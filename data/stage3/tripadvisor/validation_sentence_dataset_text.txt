16063 We enjoyed the most was simple, fresh design of the room. It was spacious and included a kitchenette. A lot of windows and light. The staff is most hospitable. We were disappointed that there is a fee for Wi Fi.. 
16064 If you are looking for a nice clean modern hotel this is the one. This hotel is so conveniently placed for all the attractions that NY has to offer. The staff were so friendly and attentive. You can walk almost everywhere from this hotel. Lovely beds 
16065 We stayed for 10 nights Mid-March The Good. -Good location -Good price -Clean -Good Service -Nice eats -Safe area The Nearly Bad. -Small room for a suite -Charge for wireless (silly now-a-days) The Ugly None 
16066 Nice clean hotel with good location. Concierge really helpful. However arrange your own transportation as the taxis in front do not use the meter if called by hotel staff. That resulted in a double up cost to the airport. 
16067 The Westin can not be faulted. The hotel is in a perfect location, within walking distance of most of Manhattan's sights. The room was very clean and had a great view - the bed was heavenly! When we return to New York we will definitely return to the Westin! 
16068 The room was a nice size. Had an very nice desk. Coffee maker in the room. Only bad thing was the refrigerator was too full of expensive items and not able to be used for anything else. Very comfortable bed. Great location. 
16069 We stayed at the Courtyard River North for three nights. Great location for us, near some good food and drinks. Room was great. Clean and comfy. King size bed was very good. All of the staff was very friendly and helpful. Especially "Ron" one of the front door men. 
16070 I had heard about this place and believed that no place could be that bad. Visiting the lobby, I knew that I could not stay here. Be glad that you didnt, you can see the pain in the eyes of the guests. 
16071 had a very nice room on the 27th floor. 2 fullsize dbl beds - great for friends sharing and nice seperat closet for coats and shopping to be stowed away in. Bathroom not so big, but all very nice and clean. extremely pleasant in all aspects 
16072 I travelled w/ my friends. The location was very very good and the hotel offered us a room where we can see the chicago river. The room space is so so, taking consideration of the central area of Chicago. The rate was reasonable, great value when you come to Chicago. 
16073 Had a great experience with service specially with Carmelo-Doormarn. Great assistance, and saved my life! I was forgetting my cellphone in the taxi, and quickly noticed. The hotel looked very well maintained and neat. Also the fact that is walking distance from Central Park is great! Thanks! 
16074 My husband and I had a lovely time at this Hotel - the staff makes you feel special, the room is very comfortable, with wonderful ammenities...and the location is perfect!! We recomend this hotel to everyone, and we will come back as soon as we can. Great!! 
16075 We stayed in the Premier Hotel section of the hotel. The concierge, Monique, was excellent. She, along with other hotel staff, made our stay very enjoyable. Our room had a great view of Times Square, the bed was comfortable, and the room and hotel were clean. 
16076 This was very good. Room was comfortable with kitchen. Staff were helpful. Had to wait for the elevator sometimes but we were there at the weekend. 
16077 great hotel and great location for a good price. Highly recommendable! 
16078 This is a very nice hotel: clean, comfortable and location is really great. Rooms are kind of small, but who goes to NYC to remain in his room? I would also recommend the Re Sette Italian restaurant close to the hotel. 
16079 Good price and value Breakfast was delicious and complimentary - a rare find in nyc Room was clean Having a small kitchen was perfect for the little kids Con: elevators were horribly slow during rush hours - bfast and check out times 
16080 Checked in Thursday to a great room on the 9th floor. Hotel personnel great with directions around Chicago. Good suggestions on where to eat. Our room was very clean. The king size bed was very comfortable. 
16081 The staff and location are the best things about this place. They were very funny and helpful, assisting with theatre tickets and other tips. Rooms are tiny but clean, shower curtains need changing. Good wifi and location - can't ask for much more at this price in Manhattan. 
16082 painless checkin-helpful staff-nothing too much trouble-great rooms-comfy beds-added bonus of a kitchen-excellent location for exploring N.Y. concierge booked us a table at Niles restaraunt next door we were highly delighted check out our review of Niles on TripAdvisor 
16083 The Novotel hotel on Broadway was fantastic. Clean, friendly, brilliant value and in a brilliant location to walk to all the attractions. Thehotel restaurant looked down on Broadwayand Times Square and was very reasonably priced.We walked everywhere and had a wonderful time. 
16084 We almost always stay at the Sutton Place in Chicago when we visit. The location is great and the service is always top notch. There are fancier places in the city, but Sutton Place combines value, service and location better than most. 
16085 The Hilton Garden Inn's fantastic location is near the L, great bus lines, fantastic shopping and great dining. The hotel is a no frills business hotel with nice conference rooms and great service. The pool and hot tub are small but enjoyable. 
16086 The hotel is very well located in Manhattan. Nice restaurants in little Italy at 2 blocks. Be careful, the room could be noisy. My advise ask for a room at a upper level The service is quick and good. 
16087 The hotel's location is great. Its service is also great: all staffs are kind and helpful. Especially, Daisy at the Priority desk helped me a lot. She made my stay there more memorable and perfect. I will return to the hotel at my next visit to Chicago. 
16088 I loved the Hudson. It was funky... modern... and fun! It was a very small room, but it was clean. The location was great and the decorations were fun! I would stay here again! 
16089 Stayed at the Salisbury for a long weekend before travelling down to DC for the inauguration. Great location, big rooms, comfortable beds and clean. Good value for money i would recommend this to absolutely anyone including lone travellers and families. 
16090 Compared to other similar hotels in the immediate vicinity of the Wyndam, my experience was average. The size of the rooms are abour the same as other hotels. The bedding is probably better. I didn't particularly like the lobby furnishings. The TV channel selection was less than expected. 
16091 sono stata con la mia famiglia a ny i primi 5 giorni di giugno e ci siamo trovati benissimo, sia per la posizione, sia per i servizi resi. Colazione ottima.Due camere una vicino all'altra piccole ma comode. 
16092 This is a great hotel. Its location is reasonably close to the subway (a couple stops to Fulton, etc). The room was a decent size and clean. There are plenty of eateries and fun bars nearby. 
16093 We spent 4 days here earlier this month and couldn't have been happier with our accomodations. Nice rooms and the staff is great. We don't travel much so this was a treat for us. If we ever return to NYC we will stay here. Thanks. 
16094 Estas dentro de Times Square y duermes como un bebe, un lobby muy moderno y un excelente servicio !!!!!!!! 
16095 The ny palace is a superb hotel, especially the tower rooms where we stayed. The staff is exceptional, the rooms outstanding, the tower club a delight. While the hotel is on the expensive side, look for internet deals and enjoy. 
16096 We had planned to stay two nights at this hotel, but it was in terrible shape so we only stayed one. Our bathroon ceiling was peeling and ready to fall, the outside lights were not working and overall in bad shape needing a serious face lift. 
16097 A lovely hotel in the middle of everywhere - My husband conducted business and I shopped. The staff and service are friendly and very accommodating. 
16098 I have stayed at several Sofitels around the world and they continue to achieve high standards. Free wifi at the Sofitel NY was part of my decsion process as it always is when booking hotels these days. The hotel is in a convenient location near subway stations and Times Square. 
16099 Terrific hotel, opulent, tastefully decorated, vintage... great location, expensive but worth every $$ spent on a special occasion. 
16100 We went to Chicago for a long weekend and split out time between Swissotel and The Hyatt down the street. While impressed by both, Swissotel was a step above in all aspects. We will be staying eclusively at Swissotel for the rest of our Chicago trips! 
16101 stayed in front part of the hotel, very dated and room dirty.....found hairs in the toilet and the hairdryer....staff very friendly and helpful...........nice pool with great view of the city...........good location near Times Square, and all the action 
16102 Thou window view can be not perfect, location is really Excellent! 
16103 Great place to stay with your dog. Wonderful park right across the street and even had dog runs. Super nice people at the hotel. Clean rooms, good restaurant and convenient to convention center. 
16104 wonderful location and very nice bedrooms very modern and clean urban and cery nyc style 
16105 Very nice hotel with good breakfast and amenities for a major city's downtown area. Reasonably affordable....Rooms a bit on small side but ok....Great locale as far as CTA and city's attractions. 
16106 Really enjoyed my stay at the Ritz Carlton in Battery Park. Could see the Statue of Liberty from my room and even had a telescope by the window. Easy sunway ride to downtown NYC. This place is great but a little pricey 
16107 All in all much better than I was expecting,room and building top quality,staff very helpful and friendly except one who thought a Dollar tip wasn't enough to move three suitcases about five meters and actually asked for more,you always get one. Would definitely return. 
16108 Great location, near Central bus station, subway. Great view from the room, very clean. Few minutes walk from Times Square. Slept like a baby 
16109 just returned from new york. this hotel is at convenient location - 5 min walk to times square. staff is very friendly. rooms are spacious & well appointed for new york standard. breakfast is bit busy & chaotic , otherwise great experience. nice eating places nearby. 
16110 I loved my stay here. So close to Time Square, Union Station - just minutes to everything. Great Staff. The Benjamin Steak House was so great!!! The room was quiet and comfortable. Older elevators but it was okay! 
16111 If u are lookling for a good location in Manhattan, clean and modern hotel ... this is the place! good staff, next to grand central terminal (train and metro) and the rooms are always clean and a large bathroom! perfect! I really recommend Affinia Shelburne! Perfect to vacations in NYC! 
16112 Nice hotel with nice big rooms. We had rooms in 38th. floor, with an amazing vue. Great exercise room and swimmingpool in 27th. floor. Breakfast was not included in the roomprice. Good locations near the UN Building. 
16113 Got a great rate for a weekend stay in NYC. Well located for upper east side, 5th avenue shopping and the 6 subway line. The room was quite small, but time is best spent exploring the city and not in your room. 
16114 Staff is not hosptable, any request seems to be too much. Too many things went wrong during the visit e.g. incorect billing, mail was not delivere to the room, executive launch room is not open on time for breakfast... Room service was good. Overall, will not return to this hotel. 
16115 I stay at OTA each time I'm in NY. Nice refurbished rooms, Euro hotel, exceptional staff. 
16116 I booked the trip for my husbands 50th birthday!...THE W had all the GREATS!..GREAT ROOM!..GREAT LOCATION!..GREAT FOOD!..AND GREAT STAFF!..It was my husbands 1st visit to NY but not our last! so we look forward to staying at the W again! 
16117 This hotel ticks many boxes in location, service, value and comfort. Rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Ask for a room at the back of the hotel as apparently street facing rooms can be noisy. Laundry service is expensive but the morning coffee delivered is exceptional. 
16118 This is a great hotel in New York City and only a few blocks from Grand Central Terminal. The staff was very friendly and the rooms are great. The banquet staff is very energetic and makes sure a meeting room is set up right. 
16119 This was a great stay here. Normally i stay at Marriott nearby, but i couldn't get a good rate so i tried the Hilton. It was fantastic! The staff was rude, but it's new york, what do you expect. 
16120 The hotel was very nice. There was a problem with the hot water so showers were quick and dreaded(cold). The restaurant next door was a 5* in food and service. This was our first trip to New York and we enjoyed all very much. 
16121 The staff were excellent. The location couldn't have been better. We received excellent recommendations on restaurants, etc from the desk staff. Suites are very spacious and very clean. I would definitely stay here again when in NYC. 
16122 Great location. Very nice staff,helpful and friendly, including the housekeeping staff. I will stay here again! We stayed here during the US open. The breakfast is not good,but there are plenty of resturants in the area. Just ask the front desk and they will guide you. 
16123 What a great a service at that hotel but espacially from Domingo Martinez, the server at the restaurant. He mades sure every morning that we had a good day start with a smile and fun and mainly with an excellent service, He's the best! 
16124 Stayed for 3 days in August, 2004. Very clean, nice sized rooms. Very professional and friendly staff. Check-in and check-out quick and trouble free. Much better than higher priced Marquis. 
16125 I had a great nights sleep. The hotel was in a prime positiion for my business trip. Lots of good restaraunts in the area. This hotel would have met all my needs, except for its lack of a business center. 
16126 bathroom very poor, front desk average service, but too much depending on the attitude of the single person, management absent nice view over the roofs and landscape of NY , from our room on 19th floor, breakfast inexisting 
16127 What a surprise! In a center of everything, but not too noisy. Beautiful rooms(not so big though) with a stunning views. Very close to Times Square and Central park. Really worth it!!! Don't think twice. 
16128 Nice and quiet rooms and very friendly Service. Bill, Troy and Roger are all great. Very close to Hobby airport. Free Internet and a Super Start breakfast are indeed Super. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Houston. 
16129 This is a decent, well-kept hotel with friendly staff. Lots of great stuff in the area. I would recommend adding staff to the front desk- they seemed to be swamped every time I went by. 
16130 The Edison Hotel is an art deco hotel centrally located in Times Square. Although the rooms are small, the overall ambience is characteristic of this exciting city. The Cafe Edison is conveniently attached to the hotel, and adds to the overall charm. 
16131 Het Strandhotel is een prima hotel. ligt midden in manhattan en vlak bij een aantal bezienwaardigheden die te voet te bereiken zijn personeel is behulpzaam maar je hoeft niet steeds met dollars fooi te geven 
16132 I really enjoyed my stay recently. It is the perfect location with many restaurant and entertainment opportunities within walking distance. The room was nicely updated and well maintained. I would definitely stay here again. 
16133 This is a great hotel!! Everyone that I encountered provided me with excellent service!! Great location in the heart of Manhattan!! 
16134 Nice location, updated furnishings, but not very quiet and the shower was a bit moldy and leaked all over the bathroom floor. Handy shuttle to the main attractions, close to Museum Campus and El stations. Staff was friendly and helpful. Paying $6 per day for internet was off-putting. 
16135 Hard to find but initially immediate peace when entereing from the noisy street. Standard Hilton decor. Great views and room size ok for NY. Ice machine at the end of the corridor hugely welcome in August! Great breakfast. Easy access to subway and taxi easily available at the rear entrance. 
16136 The hotel is very nice and it has a great location but can't help but get that feeling like your visiting grandma's for the weekend. The service is amazing and everybody seems willing to help you but the place itself feels a little old even after the renovations. 
16137 We loved our room on the second floor--three double beds, large walk-in closet and it was VERY CLEAN. I guess we lucked out and really enjoyed the Hotel Penn. We were given a small fold up map of the subway and written directions--everyone was very helpful. 
16138 Very nice hotel. Good location close enough to Times Square, but far enough away to not have the crazy foot traffic and noise. Rooms were very cozy. Front desk staff was very polite. Would definitely consider this place on my next stay in NYC. 
16139 This is one of the best location in New York in my opinion. Great rooms, and if you manage, I strongly suggest getting a room on the club level. 
16140 I am so much looking forward to my next stay. If I were American and lived in the neighbourhood, I would stay there every weekend ... I am simply in love with that gorgeous Hudson. 
16141 Rooms beautiful. Staff attentive and friendly. Complimentary mini bar, daily delicious treats in your room. No set check out times.. Next time Im in NY I'm here :) 
16142 Great location, can walk to nearly everything.Time square,Central park,buses,trains, bars restaurants. No free internet in the room but you can get it in the lobby. Some great diners around for breakfast etc. 
16143 Had a three night stay in a large one bedroom suite. Service was excellent and all the complimentry items were a bonus. The restaurant was a little pricey but the food was exceptional. Would not stay anywhere else in NYC. 
16144 I stayed at this hotel because Sid Vicious and Nancy spungen lived at this hotel in the late 70's, even though their room 100 that they stayed in isnt there any more, just the presens of knowing that they stayed there made it all the worth while!!! 
16145 the rooms are nice and the bed is comfortable! the only issue we had was with valet parking. We were there on a night that they had a huge event. It took 20 minutes to get our car. 
16146 Super kleine kamers/maar fantastische ligging en alles is aanwezig. 
16147 Great concept hotel. Fantastic value and service. Micro sized rooms, but everything you need 
16148 Stayed here last summer for a girls night out. Got upgrade to a gorgeous suite and had the best time. Room was very comfortable, room service was delicious and quick and overall we had a great time staying here. 
16149 I spent a week there from Dec 22nd and enjoyed the experience tremendously. Would definitely stay there again. 
16150 I stayed here to be close to the airport on a snowy night. The hotel is newer and is very nice. Has a nice bar/rest. Staff was friendly. Room had a new feel and was very clean. Would definitely recommend. Free parking and internet 
16151 My stay was very good! The rooms were very clean. Service was great and so was breakfast! The rates were good and my children and I highly reccommend this hotel to others!!!! Thanks for the great stay!!!!!!!! 
16152 Kamers klein en met weinig/geen daglicht. De kamer die we in eerste instantie kregen keek uit op een muur (ongeveer en halve meter van het raam) zonder problemen kunnen ruilen. Elke dag werd de kamer schoon gemaakt, idem schone handdoeken. Centraal gelegen. Aardige mensen. 
16153 This is not a luxury hotel. However, as a basic hotel it is quite good. The room I stayed in (2 queen beds) was not big or fancy or new, but it was comfortable and clean and well maintained. It's right at time square. 
16154 Superb location, close to Times Square and every midtown attraction. Small modern hotel, nice rooms, great service, reasonable parking next door, excellent breakfast provided. Always again when traveling in NYC! Great job! 
16155 We stayed for 3 nights an were very happy with the experience. Great central location. Room very clean well equiped but not huge. Staff excellent. Nice gym and lovely breakfast in mornings. Great korean restaraunt next door!!! 
16156 We stayed here Aug-Sept 04 and had a tremendous stay thanks to the great location, clean facilities and friendly staff at the Cosmo! We're coming back in December for what is sure to be another fantastic stay. Thanks to all the staff for helping to make our trip so memorable! 
16157 Cracked sink, hairs in the bed, dust everywhere need I go on. Throughly disgusting hotel that nearly ruined holiday but luckily 6 hours after arriving virgin holidays moved across the road to the hotel metro. If you want to enjoy New York then DON'T STAY AT THIS DUMP!!!!!!! 
16158 Location is close to theatres, times square, columbus circle and central park. We had a double room that was spacious, clean and well appointed. Beds were VERY comfortable. Bathroom was a bit small, but nice. Staff was excellent. Better value if breakfast was included, but a good value overall. 
16159 Best Service! Best Location! Beautiful Facilities! Gorgeous Room! Hands down the best hotel in New York! Well done Fairmont! 
16160 This is a place for somebody who is single and isn't going to spend alot of time inside. The place is small!!!! However it is clean and very central. 
16161 The staff were all very friendly and helpful. The room was large, well maintained, and clean. The free breakfast was great. And the neighborhood is perfect for exploring on foot. Also, much less car traffic than in midtown. 
16162 times sq. is around the corner and acess to the subway is excellent. For the price you cant beat it for being in the middle of all the action 
16163 The location is terrific 
16164 I stayed here about 40 days in the last year and a half. Sunny, Trish,and the young men at the front desk are terrific.Only one complaint---the bath tubs could use rubber mats. They are very slippery 
16165 Stayed here to take the step 2 CK exam at the Texas site. Nice room, reasonable price. Most importantly, very close to the test site- I was able to walk to the site easily, then walk back to get my rental car from the hotel on the way out. 
16166 Nice size room. Very conveniently located. No bedbugs!!! Which makes the experience that much better. Would most definitely go back. 
16167 great location very clean good staff free storage free coffe in the morning 
16168 Great location close to central station. the rooms are not tiny, but a bit shabby. Good views from some of the rooms. 
16169 Great stay, lots of history. If you can do it once, then you should. Concierge and staff are wonderful. A bit of a waste for our first trip as we did not stay in the hotel other than sleeping. Get a breakfast deal if you can. 
16170 great hotel. Nice room and great service. This hotel used to be an Embassy Suites. 
16171 Had a great stay at the W. Derron was excellent again and makes sure everything is taken care of for with the right room and suggested evening agenda. I will be back for sure!! 
16172 Great Service and Great Location, very friendly Staff! Free shuttle to the airport! 
16173 The Hilton has undergone a Reno for the most part - rooms are nice, but many areas remain the old, such as elevators that shake badly - cafe and snack bar are nice. House keeping is awful - wireless is good 
16174 great location to theater, restaurants and great shopping, not to mention the excitement of Rockefeller Center. Staff was friendly and helpful for all our needs and whims. will definitely return for business with some fun added to our stay. 
16175 Con una ubicacion tranquila y sin complicciones.En carro son proximadamente 15 minutos al centro.Alrededor centros comerciales y areas de jardines multiples.Ideal para el descanso y para paseos cortos a pie por sus avenidas.Muy tranquilo 
16176 Great location in the theater district. Staff friendly and helpful. Breakfast included and was continually stocked throughout the morning rush. Were even able to leave our bags locked up after checking out to see more of the city before catching our train. Will plan on staying here again 
16177 Friendly helpful staff, could not fault them. Great location fr shopping, theatres, restaurants & Central Station. 
16178 Ellen was very helpful at the front desk. great room, great bed, lots of peace and quiet in my corner room. people must be looking for reasons to complain if they mention the elevators- the system worked fine for me. 
16179 lI had a friend who wanted to be right on Times Square and made reservations at the Marriott Marquis. I thought it would be noisy, cramped and not nice. So wrong. It was very quiet, newly redone, rooms were spacious. It was a very nice experience 
16180 ok, if you are planning a nyc with nightlife in meatpacking this is the hotel, close to pasti restaurant, a lot of bars, chease market, and with a apple store in next block, and with a great bar in the loft 
16181 Convenient location nearly across the street from the Port Authority Bus Terminal. A short walk from all Time Square and Broadway have to offer. This large hotel has a quiet and clean feel. 
16182 Stayed last week on a business trip. This was the best hotel I've stayed in in New York. Bigger than average rooms, really comfortable, good location and excellent value for money. Room a tiny bit stuffy, but not too bad. I'd definitely stay there again. 
16183 great location near metro, central park and 5.th avenue. A bit noisy to the street, like many NY hotels. Very nice atmosphere and employees, choose the hotel for that and the location, not for the standard of the interior, which is a bit rundown 
16184 I reserved this hotel based on location. I have to say, this hotel has the friendliest staff! Crystal was a awesome clerk and took care of everything from check-in to check-out! The hotel has a beautiful lobby and the meeting rooms are exquisite! 
16185 Great location, close to everything and it's great having the extra space. Rooms were clean, well kept, nice having the restaurant in house. Location is easy to walk to everything and the staff was professional and very friendly. I'd stay there again! 
16186 I stayed at The Pod with my daughter last month and it was our home away from home. It was a very pleasant experience. The staff was exceptional and the room lovely and clean. The location was excellent. My daughter cannot wait to go back there again. 
16187 beautiful hotel. Bagels were a 10 minute walk (well worth it) just a few blocks from Times Square - the center of the world :) 
16188 Centrally situated with great access uptown and downtown, the Waldorf remains a favourite with awesome beauty. Good service and willing staff all fits in with the legend. Best rates available online on the hotel website about 3 weeks before arrival. 
16189 Staff so friendly. Great location. Will return. It's just beside everything. 
16190 Me and my family were up there for a friend in The Memorial Hermann Hospital. We stayed there for about a week. I personally liked the service but I thought the food was expensive. Also it was not very good. 
16191 I stayed here two nights for a business trip. It was close to everywhere I needed to go, was a good size room, had nice amenties and overall made for a great stay for my NYC travels. 
16192 bed bugs. Recent visited to Garden. Room was not clean. pool is small. 
16193 STayed here in Feb 2007 shortly after opening. This hotel is an excellent value for the price. Rooms are typical NYC size but are chic. The front desk staff is extremely nice and helpful. location is excellent 1 block from Times Square. 
16194 Good friendly and central hotel. Nice big quiet rooms, near times square, 20 meters, Expensive and not very good breakfast, Use deli next to hotel. Staff was very helpful. Free Wifi in the receptionarea and bars. 
16195 Close to all places to go - Clean rooms, nice restaurant. Went with daughters, had great service all around. Will return 
16196 Stayed for just two nights. People helpful and friendly. Room clean. Would have liked a better tv and a fridge in the room, but the value was good and the location excellent! Would come again. 
16197 my partner and I were visiting family in Katy, we wanted to say in a new hotel and are glad we decided to stay at Hotel Sorella.. very very nice place, service was excellent, rooms VERY NICE. i will stay here again.. 
16198 Location, Service, and Accomodations were all wonderful! I cannot think of a single negative! Blew the service at the Waldorf=Astoria (our previous stay) away. We would definitely stay again when in NYC. 
16199 A wonderful vacation. Concierge & Frontdesk staff were cheerful and helpful. Room with two beds typically small for NYC, was clean and tidy. Beddings are Frette's, fresh and neat. This was our second visit after five years. The hotel has been kept extremely well. No complaints at all. 
16200 This hotel is a great place to stay in NYC. So comfortable, the staff is genuinely friendly and helpful, and the rooms are beautiful and very very clean. I will definately stay here again. 
16201 Nos encanto el hotel. Muy buena situacion, el desayuno incluido es en un salon amplio y tienes mucho donde elegir, y la habitacion muy bien, todo muy limpio, limpieza diaria y cama muy comoda. La verdad es que no encuentro aspectos negativos. 
16202 Small dark rooms - the entire hotel is like a cruise ship. Rooms are clean but could use some updating. Overall I would recommend the hotel - it is different. 
16203 Good hotel, clean, great location, great service only thing that left a sour taste in my mouth was the $50 + tip for 3 gin and tonics! Thank god I stopped at 3! 
16204 Everything about his hotel was solidly good, nice rooms, good food, great service. Close to shopping and the beautiful UN neighborhood. 
16205 Had a good experience; the staff was friendly, the room was very clean and a comfortable size for two people, the beds were very comfortable, the free breakfast was nice and the coffee was good. It is conveniently located to restaurants, theaters, and Times Square. Would definitely stay there again. 
16206 The room was disgustingly dirty, as was the bathroom. The floors, walls, furniture.. EVERYTHING was crawling with filth. There was no security and we felt extremely unsafe. I would not wish this place upon anybody. We left first thing in the morning after the first night. 
16207 Our room was small but worth it due to the location. 
16208 Grim, dirty, tired hotel - avoid 
16209 The hotel staff was excellent, The breakfast in the morning was delicious. The variety was perfect. So much food to choose from. I love the rooms and the service was with a smile. I would go back again and again. Chicago is my kind of city. 
16210 Clean and cozy. Close to everything. And you cannot beat the price. Cheers. 
16211 All I can say it awesom!!!! I wouldnt stay anywhere else 
16212 its a very nice hotel, the rooms are spacious and very comfy, though the service was so bad, it took us 30 minutes to check in, and the reception desk employees were so laid back! too bad for such a great location! 
16213 Excellent location, lovely service really friendly staff. Prices are quite high but the add ons make the overall package worthwhile. A really relaxing oasis of tranquility that's just 1/2 a step away from all of the hustle and bustle of a really central location. 
16214 The accommodations where nice for the price, but not as nice as they advertised. Advertised free Wi-Fi, but discovered it was only in the lobby, in the room it was $9.95/day. It would have been nice to have a coffee maker in room also. 
16215 I stayed there for almost a week, in Oct'2010. Great hotel !!! very nice & relaxing atmosphere, lots of trees. Free Wifi. Nice swimming pools & they played great music too haha. Restaurant that served breakfast is great, I cant remember name. strongly recommeded. 
16216 If your looking for a comfortable hotel in the heart of the city. The book The Hilton New York. 
16217 I stayed one night at this hotel it was great. Great location and clean. I stay due to my business travel. I had to catch early flight so I stay one night and park my car at the hotel and catch hotel shuttle. Great shuttle service. 
16218 Stayed two nights - got the "Autumn Discount" from the web site so the rates were quite reasonable for the area & quality. Staff was friendly, room was nice. Enjoyed staying in a smaller hotel in a historic building. Easy walk to the Field Museum/Art Institute. 
16219 The Renaissance Blackstone is a wonderful experience. We enjoyed our room and the service from the front door bellman to our checkout. Beautiful decor, great sleep, so clean and beautiful. A pleasure to stay there and would stay there again in a heartbeat! 
16220 I spent there only one night. Clean, shared bathroom outside the room. In reality was dedicated to our room only while the second room was vacant. Good price and excellent location. Close to CP and Metro. 
16221 This is a great hotel. The rooms were very comfortable and very nicely decorated. It was so convenient to come here and go to the Astro game and then walk back here after. Staff was friendly but unobtrusive. What a find. 
16222 La migliore hall vista durante il mio tour negli US! Camere e bagno ok. Uniche 2 note negative...accesso a internet a 15/16$ al gg e deposito bagagli 3,5$ per pezzo...negli altri hotel negli US ho trovato tt questo free :) 
16223 The consierge,staff, service and the Hotel itself are excellent.The location is great and you can walk to all major areas like Times Square, 5th Avenue and Broadway. The area is very safe and clean.Your stay at the Iroquouis Hotel will be a most enjoyable one. 
16224 Gutes Hotel in sehr zentraler Lage. Zimmer und Dusche sehr sauber. Vom Hotel aus ist alles bestens zu erreichen 
16225 We stayed here for my husband's birthday weekend last year. The hotel is very nice, clean and even though it is in the financial district, it is still close to great restaurants like Delmonico's and great pizza places. We had a blast and will definitely go back. 
16226 Siamo stati ad agosto x tre notti, hotel molto bello, camere curate e molto grandi, pulito ed elegante, personale gentile, consigliabile anche x famiglie, e comoda la posizione due passi da millennium park, zona ristoranti raggiungibile con autobus, la fermata e' proprio davanti all'ingresso!lo consigliamo vivamente! 
16227 Was visiting Chicago for the Cubs/Sox Series and the Blues festival. Perfect location to get around, love the neighborhood. Front desk was very helpful. 
16228 Madeline Cole and her staff on the Gold Floor make this hotel the one not to miss! Nothing is too much trouble and everything is no trouble at all for the gold Floor Stafff. Kudos for making our stay truly memorable 
16229 A good hotel with a great location. The staff was friendly and the room was clean. The room was a bit small but was otherwise fine. 
16230 Clean. Great Location. Decent price. I did not encounter attitude from any of the staff. Balthazar around the corner. 
16231 This is an affordable hotel in NY. It's situated near Central Park and near the Metro. Breakfast is cheap and good enough to start your day. We booked a one bedroom suite which had plenty of room and was clean. Staff was friendly. 
16232 What makes this hotel stand out is the friendly,helpful and efficient staff.From the reception by Maria with a smiling welcome to the attentive bellhops and the efficient housekeepers provides a rewarding environment certainly not expected in NYC. 
16233 the stay at the benjamin was very nice it is a nice hotel in a great location the bedding and pillow menu es excellent i would recomend it !!! 
16234 Great location. Beautiful lobby with friendly staff. Room was very small with little storage space. Friendly doorman Brian helped with luggage both upon arrival and departure. No in-room coffee service. We were on the third floor and did not hear street noise. 
16235 3rd bed in one of the rooms reserved not made up and took several requests late at night to sort it; 5 to 10 minute wait every morning for a lift Ongoing building work Wifi charge when paying 4.000 dollars for 2 rooms for 4 nights is out of order 
16236 Excellent luxury hotel in an enviable location. Expensive, but then Manhattan is an expensive place to stay. Room was quite small but very comfortable. Amazing shower. Really enjoyed our stay. 
16237 The hotel staff was extremely helpful and friendly from the bellman to the receptionist to the girl who brought your coffee at breakfast. Absolutely nothing to complain about. I reccommend it to all friends that are going to NY. 
16238 The location of the hotel is fabulous, the rooms are quite good and clean, free wi-fi at the lobby, nice view to the river, good prices at the restaurant. The cons, is that the lobby is always crowdy, no bellboy available to assist. 
16239 Excellent value, location and service. I stay twice a year when traveling to nyc. It's close to shopping, dinning and attractions. It's like staying in a quality condo or timeshare. 
16240 I would not return to this place because the seevice was really bad! I am not a person looking at this point very strong! But althought i couldn't stand how unfriendly everybody working here was! The rooms are very old! 
16241 Walking distance to Grand Central Station, surrounded by great restaurants & bars. Hotel was clean, quiet, and rooms were much larger than what I expected for NYC. In fact, our room actually had its own private deck! 
16242 Die Zimmer sind noch kleiner als erwartet, der Service an der Rezeption enorm unterbesetzt. Eine Stunde Schlange zu stehen um einzuchecken und dann nochmal eine Stunde aufs Zimmer zu warten, weil keines frei ist, ist nicht hinnehmbar. 
16243 Excellent rooms, dining, and service at this Hilton hotel. Great for my purpose which was to stay overnight then fly out the next day. A little sopendy, but worth it. An excellent property. 
16244 I liked the small rooms. The bed was rock hard which made it hard to sleep. Staff was excellent. Danny at the front door went the extra mile to have a car waiting for me for the ride to the airport. That was not expected and much appreciated. Great location. 
16245 The only thing great abt this hotel is the location, besides that I didnt know how I endured the dirty rooms, daunting corridor, rats n roaches n mouldy stale smell.Please do not ever stay in this hotel!! 
16246 What a great weekend! Right at check-in Stephen Bee and all the staff were great. The room was great and the convenience of the location for all Notre Dame events was ideal! We will definitely return. 
16247 I decided to stay here on a whim. I ordered a one bedroom suite that was a good space in NYC for the money. The suite also featured a kitchen. However, I did not care for the area. 
16248 otttima posizione, camera discreta con pareti da imbiancare, letto un po piccolo(non qeen size)ma a due passi da time square, e ad un buon prezzo, ottimo per brevi permanenze max 1 sett. 
16249 Great hotel with very good service.Beds are just amazing,very clean and fresh rooms!Nice bathroom with big shower!Great storage for clothes and shoes etc! 
16250 The hotel was clean but the rooms were small. I think you expect that for NYC. We had a drink in the bar which was very nice. Good location for the theater if you don't mind walking - which we don't. Very close to Central Park. 
16251 On Park Avenue close to almost everywhere you wanna go on Manhattan. The only disappointment was that we expected a design hotel, in Japanese clean style but found a traditional American style one with thick carpets, heavy curtains and too much furniture. 
16252 Uitstekend hotel. Prima gelegen. Charme van het boutique-hotel, klasse van een top hotel. 
16253 You can tell the hotel was once something special, but Hilton has really let it slip; especially considering what they're charging. Staff was excellent, but the rooms are ancient - I felt like I was visiting my grandparents house. Hilton desperately needs to pony up and gut the rooms. 
16254 The location is just great...2 minutes walk to subway 96th st. Staff are friendly. The room and bathroom are clean. Close to "OK-not pricey foods"..next door to Thai restaurant&chinese food -amsterdam&94..tasty fried chicken no greasy.. Easily access to public transportation to major touristy places. Will be back! 
16255 The hotel itself is cute, very compact, perfect for a night in the city. It's very clean, which is a super plus. Also the staff is amazing, super helpful, and very friendly. For this reason alone I would stay here again! 
16256 I am a frequent guest at that hotel. Service at front desk is excellent. I would like to recommend especially Ms. Vicky and Ms. Hagar. They are very professional, helpful and efficient. I will certainly be a future guest. 
16257 a lovely hotel, wonderful service, wonderful rooms and the lobby, wow one tip, bar and restaurant expensive, but you are in new york and the hotel location is wonderful! 
16258 I'd stay here again, for sure. It's a great location and the staff are really nice 
16259 Great place to stay. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. We will stay here again. 
16260 Easy going atmoshphere, super fun identity, great view and rooms... the best bed and pillows in the world and FREE INTERNET!!! 
16261 Very well kept property with a convenient, quiet location. Close to the subway, but definitely within walking distance of the heart of the city. Would definitely stay at this property again! 
16262 This hotel is located next to ground zero.It is brilliant for business or leisure.The rooms were very clean but found a few hairs in the shower.The person at reception could have been a bit more friendly.Would stay here again. 
16263 This is a beautiful hotel and great location! There is Starbucks coffee, lots of restaurants and very nice rooms with nice amenities. The Irish pub is very quaint with good beer. Great place to stay and very friendly staff, very helpful 
16264 Stayed here for 1 night at the end of January. The room was large and comfortable with a great view over the Avenue. Only downside was the small bathroom Saff were efficient and capable. Will stay again next time in Manhattan 
16265 This hotel and the staff were absolutely splended. We could not have asked for anything better. The concierge, housekeeping, the doormen, even the staff in the restaurant exceeded our expectations. This will be my home away from home everytime I visit New York. 
16266 The hotel is excellent for the price, it was a modest room, but was clean and the service was excellent. The location was wonderful to go anywhere in Manhattan. Can't wait to go there again! 
16267 Was here for 4 days with my girlfriend. We both loved the place. Big, comfy beds, cabin-like feel to the room but with all the amenties, an old black wrought iron staircase right outside our window where we could sneak cigarettes. May be my favorite hotel in New York. 
16268 Everything was exactly as advertised. Very European boutique hotel feel, yet predictable enough for a business traveler like me. Service was excellent. Very clean. 
16269 Located in the heart of Times Square (47th and Broadway) this property is wonderful. Great food and good service. Rooms are spacious for NYC. 
16270 We stayed here for a night as our flight was cancelled and chose the Marriott due to its location only. It is super convenient, has comfortable beds, decent service and decent staff 
16271 Just not exceptional in any way but location. Also pricey for the room you get. 
16272 Fantastic lobby, great NYC feeling. But no hot water on a Wed. morning at 7:30am -- essential for a business traveler. And who needs to wait in a line to check in? I'll go back to the lest interesting but more reliable Omni. 
16273 Good place to stay when traveling to airport! Quick and easy! Parking was quick and service was great! The price was great compared to others in area! Would stay again for sure! 
16274 Hotel bello, stanza spaziosa e ben tenuta, servizi alla stanza buoni. Un po' cari i servizi non indispensabili di cui ho approfittato: lavanderia, telefono, internet. I prezzi di listino dei pasti in camera piutosto cari. 
16275 The room was clean, but the bathroom.... IUt needed major renovation; the toilet bowl was disgusting.. The lobby also needs major renovation. This hotel is convenient only because of its location. It is not worth more than $50.00 the night... 
16276 I had an extremely poor room. Outside of the window was a very load compressor and the view was terrible. There was also no free LAN/WLAN. 
16277 this small hotel is clean comfortable and a value for New York City. Literately STEPS away from the grand street subway. This hotel has free wifi , flat screen TV modern bed linens. The young men at the front desk are very polite and helpful. My stay here was great! 
16278 hotel was clean, queen size bed which was amazing and made for us every day, room cleaned every day, staff friendly and helpful if needed, coffee and tea was available every day, perfect place loved it and will definatly book to stay there again 
16279 Had the good fortune to once again stay at this beautiful hotel. We had a great Times Square view and the staff was great. Best location in Midtown by far. Approach from the West side on 48th Street for easy access to the parking garage. 
16280 Clean rooms, but a bit dark. They even have microwave and coffee machine. Free Internet access and shuttle service to the medical centre. Helpful staff at the reception. A bit far from city centre and the medical centre. Some rooms are quite noisy because of nearby traffic. 
16281 We loved the location of this hotel, right by the river within easy walking distance of both the loop and magnificent mile. Staff were friendly & helpful. The room was clean & comfortable. 
16282 I had a great short-stay experience at the Gild Hall. The lobby and rooms have an interesting vibe... The staff is friendly and the bed was nice and comfortable. I highly recommend it! 
16283 From check-in to checkout, everything was superb. The location is perfect, the hotel is swank, and the staff is very personable. You will be staying in a luxury hotel without the stuffiness. I love Kimptons, but this one was topnotch. 
16284 Ok so the hotel needs a refresh but look past that and it's good value for money if you push hard for a deal. Location cannot be beaten. For breakfast head to the Green Cafe out the back door and to the left. 
16285 I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel over the past weekend. It was my first trip to Chicago and I couldn't have picked a better location! The hotel was modern, clean and comfortable! Furthermore, the staff goes above and beyond! I would definitely reccommend this hotel! 
16286 Very clean, metro East and West around the corner. No breakfast facilities, just a guesthouse but very ice price in New York City Single women have to be careful however at night 
16287 Hairy blower at the bathroom. Noisy piping hitting the wall hourly and loud. Small closet barely fit 6 pieces touching each other. Location is good. Overall I don't like the cleanlyness. 
16288 Internet constantly down, phones never answered, packages/faxes never delivered, food OVERPRICED, just seems like anything you ask for JUST doesn't get done. Very unfriendly staff who just don't give a damn. Unfortunate, i cut my 3 month stay to 2 weeks, i couldn't bare it anymore. 
16289 My wife and I won an overnight at the NY Palace and dinner at LeCirque (in the hotel lobby) and it was absolute nirvana. The staff was incredibly friendly, the room was beautiful -- it was spectacular! We'd go again in a minute. 
16290 It was nice except that the heater made some clicking sounds. I didn't bother to call to get it fixed, because I didn't really need it. Before this, I called for help on how to use the heater, and someone came in less than a minute. 
16291 A great little hotel in the upmarket upper east side, excellently located for fifth avenue and central park. Nicely laid out room with lovely large and comfortable beds and really clean bathroom with great rainshower. Topped off by wonderfully helpful and pleasant staff, we'll be back for sure. 
16292 The breakfast plae is too small, not very practicable and ofen busy. 
16293 Enjoyed a one-night stay in NYC. Very helpful staff; good location in mid-town, small, but well appointed room; numerous amenities (including free bottled water!) Definitely a hotel I'll be returning to in the future. 
16294 muy bien ubicado llegas caminando a Rockefeller todo muy limpio la zona en la que esta ubicado esta muy bien tienes cerca metro, farmacia, supermercado, cafe,etc el hotel ofrece el servicio de trasnporte para ir al aeropuerto a muy buen precio simplemente me encanto y volveria a ir 
16295 A nice budget hotel which made a welcome stop after an 11 hour flight. The only thing which put me off was finding a cockroach in the bathroom very soon after we arrived. Otherwise, the staff were extremely friendly & helpful. Breakfast was basic but adequate. 
16296 This is an awesome hotel for location to ride the subway, walk the "Mile," be near great restaurents, and see the sights of Chicago. It is ot only beautiful but historic too. The concierge is AWESOME!!! 
16297 Love this hotel, close to everything, great helpful staff and clean comfortable rooms, beds to die for, slept like a baby! Would definitely come back here again without hesitation! 
16298 Great hotel almost in the middle of Times Square. Clean, neat with plenty of room. Only thing missing in the room was bottled water. 
16299 Rude staff - who did nothing to help or welcome Tacky dated room - peeling wallpaper, dirty carpet........ Disappointing that this icon has obviously fallen into the wrong hands. I really wouldn't recommend staying here. 
16300 This hotel is one of my top faves in the city. The staff was so pleasant and accommodating during our stay there. The rooms were amazing and loved the rooftop bar. You also cannot beat the location......AMAZING! Will be returning very soon! :) 
16301 Great historic hotel in a convenient location near Penn Station. Hotel is nicely renovated. Free wifi was convenient. Only downside is that the rooms are extremely small, and not suited to more than 1 person. 
16302 This hotel is very clean and neat,,most of all the STAFF IS EXCELLENT !!!..THEY TREAT YOU WITH RESPECT AN DIGNITY..so therefore that will always be my choice of hotel when ever im in the city of houston...and Im from New Orleans,,,...an my name is RAHSAAN... 
16303 I loved new York loved the hotel the rooms were great very clean the staff and doormen were nice. Only downside was the huge deposit but we got it back! Would definitely go back would recommend dis hotel to every1! Made our holiday even better. 
16304 Stayed for just one night while in Houston on business. A clean, well furnished hotel with fine service. Might be the best value in the Post Oak/Galleria area. Make sure to get a shoe shine, it was excellent. Will stay again for sure!! 
16305 Location is great. Rooms and hallways are old and dirty. Don't have any expectations...or you will be disappointed. I am sure some cleaning and painting would do wonders. 
16306 Besides there being a shortage of wash cloths, this Holiday Inn was not bad. The breakfast was great, and the staff was friendly. The location was great, especially for the price. Rooms are small, so be prepared to be close. Overall value - not bad. 
16307 This hotel was a super value and a perfect place for us to stay with four boys ranging from 9 to 17. The suite was roomy enough for all six of us to stay comfortably, and the entire hotel was very clean. Staff were extremely friendly and helpful. 
16308 Easy access, nice walk from the train station. Very nice rooms, service was excellent, cordial and accomodating. Meeting rooms were comfortable temperature, chairs were nice also. 
16309 Ellen helped me check in. This hotel is in a great location, very friendly staff and helpful. We needed more towels and the radiator looked at, both requests were satisfied in excellent time. 
16310 Thoroughly recommend this hotel. The staff were delightful, the decor stylish and atmospheric, the room charming and the location perfect. My only niggle was that the breakfast was a little basic. 
16311 Pleasant employees, clean large rooms, and free parking! WONDERFUL!! 
16312 Ottima soluzione per muoversi nel cuore della Grande Mela 
16313 We stayed for four nights in January. The location is very good and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. The only down side is the size of the room. You had to manoeuvre around your case. Would stay there again. 
16314 the place is just ok , it is just too expensive for the value you get...i stayed there for three nights , didn't enjoy the room that much and i don't think i would pick it again or recommend it to a friend 
16315 It's a great place. I'll always check to see if there is room at the Beacon when I come to NY. Perfect location and near the subway for easy access all over town. 
16316 Great place to stay if you like waking up with bed bug bites all over you body. Never again.... 
16317 The hotel is maintained well, and the staff are terrific! 
16318 E una citta da vedere e da vivere sia di giorno che di notte .e alla portata di tutti ,nn c'e tutta quella violenza che si vuol far credere.delle dimensioni degli edifici ci si rende conto quando si ritorna al proprio paese. 
16319 The entire staff was very accommodating. Jessie Kryeziu was particularly courteous and extended authentic Hawaiian hospitality to our group traveling for business. 
16320 Excellent service and operations. Priced at a great value when booked through local trade show. Perfect location from Javitz Conf. Center and Times Square. Rooms were very adequate but need a little updating which is planned for this year. 
16321 Very nice location near Chinatown and subway. Rooms cramped (but what do you expect in this loaction?) but updated and very clean. We asked for extra towels and we got them quickly. Bellhop and guy in lobby very courteous and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. 
16322 Conveniently located, nice rooms, and great customer service! 
16323 Its located practically in Times square. At walking distance from any broadway show. Stay here if you want all the action at the palm of your hands. Clean, big rooms for a NYC hotel. I booked my next stay already again. 
16324 Our corner room was awesome with a fantastic view of the city! The bed was soooo comfy, and the staff was both helpful and professional. Their lounge was very inviting with comfortable seating, and the location was fantastic-right in the heart of all broadway shows! 
16325 The location is amazing, but we saw only the back of an advertising panel; the rooms are very small, nosy and dark. Not worth the money. 
16326 The Sutton Place Hotel was simply wonderful! The room was large, spotless, extra comfortable beds, and the view was amazing! The hotel staff was extraordinary. Perfect location for dining and shopping. I couldn't ask for more. I will definitely be back. 
16327 the front desk manager centra was very rude and not so friendly.......... 
16328 Great stay with my family. Staff solicitous and helpful. Pool area very nice. Great food. Great location. Don't forget to bring long pants if you want to dine in hotel's Italian restaurant. 
16329 It is the cheapest option in a fantastic area and we loved the service that we received. The building was clean and the beds were really comfortable. Jenny at the front desk was sweet and helped us get a cab and dinner reservations. Would definitely go back. 
16330 Overall a nice place to stay in Chicago. Every staff member I encountered was extremely friendly. The bed was comfortable. My only complaint would be the size of the bathroom. Very small space with a very small tub. 
16331 The check-in process is amazing. You do not have to stand in line. They sit you down, bring you a drink and check-in with an iPad or equivalent. Very fast check in service. The rooms are very nice and showers are amazing. 5 star plus! Great location too! 
16332 Despite it's location in the heart of Times Square, the suite I occupied was one of the quietest I have ever had in Manhattan. The rooms are spacious by NYC standards, and the beds very comfortable. Highly recommended for a Times Square or mid-town visit. 
16333 stayed here for 6 days with 5 lads in one room and could not fault anything the room was adequate and the location was perfect the hotel staff were always accomadating and helped make our stay very enjoyable would definetely use this hotel again 
16334 The hotel is great location and supper clean. The front desk is very helpful especiallly Tommy. We will come back again 
16335 I appreciated the friendly service of the staff, from the people behind the front desk to the cleaning lady to the luggage boys. The location of the hotel is good, close to 5th Avenue, Central Park and Times Square. 
16336 Huge rooms ,well fitted out but no soul or character in this place.Service also faulty,they didnt clean y room for a whole day and i rang down several times....disappointing...but good value if you like a lot of room for the money 
16337 Nice clean hotel. Staff were friendly. Location was great. Cafe over road (slightly down hill) is AMAZING! Well Priced, Amazing food. Room was a good size, Location was great, Metro stop in just across street, easy access to all of New York. Highly recommended for price 
16338 Friendly and very helpful staff, the room and hotel in general extremely clean. You need your room key to activate the elevator so security is also a plus. 
16339 Good family hotel in a good neighborhood. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were spacious however starting to show some wear. 
16340 Excellent hotel. Beautiful accomodations great location, wonderful staff. Couldn't have been better. 
16341 We've just returned from a 4-night break in New York staying at the Skyline Hotel. We found it to be very clean, the staff were helpful & it's only a 10 - 15 minute walk from the Rockefeller Center, 5th Ave & Broadway. We'll be back soon. 
16342 if you are looking for a great hotel in the northern part of Houston, you cannot beat this one. Convenient to Bush Intercontinental and businesses based in the north part of Houston. 
16343 Excellent service, friendly staff at front desk, bell hop very nice and accomadating pooring rain, and gentleman at front of hotel hails me a cab sans umbrella 
16344 Great place to stay very central and just a lovely experience. Breakfast is fab and sets you up for the day. Would definitely recommend it as somewhere to stay to friends and family. 
16345 Lovely clean room and very friendly and helpful staff. The bed was huge and the room was very spacious. Very close to sights. Just disappointed there wasn't any coffee making facilities in the room, however there is a Starbucks opposite! 
16346 I can see why this legendary hotel earned kudos with the likes of former US Presidents, Al Capone and other famous figures choose this place. 
16347 I'm going back to this hotel in March! It's the best.. 
16348 Love this hotel, stayed many times, The hotel staff are wonderful, and thats what it takes to make a great hotel It's close to time square and subway is near by. I can never find anything wrong with the hotel. Enjoy your stay. 
16349 Great Hotel..Needed a one night stay in the city. Most hotels over 300.00. This hotel was half that, and a great location. Walked to Geno's Pizza, Mag. Mile. Staff was very freindly!! Rooms are very small, but hey doesn't matter. Very clean, comfortable beds, flat screen TV...just perfect!!! Book it!!! 
16350 The hotel is a great property the staff is awsome very helpfull. When I travel to Houston again I will stay there. 
16351 bon hotel, mais pour le prix et la classe de l'hotel le fait de devoir payer Internet ou le Wifi n'est pas admissible 
16352 la chambre ne donnait pas sur la rue mais sur une cour interieure donc tres calme le matin ! 
16353 Good location, near Times Square. I was able to change the room and got a corner queen room which was in fact much bigger than the regular queen room. Really expensive wi-fi internet access not included in the high hotel room rate. 
16354 Hotel muy limpio, cerca de todo, a dos cuadras del time squar,restaurantes cercanos lindos y baratos, lo bueno es que esta cerca de todo.Lo negativo el desayuno del hotel muy caro y no esta incluido en la tarifa. El internet wifi tambien caro, que podria ser gratis. 
16355 I used this hotel to accomodate family members for wedding. It was reasonably priced, clean, and staff was friendly. Location is convenient too, as there is a supermarket, and a Target nearby, which was great for family staying for longer period. We also reallly enjoyed that they had complimentary breakfast! 
16356 For NYC it doesn't get any better than this for the price. Prime location, well appointed rooms, fastest check in/out ever. Hallways a bit loud though. Breakfast bar was good. Overall: Happy people, modern concept, great stay! We'll be back 
16357 Love the gansevoort hotel. Very nice staff and clean hotel in an awesome location. 
16358 enough for sleeping in new york! and also cheap but nothing to stay for long time! a bit dirty! very old and rusty bathrooms. mice in the rooms! 
16359 The hotel is located at times square and the rent is unbelivably cheap!! Of course you can't expect anything more than a bed and a working shower. But seriously, in a city where even hostels are unreasonably pricy, this place is just amazing!! 
16360 Rosa and crew provide excellent customer service. Very friendly and willing to help out with any issue. Housekeeping is done on a timely basis. Pet friendly. Very affordable, Close to many restaurants and interstates.Plenty of room and very comfortable for long term stay. 
16361 Mooi hotel, wij zijn er als nood terechtgekomen, maar totaal geen spijt. Behulpzaam en vriendelijk personeel. Mooie kamer, wel aan de krappe kant. Alles was schoon, werd ook elke dag goed schoongemaakt. Rustige straat.Overal dichtbij. Bed was goed, en douche ook. 
16362 Good staff, Room clean and comfortable ( a little noisy due to being on the service road of The Gulf Freeway). Very convenient to the Airport. Would stay there again. 
16363 If you can't splurge to stay the night, at least stay for drinks. The bars and restaurants are wonderful and a way to experience the glamour! 
16364 Booked this on Priceline and got an incredible deal. The rooms were large for NYC. A little dated but very clean and so close to Central Park and Times Square. Would love to stay here again. 
16365 Recently, I spent an early Saturday evening at the rooftop bar at the Hotel Indigo. It was a wonderful experience. The view as great, the appetizers excellent and the staff very friendly and helpful. I will definitely visit the Hotel Indigo on my next trip to NYC. 
16366 between Christmas and New Year, extremely well located hotel. frontdesk very helpful. roomsize great. clean with extremely comfortable bed. sole downside, not soundproof neither from corridor nor from street. restaurant was very expensive therefore we rather went to the many delis and other diners in the area. 
16367 You have to see these small + uglies bathrooms. Go somewhere else 
16368 The hotel management were very helpful and friendly. The room was very clean and the furniture was very modern. Great location, in Chinatown and right next to Little Italy and Soho. Just two blocks from the subway station. Would stay at this hotel again! 
16369 Booked it through ebooker got a good deal hotel was good for the value for money. 
16370 An easy walk to Penn Station and to the Empire State Building, Times Square, and many key tourist sites. Hotel, although relatively small, was safe and clean. Stayed here with my family and would definitely stay again. 
16371 Superleuke trip gehad met mijn 12 jarige dochter. Hotel is prima uitvalbasis voor alle bezienswaardigheden. Grey line bus is een leuke manier om je te verplaatsen door de stad. Je bent iets langer onderweg dan met de metro maar je ziet gelijk heel veel onderweg. 
16372 The Omni was the perfect home for our stay in Houston. The rooms were attractive and the pool area quite appealing. You can park for free in the garage down the street from the hotel. There is a fun club where we went dancing on Saturday night. 
16373 O quarto era exatamente o que eu solicitei. A localizacao e perfeita. O quarto era grande , de esquina. 
16374 Train is a problem very Noisy. Staff were pleasant and helpful The water problems seem to be sorted as everything was in order in Sept. Location is a subway ride away from Time Square. 
16375 Large rooms for New York, well furnished. Great value accommodation for Jan/Feb. Close to everything and to subway, very friendly staff. We loved it all 
16376 stayed here for a quick vacatoin based on other reviews. hotel staff lukewarm, breakfast line in morning was thirty minutes so we went somewhere else, elevator broke and waited 25 mintues for one. spoke to management about hampton inn guarentee and they laughed. 
16377 Our stays at a Westin in Costa Mesa and other locations were always comfortable. The Chicago Michigan Ave. was in a good location, but that's about it. 
16378 Estuvimos 5 noches de luna de Miel, y de 3 veces que e estado es el mejor hotel que e visto en NY, recepcion super amables, algunos hispanos.. Solo un pero..no se os ocurra llamar desde el hotel cuetsa 10$ el minuto 
16379 Rooms are needing update. Very noisy at night from street. Amenities are sub par. 2nd time staying here...last time was 2008. Would not recommend. 
16380 I always try to stay here when I am in NYC. They have a pantry, fridge microwave and stove top in the rooms. Free wifi. Always like staying here minutes from time square and places to eat. 
16381 It's very expensive for a hotel room, but when compared to other hotels in the city, it still offers good value. Very comfortable and most of all, the staff cannot do enough for you. Be sure to make use of the concierge. 
16382 I will never stay here again as I am recovering from bites. Stayed here for two days and I will need to spray my clothes to get rid of these damn little bugs 
16383 Very nice hotel with people that do theyr best for guest. 
16384 I didn't know what to expect, but from the moment we walked in everyone we encountered (especially at the front desk) was pleasant and helpful. The room was small but very well done....wide screen TV, Bose music player and great pillows. I definitely will stay there again. 
16385 Great location. Good property. Staff is very hospitable. Nice lounge for Marriott Rewards premium customers. If you can snag a good rate, this is a dependable, comfortable place to stay. It's a solid choice, but it doesn't say "luxury." It says "good business hotel." 
16386 I was here for a girl's trip and we had such a good time. It was nice to have a car with a driver to take us where we needed to go in Downtown. 
16387 A very hip hotel. The stars even stay here. The service is great, The food is awesome. Stay here! 
16388 Stayed for four days and the hotel was excellent. Food good, wifi worked, excellent location and good value. This hotel would also be good for families as the rooms are large compared to most other new York hotels. 
16389 Perfect location. Near all attractions. Very Clean. Safe area. Many restaurants. 
16390 Just off 5th ave, I liked location very much. However, the bathroom was very tiny. If you are solo that's fine, but 2+ people no place to put your bags. The staff were very nice, though. 
16391 Well situated hotel next to the MOMA and central park with comfortable rooms with reasonable prices. One should ask for a corner room with view (and not a dark room with view on the wall of the neighbor building). 
16392 The staff was GREAT.The whole weekend was GREAT we couldn't have asked for a better stay..If you go to New York you should stay at The Empire Hotel..Sean and the whole staff made us feel at home 
16393 Great hotel, fabulous service, amazing room and great location. Would definitely stay here again. 
16394 We've put our friends and family here recently and spent some time there. Great facility--good location-very close to highways and great dining. Free breakfast was actually decent--when other Marriotts might have so-so. Rooms could stand an update-but they're very comfortable. 
16395 very small room for the price....food was very good but expensive 
16396 Very charmming with and selected atmosphere. Great assistance and in the center of New York heart. 
16397 Great location, hotel with a lot of history, all guests were very friendly, good service. 
16398 Around the corner from Times Square, comfortable and modern. Not cheap but you get for what you paid for = location. 
16399 The rooms were smaller than expected, but there was free Wifi and the beds were comfortable. There is a fun night club downstairs with a mechanical bull. For the price, we would definitely stay again. Located around the block from Time Square, Rockefeller Center and Radio City. 
16400 Hotel is next to Rockefeller center and close to Times square. Very close to buses and subways. Rooms are great. Very clean. Very good service and help with recommendations to restaurants and directions. Separate access to fitness room and living room with free use of computers. 
16401 Excellent location------great service. Great for a brief family getaway! 
16402 A wonderful place to stay. The staff couldnt be more friendly and helpful. The room was wonderful. Would definately stay here again. Local was jst great 
16403 Only problem ( and not the hotels fault) was the raod works outside but hey.. this is New York!!! 
16404 Location, genteel ambience, comfort, staffing of all services, quality of dining, room quality and cleanliness are exceptional. Have stayed four times and will always return. Cabs are hailed upon request and elevator operators add a sense of bygone times. 
16405 Great hotel in a fabulous location, service was outstanding. I would definitely stay there again. 
16406 El Hotel esta muy padre, muy moderno, pero el cuarto es super chiquito, muy ruidoso, los ruidos de la calle se filtran todos hacia el cuarto, pero si eso no te importa entonces el hotel esta super bueno, un antro muy inn, el restaurant poca madre, recomendado 
16407 In ottima posizione, di fronte alla fermata della metropolitana, 2 comodissimi starbucks per la colazione, e ristoranti di ogni tipo. Camere comode e pulite, 4 ascensori funzionanti. Personale gentile. 
16408 Hotel Carter ligt echt om de hoek van Times Square. Als je tevreden bent met een net bed, om de dag schone handdoeken en opgemaakte bedden en hier en daar wat achterstallig onderhoud(!!!) beveel ik dit zeer voordelige hotel ten zeerste aan. 
16409 The location of the hotel is between Central Park and Times Square, so that's good. But furthermore the hotel does not offer anything more. There is no bar or restaurant. The airco is built-up and old and makes a terrible noise at night. 
16410 Manager of the Reception Elizabeth is very kind, polite, responsive and very professional. We will recommend this hotel to our friends who are going to New York. Regards, Russian family Miroshnichenko 
16411 all i have to say is never again, and people do your homework before, read all reviews , i was very disappointed.... 
16412 My wife and I were guests for 4 nights and enjoyed the modern open concept Andaz properties offer. Very convenient location to shopping, theatre district, and cultural locations. 
16413 Was worried about hotel choice in NY. Nice room and had 2 bathrooms, although the hot water only worked in one. Staff were very friendly/helpful. The location was perfect. Really can't think of any criticism at all. Thank you. 
16414 A nice hotel, with helpful staff. THe wheelchair accessible room was a little worn, with a broken drawer in the dresser and the shower chair loosely attached to the wall. However, the staff was great and the room was convenient. 
16415 This hotel really gives value in the city of New York. Well-sized rooms with comfy beds and good bathrooms. Location is tops. Plenty of breakfast spots nearby. 
16416 Wonderful Hotel,with clean and spacious rooms. Great Airport location.Great stay. 
16417 Wonderful accomodation and people. The sevices were very good and the beds. 
16418 Nice place but the rooms are very small................................. 
16419 The better place in the better city. And great prices for all you have in the hotel. I'm sure I will be back soon. 
16420 Fix the drapes in room 1120 so they are all attaached. It was still functional just looked off. Add mouthwash to room supplies. 
16421 Checked in, took off my shoes and found not one, not two, but THREE DEAD COCKROACHES throughout the room. Absolutely disgusting. The front desk guy checked me out and wouldn't even book me another hotel. STAY AWAY!!!!! 
16422 Staff is incredibly friendly. Quiet, beautiful views. Very comfortable stay. 
16423 I stayed here after reading some great reviews but I have to say I was disappointed. Check-in took way too long- on top of that they had some issue with finding the reservation. Room was small and suffered from wear and tear. Location was good but that was about it. 
16424 relaxing room, not on the street so quiet, with a small kitchen not far from the metro. Near the park and museum 
16425 Great price, excellent value! Great Location-2 blocks from the empire state building, a short walk to Penn station and Madison Square Garden. staff was very friendly, room was very clean and neat. I would definitely stay here again! 
16426 Cramped bathrooms but it's NYC. Great location. Lobby is cool. 
16427 Just spent three nighs there for business. I booked the rooms and my boss liked his room. It had everything you needed. Great shower. Its in a good location. Easy to get to everything. I would go back again. 
16428 Had an amazing time. They catered to our needs.. Very helpful. Was there for our 25th wedding anniversary and had a great time. The poll also has one of the best views of central park. 
16429 We stayed for 3 nights and couldn't fault the location or the staff who were excellent ,hotel is very busy but plenty of places to eat nearby ,rooms are good just what you would expect no complaints 
16430 La posizione dell' hotel e' centrale, due passi dal Madison, un isolato da Macy' s, 2 da Time Square. Personale gentile ed efficiente, l' unico difetto stanze piccole, ma un buon appoggio se si intende stare in hotel solo per dormire la sera. Consigliato, ma non aspettatevi nulla di speciale! 
16431 My partner and I just came back from staying at the Lombardy, and loved it. I had everything you need and in a great location, very central to everything. Would recommend this hotel to first time visitors to NYC. 
16432 Amazing hotel, positioned at the perfect location! Service is unbelievable. So are the restaurants and breakfast buffet. Would not hesitate to book there again! 
16433 Enjoyed the room with a view of the Hudson River. Service was attentive and food in the little cafe was good. Great location to the subway and bus lines. We walked alot. September is a good month to travel to Manhattan, NY. 
16434 Percet location, excellent stuff, elegant rooms, value for money if you choose prepaid reservation. Only the breakfast area is not good enough (you have no privacy, it's an open area between reception and one of the exits). It will be my first choise when i'll visit again New York City. 
16435 Third stay here. Location is great. Breakfast included in adjacent restaurant is very good. Nice neighborhood. Rooms are small but very clean. Will stay again! 
16436 Travelodge was exactly what I needed, an affordable hotel in a great location. The room and service was fine. The wireless was non-existent, I had to go to the lobby to get a connection. Despite that, I would recommend Travelodge for any traveler looking for a bargain. 
16437 The hotel was comfortable. It could have been a little cleaner. Great Location! 
16438 This place is always buzzing from the bluefin at street level, a great place to watch Times Square and have a drink to the living room bar which is a great place to meet friends. If you are looking for the best location in Times Square this is your place. 
16439 What a great location, and the staff was so nice! I left my purse at the Hotel and the security dept. sent it the next day. 
16440 Very nice hotel, the price paid was a bit higher (but you get what you pay for, right?) 
16441 Stayed two nights for business trip. They upgraded my room at check-in to a tower suite on the 39th floor. Beautiful views of empire state and Chrysler buildings. Quick elevators. Courteous concierge service directed me to a nice restaurant in the theatre district. 
16442 Excellent location. Lovely breakfast. Great service. Clean and modern rooms. Highly recommended. 
16443 We had two family rooms: 3 adults & 3 teenagers. Everyone had their own space. Very nice. Only complaint would be the noise outside overnight as the room faced the street. The Bellman, Matthew, was always helpful and knew when one of us was missing from the group. 
16444 My daughter and I stayed here during the Thanksgiving week, 2010. It was excellent because we could just slip out the front door and be in the middle of everything. Our room was right across from the New Years eve ball...cool. 
16445 Yes, the rooms might be a bit small - but so are most in NYC and you don't come to town to stay in the room. But it's all very modern, stylish and efficient for the price, and the staff are extremely friendly. 
16446 Ottimo hotel, posizione veramente invidiabile! Eravamo al 41' piano e la vista su Times square era incredibile! Facevamo sempre colazione a uno Starbucks e la cena in uno dei tanti ristoranti della zona ( a proposito vi sconsiglio vivamente Sbarro ...). L'hotel vale sicuramente tutti i soldi spesi! 
16447 Definitely worth every penny. Location is fantastic and a metro nearby for easy mobility elsewhere. Rooms are clean. Will definitely stay here again! 
16448 Tiny room that smelled funny. I'm not sure if it was smoky or just old. But for $100 a night, couldn't beat the location!! The staff was always helpful. 
16449 Rooms are too small for two people. The wallpaper, carpet, desk surface looked worn and shabby. Found a bed bug in the bathroom! Overall a DINGY impression not comfortable. Won't ever use Sheraton Hotels again. 
16450 We had a lovely stay at the Marriott Marquis and will definitely return again. The View restaurant which is a revolving restaurant is a most for amazing views. 
16451 We have family in the area, and was thrilled to find a lovely room with view of the river. The warm breakfast was a nice, surprise treat. We will definitely return. Staff was kind, helpful and accommodating. 
16452 Siamo state 5 giorni a NY e questa struttura ubicata a pochi passi dall epire state building ha offerto un buon servizio nel complesso. camere pulite, spaziose e confortevoli. unica pecca la piccolissima zona riservata alla colazione. 4 tavolini con sedie insufficienti. 
16453 Room is clean, quite old furniture, spacious for two ppl. Near korean restaurants, one block away from empire state building. Free internet. Breakfast is just so so. 
16454 Alter Kasten aber sauber in sehr guter Lage bei Penn Station. Preis - Leistung ist gut. 
16455 When traveling business, one often ends up in beautiful, but rather anonymous chain hotels. This place delivers a quality boutique experience, while maintaining business standards and convenience. And it is located in one of the most friendly areas in Houston. 
16456 As I am partial to older hotel,this was a rare find. The older decore is well kept,yet we had all the modern amenities.The entire hotel was absolutely spotless,the rooms were spacious and the service superb.I location is also a plus. 
16457 Great location, nice and clean hotel, buig rooms, pleasent staff, free internet in the loby, free breakfast (bagels, cereals, yoghurt...) 
16458 Warmly recomend it! 
16459 Overbooked at Palmer House so they sent us to The Drake. Completely unaccommadating, called for room service three times with no response, and snotty front end staff. The only positive was location o the park, John Hanock Bldg and hops. 
16460 Everyone starting at the front desk was very kind and helpful. The hotel was only a 9 minute walk from Times Square. Rooms were very comfortable, especially the bed. Loved having a refrigerator and microwave in the room. Showers were excellent as well. 
16461 This hotel was surprisingly nice with more spacious rooms than I have previously seen in NYC. If you stay above the 5th floor, it is quiet. Beds were very comfortable and staff was very helpful with directions, recommendations, etc. 
16462 I always like sharing great hotel visits. I've stayed at the Hotel Wales, located on the Upper East Side many of times. Each time I visit - the service, ambiance and accomadations are fantastic. It's a perfect place to stay and I love staying there when I visit NYC. 
16463 Hotel is goed gelegen: ongev 8min van metrostation. Het wordt momenteel volledig gerenoveerd waardoor restaurant en bar gesloten waren. Ontbijtbuffet was niet berekend op aantal gasten. Ruime kamer met prima kingsize bed. Verrassend groot zwembad en geschikte fitness ruimte. 
16464 Just came back from a 5 night stay at The Barclay to celebrate by wife's birthday; great central location , able to walk anywhere in Manhatten; breakfast buffet excellent; room (858) very comfortable and well maintained each day; will definately go back; 
16465 Stay is pretty non-eventful. Sometimes, this is all you can ask for in big cities, especially NYC. Good location. Really nothing great or bad to mention. 
16466 Booked on the basis of TripAdvisor ranking and did not disappoint. Fantastic location next to Time Square. Excellent, Helpful Staff. Clean Bathroom. Comfy Bed. Excellent Continental Breakfast. Not to mention one of the cheapest places to stay in New York. 
16467 The quality of your hotel exceeded my expectations not only was I pleased but my clients were pleased as well and this was a indication of boosting my business. I will use the Hilton Garden Inn again for future business and personal benefits. 
16468 your staff very profesional,and very informative,Gentelman in front desk Super Nice. 
16469 Very handy for Times Sq, 5th Ave etc, Staff are helpful, no issues with rooms. Would recommend. 
16470 I booked this hotel for a friend and experienced the WORST service ever in the NYC. If you really want to enjoy ur stay then avoid this hotel 
16471 We loved our stay in Manhattan coz our hotel, The Manhattan at Times Square Hotel's location is very good. It was so easy to go around Manhattan. Their facilities are good and clean, the staff quite accomodating and the rates fare. 
16472 great location ,great hotel, would recommend this hotel , would stay again in future 
16473 Close to times square, elevators are very slow. Funny smell in hotel but not in rooms.Concierge was awesome!! No safe in room. 
16474 We had a great experience with On The Ave, despite having difficult and often changing travel plans. They did everything to accomodate our business group, without any mistakes or troubles. It was great! 
16475 This hotel was the biggest hotel disappointment. Dirty rooms, dirty bathrooms, small, thin towels with holes. chipped paint and terrible service.Changed room once. The 2nd room was not as dirty. Good location and nice lobby. 
16476 We reserved this room on Hotwire for $140. Quite a bargain for a great room with a fantastic location. Room was well appointed and comfortable. Starbucks in the lobby was convenient. Room service was delicious, but super expensive(to be expected though). We were very happy with our experience. 
16477 Nice hotel, great staff, clean and excellent location. A little bit hard bed and thin walls, but all in all a very nice hotel. 
16478 Hotel is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!!!! My girlfriends and I had a great time. Lots of celebrities in/out of hotel during stay. Very hip and chic. Only hotel i will stay in from now on when visiting the big apple. I highly recommend. 
16479 The hotel is wonderful!The dinning room is very good. The bar is great. The rooms are spacious, immaculate and luxurious. We had a one bedroom suite and we could have moved in and lived in it! The staff was extemely helpful and far superior to most in NYC. 
16480 Hotel comodissimo a 100 da time square. Staff gentile e molto disponibile. Camera comoda e pulita. Le camere interne, hanno una visuale su un muro di un palazzo di fronte, ma sono molto silenziose. 
16481 This is my second visit to the Tremont. Both visits have been pleasant. Quiet rooms, great location near both North Michigan Ave (for those who like to shop) and Rush Street (for those who like nightlife). The only downside is the elevators are a bit slow. 
16482 Room decor was modern, good breakfast buffet. Stayed here on business Recommendable. It was cute and agreeable. The building is beautiful, interesting architecture makes it worth a look, at the very least. 
16483 We found our accommodations to be clean and comfortable. Great location, near Madison Square Garden, Macy's....beautiful walk to Times Square, Central Park, etc. 
16484 This will be our third summer to go to NYC. We always stay at the Skyline. Great location walking distance to most attractions. I always recommend this to friends 
16485 it was okay, certainly not 4 stars but a little lower. The view from the window was dismal, maybe because of the way the hotel is built. room was small, but very clean. close to 2 subways, so easy access. 
16486 The room was very clean and spacious! The bed was super comfortable. The gym was very clean and fully equipped. The location was excellent and convenient! Loved my stay. 
16487 Hotel muy muy grande. Muchisima gente a toda hora. Muy bien ubicad si desea utilizar el transporte subterrane. habitaciones amplias pero no especialmente lujosas. Se deja como sehujnda o tercerqa opcion si se consgue una buena tarifa. 
16488 The rooms were clean. The staff was friendly. The breakfast was fresh and hot. I just wish the room rates were a little cheaper, but that's NY in a nutshell. I'd stay here again in a heartbeat... 
16489 Location very c;lose to Penn Station. Very helpful staff. Breakfast vouchers for 2 people entitle you to a sumptuous buffet. Wonderful business centre. I would recommend this hotel for its good value.. 
16490 We are never disappointed in the Marriott Marquis...staff is always accomidating, great location, great price (for NYC that is lol) 
16491 Stayed in the hotel for a week. Room was very clean and comf with a little kitchen and fridge. Staff very helpful and friendly. Breakfest good but basic. Very convenient location. Will stay there again for sure. 
16492 This is a great hotel for someone who is travelling alone, because the rooms (the majority if not all) are for one. Great location in greenwich just below 14th street, the staff very nice, and for New York, great price. I recommend it to anyone travelling by themselves. 
16493 Por lo general esta muy bien el hotel,la cama muy grande,la situacion estupenda, y el trato con el personal fantastico, yo volveria. 
16494 Very good location, good service, good stuff. Near Time Square and Grand Terminal. Comfort rooms and very Soft mattresses! wi-fi is free! Nice meal. but in this building here is The night club for the men. Only. And the big guys can kisses near the entrance of the hotel )). 
16495 Great location is the key to this place! The room is generally smaller in any hotel/inn in NYC. So don't expect huge room with the given price. It served me its purpose of having nice clean shower, rest, and sleep. 
16496 very modern hotel with an asian feel that is close to everything. I would stay there again. 
16497 enjoyed the trip and the hotel met with expectations - pity about the housekeeping quality control, ie, duvet cover looked grubby and was heavily stained. Great location for exploring Manhattan. 
16498 i think the mansfield was okay, but the room i stayed in couldve done with some cupboards, had no ironing board. The main telephone was not working properly and i also found the bathroom abit of a tight squeeze. 
16499 The hotel was nice, the elevators were not so slow as other guests mentioned before and Internet was free in the lobby. The only issue was about the rooms, that were really small, especially the "4 people room", because you don`t have neither space to open your baggage. 
16500 My husband just recently stayed at the Fitzpatrick for (2) nights. It is very easily located to shopping. Very nice upscale hotel. The Bed linens where fabulous. Hotel staff was awesome!! We will be back for sure. Looking to go back in the Spring!!! 
16501 Top !! * * * * * sehr central gelegen mit super sicht auf die skyline und statue of liberty !!!!! 
16502 It is a great hotel central to all attratctions just round corner from times square Highly recommend the open top bus tour very good value and get to see all the sights 
16503 We stayed at the grand hyatt for two nights, the rooms are a good size,clean, this hotel have great location, near grand central station, from it you can know the city ( midtown) by foot. The staff were so friendly and helpful. Internet paid. 
16504 Stayed here during a business conference. Outstanding! 
16505 Everything is well cared-for here. It's very clean, the breakfast is clean and fresh, and you can't beat the price. I'll be back. 
16506 Very well located in the Meat pack district just in front of Pastis (Perfect for a Sunday brunch). Everything ok except the service at the pool bar (no at all professional). 
16507 This hotel is located within blocks of Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, theaters and more. Nice place to stay, very clean hotel and room was fantastic. Can't beat rates in the heart of the City. 
16508 Great location. Small but clean room with a nice sink. The shared bathrooms were very clean and always available. You can go everywhere from the hotel. I will go back. 
16509 Excelente ubicacion. Muy lindo el salon de recepcion, muy moderno. A la maniana arman un apartado en la entrada donde venden cafe starbuck y podes comprar tu desayuno y subirlo. Muy buena limpieza. Es muy grande, pero tiene un sistema de ascensores que no tenes q esperar. Practico. 
16510 Excellent location and excellent for families with kids. Rooms were spacious by NY standards. Great and would stay there again. 
16511 The staff tried to make our stay as nice as possible. 
16512 Great location downtown, walking distance to Magnificent Mile, as well as to bus/subway/trolley stations. The manager even gave my son a gift card to area restaurants to treat us on his birthday. Although rooms were a bit small they were clean and comfortable. Breakfast at Marriott is always great. 
16513 Nice hotel, extremely clean, cozy, comfortable, excellent breakfast, extremely helpful and nice staff, wonderful position in new york... our child was starting to call it home after 4 days! I will for sure stay there for my next NY visit 
16514 Great location, attentive staff, spotless cleaning and comfy suites make the Park Central a sure bet for those looking for a great stay in NY. 
16515 The deluxe studio is elegant, comfortable, roomy. Lovely light and windows. The staff went out of their way to help us and couldn't have been kinder and more creative and responsive and generous. 
16516 Needs rooms facelift!and faster check in!..grt location.....grt...breakfast....sweat staff!A bit dull and dark....I guess it's how old it is..concierge was grt help in booking plays..tours..ect ect... 
16517 The Time is an excellent establishment. The hotel is beautiful with a great location in NYC. The staff is extremely helpful and courteous. Very accommodating and clean hotel. I recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for a nice hotel in NYC. 
16518 Near Broadway and Central Park. Breakfast included. THe carpets are old and smell funny but it's ok. It's clean and the staff is nice. 
16519 Stayed at this hotel for 2 nights with 2 other girlfriends. Hotel is a bit old, but price is decent considering its location. Room is clean and beds are comfy. Centrally located and easy walking distance. 
16520 Very good location, right next to grand central station and the chrysler building. very friendly staff. 
16521 Fairfield Inn New York / Time Square. Great Location only two streets from Time Square, Broadway and also Port Authority which is great for getting into the city from the airport. I would recommend this hotel for location, great hotel room, free breakfast and free internet. 
16522 Staying at the New York Hilton was a wonderful experience. The staff is courteous, friendly and helpful. The hotel is very clean at all times. The New York Hilton is in a great location. It is minutes away from most attractions and close to many good restaurants. 
16523 Free wireless internet. Coffee maker. Climate control. Free water bottles in each floor. 
16524 Got a great rate for a weekend in Aug through Priceline. Rooms was of reasonable size by NYC standards. Beautiful public areas. Only negative is wifi only free in public areas and not in rooms. 
16525 Siamo stati in questo hotel a luglio,per 3 notti.le stanze sono piccole ,ma a new york ,siete sicuri di voler stare in camera??? hotel pulito,con connessione wi fi gratuita.5minuti a piedi dal metro e in quartiere sicuro 
16526 A shame to review this beautiful hotel so poorly... They used to have it all: charm, location, antiques, freshly squeezed orange juice for breakfast, the nicest tea room... But now it is so dirty and not that well kept anymore. Very worn and asking for some attentive maintenance soon. 
16527 the has a perfect position, you are directly in Soho, China Town and little Italy, the subway station is not far away.... we enjoyed our stay in NYC and in this hotel 
16528 My fourth stay at Millennium Broadway. Three friends were with me. They were impressed with the hotel as well. The location can't be beat. Great value!!!! 
16529 Currently staying at the hotel. Very nice with very large rooms. I had a couple of issues I needed help with and Regina (front desk) helped me... and, she was awesome - very professional and very helpful! I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
16530 Definitely worthy of consideration especially when travelling with family. Price is reasonable for a suite in NYC and you can't ask for a better location if going to see a Broadway show and want to experience the "live action" 
16531 Excelent hotel, worth the value in every sense: location, service and comfort. 
16532 Absolutely perfect base or our 6 days an nights in NY, location perfect to walk to time square where you an easily get subway anywhere. We walked a lot in NY and found the location perfect. Rooms clean ideal. Staff helpful and very friendly. Would recommend. 
16533 We love the hotel. The staff is always courteous and we love the proximity and the view of Central Park. We stayed on the 37th floor. This was our 5th year in a row and we'll be back next year to hit Broadway and Fifth Avenue, yet again!! 
16534 The Warwick hotel was lovely and in a wonderful location. I would recommend it highly and would definitely choose The Warwick again! 
16535 This is a nice hotel, but certainly not as good as a Ritz should be. For the price there are better choices. 
16536 Why is it that a $69 motel serves free breakfasts, turns on the TV when you push power on the remote and has free internet service. 
16537 Nice hotel with personable hotel staff. Molton Brown toiletries. The rooms are small but normal for NYC. I stayed in the smallest room and it was fine for one night. The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, and the street was fairly quiet. 
16538 Wonderful lobby, bar and restaurant. Rooms are a little funky (mine was also an adjoining room so it was also noisy) and not great for a business traveler. Attempted upselling at check-in was a little disappointing. Location can make it very difficult to get a taxi in the morning. 
16539 I stayed at the Crowne Plaza Manhattan last week for business. I received a lovely and clean room. The staff was helpful and friendly. This hotel is right smack in the middle of Times Square. Great location and centrally located in the Theater District. I would definitely stay here again. 
16540 Nice Property, Great Location. Easy in/out. Walking distance to many Restaurants, near theater district. 
16541 Me and my family stayed during the 4th and the hotel took us to the fireworks! Thanks for making my kids happy and many thanks to the front desk and Renee. The bus driver was really nice. 
16542 We had two rooms for our family of six and while they were not connecting, we had no issues. The beds were comfortable and the hotel was quite. The location was great with tons of things within walking distance. We'd stay here again in a heartbeat. 
16543 Got a room with absolutely no view, but it was perfectly clean, and so was the shared bathrooms and the rest of the hotel. Perfect location and great value for the money. We would stay there again.. 
16544 Just returned from a trip to new york, this hotel was very clean and very well located. Would highly recommend anyone to stay here. 
16545 very nice hotel, young people, good music on friday night at the bar, very good restaurant 
16546 For the price of the room I expected a more updated hotel. The rooms and hotel in general was shabby. Bathroom didn't have a decent shower. No water or coffee machines in the room. Breakfast very overpriced!! Staff were friendly and the location is ok. 
16547 The location of hotel is perfect because it is almost inside of Time Square (without the noise). In each corner there is a subway where you can connect almost to any other line. The staff was very helpful in everything I needed. 
16548 hotel scenografico ma non pratico.dalle camere si sente il rumore di tutto l'hotel,essendo tutto aperto,come se le camere dessero tutte su una corte che sono tutti i piani dell'albergo.molto da aspettare per gli ascensori nei giorni di capodanno 
16549 Entire staff was great, friendly and helpful. Especially enjoyed Josh at the bar! Very knowledgeable and gifted mixologist! Knew his stuff and had some incredible creations. Very refreshing for a hotel bar. 
16550 This was our first visit to NYC. We came on a whim after attending my cousins wedding in baltimore. We were so close and said hey why not. This was one of the cheapest,nicest,PET FRIENDLY places we could find. They were very nice and helpful. 
16551 The bathrooms are outstanding, and the beds the always reliable Heavenly Sleeper. Most rooms have nice views as well. Staff is uniformly excellent. The lobby bar is well run, if somewhat noisy. Good value is available. 
16552 Great location in a "quiet" NYC neighbourhood. Very close to Central Park, great for morning runs. Bigger than typical NYC hotel rooms, great bathrooms. Slow elevator. Neat rooftop deck, but wish it were oriented for a better city view. I'll be back again. 
16553 We have stayed at this hotel several times and have been very pleased. Large clean rooms, great service, nice decor, wins the most comfortable bed award hands down and also the best shower award. An all around great hotel. 
16554 very busy hotel clean rooms small rooms very small lobby staff very busy so no personalized service 
16555 I chose the Roger Smith based upon raves from Trip Advisor reviewers and they were absolutely correct! Perfect East Side location, friendliest staff, and my room on the 9th floor had a very high fourposter bed. Largest room ever for a boutique hotel. My search is over. 
16556 3rd time staying, feels like a home from home, view over the Hudson, friendly bar staff and excellent welcome. Will def be back for the 4th time. Only negative was a frosty receptionist - bit of a shame (and the weather is freezing this time of year). See you soon. 
16557 Great hotel, excellent location, very welcoming I enjoyed it a lot 
16558 We had a suite over looking central park, it was gorgeous, the staff were lovely and the location was second to none. The large fridge was fully stocked, the room was stylish and very comfortable it made that trip to NY perfect. 
16559 Great location, poor service. Upon checkout , came across an unpleasant young woman by the name of Sally. Dont bother asking her any questions- very abrupt. On the other hand, great decor, nice aquarium. Small rooms, but cozy. Overall 3 out of 5. 
16560 Stayed at Sanctuary Hotel for the first time, and will definitely be back. Location is central to Times Square, 5th Avenue, accessible to at least 3 Subway stops nearby, great customer care and experience at this hotel. 
16561 Sam GUIRAGOSSIAN, manager of the fitness center, is one of the primary reasons I stay at the Westin River North in Chicago. His positive attitude and energy start off my day right. It is the same positive experience I have each time I stay. Thanks again, Sam. 
16562 I am a bit late writing this but better late than never. I cannot fault this hotel. It is clean, staff are friendly and helpful. Food is great. We stayed here over new year and was wonderful. Would stay here again. 
16563 Net gerenoveerd in februari toen wij daar in augustus 2011 verbleven. Leuke en frisse uitstraling. Badkamer is klein maar voldoet prima. Centraal gelegen en naast het hotel een prima gelegenheid voor een gezond ontbijt. Direct to een metro station. Prijs/kwaliteit voor hartje NY is hier uitstekend. 
16564 Used it as a crash pad after a night out with my best friend. Good quality, room was on the small side, but I paid a very competitive price, it was like new, very clean, very easy check-in and check-out, so I was pleasantly surprised. 
16565 Make sure you book a central park view room; the view is amazing, so romantic. The rooms are very spacious and clean, the breakfast delicious (also with central park view), the staff extremely competent and nice; worth every penny 
16566 This place has a terrific location. The restaurants and bar are excellent, although breakfast is a little pricey. The decor is very modern, down to cartoons in the elevator, but the facilities are great. The bed is super comfortable and the flat screen tv is fun. 
16567 situated in great location.. rooms VERY small.. great for singles 
16568 What a great Hotel, right near Times Square! Fabulous Service! Friendly Staff! 
16569 Very good value. What do people expect for the money & the prime location? The hotel has considerable old-world charm from the 40s & 50s (the lobby is stunning), though the rooms could perhaps benefit from some repainting. 
16570 We have stayed here twice and have had a great experience both times. The location is amazing and the hotel rooms are modern, clean and the most comfortable beds. We highly recommend the Le Parker Meridien and will stay there again. 
16571 From Charles the Doorman to our accommodations, everything was great! The location made it easy to get to theater, restaurants, shopping, etc. My only wish was a firmer bed. Double beds were not equipped with sleep numbers like the king size beds. 
16572 Prices are high, but service is very good. Stayed for the 3rd year in a row and surely coming back next year. No problems everything you ask can be arranged. 
16573 The staff at this hotel were all very friendly and helpful. Taxi's are readily available and it is close to the train station - we toted suitcases down the sidewalk upon arrival. The roof-top pool was a draw and totally worth choosing this hotel. Recommend highly. 
16574 stayed on 22nd floor, nice room 2 Queen beds, very clean, bathroom good in all elements. Chose the Hilton principally for the location, Central Park is 5 mins stroll, Times sq the same. Good Irish bar close by, and a great supermarket across the road. 
16575 Stayed here for 4 nights. All the staff were very friendly. In a great location, easy to walk to grand central station, and times square etc. Bar was lovely, spent many an evening in it! 
16576 I loved this hotel. I work at an HGI so I already knew I was going to get great service. Front Desk, Bellmen, Housekeeping were all great. I met the GM and he seems like a great guy to work for. I have already booked my next stay!!!!! 
16577 Good point: spacious room, clean, excellent location Bad points: too much street noise (we stayed on the 4th floor), staff impersonal, no safe in the room, bathroom very cramped, tv was placed on the side of the room and not directly in front of the bed. 
16578 I would totally come back here. The staff are friendly and the room was cozy but spacious at the same time. The beds didn't take up the entire room, which is so hard to find in NYC. Awesomeee!!! 
16579 Hotel is renovating rooms - the new ones are pleasantly updated. I had a deluxe single, which had lots of windows (which open), a couch, great bed and serviceable bathroom. Convenient location to Penn Station and a great food emporium Cafe R just down the block. 
16580 I loved everything about this hotel. The price was right, the interior was modern, clean, and upscale, the room size not bad (for New York), great staff, great location. This is my new digs of choice when I'm in NYC. 
16581 simply the most bad mannered staff i've ever encountered, with the exception of the two nice chaps working at the front door.. overpriced, rude, bad mannered uncaring staff, avoid at all costs... 
16582 The hotel is in a great central location to visit anywhere in NYC; and we had a great room with a great view of the city; the staff was receptive and fun. 
16583 The room was very small and needed renovation; the shower had a minimal pressure; the air-condition was noisy and didn't work well, the bar smelt terrible. If they want to see me again they should renovate this hotel ASAP. 
16584 Wow! Fantastic room, in a wonderful location! Staff was friendly and very helpful! Couldn't have asked for a better night! The price was perfect too! 
16585 I loved the place. It is three blocks from time square. The staff was friendly enough. My sister and I stay from Mar 30- apr 1. The room was clean and very affordable. I would definitely stay here again. 
16586 Second visit this year. A truly legendry property but the service quality seems to have slipped a tad. Can be irritating at the sort of rates this hotel charges. Just small things but they add up. Will try the another hotel on my next trip. 
16587 I typically stay here for business once or twice a month: The good: Lobby, hotel staff, room bathrooms, bed, alarm clock, location, fitness center, access to major highways, drinks and snacks. The bad: tv's are not flat screen or HD, in dining breakfast. 
16588 We really enjoyed our stay in this hotel. It's pretty close to restaurants, theater, and shopping. Nearby train and bus stops. A little pricy, but a great place to stay. 
16589 We were VERY happy with our stay. Our room was clean, spacious and comfortable. The kids loved swimming in the pool at night --- with an incredible view of the skyline. It was close to everything and an incredible value. Will return on our next trip. 
16590 Amazing stay, the Manager went out of his way to assist us daily, even picked out a great restaurant for us and stayed to make sure we were set. Also stayed at a Hapton in SoHo, new and amazing too. 
16591 We stayed here for one night. It is in a great location - close to everything. The rooms were nicely decorated, clean, very comfortable bed. The staff were so friendly. Would definitely recommend it is a great hotel in NYC that offers convenience and value for money. 
16592 Hotel con excelente ubicacion; salis y respiras Times Square, frente al M&M World. Muy buena atencion; en muchos idiomas; y excelente breakfast. 
16593 Milford Plaza was modern chic the location is the best of the best. The room was small but very clean and tres chic. We are in the heart of Time Square walking distance to everything exciting. The staff was friendly and professional. I truly enjoyed myself...SUPBERB LOCATION! 
16594 Desde a recepcao, que eu e minha familia chegamos mais cedo do que o check in, fomos bem recepcionados e a boa vontade dos funcionarios do housekeeping foram maravilhosos. Todo servico oferecido foram de excelente qualidade.Parabens! 
16595 Das Personal war unfreundlich und desinteressiert 
16596 Went to Texas City on business but stayed in Clear Lake. Hilton as always exceeded my expectations. Clean, comfortable, top shelf, what more can I say. Plus it's right across the street from Mission Control, which we visited and was awesome!!! 
16597 the room was small but clean. a little bit noise because of the air conditioning system in the courtyard. we had a good time 
16598 Great rates. A wonderful refurbished older building in a New York neighborhood filled with cafes and great shopping. Near Central Park West, Natural History Museum and convenient subway.Lovely fresh rooms, wonderful service and a staff that knocks themselves out for you. And the rates are great. 
16599 Located in bad neighborhood, no restaurants in walking distanste, front desk very slow and not very helpfull. Breakfast is a joke, the complementary coffee in the morning was cold and heated up for me in the microwave. Veding machines were empty my whole stay. 
16600 Excellent option in Houston, we paid 112 Dlls per night and it was GREAT, recently renewed, LCDs, amazing bed, good service and great location!!! 
16601 awesome rooms grear beds generous service- this hotel has it all 
16602 It was a great rate for NYC. I especially enjoyed the Yobot that stores ur luggage. The only thing I did not like was not having the ability to print from my laptop. The robes and shower gel/shampoo was amazing and a nice touch. 
16603 Bell'albergo in posizione strategica per visitare tutte le principali attrattive del centro di Chicago. Personale cordiale e molto disponibile. Ristorante annesso per la colazione. Parcheggio a pagamento nello stesso stabile. Attenzione che durante i periodi di fiere i prezzi come al solito lievitano. Una scelta che rifarei. 
16604 Stayed at this hotel a number of times, excellent location, comfortable large rooms. Would recommend. 
16605 Dont stay here ! We stayed up most of the night because of the noise in the next room 
16606 The staff didnt do much to help 
16607 It was a nightmare 
16608 i have stayed in this hotel ,, enjoyed alot,, the great thing in this hotel was it has a restaurant in the top floor touching the sky with delicious food and good ambience. the rooms were very neat and clean with a good service. 
16609 PUBLIC was the perfect spot for our gathering of a dozen women from around the country. Location was convenient to everything that we had on our "to-do" list. Rooms ranged from very good to great. Pump Room was fantastic! 
16610 Muse (part of fab Kimpton Hotels) is a super stay while in NYC. Best service in town - Lauren at front desk and David on the door great class acts - and the location is perfect for theater, food, anything. I will always choose Muse in NYC from now on. 
16611 I travel to Houston frequently and stay downtown. I've tried them all - this is the best. It can cost a little more - pay it, you'll be glad that you did. 
16612 It is time for Donald trump to buy this hotel and add some class, sad that such a terrible hotel is in such a great location. Not the best service in the world. 
16613 The hotel is great- very clean, well appointed, fabulous location. Rooms are not large (typical for NYC) but extremely well designed- they have everything laid out quite well (even a microwave and fridge!). The staff was A+- very helpful with advice. 
16614 Only the service at the hotel met our expectations. It was expensive considered what you could get for the money in the area, bad value for money, noisy, and the basic standard and cleanliness of the room was not 4* quality. Stay somewhere else! 
16615 Hi, just back. Room was small but for price really good. Room was hi spec with big tv and iPod connection. Bathroom great. Near to sub way, and breakfast places nearby. Also good bar, although a bit pricey. Would go back and highly recommended. 
16616 Great Value for Money in the heart of the village. Easy access to everything and although the affordable rooms are small they are good for what you need. 
16617 spent 3 nights in the West NYC May 24-27. Our first trip to NYC, was a little concerened about hotel room. Nothing to worry about here. Great room, great service, and above all perfect location, very central for everything. would stay her again. 
16618 Beautiful boutique hotel near Times Square. Sexy as hell! We didn't want to leave. Perfect accommodation for a romantic getaway. Contemporary, chic decor. Hip service. 
16619 If you want to bring your under 80 pound pet(s) along to NYC, this is the place! Price is very reasonable considering the ideal Times Square location. Staff: very pleasant/helpful! Room: not huge, but big enough and clean! Free wi-fi and efficient elevators (32 floors!) We will definitely come back! 
16620 Stayed here three nights in November 2006. I had stayed here before and knew that for the price... it was clean enough, no bugs, and that it was affordable for NYC. Location was great, close to subway, close to Central Park! 
16621 Spent a weekend here with my daughters and grandaughters for a family "Chick trip" Easy walks to anywhere. Two bedrooms with a full kitchen Nice Breakfast was great Couldn't ask for more! 
16622 This is a typical standard Hilton Garden Inn, lobby and rooms clean, good service, excellent internet speed. The Air Conditioner in the individual room is noisy, but it works! Easy access to I-10 freeway. 
16623 So pleased with our stay in Aug that we are returning in Dec! Walking distance to all major sights: Times Square, Central Park, Rock Center and Fifth Ave! Perfectly situated in Midtown. Clean, functional rooms in a boutique hotel with friendly service. Everyone made sure we enjoyed our stay. 
16624 SN is a small jewel. It has only 50 rooms and suites. Most or all are individually owned and furnished but run by the hotel. Rooms are recently renovated and are luxurious in traditional way. It is like having your own opulent apartment at the best location in NY. 
16625 Realmente es un excelente hotel, y el precio de otportunidad, me gustaria que lo vuelvan a repetir!!! no se arepentiran de asistir a este hotel. el unico inconveniente esque hay que hablar ingles todo el presonal de resepccion solo habla ingles..... 
16626 We were on the executive floor and had a wonderful room and great food and service. It is down the street from MOMA and a few blocks from the theater district and 5th Avenue. 
16627 Room upgrades or professional service. Forget it here. 
16628 I have stayed in the Kimberly hotel twice and have to say it has a lovely homely atmosphere. Its a perfect location for all the attractions. Have stayed in other New York hotels but this oned is by far the BEST!! 
16629 Stayed here for 4 nights February 2012. The hotel is in a fantastic location. Bedrooms and bathrooms could do a refit but it was clean & tidy. Only wanted some where to sleep and this place fit the bill for what we paid. Would stay here again. 
16630 Great Hotel. Everything you need. Close to all the Theaters and Times Square (only a 2 minute walk!). Very clean. Room was made uo every day with fresh towels etc. Friendly staff. Great bar on corner called "Social" if you are a sports fan! Food great there too. Highly reccommend! 
16631 A good and safe homebase in New York for Manhattan sightseeing, shopping and visiting shows. Carnegie Hall is in the same street. A place full of tradition (but also worn down furniture). Noisey neigbourhood. Breakfast is nice, service without significance. Take it if you get a reasonable rate. 
16632 I've stayed here several times. I love the large rooms that have 2 bathrooms, total waste of space when traveling alone but makes you feel like a princess. Food in the hotel is expensive but of course there are many options around. Starbucks is located in the lower lobby. 
16633 I stayed here 3 nights on business and will do so again. Quiet location, well kept, and stylish. Fantastic amenities for the price, robe, slippers, Aveda toiletries, minibar, and loads of HGTV. stations. Better than most NYC hotels in the same price range. 
16634 friendly staff, clean and updated rooms without damages, reasonable pricing 
16635 Hotel was fantastic, in a great neighborhood. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Rooms were big and nice for NY. Lounge was great. All in all, I would stay here again! 
16636 The hotel ws clean centrally located. The best thing was the staff, who bent over backwards to give us great service. I was great annd reasonably priced for all we got there. 
16637 Great hotel close to Times Square. Small but comfy room. Very easy to book at hotels website. Quick checkin/checkout. Nice value. 
16638 they gave away our room terrible service manager was vulger and rude he just kept screaming that thats all he has which was a smaller room for the same money They Ruined our new years 
16639 I came with my wife suzen for a weekend in NY and we had the best time! The location the hotel the room and speacily the bad all of them were absulotly perfect! 
16640 This Hotel is very very gooooooooood. There is a fantastic view in Times Square. Happy hour and cocktail very very good. The location is perfect, it's in Times Square with 1 minute you can arrive by walk in Broadway. The hotel's elevator are very nice like a space shuttle. 
16641 Stayed over April vacation, Convienent location inbetween Bryant Park and Times Square. Clean with Friendly staff. Great complimentary breakfast. Only problem was that the pull out was incomfortable. 
16642 Excellent service and amenities. The hotel staff was very accommodating and knowledgeable about the area. Close by shopping and dining made the stay even better with much to do when not in meetings. 
16643 we arrived in the hotel in a relatively small room but enough space for everything you can bring. we then got an upgrade to the suite which was amazing, had everything in there and was very comfortable! would definitely go there again! 
16644 Had a great time at this hotel, location is very close to major attractions in Manhattan, and just a couple of blocks away from Subway stations. Is an old hotel but is very good shape! Rooms are nice and clean! Bed was really good and the service was impeccable! 
16645 baest location best value for money dicent service lousy breakfast 
16646 This hotel lives up to the expected standards of the chain. I was totally satisfied in every aspect, from cleanliness, quiteness (despite being on 8th Ave), and service was impeccable. You can't go wrong staying here. 
16647 Busy loud expensive - but it's new York so no complaints. It was a nice stay and perfectly situated close to everything. 
16648 I spent many days there in different stays and overall I've got a very positive experience. Pros: location, attitude of the entire staff, restaurant, rooms size, beds very comfortable, nice bathrobes, great Sunday brunch. Cons: small pool area often crowdy, overpriced breakfast (no buffet option), need for a general "lifting". 
16649 I loved looking out the window at any time of the day and seeing Times Square alive and bustling with people. It made my first NYC experience a really good one. Very modern and well-decorated lobby. And the free cookies were delicious! 
16650 One of my favourite Westin in the world. Service is impeccable, lobby is spacious and relaxing. Rooms are clean and have all the modern facilities you can expect. Very quiet Nothing can beat the location, right in the heart of NYC. Heavenly beds are the best! 
16651 Ffor any hotel in this price category, $15 per night for WiFi, and $14 for a drink-is just sleazy. And AT&T is almost impossible to make calls from the room. 
16652 Loved this hotel! Nice rooms. It has alot of great and quite funny history.. Very New York. 
16653 Stayed over night on a weekend. Very clean and spacious room. Service was great and the Sunday brunch was very good as well. Couldn't ask for a better location. 
16654 servizio inesistente, pulizia e camere da dimenticare, colazioni ok, nel complesso non lo cosiglierei. 
16655 This hotel is really small but clean and comfortable. Breakfast was basic but good, small crowded breakfast room, get there early. Great location, walk through central park to 5th avenue, subway 2 mins around corner. Great restaraunts close by, I would stay here again. 
16656 I LOVE THIS HOTEL!! Service- Excellent Room- Phenominal! Resteraunt- Perfecto! Everything Else- Wonderful When I woke up I pressed a button on this remote and the curtains opened to a wonderful view of NYC! I would recomend this hotel to ANYONE!! Chrissy Taylor 
16657 Would stay here again loved being so close to Central Park and the museums. Much quieter than the Times Square area. Great for couples our butler was wonderful. 
16658 This hotel exceeded my expectations. The room was very clean and the beds very comfortable. The bathroom had very nice fixtures, soft luxurious towels and was very clean. If I have to stay in Houston again, this will be my first choice. Breakfast was very good also! :) 
16659 Tutto ok per questo hotel: unico neo una piccola disavventura capitata ai nostri compagni viaggio: avevano " smarrito" un paio di orecchini ma e' bastata una segnalazione alla reception per ritrovarli 
16660 Definitely different from the hotels I have stayed at in a sense that it was not your typical hotel. It was very colorful and every room has a different theme. It is right next to the Galleria which was good for us. 
16661 A beautiful hotel, loved the lobby, ballroom, atmosphere and breakfast. 
16662 Our son lives in NYC therefore we visit on a fairly regular basis. After staying at many other hotels, this one was far superior and will definitely be the place we will look to for our future visits! 
16663 The managing is a problem, but the rooms will be cleaned up if you asked them a couple of times. You could stay there for a week. Just a week! 
16664 Wow!! This hotel definitely knows how to take care of their guest. Within walking distance of the Statue of Liberty and Ground Zero. The staff was more than helpful. We had an amazing room with a view of the Hudson. 
16665 Had a great time at the Gansevoort for a one night surprise stay. The meat packing district was a great time, followed by express entry to the upstairs patio lounge/club. The room itself was spacious wit h a great view of the river. 
16666 It was a great location, to shows and time square. The stores and restaurants were also very good near the hotel. The beds are very nice and comfortable. The hotel customer service is top notch. We will stay there again. 
16667 buona la posizione, per il resto da non consigliare - camera standard piccola e molto rumorosa - fila al check in e per qualsiasi servizio al banco (servizio di cassetta di sicurezza direttamente al banco check in senza privacy) 
16668 Just a half block norh of Chinatown is just right for me and my Son - we both love Chinese food. Great property in mist of everything great about Manhattan - Soho, Greenwich Village, Financial District and of course Chinatown. Rooms were excellent and the staff was first class. 
16669 The hotel was in the perfect spot..right in between Magnificent Mile and Navy Pier. It truly was the best value in the area. The hotel had been updated, but there were a few minor things that still need some work. Very modern decor as well. 
16670 Great service. Great rooms. Lots of nice little perks such as happy hours, a free shuttle service around downtown, breakfast, and milk and cookies. The staff is courteous, knowledgeable and helpful. I will stay here again when I'm in Houston. 
16671 Stayed with my husband and two adult son. fantastic hotel ,fun and great atmosphere.great staff and very helpful,rooms were lovely with great views from our corner cabin. This hotel is very different from the traditional hotels that i have been in before so go try, theres everything you want here. 
16672 Hotel rooms are incredibly spacious with great views from higher levels. Location is central and ideal for NY. Service is everything you would expect at a hotel like this - every free shoe shine overnight! You pay for all this but a great experience. 
16673 My husband and I stayed here in Spetember- Excellent location, high standard room, very friendly and helpful staff! We had a very comfortable stay, this is a small hotel that provide a warm, welcoming stay. I would definatly stay here again, you will not be disappointed! 
16674 i was pleasantly surprised at the nice rooms. very clean and updated. but most of all, i appreciated the customer service. the shuttle driver and the guy at the front desk was super nice and extremely helpful! thanks so much! 
16675 My friends and I stayed at the Ritz from Jan 12-15 and we could not have been happier!! The room, the service, and the location could not have been better. Book the concierge level, it's worth the money!! We can't wait to stay there again next January. 
16676 Enjoyed first stay to NY at the Bedford. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel was older but clean. The location was really great. Loved being close to Grand Central Terminal. Walked to Macy's, ESB, and many other places. 
16677 Great experience. Clean and very comfy. Close to Rockefeller center and decent but fun walk to time's square. 12 types of pillows and kids had fun ordering all types during our 4 night stay. Food at the hotel restaurant was the best we had the whole trip. 
16678 Nice hotel. Not the best W I've seen but it is nice. Staff is great. Concierge Eden was helpful. I recommend it. The rooms are nice and big. Nothing super luxury but it is nice and feels like a W hotel ! 
16679 Everyone is very friendly, and always willing to go the extra mile, the rooms are clean and comfortable 
16680 Was there for a week and what a great stay. Friendly staff, great room, loved the fitness centre and the location was superb. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT and will stay again, hopefully soon. 
16681 I have stayed several times at the Hudson and looking forward to coming back ASAP and the Hotel is always amazing excelent crowd, but the best thing is the contact I have there Jerry Mac, this guy make you feel like in home! thanks Hudson! 
16682 hotel was lovely, room was huge. we had a veiw of times square dat was fab coz we wer on a high floor. def stay der again. novotels r a good chain anyway, stayn in one in liverpool it was fab 2 
16683 We stayed one night and were very pleased with our entire experience! Our only complaint would be waiting for an open elevator Sunday morning during checkout. We watched 4 full elevators pass before being able to get on. Other than that we couldn't ask for a better stay. 
16684 The room is cozy and i feel comfortable there. I love the bed and liners, The memory was interesting.... The location is wonderful! Just walk for a few mitutes and we can get to the Times Square. 
16685 I'm very impressed! The location, space, and price make it a lot better than staying outside of Manhattan. I highly recommend this hotel. I enjoy coming to New York and next time I will stay here again. 
16686 The location is convenient to theatre district. Rooms have good space. The staff are nice and receptive. Excellent brakfast. High speed free internet. Of all the hampton inn properties in New York city, this seems to be the best. 
16687 De ligging van het hotel is perfect (vlak bij Central Park en de subway. Het hotel zelf is middelmatig. Alles netjes hoor, maar een beetje bedompt en lichtelijk afgeragd. Het voelde een beetje als "vergane glorie". Desalniettemin hebben we er prima verbleven en was het schoon en relatief ruim. 
16688 Room was comfy, a tad small but clean. My wife liked the bed very much but I like them a little softer. The staff was GREAT, very friendly and professional would stay here on our next trip to the theartre 
16689 Great hotel, friendly staff and great area to be in! I'll stay here next time! 
16690 Had a wonderful stay at the wellington hotel. rooms clean tidy. staff polite and helpful. Food and room service very good. Locacation amazing 3 minutes from central park 10 mins walk to time square amazing place. 
16691 This hotel is very clean, room are nicely appointed, and the staff is professional and friendly. My stay was so good that I have already booked this hotel for my next trip to NYC. 
16692 We were close to everything via sub way. Desk was very helpful and friendly. No air conditioning in our room but with the window fan very pleasant. Thanks West End Studios, ROCK 
16693 Excellent hotel, situated in a very good place. Very clean, with an extremely comfortable room and an excellent staff team, specially Kris, Latoya, Caprice, Sal and Jackie. Thank you all for everything. 
16694 I frequent NYC, stayed at several hotels. This hotel offers pretty spacious rooms, comfy beds. Hotel staff is very friendly! Short walk to Grand Central and PJ Clarks. Great prices under $200.oo off season. 
16695 Nice hotel. Great service, nice view, nice room. It's off the Mag Mile by a few blocks and the street is very empty after dark. Other than that, it's great. 
16696 Would recommend this hotel for those having to catch an early flight from IAH. The shuttle service is free and excellent. Rooms are very clean and fairly large. 
16697 Great hotel great staff very friendly good service and great location handy to grand central station walk to central park subway near by This is my third time to this hotel in past twelve months I have always found it to be a great hotel 
16698 Beautiful hotel, lovely spacious clean rooms, fantastic service, fabulous location = amazing. Staying at the NY Palace with three friends and we are very impresse. Will stop again and would recommend to all. 
16699 Great location. Room was comfortable and clean. Staff was pleasant and helpful. Will stay again! 
16700 Very nice hotel, with strong price/quality relation. Big, comfortable an clean room with also very clean bathroom. Great location, 5 minutes walk to times square. In my measure, a 4 star hotel. 
16701 Found this Hotel through Trip Advisor. It was clean and the staff were wonderful. $197/night in this area was a steal. 
16702 I had a great stay at the Holiday Inn. The location is very central. The staff was pleasant and even let us check in early. They had a guest computer that was very helpful when mapping out locations and finding events. Modern and very clean rooms. 
16703 After a long international flight and a layover no thanks to United Airlines. The Windgate on 1330 N Sam Houston Pkwy E, Houston, TX was a great place to stay the night after a long day of traveling. Great price, great rooms, great everything. 
16704 We had a great experience! Booked through expedia and got a great price. Location is perfect - blocks from Times square and subway! Breakfast was amazing - 7:30 - 10 a.m.! Service was impressive. We highly recommend this hotel. 
16705 Nice room with excellent view of Times Square. Lots of food choices and shops in the hotel. Very nice concierge lounge for rewards members. 
16706 I was there for a wedding weekend. We had a suite along with many other of the wedding guest. Suite was roomy. I loved the size of the suite and loved the bathroom. Breakfast choices and food was exceptional. The cost for the suite was the pleasant surprise. 
16707 Service was Great! Location is wonderful. Lobby is spectacular! Have a drink there and enjoy the atmosphere. 
16708 Great location, nice staff,Large rooms by NYC standards- They even had our room ready fro check in at 9:30 AM!!!!! Wow.- Great breakfasts in Norma's - ( bu a tad on the expensive side) 
16709 Really great place to stay. Facilities are excellent, location is convenient. The staff are very helpful. I was hoping for a bit more help getting tickets from the concierge. Would definately stay again. 
16710 The location is perfect that it is closer to the Penn station. Opp Madison Square garden and almost at the heart of New york. Closer to Empire Estate and times square as well. A lot of shopping options available. 
16711 The room was large comfortable beds! When you walk in front door you feel like you've just entered an enchanting place! 
16712 Perfect price/quality level. Free wireless internet, great comfort in room. Great pick up service from airport and drop of at restaurant later on. Closest good quality hotel to the airport. Only one minus: Shower in bath with curtain. I prefer just a shower and no curtain. 
16713 Wunderbares 1 Class Hotel. Wir hatten ein tolles Zimmer im 53 Sock mit Blick auf das Rockefeller Center. Die Betten waren sehr bequem und alles war sehr sauber. Personal freundlich und zuvorkommend. Die Lage ist absolut praktisch, man ist schnell in ganz New York. 
16714 Great location for the South Shore Line and the Shedd Aquarium. Our room was emmaculate as was the lobby. The bed was very comfortable...wish I could have brought it home with me. Staff was friendly and helpful. 
16715 Stayed 2 nites at Hotel Mela before a cruise and loved it. Great location, friendly staff, right in the middle of Times Square. Room was decorated funky gotta love Boutique Hotels. Will defintely stay again next time in the Big Apple. 
16716 Outstanding hotel - great location, good healthy food options and excellent assistance from the personal trainer at the workout facility. 
16717 It was a great experience!! Excelent location and services! Close to a lot of turist options and to an important subway line to all NY. The staff is amazing, especially Elizabeth who was in charge of our stay. I recommend. 
16718 This hotel is centrally located and gives easy access to all of Manhattan's attractions/ Great rooms and great staff 
16719 I confess to being dubious about this hotel, but the reviews are correct---it is a great place. Out of the way there in Murray Hill, it is close to many sites and yet maintains a good tranquility. Would I stay there again? Recommend it? Yes! 
16720 Fabulous central location, helpful, polite, friendly and knowledgeable staff. The room was spacious, clean and comfortable (2 double beds). The handy kitchenette and 24 hour store next door were a real bonus! We are returning next year and will stay here again. Amazing value for money 10/10. 
16721 We stayed 1 week in Yotel and it was great. Clean, cool atmosphere, good location. Crew very gentle. Maybe the family room is a little bit too small We'll come back ! 
16722 We spent one night in NYC and the hotel was very good. The staff was friendly, the location is good, the room and hallways were clean (but very small) and the price was reasonable for NYC. We paid about $160 plus tax. 
16723 My truck was broken into on the first night, and I recieved no help from the staff. Locals refer to the area as "Gunspoint"... not Greenspoint. 
16724 The worse bullying hotel management I have even seen. Rude, dishonest, and repulsive. I have traveled over a 120 night a year for the last decade and this is the first time I have even walked out of a place. DISGUSTING 
16725 Stayed over for a wedding. Great central location , with best wedding meal I have ever had! Top notch! International clientele , Davidoff cigar shop nearby and Starbucks. Across from PINKS custom shirts, Touneau watches, and the view of St. Patrick's spires from our 34th room windows was fantastic! 
16726 Subway at the corner, not far from Time Square, great location, very clean. Loved my nights there ! 
16727 We visited Le Parker Meridien recently with a special rate from quickbook. The extremely gracious staff upgraded us to a king room with a view of Central Park. The room was stylish and immaculate. Very quiet, and just a fun place to stay. I recommend it highly! 
16728 The Grand Hyatt is a fine faculity and is particularly well set up for the business traveller. Location is good and the service and facilities are good. 
16729 I would gladly miss my flight again if the consequences involve staying here, again. The in-house restaurant had some pretty good food (nachos). Check-in was quick and the room was fantastic! I enjoyed the complimentary mouth wash as well as the soft towels, adequate water pressure, and comfortable bed. 
16730 Although the rooms are small, I found this to be a lovely small hotel in a good location 
16731 The employees were always friendly and helpful. It's also a nice place and the location is alwesome. 
16732 This is my headquarters for the complete NYC experience when I am in the city. Great value when you consider you get Hilton quality combined with good size rooms and a location that is ideal for the tourist and business traveler too. 
16733 This was my second visit to this hotel, being an hilton honours member i got a free upgrade and a late check out. It was well located and a very comfy and cozy room, great food and lots to see around 
16734 As the other reviewers mentioned, the location of this hotel is great. The hotel and rooms are nice, but basic. The second floor has a nice lounge with complimentary wi-fi. The hotel was fairly quiet and the limited staff was friendly. 
16735 Definitely a good place to stay. Try to get the best price you can and make sure you are a spg member. 
16736 .Albergo ottimo,stanze spaziose,pulite,arredate in maniera elegante.Posizione fantastica per girare e per fare shopping.A due passi da Rockefeller e dalla 5 Ave.Nelle vicinanze tantissimi posti dove mangiare.Elena da Palermo 
16737 At first we were a little weary about the doors being on the outside, but we were pleasantly surprised! Nice, clean rooms, comfy beds, a flat screen TV, and really nice staff! They even served Texas shaped waffles! It was a really nice place, would stay there again. 
16738 With all the lovely hotels in Chicago there is no reason to stay here. My room was not a suite and there was no kitchenette. The lighting was outrageously bad and the decor is too ugly for words. The hotel attracts loud groups so beware. 
16739 Fantastic boutique hotel in the heart of New York - about 10 minutes walk to 5th Avenue. Great restaurant on the ground floor as well. Staff superb 
16740 The staff treat you very special, and show their appreciation for you choosing their hotel. Very rare to see such customer service and appreciation towards the customer. The bellmen, Jubar starts off the experience of welcome that makes you feel you are the most important person in the world! 
16741 Had another great time at TheStandard NYC. Front desk person Amal Bijou was fantastically nice and helpful during my stay. She rocks. Front Desk Manager Paul Kashman was also very helpful. 
16742 This was my second stay and just as the first, it was great. Convenient, clean, quiet and good service. The little bar was great with friendly staff. Will definitely stay here again! 
16743 This hotel is a rundown dump. The first room they gave me was a tenement flop house and the second room like a cheap, old motel. The staff is barely interested in helping with anything. I will not stay here again. 
16744 Beautiful art deco hotel, Lobby amazing.Cleanest rooms i've seen Yes the restaurants are pricey but good,try Oscars for breakfast.Excellent location. Ignore the negative reviews just book it you wont regret it. 
16745 We had a trip to new York, niagara during long week end & stayed in Marriot Hotel. We enjoyed the stay in hotel because of the entertainments provieded in the hotel room.even my 2 years old kid also enjoyed sraying that hotel 
16746 this is, by far, the best hotel for: location, service, attention, friendliness, accessability and comfort!! everyone, from the bellhop to the concierge, to the bar/restaurant folks were attentive, caring, and the desk people were the nicest we've come across ever!! we'll never stay anywhere else, whether for business or pleasure! 
16747 This is a 4 star hotel. Rooms were very small. We were on the 10th floor noise from outside sounded as if we were on the 1st floor. Would not stay here again 
16748 The Dream Hotel is ideally located in New York City. The staff are excellent,it is spotless and we will certainly return. 
16749 Tea at the Plaza (very expensive!!!!) may have been the best moment of my daughter's life. They really play up the "Eloise" theme, and it was so fun. The rooms were very spacious, with gilded gold fixtures. Great location, service, and people watching, especially in the "Rose Bar" at night. 
16750 Great location, loads of good places to eat nearby. Friendly staff, clean rooms. Wifi speed was also good. Would stay here again. Only minor issue was the window mounted aircon unit was very noisy. 
16751 We have stayed in many hotels in New York city for business, but Hotel Mela is the best of them all. Excellent is the mark in every catagory. 
16752 Unique check-in experience and although the room was small, it was adequate for my business travel. Also the location is outstanding. 
16753 very impressed with this hotel, and its staff - would recommend it to anyone! 
16754 I have stayed at this hotel dozens of times over the past 7 years and have had only very positive experiences. The staff is very friendly and accomodating, location is wonderful. All of my friends from both this country and Europe stay there and love it. 
16755 I had a good experience whilst here. I would recommend going here. Just avoid room 104. I had my first 3 - way there. 
16756 Everything you would expect from a place where the legendary Gordon Ramsey places his name. Superb across the board! 
16757 Good hotel in a great location. Rooms quiet, clean and the bed was very comfortable. Diner opposite good too. Not far from 72nd st station. Highly recommended. 
16758 room tiny but chic breakfast a joke pay for breakfast or use free token & get treated like nobody !!!!!!!!!!!!! be WARNED 
16759 Wir waren im Mai 4 Naechte in diesem Hotel und hochzufrieden. Schickes Design, nicht zu laut trotz Lage mitten im Meat Packing district. Tolle, sehr angesagte roof top bar! 
16760 Hotel is great, large rooms, clean and quick service. Special thanks for the guest manager elizabeth cacovic, who has made our stay wonderfull. The best is the location, in the middle of where it all happens. Perfect stay! And a real reccomandable hotel 
16761 It was our first trip to New York City. The hotel was in a great location, friendly staff, clean rooms and great breakfast buffet. We would definitely stay there again. 
16762 I love the W in Manhattan! It's a fun, hip place to be and stay! I always have the best time. 
16763 Love this hotel. It creates quite a swank mood. They accept pets. It's walking distance to everything, including Bryant Park (Fashion Week). Staff is nice. Breakfast. And, I found out later that they even have DJs. 
16764 Fun location in heart of Chelsea, room was clean and comfortable, front desk staff friendly and helfpul. The room has what you need including a good bed, cable TV, plasma on wall and a roomy bathroom (for Manhattan). I'd stay here again. 
16765 This hotel was a good value for what we paid. Nice location, close to subway and train station. Small room but had a fully equipped kitchen (full size fridge) and bedroom & bath were renovated nicely. 
16766 A marvellous hotel in every way - very quiet and steps away from Battery Park and the ferry. Staff amazingly friendly and helpful. Thank you all for making our stay wonderful - Kath and Steve 
16767 cerca de todo, la ubicacion es perfecta, la limpieza regular y lo unico inconveniente es la conexion a internet que es paga, por lo que el lobby es dificil de transitar debido a la cantidad de personas que utilizan internet, ya que es la unica zona donde es gratis. 
16768 The moment you leave the front door, your in the middle of pushy crowds. Stay one or two blocks out. 
16769 We loved the hotel, the location, and the Starbucks in the hotel. We were at Times Square near theaters, subways, tour buses, and restaurants. The hotel personnel were friendly and helpful, and our room was quiet, very clean, and comfortable. 
16770 Room was a bit small, and the hotel is very impersonal. Wouldn't recommend, although the concierge was very helpful. 
16771 Very friendly staff...easy access to the subway, within walking distance to Central Park. 
16772 very convenient location. Nice to have pool with kids. Weber restaurant in hotel has great kids' meals. 
16773 I spent a week here, shopping and resting, while my daughter worked nearby. The staff can't do enough for you and, yes, the door man is excellent. The pool service was great. Just a totally brilliant hotel. 
16774 Terrific hotel close to everything: theaters, grand central station & connecting trains, MOMA. Room was spacious with large couch, fireplace & huge sunken tub. Friendly, efficient staff. Attractive lobby with lots of seating areas so you never feel overwhelmed by lots of people. Would definitely stay there again. 
16775 Stayed for 3 nights, no complaints. Room was clean, yes could use update but for price and location is exactly what we were looking for and would not hesitate to stay again. 
16776 The Westin was a great experience. From the check-in, through to the room and the service, everything was above expectations. Also, the location was particularly convenient. I certainly reccommend this hotel. 
16777 great staff at the front desk, great location. but a little disappointed by the restaurant menu (entrance at the 45th street side) 
16778 I stay there twice a month and I get the best deal on price with comfort, accessibility nice ammenities of the hotel. Right size pool and hot tub. Very nice breakfast buffet for a price. 
16779 Great hotel in great location right in the heart of times square. 
16780 Hall and room rugs very dirty. Lights and radio did not work. Even if I could plug clock in it was too complicated. Maids in the AM very noisy. 
16781 Just returned from a stay at The San Carlos, 10/04. Each member of the staff that we had contact with were friendly and very helpful. I would highly recommend you try it out. 
16782 Good, great experience. You feel history there. In some parts should be renewed and refurbished but I think it's the price of history. To be suggested. 
16783 We like Kimpton Hotels and this one was perfect. Location is fun and convenient to activites and public transportation -- we use buses and subways in NYC. Lovely rooms, polite staff, comfortable lobby. 
16784 This hotel is in a great location right off Broadway. Perfect for going to the theatre. We had a nice room and it was a good size. A good deal for the money. 
16785 I stayed here because the location was perfect. The room was small, but still met my needs. The club in the lobby seems very popular. There was some exterior noise late at night, but it didn't bother me. The soaps and toilet amenities were nice. 
16786 The hotel is very plain with not much to offer. The room is decent but needs to be updated. The lobby also needs some work. This time of the year, you need to wear a snowmobile suit in the lobby. On a positive note, the hotel has a great location. 
16787 The hotel is beautiful and so close to all the activities -shopping, Radio City, Times Square, Rockerfeller Center, etc. They offer very good food and great service. The rooms and the view of St. Patricks and NYC are wonderful! I stay there whenever I can and have never been disappointed. 
16788 The Plaza IS New York. From the moment you enter the grand lobby and reception area you are swept up in a bygone era of etiquette and glamour. The rooms are the perfect getaway to life outside the walls of the beautiful hotel. Service is impeccable. 
16789 Een perfect hotel qua ligging. Direct om de hoek van Times square, midden in het theatre district. Prima uitvalsbasis om de stad te ontdekken. Het hotel is modern ingericht en de kamer was zeer comfortabel en schoon. Ook het personeel was erg vriendelijk. Kortom een echte aanrader. 
16790 Elizabeth, the hotel manager is very helpful! talk to her if you have any problem! great person. The hotel has a perfect localization, and it's near everything! Near the central park, near times square and just two blocks away from 5th ave. 
16791 Had a great 6 days here. The location is very close to Bryant Park which was a very nice place to have lunch with a free wifi connection. Bathrooms in the hallway but worked out just fine. Wasn't cheap but for NYC it was a good price. 
16792 Terriffic, clean rooms!!!! Very comfortable beds!!!!!! 
16793 Klein (maar 12 verdiepingen) en knus hotel in hartje van Manhattan. Goede service, schone en nette kamers welke van alle gemakken zijn voorzien. Een aanrader voor een weekendje New York, dichtbij bezienswaardigheden en op loopafstand (ca. 5 min.) van een metrolijn. 
16794 Stopped here a couple of years ago, well located for Times square, Central park and subway Hotel basically a room only residence and getting a bit frayed around the edges, huge room and bathroom but needs updating But for price and locality not bad value 
16795 This hotel has the most beautiful rooms, freindly and helpful staff and just a high class feel and atmosphere. 
16796 Good budget hotel. The staff was friendly, Great location. Room too small for family. Would recommend for couple in a room with private bathroom. 
16797 Good in all aspects. Luxury, confort and correct relation quality/price 
16798 I had read a few disturbing reports, but these proved to be false, could not have asked for better, room was great, location was great and the staff were really friendly. I will have no problems recommending this hotel to my friends, and I will certainly stay there again. 
16799 Fairly good size, comfortable room. We got a view that faced into the ventilation shaft, not too pleasant. The carpet was dirty, but other than that it was fine. Corporate rate makes it competitively priced. 
16800 Stayed 2 nights last week and was amazed at the quality of this recently opened hotel. Rooms are very spacious, Nespresso machines, service is impeccable as is room service! Downtown location is very convenient so don't hesitate! 
16801 Fiquei com duas amigas, o quarto e impossivel de ficar, o cafe da manha roubo. O hotel fedia a fumaca de maconha. Nem Louca eu me hospedaria novamente ali 
16802 Great hotel,spot on location,very helpful staff,very clean,free coffee and tea,mini bar and breakfast expensive but are nt they always ....plenty of diners on doorstep for breakfast. Loved every minute of New york and will return here next time we visit 
16803 I enjoyed staying in this handy place with good quality hotel. However the lobby was not well adapted to the Comfort inn series. Staff had a very good and welcoming attitude. Slightly expensive for what you get but Ok. Breakfast was great. 
16804 Nice hotel in New York City around the corner of 42 street and only 10 minutes away from Time Square. Perfect for a stay in New York and the breakfast is included the room rates !!! Hotel next to the bus Terminal and a subway station. 
16805 Aside from good location, this hotel has not much appeal. Front desk lacked basic hospitality skills and room was dull and bathroom was ridiculously small. Air con almost an antique piece. 
16806 I would recommend it. I liked pretty much everything. Maybe the view was not excellent, and the room was a little bit small. Bed very comfortable. Service very good. There is also a room with video games! (but closed in early morning). Good for young travelers, although it's not super-cheap. 
16807 The staff is very polite and the rooms are very clean and confortable! I recomend to everybody! 
16808 Good for business trip or vacation since it is located in the magnificent mile, walking distance to several restaurants and atractions, right in front of the lake. Concierge and reception are extremely helpful, such as all the staff. 
16809 Enjoyed a long weekend in NYC at the Eventi. Great customer service, quaint clean room, nice bathroom, and the evening reception on the patio proved to be a great touch! 
16810 The best of this hotel its the location and the price. The rooms are small, basic but clean. The location is great. It's located very close to Times Square. 
16811 No Breakfast and Really bad restaurant BUT Great service and very nice bedroom. Very Comfortable beds! 
16812 anders als angegeben,war alles sauber und der Service o.k. Supernah zur Tube 
16813 We had a great time! Everything was wonderful - nice room, good service, great location. Hoping to return soon. 
16814 i had a very pleasant experience when i stayed at this hotel. The staff was extremely helpful and the room was VERY clean! I loved the location and will definitely return! 
16815 elegante, funzionale, camere piccole ma attrezzate. brunch super e super aperitivi e stuzzichini vista mozzafiato veloce check in e check out zero tasse con expedia mai utilizzato l'angolo caffe ma avevano di tutto ci tornerei subito volentieri. personale gentilissimo e disponibile. servizio taxi con risparmio se chiamati dagli addetti hotel 
16816 My wife and I stayed at the Whitehall for 5 nights at the end of September. We found our stay extremely comfortable, loved the amenities and the staff most helpful. We will be back! 
16817 Location is great and staff are helpful but some rooms are uncomfortably small. Be careful about booking and check that room is not described as standard. Bigger and cheaper rooms are available within 2 blocks. 6-11th December 2011 
16818 Nothing remarkable, but perfectly fine if you can get a good rate 
16819 Fantastic location, friendly staff, great price. The rooms are very simple (know this going in and you'll be fine). The location (right near Union Square), price and the excellent staff make this place a great choice. I would totally stay here again. 
16820 We booked this hotel for a girls weekend in NYC and will definitely stay here again. Great location, helpful staff, and around the corner from the subway. The rooms were clean, bed was comfy, and they were more than accommodating to our unique needs.Two thumbs up! 
16821 I stayed for two nights. Subway station is just one block away. It is very convient to walk to Central park, Broadway and MOMA mesuem. Everything was OK except Bed. Bed wasn't comportable. 
16822 Stayed here with 17 year old grandson. Fantastic location, as we came into Penn Station and the hotel is right around the corner. Very friendly and helpful staff. 
16823 We stayed at the Grand Hyatt. What an Incredible view we had,. Would also recommend upgrading to the Grand Club., Wonderful breakfast selections and Hors deuvres. Our concierge in the Grand Club actually surprised us with free tickets to see Tosca at the Metropolitan Opera house 
16824 Flight arrives at 11:15pm. I call to ask to be picked up, they tell me the shuttle stops at 11:00. $15 cab ride. I arrive at the hotel, and they tell me that the only rooms available are smoking rooms. Had the non-smoking reservation for months ahead of time. Unacceptable. 
16825 this is an excellent hotel by the standards of both Sofitel and midtown New York: clean and quiet. Quite varied clientele. 
16826 Convinient - stayed for business, fun lobby. The burger at the Breslin in amazing. They need better hair dryers in the room though. 
16827 Cindy at the front desk was excellent new how to make me feel great from the beginging 
16828 I have stayed at this hotel twice on mini vacations to NYC. The location is great for Times Square and the theatre district. The free breakfast is excellent. Free coffee all the time. The staff is very friendly and helpful. It is always clean. Thanks, D. Watts 
16829 Since we arrived to the hotel at 11 am the service was unforgettable. we arrived 3 hours before check in and eventhoug they should not have they gave us the room. The rooms were nice and we had an incredible, yet unforgettable time. 
16830 200 dollars for 4 nights, between 2, on 5th avenue,10 mins from time square!!!!! If you want cheap and cheerful, no frills but in a fantastic location...ideal......if you intend to spend anytime actually in the hotel other then sleeping or washing, go elsewhere!!! 
16831 Marty, the duty manager, could not do enough to help us. Unlike many hotel managers, he was always walking around his hotel, assisting his guests. Staff were very friendly & eager to please. Huge room, if dated. Great location. Would stay again. Stuart & Judith T. 
16832 The hotel is located right next to the WTC, close to the metro and battery park. Its brand new, rooms are small but comfortable. Only problem is the construction which is 24/7, although on sunday they rest at night. 
16833 Work chose the hotel. I wouldn't stay again. Nothing dramatically wrong with it just very dated and dark - bedroom especially dark with poor lighting. 
16834 great location, and spacious rooms by new york standards. great for families with small kids when you need a little more space. would stay here again in an instant 
16835 Beautiful lobby. Dated rooms. If you don't mind a small bathroom, the convenient location more than makes up for it. With the proximity to Grand Central, it's easy to get anywhere. 
16836 Absolutely outstanding/ Very clean, willing staff/ room service and the concierge knows everything about anything. Great location/ view from the rooms and lobby. The rooms are all exceptionally clean with very comfortable beds. Had an amazing stay and will definitely go back the next time I visit new york. 
16837 We really enjoyed our two nights at the Kitano. It was a really calm, relaxing place, in a good location (couple of minutes from Grand Central Station). I would definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. 
16838 Incredibly friendly and obliging staff - an oasis in the hustle and bustle of the city. Very conveniently situated to walk to the village or hop on a subway uptown. Comfortable beds in spacious room. Coffee and tea complimentary at reception. Couldnt have asked for more! 
16839 Excellent and discreet. This is a secret i'm reluctant to share. A little Victorian for the groovy crowd. 
16840 hotel was nice, room was a little on the small side but everything was clean. bed was comfortable, sheets were nice. 
16841 I think Motel 6 actually has larger rooms than this hotel, BUT the room was immaculately clean. The location is great and perfect for 2 people who are on the go. 
16842 Stayed at the hotel in March and again in August. Hotel is a boutique hotel with decent sized rooms. Great location and great service. 
16843 Stayed here to meet friends in the city. Got a good deal on the room, it was clean. Nothing exciting, but a decent place to sleep 
16844 A compact well located hotel, nothing special or great but very functional. Staff are friendly and helpful, rooms are a little small but work, air-con be a little noisy. Good place for leisure visits, only two blocks from the subway 
16845 This was the second time staying at the Palace and again very pleased. Rooms are a nice size, clean and beds are very comfortable. The staff is very attentive and the location of the hotel is great for shopping and walking around. 
16846 We had two rooms, and the price was great for the neighborhood. Very good restaurants were all within walking distance, as well as the subway and Broadway. The rooms were nothing special, but they were clean and the service was friendly. 
16847 Rude girl at check-in, noisy aircon, small rooms... Helpgul guys on the first floor - concierges - good location and I will stay in Soho again, but not at the Holiday Inn... 
16848 We came jan 1st very unhappy with orginal room very helpful to get things right we had a wonderful stay close to my favorite Deli the Crave and my love Starbucks which was close and lots of resturants snd the theaters this is a wondervul hotel 
16849 Room size small, Tiny closet,TV not mant channels, No Ice machine, Bar stools were hard on your back and butt. Staff was cluless were anything is (ie tic tock dinner and so on!). Very Loud outside. heater was very loud also. 
16850 Prima hotel op Times Square.Fantastisch uitzicht vanuit de hotelkamer. De luxe kamer is ruim met een voor hotelbegippen enorme Flatscreen TV. Minpunt, check in time is 3.00 p.m. we konden pas om 5.15 p.m. op onze kamer. 
16851 I am sorry to say that this hotel has the most unfriendly front desk staff. Not at all service minded and it seems that they are just there to get paid. 
16852 This is my first time visiting New York.The location is out of this word.Port authority is only one block away.That was very convenient for my friend and I to take a bus.Besides,this hotel also provide american breakfast.I love that!!!The staff there are very helpful.Not to mention the price is cheap. 
16853 Great hotel staff, attentive and courteous. Rooms clean and large for a W hotel. Would stay here again if I wanted to stay in Times Square 
16854 Excellent hotel - walking distance to empire state building and Times square. Would definly stay here again !!! loved it. 
16855 I was treated poorly by the service staff. No assistance whatsoever with baggage, etc. I liked my room, but was angry over the way I was treated and thus did not enjoy my stay. I will never stay there again. 
16856 We've spent Christmas time in NY, it's unforgetable! The hotel took part in it. Great location, good services and confotable. I'll never forget the Chistmas carols that was playing all the time... It was so deep and romantic. Kisses to my lovely wife... Best Regards. 
16857 The hotel was in a great location, just walking distance from the theatres. The staff was friendly and there was free water, champaigne, coffee, and hot chocolate. The hotel was very clean with a modern decor feel to it. This hotel can be for anyone. 
16858 Bedbugs, brown water from the facet, toilet 8 inches away from the wall (about half the space you get on a plane toilet) room size that makes space travel a treat, two colleagues would give the same review, one of my best "hotel from hell" stories. Thanks. 
16859 Typical Marriott, room service is good though. They're doing some work on the elevators, some delay, but not too much. 
16860 good hotel. Staff acknowledged the do not disturb on door. Lounge upstairs was fun if not a bit pricey ( 14 dollar drinks ). Free day pass to Equinox is the best. 
16861 Rated one of the top 10 restrooms in the country, each bathroom is a "muse". 
16862 Good choice in NY. Centrally located between Midtown/Upper East & West sides and Greenwich Village, Downtown etc. Good value for the price. Staff is personable and helpful. The concierge was able to nail down some hard to get reservations. 
16863 Rooms are very nice size, even including walk-in closet. Super cold a/c. Any problem is addressed immediately. Very nice bar in lobby. Very friendly staff from housekeeping to bartenders. Very good fitness facility. 
16864 For the money, this is a decent hotel. Location was great, staff was helpful enough to get me in and out. The place definitely needs some upgrading and cleaning up, but again, for the money, I would stay there again next time I'm in Chicago. 
16865 Very small room that smelt musty. Great location but not worth the price, much better can be found in the area for a similar price. Bathroom is pretty basic also. 
16866 Service, hotel room and location in the very best. The Staff had a bottle of wine and a birthday card waiting for me on arrival. The Staff makes you feel at home. I love staying at the Casablanca Hotel..... 
16867 I have never stayed at a hotel like Yotel. The concept is really fantastic. I strongly recommend this new, hip, extremely well located hotel - and it wasn't even expensive! 
16868 New York City has always been my favorite place ever. I've been staying in The New York Palace Hotel every time I go for vacation there. Everything is just perfect in this hotel. 10/10 highly recommended! 
16869 Everything was good except for breakfast which was cold due to a large group. Bed was great, room was clean, good air conditioning and had no odor. 
16870 The room was comfortable and clean and everything in this hotel smells great. 
16871 Stayed at the Mondrian in July 2011. Overall, I thought it was a good hotel. Trendy, great location, good service. My only complaint was the rooms were a little small but it is NYC. I would recommend this hotel to others, especially for the location. 
16872 Stayed there one night and the staff were great. Room was small for 4 people--no chair to sit in, but the location was good and the price was right! 
16873 New property. Price was right and the rate included breakfast. Overall pleasant stay 
16874 Stayed here with the family over Memorial Day Weekend and decided this is where we'll stay on all future trips to New York. The rooms are great, the staff is great, the location is great - all in all great! 
16875 Le rapport qualite prix est excellent ainsi que l ambiance, l emplacement est unique, silencieux et propre, les chambres sont styles d un formule 1 mais la salle de petit dej est tres sympa, un bemol la connexion wifi marche pas super, sinon rapport qualite prix imbattable et propre 
16876 Started well from the front door drop-off through to the reception and check-in with "Evelyn". There was a small mix-up with deliverying my luggage to the room because the tag slipped behind a small shelf at the reception desk, but Evelyn got everything back on track! 
16877 There were a few problems with the room, so there seems to be a quality control issue. There was no pool, but a nice workout facility. 
16878 Bigger rooms and more luxurious than many in NY. Whilst trendy the hotel rooms go for comfort not just hip style. Staff also on the ball 
16879 This hotel is in a good location, a little hard to get to. Rooms are fine, not terribly upscale, but the price is RIGHT (under $100). I requested a view down of the South branch of the Chicago River and they gladly obliged. Open parking lot not the best, though. 
16880 After reading some reviews on Tripadvisor, I was worried, but the construction is complete. The rooms were very nice and quiet. The bathroom was a little small, but clean. I would definitely stay here again. The bed and pillows alone were worth the stay. 
16881 Man bor inte pa det har hotellet for att sova gott eller ha fin utsikt. Har bor man for att det ar ett toppenlage och nara till allt. Tva dorrar till hoger finns en deli med den basta och billigaste frukosten och frukten, rekomenderar det! 
16882 We stayed 2 nights in a suite. Ok, so it's pricey but we loved the decor, the space, the sheets were amazing! Very friendly service, wonderful buffet, trendy bar. Fantastic location. Watched the World Cup finals in the living room with other travelers, such a fun experience. 
16883 buenisimo hotel famoso y tradicional bien ubicado excelente desayuno 
16884 GOOD: location (walking distance to subway and central park), breakfast, good bed, quiet neighborhood, very nice staff. BAD: rooms are really small. Almost didn't have espace for our baggage. ....................................................... 
16885 good location for staying over night - shopping - walking distance to the Walden Gallery - this will be our third time at Millennium Hotel - quick check in and out. airport shuttle - but did not have to use this services yet. 
16886 This hotel made my stay in Chicago just wonderful. The pool indoors with the adjacent deck with lounge chairs outside overlooking the city was the best part. The room was comfortable and very clean. My only complaint was that the front desk attendent was not friendly. 
16887 At first I was shocked to see how small our room was, but somehow I managed to get used to it during our 6 nights stay. No breakfasts are included in the room prize, but there is a Tik tok diners downstairs where we had our american breakfasts (open 24/7). 
16888 Not luxury but a great place to stay in Times Square. Room was spacious enough and clean. We had some problem with our first room being next to some kind of changing room. (people coming and going and doors banging) but we were re-located with little hassle. 
16889 For $250 a night you would at least expect clean rooms! Dirty bathroom, dirty tissues lying around in the room, hair in the tub and randomly, a hairband on the bed! Staff was miserable and very unhelpful. Completely terrible stay and will definitley not be back. 
16890 As the old sayIng goes if the price is too good to be true then buyer beware. The hotel is filthy, outdated rooms and they ream you with charges. The only positive is the location which doesn't say much since there are many options in NYC. 
16891 Wonderful place to stop over for a few drinks. Great service, beautiful rooms. Will be back next time i'm over this way. 
16892 Helpful staff, clean rooms, safe area, convenient location. Enjoyed the stay very much. The staff stood out to me as particularly helpful and cool. There were great restaurants nearby as well as anything else you could need. 
16893 Spent 3 nights in NYC for business. WOW! Impeccable staff and extraordinary service. Large rooms, great amenities. Auriga Spa - outrageous! Hot and cold treatment rooms..great masseuse. Beautiful Bar with terrific cocktails. Can't wait to return. 
16894 Op loopafstand geweldige restaurantjes (vergeet zeker niet een keer te ontbijten bij Balthazar) en winkeltjes. Metro om de hoek, gunstige prijs, wat wil je nog meer? 
16895 ottima posizione e servizio impeccabile con camera affacciata sulla Cattedrale di San Patrick e Rockfeller Center 
16896 The hotel is good value for money. It is located slightly away from times square and Broadway, the buzzing areas of NYC. Otherwise, the hotel has good amenities, very helpful staff. 
16897 One of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. Great service, room service is great as well. Bed's are very comfortable. The internet is a bit slow but that's expected. Front desk is very helpful with directions. The location is the best for the Mag Mile, perfect for shopping. 
16898 Hotel comodo per la posizione, prezzo ragionevole per N.Y. Tuttavia le camere ai piani bassi sono rumorose a causa del traffico (poco isolate) ed ai piani alti a causa degli impianti di aria condizionata. Le camere con cucina non sono ristrutturate di recente e sentono il peso degli anni. 
16899 I stay in hotels 60+ nights a year and am a huge hotel snob. The CP was amazingly quiet--the quietest hotel room I've ever stayed in--despite it's location right in Times Square!! The beds are great, too. Would definitely return. 
16900 We stayed at the Waldorf and frackly it wasn't what we expected. :( The service was just okay. I think the hotel is not what it used to be...sad! 
16901 Stayed there for my anniversary.The heavenly bed was Ahhhhhhhh. The staff was courteous and helpful. Location was great ! 
16902 clean, quite, large room, comfortable bed, close to 28th st subway, OK breakfast, helpful staff - only con is no free internet 
16903 Great Hotel,Best location in the heart of Times Square!!! Great rooms and great service!!! 
16904 Waere nicht der Verkehrslaerm, waere es hervorragend. Deshalb moeglichst gleich nach einem Zimmer zur Hinterseite, auf von der Lexington Ave. abweisenden Seite, fragen. Die Minibar ausstecken bringt auch viel. 
16905 Hotel was clean. Service good. Wi-fi great, better than computers they provide for customers. Hotel needs upgrade, though. Piece of floor missing in kitchen. Location good..some road construction...very quite area! 
16906 I like this hotel and try to stay in it whenever I'm at Dallas. Located near my business and all kind of attraction areas in Dallas, all staff are friendly and try to help as much as they can. 
16907 This is the freindliest hotel in town as wll the best local everything you could want is near by as is a new deracinated resturant right down stairs u can't beat it's place Mitch m 
16908 The spacious room and ideal locale helped make this stay enjoyable, but what I appreciated most was the excellent service that Lindsy provided. She made this Gold Level Marriott member feel like a Platinum. The Dodd family says a heartfelt THANK YOU to her. 
16909 Reasonable rates if you are working in the loop. Room is nothing more than a standard business hotel, but good value overall. 
16910 As a solo traveller, it was a good spot - but not close to United Arena 
16911 A great location; helpful staff; a good gym and nice rooms. Would definately stay again..however the restraunt and roomservice food was quite limited - try the Hilton just over the road! 
16912 Hotel in posizione buona (circa 300mt da fermata subway) vicino a Broadway ma non troppo rumorosa A pochi isolati da central park. Zona tranquilla e sicura Rete wireless free a disposizione Colazione a buffet inclusa. 
16913 Wow, this place is awful. Terrible service. No wireless Internet and the wired internet is unusable. Ridiculous rates. Dated decor. The night I stayed the tram wasn't running so I had to take a really slow shuttle. It would have been quicker to stay at another hotel. 
16914 Perfect location centered between mid-town and the village. Nice firm beds and very clean bathrooms. The rooms are silent at night. 
16915 Just got back from a weekend in Chicago. location is awesome, view was beautiful (we watched the fireworks from our room!). If you don't want to pay the $50 a day for parking, park right next door at 303 whacker (30/day) an connected to hotel. loved it! 
16916 Conference and banquet staff were very attentive. Rooms were not much for the price, and at the price Internet should be included. Bathrooms were very small and challenging for two people to use at once. 
16917 Very good position, the room was clean and comfortable. Bed was very large and toilet clean. The service was good. We left baggage on deposit without any surcharge. 
16918 Great location. Close access to everything. Good breakfast though a little crowded at peak times. Lovely staff. Quiet rooms. Comfy beds. Bathrooms a little cramped. And rooms a little small with a family. But it's New York City afterall. Wonderful stay 
16919 Shares a building with a Marriott Residence Inn. As plastic hotels go it's fine but not exceptional Best attribute is location. 
16920 I recently stayed at this Hilton hotel, the staff was very helpful and courteous. I would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Houston, Texas. 
16921 Ok its NY and Manhattan near Central Park - but we encountered a very loud construction site across the street started a 7am. General loud noise from street due to improper sealed windows, heating not adjustable, very narrow space, and unpolite concierges as well as unmotivated staff at the desk. 
16922 Nice hotel with a reasonable room rate. Rooms were a nice size and beds were comfy. 
16923 Muito bom esse hotel. Recomendo a todos sem medo! Muito perto da Times Square (+- 2,5 qurteiroes) e do metro (+- 1,5 quarteirao). Hotel limpo, novo, atendendimento bom. Internet rapida e gratuita. Para quem gosta de manh~a da pra tomar um cafe do Starbucks gratuito no saguao do hotel. 
16924 Best hotel in New York! Great value and service! We will never stay anywhere else again! 
16925 Just returned from a trip to NYC and the Eventi. Nice, helpful people running a top-notch place. Great neighborhood for shopping, food, subway, and relatively easy walks to many of sites in Midtown and downtown on Manhattan. Rooms were larger than most places and no wait for the elevator. 
16926 Uitstekend hotel, mooie kamers voor een goede prijs verhouding. vergeleken met motel 6 is dit een betere keuze voor het prijs verschil van 7 dolar. vriendelijke eigenaar en zeer schone moderne kamers 
16927 Always friendly staff, true value for the money at springhill in great restaurant area. Don't overpay for stuffy 'brand name' hotels. This hotel is clean, great lobby, complimentary breakfast at great rate. Only 5 mins walk to most downtown offices. 
16928 Awesome area, but god awful rooms! We got a room that was to be for 4 people, the 2 beds were smaller than twin bed, barely fitting one person, let alone 2 in each bed! Rooms extremely small, and overall unpleasant stay. 
16929 PERFETTO PER TRASCORRERE LA NOTTE E FARSI LA DOCCIA. SENZA GRANDI PRETESE, LO STAFF INDIFFERENTE. PULIZIE GIORNALIERE MOLTO BUONE, CONDIZIONI DELL'ALBERGO AL LIMITE DELLA DECENZA. CONSIGLIATO SOLO A CHI HA SPIRITO DI ADATTAMENTO E POCHI SOLDI. 
16930 I stayed here for 2 days with an 11 yr old and we had the best time! Beds were comfortable and I LOVED the free bottle water on each floor! Would stay again and again! 
16931 Dit hotel zorgt voor een prima rustpunt in de hectiek van NYC. Uitstekende service, vriendelijk personeel. Kamer ruim genoeg, bad, koffie, alles wat je nodig hebt. Locatie is prima, goed centraal, makkelijk bereikbaar. Het ontbijt ook goed, maar het restaurant is niet echt gezellig. 
16932 Great location on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Walking distance to everything. Very clean, spacious rooms. Charming. Feels like you are a resident of the city while staying there. Beautiful, nostalgic building. Great value. 
16933 An unbelievably good deal for the price. The staff was amazing -- friendly and efficient. The rooms clean and spacious by NY standards, though no view. No extra charge for early check in and late check out if available. Good location 
16934 Great Time Square location. Wonderful, efficient elevator system. Friendly accommodating staff. Expensive like everything in NYC. Would definitely stay here again! Added bonus: two Starbucks in the hotel! 
16935 This hotel is very good value for Manhattan. You get really spacious rooms, with a kitchen, and a large bathroom. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Location is prime, with walking distance to most things on Manhattan. Defiantly staying again, would recommend. 
16936 I have stayed here many times over the past several years. Super-friendly front desk! They aim to please. Especially nice to Platinum Priority Club members with unadvertised breakfast buffet and free internet access. With all of this, and their location, it's the only place to book your stay! 
16937 I like the location of the hotel. Almost everything is around it, stores, restaurant, grocery, etc ... A remarkable place that M&M's is located in the opposite building. The staff was friendly. It was a clean room with good view. 
16938 I've had occassion to stay at the Wolcott three times. The rooms are great and the staff is always accommodating. This hotel has reasonable rates and is convenient to port authority and MSG among other important landmarks. 
16939 We have stayed at the Regency for many occasions and you simply cannot match if for location, comfort, and the friendliness and professionalism of the staff. By the way, the beds and pillows cannot be more comfortable! The Loew's regency simply cannot be beaten in this price category! 
16940 The staff went out of there way to make my stay a very good one if we needed any thing they made sure we got what we needed. 
16941 Anya at the concierge was extremely helpful. She recommended the new restaurant The National which had superb food. Room service and pillow service was good; they have a pillow menu with twelve different pillows. 
16942 3rd year enjoying location, park view, Norma's for breakfast 
16943 Great location but bare bones hotel. Small , basic but clean. Cafe next store is fantastic with all types of food, open 24 hrs Especially coffee in the am. AC is a small window unit....enough to take some heat but not summer comfy. My husband would not ave liked this 
16944 Poor handling at reception and valet/car service staff a bit brusque. (Left at Wortham and had to make three calls, not apologetic, no sense of urgency...). Awesome bath/room layout with clear attention to design detail. Restaurant was good but staff is a little undertrained and rote. 
16945 Friendly, helpful staff. Nice, decorative hotel and rooms! Loacation couldn't be better! 
16946 Very nice hotel, good rooms, great bathrooms and good breakfast. Location is good for tourists and views are spectacular. I would recommend this for any one staying in Chicago. 
16947 the hotel room was small but thats NYC .the room was nice ,the staff was excellent and it is right there at Times Square. the price was very reasonable for NYC also. 
16948 We stopped 3 nights in this hotel in a family suite, Mother and father and grown up daughters. It was a very pleasant stay in a central, convenient location close to Herald Square Subway and Macy's. Would stay there again 
16949 A great hotel - easy access to public transportation and a decent location even though it's in the financial district. Our room was wonderful and the bed was very comfortable. The only con: expensive mini-bar and no vending machines in the building. 
16950 We stayed 4 nights and did not have any complaints. Hotel is in a good location and was quieter than we had expected. Rooms are fine and everything was very clean. We would recommend to anyone staying in the city. 
16951 Ottima posizione, comodo alla metro (linea rossa 1 2 3) a due fermate da times square, pulito, silenzioso (laterale dell'ottava), si va a piedi al madison square garden, da macy's.. Personale gentile, disponibile, stanze grandi. Consigliatissimo! 
16952 zeer comfortabel hotel gelegen in gezellige buurt met ruim aanbod van restaurants. enig nadeeltje: het dichtstbijzijnde metrostation is ongeveer 8 minuten lopen. maar hotel is perfekt met uitstekende service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
16953 Front desk helpful. Room very nice for price. Free parking. In the right area and also easy on and off highway. A real surprise as I have avoided La Quinta which I will not do in future. 
16954 Really nice hotel with reasonable prices and terrific hotel staff. For my purposes, the location was excellent. No complaints. 
16955 Cheap prices, great location and surroundings, and good service. For just a place to sleep it's perfect. It's not the most updated place, but it works for a day trip. It's clean, but it can deffiently use some upkeep and updating. 
16956 Clean, great location, and very nice bar staff. But don't expect to hang out in your room as you will become claustaphobic quickly. Reasonably priced for the city. Bathrooms are tiny. Beautiful lobby and fun place to sit and people-watch. 
16957 For the accomodations and the serive you receive for the price, this place is quite a bargain! 
16958 Small rooms but overall A very pleasant stay in a great location with good facilities. 
16959 The location is great. The staff is friendly, helpful, and attentive. While the rooms are small... it's NYC. Overall, I had a great stay, and I'll be looking there first in case I'm staying in/around NYC anytime soon. 
16960 The hotel was exceptionally clean and the staff was excellent. The location was perfect for a short walk to Times Square, shopping and right at a subway line. This will be my hotel of choice when in NYC from now on! 
16961 Stayed in a one bedroom apartment. Clean, comfortable, plenty of space for two people. Generally friendly service, great location. Just perfect. Look around for best price! 
16962 Nice and clean, fantastic service and reasonable prices. What more do you want? 
16963 Ideal to get to a the popular sites. Staff friendly and rooms fit for purpose. Nice and quite too for such a central location. Breakfast on the terrace Restraunt ( 7th floor looking out on Rockefeller Centre) was pleasant affair. Would definitely go back an happy to recommend it. 
16964 We experienced good service. I like the room because it's clean and has more space compared to other hotels. This hotel is very accessible everywhere you want to go in NYC. Wi-fi is okay. 
16965 We loved it here! Everyone was so nice and very friendly and helpful. Our room was beautiful. We loved the lobby. I only wish we could have stayed longer! Check in and check out was smooth and quick. Very organized. We were really happy with our stay here. 
16966 Great location on Times Square (even though I would never stay right in Times Square again). Friendly staff, clean rooms, great room service and onsite restaurant. Absolutely no complaints 
16967 The staff members were amazing at accomidating us at this beautiful hotel. The location is perfect. They made my trip so great!! I will definitely recommend this hotel to anyone & will stay there the next time I go to New York. 
16968 We were given a complimentary upgrade to the 54th floor because it was our 10th wedding anniversary. Impeccably clean, roomy, comfortable and wonderful hotel room. There's everything you could need there. Would definitely stay again. It offers amazing views of the 9/11 memorial site and also of the harbour. 
16969 Good location, good value, clean rooms, excellent staff but noisy rooms I couldnt sleep much, but it is New York just off Broadway, so suck it up. I would recommend this hotel due to location and value. thanks again 
16970 My stay at the Hudson Hotel was great!! I loved everything, exactly as I expected. That was my first time in NYC and I strongly recommend this hotel. Great location, amazing design, excellent staff and small but very comfortable and clean rooms. 
16971 Mostly pleasant staff and a large room helped to offset fact that the shared bathroom had only one small towel bar for 3 rooms, almost no hooks in the room, a stained carpet and a noisy air conditioner.Plus for hair dryer, iron, frig, tv. Very nice neighborhood. 
16972 I really wish I could give this hotel a good rating since the desk manager was so nice and the room itself was fine - but I came home with bedbug bites. I hope I didn't come home with some hitchiking bugs as well. Sorry, folks, stay away. 
16973 They have well presented double bedrooms, private bathroom, little lung and kitchen. One can eat in the room, not having to go to a restaurant. Envoy Club is very near the UN building. 
16974 Great find, thanks to trip advisor. Great location 2 blocks from Times square. Clean, friendly and have no Issues.. Very quiet to sleep considering the location, i was surprised but a GREAT Surprise. Looking forward to making the Iroquois Hotel my Home when I am in New York City 
16975 Our first visit to NYC. We selected the Alex based upon the photos on their web site. Somewhat disappointing. Good location, small rooms, and tired. 
16976 The Hilton has a great mid-town location and is excellent value by New York standards. Service is impersonal, the rooms mid-size and the staff highly overworked. The lobby is like the entrance of an upscale mall and the rooms could benefit from some thoughtful renovation. 
16977 A great location, great staff and a great time. Whether your goal is to relax or to party the W Times Square offers you both. You're at the center of everything that New York has to offer. I will never stay anywhere else. 
16978 Hotel was very clean and the breakfast buffet was very good! Our only problem was it just seems very hard to get to. It is off a service road and there are a lot of U-turns. Staff was also very friendly. 
16979 This is the place to stay in new York! The staff are a amazing and it is really well priced. You truly get value for money! Check out the bar & Restruant in the hotel because it is awesome! Will definitely be returning! 
16980 a metros da penn station, muito bem localizado, hotel razoavel, custo beneficio bom, so deixa a desejar e muito no estado , esta muito velho precisa de uma reforma urgente, fora isso e ficavel para quem nao tem frescuras. 
16981 I've made several trips to the property next to Reliant Stadium. Many times I've encountered Reena Wadera who has been just a gem. She is pleasant, professional, an all around good guy who made my visit absolutely great. 
16982 I spent a great weeked with friends and found myself very relaxed, the 15th floor is cool, with a nice view and well kept landscape, clean, and neat, nice place to hang and grip the city.. 
16983 I recently stayed at the Wyndham Blake Hotel in Chicago and loved it! The hotel is conveinently located in the South Loop and the room was spacious and well appointed. The staff were friendly and quite helpful. I plan to return in January! 
16984 The hotel staff was amazing. They took care of everything we needed. The location was within walking distance to Times Square and the subway. The kitchenette in the room was a nice bonus. 
16985 At a good location minutes from everything you could possibly want. Service in the hotel is second to none. If you enjoy Indian food go to the "Jewel of India". 
16986 This review is a little late, as my wife and I stayed there in 2010. But I just wanted to say that we had a great stay here. Great location and a clean room. What else could you ask for while visiting NYC? 
16987 I will tell all my friends and family that this hotel is the best hotel for the price and the location is very close to times square! Five stars! F Torres 
16988 Great Art Deco hotel, stayed for a week - excellent location near Central Park, Metro and Fifth Ave, well equipped rooms, tastefully decorated. Excellent staff services. Would stay again 
16989 We returned to this hotel after having stayed last summer. I can't say enough good things about the staff--they were all friendly, helpful, and made our stay great. I will definitely stay again when returning to New York. 
16990 Margaret, vanessa & Janey will do everything to make your stay the way you want it. The best front desk service I got. 
16991 Overall, no complaints. Got a great rate for a weekend trip. Can't beat the location when you just needed a place to sleep. Our room faced the back of the hotel so it was nice a quiet. I would stay there again. 
16992 Only had one night here. The rooms are compact, but very very clean. Comfortable beds. The location is fabulous, close to theatres and action. Heaps of restaurants nearby. Subway line very close. Service was excellent, with friendly staff. 
16993 My wife and I visited NYC recently and enjoyed the hospitality and rooms. The rooms were decent sized for NYC and the service was great. 
16994 Lovely staff! Great beds, clean pool, and cool rooms! Only complaint is one of the bed lamps did not work and the warm temperature in the lobby and elevator. A great location with suprisingly low noise. 
16995 Excellent staff and very pleasant staff. The room was excellent as it has a microwave and room to work if need be. Thank you for a wonderful experience always. Greg 
16996 Stayed at the iroquois over NewYear. Hotel location was excellent, concierge amazing! Restaurant food was good and well priced,but the rooms were overpriced considering the hotel amenities. But overall a good hotel. 
16997 We had a perfect stay at the Marquis. Its location at Times Square made it the perfect location for our visit to sightsee, attend plays and dine out. It was easy to grab a cab with the help of the doorman, though many attractions were within walking distance. 
16998 Stayed for graduation, had a nice suite, comfortable bed, 
16999 Amazing location surpassed only by the great hotel staff. Beatiful lobby, nice spacious rooms. A great choice when you visit NY, when your business has a function or a family event. 
17000 I had to stay in the city for one night. It was pleasant and I have no complaints. Very cool roof top lounge. Also, an employee, Raul, went out of his way to make the stay enjoyable. Great experience! 
17001 Great location, spacious and clean rooms, beautiful lobby with a view of Times Square, and excellent sound insulation. It feels bright, comfortable and quiet inside, which you will appreciate after a day in New York City. Definitely recommend it. 
17002 We had an upgraded room at the hotel and it was far from grand. It needed updating. The bathroom was small and needed work. We visited 3 rooms and finally found a room that was OK. Suggest that you try another property. 
17003 We paid $200/ night and not worth it. Very old, dingy rooms that they have tried to remodel best they could. Water slow to come out of pipes, rooms smell like Smoking Rooms from the 1960's. Look a little more North up Michigan Ave would be my suggestion. Dk 
17004 Location was awesome. Head anywhere Midtown, or jump on a subway at Grand Central. If you can get a corner room that would be ideal. You will recognize the lobby as it has been in many movies and TV shows. 
17005 habitaciones confortables y limpias. excelente desayuno y ubicacion buena tanto si quieres estar en el soho como si te quieres mover pues tiene el metro al lado. muy agradable nuestra estacia 
17006 The room is okay, not great, but okay. Would recommend avoiding the restaurant. We were chased by the server after leaving a 12 % tip for so-so service. Yeesh. Welcome to New York. 
17007 My wife and i have stayed at this hotel twice in 12 months. Its clean and the rooms are a good size. The staff are friendly and can't do enough for you. Location is spot on and we look forward to going again 
17008 SOno stato all'Hotel Mela per lavoro. E' un design hotel molto carino. Le staze sono nuove, pulite e grandi. Servizio cortese. Posizione ottima, a 200mt da Time Square 
17009 Good value for the money, lovely suite room with fireplace (that the management gracioiusly turned on for us, despite being turned off 'for the season'. Nice shower and plush towels. Nice ambiance and lovely lobby bar. A gem in the gold coast, easy walk to clubs and restaurants. 
17010 I gave this facility outstanding reviews in the past. However, over the past 3 months the hotel has had a change in management and a large turnover of its front desk staff who are ill trained and not as friendly as the earlier staff. 
17011 The service, from the singing doorman to the front desk clerks, to the bellman was wonderful. It is an eclectic hotel in a great location. The rooms are roomy and it was a very enjoyable stay during the last week in May. 
17012 Thanks to Crystar, Nathalie and a crazy great bartender named Chris we had a great time. Everyone was very gracious and welcoming, and the reno's are terrific. 
17013 Stayed at the Hyatt in August, 2012 and Emi at the front desk was very helpful and accommodating.Great location, close to everything in the loop. Plenty of thing to do while you stay in the Hotel. Rooms were clean, need a little updating but for the price it was great. 
17014 Comfortable hotel. Great beds. Large bathroom. Breakfast included. Close to Times Square, Central Park and theaters. 
17015 Had a wonderful stay. Service as top-notch and the rooms were clean and spacious for NY. I almost don't want to tell people about the hotel because I don't want it to get too popular and I won't be able to get a room! 
17016 The hallway was being renovated when we went. The building is a little old evidenced by the carpet and walls, but this hotel was clean enough for me not to complain about and the location is great. The parking across the street is much higher than the hotel website claims. 
17017 Excellent location. While most hotels don't, The Manhattan at Time Square offers free WI-FI at the lobby, althoug I had to get out of my room and go downstaris to use it. 
17018 The Pierre is located across the street from Central Park. Pierre at the front desk was super helpful...the room needs updating but the bed and sheets were perfect! Overall staff was very professional! 
17019 The hotel is relatively new. The rooms are small, as with most New York rooms, but they are very comfortable and clean. Location is in the Fashion District. Theatre district is within walking distance, and subway entrance is right outside the front door. 
17020 Stayed here withfamily while visiting New York. Excellent value and great room. Very quiet given location. Charging for Wifi in room and expensive breakfastsonly negatives. 
17021 super hotel we stayed 3 nights it was very nice hotel, 5 mn walk to Central park and 5 minutes walk to main metro station, rooms are nice service is very good very helpful persons I would recommend this hotel 
17022 Hotel situato in ottima posizione, a pochi metri dalla metropolitana, da Time Square e dei teatri di Broadway. Hotel pulito, curato, attenzione a richiedere camere con letto Queen o King, le altre sono molto piccole. 
17023 Very nice hotel in the heart of the magnificent mile. Room was nice, bed was soft as can be. Hotel bar was hopping on a Wed evening and very trendy. Convenient starbucks right in the lobby. 
17024 Het hotel lag lekker centraal in Manhatten. Veel bezienswaardigheden waren te belopen en de subway was dichtbij.Hotel was prima met goede service en vriendelijk personeel. iedere dag was de kamer opgeruimd en beddengoed plus handdoeken verschoond.Kortom een prima hotel die ik iedereen kan aanbevelen. 
17025 Hotel Chandler provides fair value for money with: - Very helpful, positive staff Clean, comfortable room Good location Would have liked a little more storage space in the room. 
17026 Nice managed & operated hotel. In the business district but walking distance to many attractions. 
17027 Val @ check-in was warm, gracious, efficient and immediately made me feel welcome. The rest of the stay equally perfect. Thanks. 
17028 Great hotel very close to central park and times square. What can i say fab city. 
17029 The location was super, short walking distance to attractions, subway just around the corner. Staff were friendly and helpful, which I never expected from NYC. My friend and I stayed for 5 nights on 29th floor which was no problem! 
17030 They are very professional and effiecient while always being very pleasant and a joy to deal with. I always recommend this hotel to my fellow business travelers and they always thank me because the service is wonderful. Please tell Angela, Saleem, David and others thank you! 
17031 Have stayed here 5 times. Location is perfect, staff professional and attentive, food excellent and the rooms are luxurious, especially the beds! Close to Rock Center, shopping and theatre district. You won't be sorry. 
17032 Small, tired rooms. The hotel feels like that guy who thinks he's cool, but definitely is not. No reason to go back. 
17033 This was a great value for a very good hotel. The locstion was very good since it is an easy stroll to Times Square. Parking was reasonable. The rooms were very clean and the linens were ironed. 
17034 Sono stato spesso in questo hotel, ha camere grandi ma e' un po' vecchio e avrebbe bisogno di essere ristrutturato. Per il rapporto prezzo/servizio si puo' trovare di meglio 
17035 Es un hotel antiguo, pero muy confortable, excelente ubicacion, desayuno basico, pero suficiente. Excelente relacion precio calidad, a 2 cuadras central park, a 15 cuadras de times square, a 2 cuadras 5ta avenida. Metro en la esquina. No hace falta mas! 
17036 Limited selection for breakfast, poor lighting at night. Everything else was excellent. 
17037 Excellent staff-very friendly and helpful from the bellhop to the front desk. Awesome price on Priceline.com. Suite was very comfortable and clean. 
17038 We stayed in the towers section where breakfast is included, and free drinks of an evening which was great after 7 hours walking around the world's most interesting city. 
17039 Modern hotel with excellent lounge, restaurant and cafe in a hip urban setting surrounded by shopping, dining, and residential living. Very good westside location, but not convenient if you have to travel to either the Reliant Center or Downtown areas. 
17040 for as much as they charge the hotel should be bug free and the ac should be working, and I shouldn't be asked to pay a deposit when I already paid for the rooms 
17041 hotel bellissimo sotto ogni punto di vista!la catena Morgan non si smentisce! entrata d'effetto dopo un incredile facciata di cemento armato! personale cortese e disponibile! camere piccole ma efficienti con tutto il necessario! e poi ricordiamoci di essere a NY!!!! pulitissimo! zona tranquilla e comoda per spostarsi! 
17042 You 'never know' what you'll encounter in NY. I was pleasantly surprised at the value for the location and price, the room was spotless, everybody was very nice, cute small bar and a good enough continental breakfast/snack to get you going. 
17043 My husband and I stayed here for 5 nights in May, 2011. We thought it was a beautiful hotel with a very cool vibe. The staff was helpful and courteous. I would stay here again. 
17044 We had great service. I requested an upper floor got it. Requested an upgrade got it. The bar was great. The service was wonderful and our room was just like the web site. Would stay there in a New York Minute. Location can not be beat. 
17045 Rooms were beautiful. Our conference was at McCormick Center so very convenient to attend meetings. Bus line was right outside the entrance for a straight shot downtown. No need for cabs. Red line and Chinatown was also just a few blocks away. 
17046 We had 2 rooms over New Years and everything was great - location, service, room and amenities (including the fitness center). We did not try any of the restaurants. The front desk swiftly handled the line of people checking in on New Year's Eve. We'll definitely be back. 
17047 Walls are paper thin. Didn't sleep at all, woke up several times from noise from trafic. Rooms are really small and bathroom was filthy. When we got down in the lobby one morning water was pooring down from the ceiling. Photos don't tell the real picture. 
17048 2" dust to carpet edges. Skirtings dirty--we washed them. Bed thick muck beneath. No wonder we got bitten by the little friends. Why the hell spoil such a potentially great place for just a bit of cleaner supervision. 
17049 STAY HERE! But choose the river view, not the twin towers view. 
17050 This hotel exceeds most other hotels in this "tier." The staff was not only friendly but highly personably and seemed genuinely interested in making our stay more enjoyable. Rooms were comfortable, cool and clean. 
17051 Beautiful hotel,clean,excellent helpful staff.Agreed to change our room to double bed without increase in price. Perfect location. Small rooms but has all you need. 
17052 Great location. Very comfy rooms. Staff was terrific and very helpful. We really enjoyed our Christmas shopping trip! 
17053 Bellissima entrata, a due passi dalla quinta strada, ottimo ristorante ma stanze e corridoi nella norma (da 3 stelle.... forse!!). Molto caro per quello che offre. Punto a favore stanze molto ampie ma bagni veramenti decadenti. 
17054 Goed hotel kleine maar zeer nette kamer met genoeg comfort. Hotel ligt zeer centraal gelegen in Midtown. Personeel vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Ontbijt was eenvoudig maar ruim voldoende qua kwaliteit en keuze mogelijkheid. 
17055 Very well located in Korea way, with nice and plesant staff 
17056 The room is in the average, but clean. 
17057 Dit hotel voel je de gastvrijheid, iets wat je in de meeste hotels niet meer vindt. De kamers zijn ruim en compleet. De kamers aan de voorkant zijn wat rumoerig door de straat. Het personeel is zeer vriendelijk en hulpvaardig. 
17058 One of the best in NYC, very clean and large rooms ,quiet neighborhood setting. Staff is very helpful, close to bus lines and grocery stores 2,3 blocks walk small resterants near by. 
17059 First time in NYC. What a great location , walking distance to most everything you would want to see. Hotel staff very helpful 
17060 Greeted by Tom at the front desk who made us feel at home. Would stay here again 
17061 Best hotel to stay in NYC hands down. Best staff, very friendly and attentive. I stay nowhere else when in NY, period. 
17062 This hotel is possibly the worst i have erer stayed in. we had to change rooms three times, floor was filfthy, rusty fittings in the bathroom, paper falling off the walls, damp, need i go on??? JUST DONT EVER STAY HERE!!!! 
17063 Nothing to write home about. Seemed clean enough. Definitely no frills. Staff weren't overly friendly when I requested a forgotten toiletry, nor were they helpful explaining how to connect to the wireless Internet. Probably wouldn't return; just stayed here on business. 
17064 Stayed 3 nights, suite very comfortable although atrium access not good for the vertigo!. Staff friendly and efficient, room spotless, breakfast great. Great location 2 mins from river where you can walk to Magnificant mile 
17065 If you want to be in Times Square this is a nice hotel. Clean room with a helpful staff. Rooms are small and expensive but that is the norm for NYC 
17066 Just returned from a 2 night stay at this hotel-deluxe king was smallish, but bedding and towels were high quality. Warning! Request a room that does not face 58th street, unless you wish to be awakened by construction at 7:30am! 
17067 For a real first experience of NYC this hotel was amazing! From the staff to the views to the cleanliness and personal assistance for anything!Perfect for children also, has everything you need all in one building!-EXCELLANT!!!!!!! 
17068 History, service, location all rolled into one lodging experience! 
17069 The hotel is AAA for service and location right in the centre of the mid-town on east 44th street just off lexington. Great for family or business travellers. Very clean rooms, excellent breakfast menu. Grand Central Station is about 3 minutes walk away. 
17070 Fantastic hotel in a great location. Central to all the major attractions. Spotlessly clean with amazing staff 
17071 Excellent experience all round, from booking to check in, to room quality and service during my stay. Highly recommended. 
17072 The hotel is located in good position and easy to reach by metro or train directly from airport. It is perfect for business trip but also for a pleasure weekend in NY. Rooms are clean and with all comforts. Service 
17073 We loved the location and the staff! Very clean and very nice for all ages. 
17074 This great hotel reinforced my already high opinion of the Kimpton chain. From the customer service, to the location (perfect for what I was in New York for), and, finally, to the room itself, everything was top-tier. Loyal Kimpton InTouch member here; they're fantastic. 
17075 Hotel centralissimo a un isolato dalla 5ta e dalla'Empire a 50 metri dalla metro ottima posizione!!!!!! Consigliato staff gentile wifi gratuito stanze libere alle 11 ricovero x i bagagli in attesa della partenza......ottimo. 
17076 My wife and I stayed here for new years eve. Its steps away from times square. Very nice accommodations, rooms a bit small but to be expected in nyc. Great indoor pool and lounge. 
17077 The best part of the stay is being greeted by Michael, Kris, or Sal! They are the best at what they do :-). The rooms are spacious, clean and have a small kitchen with stove, fridge, and microwave. Great location for dining, shopping, and people watching. DOG FRIENDLY!! 
17078 This is a safe, comfortable hotel for the price. Not a bad neighborhood. Service is great. Its not the Waldorf but for the price, you cant beat this one! 
17079 The location is amazing. The rooms all have character (we've stayed there several times). Some of the rooms can be small, but they're all very comfortable. Many great memories in NYC and the Carlton Hotel! 
17080 It served its purpose for a conference... nice modern rooms with a decent view. Hotel staff were adequate with concerns and addressed them in a timely fashion. 
17081 I had the pleasure of staying at the Blackstone. The room was extremely comfortable, The bathroom was out of this world with its elegance. I attended at training and part of it was held in the Ballroom. The Ballroom is so elaborate and just a visual feast for the eyes 
17082 Renovated, new surface on old walls. Clean and quiet. Good location to explore the city. 
17083 We stayed in this new hotel over Easter and other than the slow lifts, it was fine. It is well located to everything and we had a view of the empire state building. Desk service was excellent and breakfast was a plus. 
17084 The Muse did a great job taking care of me and my guests during our stay. Barbara Los and David Gomez made the stay even better with personal attention and service! The meeting rooms were great. The banquet service was excellent. Thanks :) 
17085 Well, just the title. Close to the UN, good for business and location. More than old or dirty, is that everything is overused. View is spectacular in top floors, the rest average. You can get better rooms for the price; you pay the view and location. 
17086 Five nights,. 2 days after getting home bites started 
17087 Stayed here for a weekend while wedding dress shopping & it was amazing! The breakfast in the AM is perfect as well as the spa! 
17088 The service was great, the bed was very comfortable, and the shower was amazing! The room package came with a complimentary Brunch in the hotel restaurant. 
17089 Very pleasantly surprised by overall experience. Room (two twin beds) was small but quite attractive, clean and neat. Room and bath appeared to have been recently remodeled. Pleasant staff. Breakfast area is attractively old-fashioned, and buffet at $17/person is excellent value. Highly recommended for the thrifty but discerning traveler. 
17090 Wonderful stay...complimentary room upgrade...great view 
17091 The West 57th Hilton is one of our favorite hotels. Greatloctio, cheerful and friendly staff and beautiful rooms. Spacious and clean. 
17092 Well located hotel 1 1/2 blocks from the subway. Very well kept and clean but the smallest rooms we have seen this side of Paris. Hotel was quiet and the staff was tremendous. Rose pedals placed on the stoop each night as you come home 
17093 i always come to nyc and stay in different hotels. But one of my favorite is the radisson lexington good location, very clean room and most especially good customer service in front desk. His name is Allan and his very helpful and knows everything in the city. 
17094 This property is very nice, Front desk manager very nice and was accomodating without asking. Rooms are small, typical NYC. Close to Macy's flagship store and was convient for what we did during our two day stay. Would consider staying here again when in NYC. 
17095 Stayed here for a weekend getaway to shop and go the the Chicago Auto Show. Hotel location is perfect, with many nice dining options nearby. Our Room had two bathrooms which is always a plus! Service was very good too. 
17096 The room was perfect. Great location. Staff goes above and beyond. Skip the breakfast though, a little pricey. Very neat and clean. Unlimited access to latte machine downstairs and the newspaper was delivered everyday. 
17097 We have stayed here before both times with a Priceline bid. It's a well run hotel with nice amenities. The drain in our tub was slow to drain (706) bIt overall a great stay and good location for the Galleria. 
17098 The rooms were small but clean and completely functional. Remember to ask for a hairdryer. The location is convenient, safe, near the train. The staff is helpful and the price is surprisingly affordable. 
17099 We enjoyed everything about our stay at the Drake Hotel: the lovely room, the view of Lake Michigan, the location, and the hotel staff, who were all friendly and helpful. My only complaint is that breakfast in the dining room is very expensive. 
17100 We are currently staying at the Staybridge on our second trip to NY. We booked this hotel after reviewing many hotels in and around Times Square. We are not disapointed. The service is good, the breakfast is excellent and the hotel facilities are first class. 
17101 Disgusting hovel the owners should be reported for false representation. 
17102 Great location, comfortable rooms. Only the bathroom is small and could do with an upgrade. Otherwise a perfect hotel in Midtown to explore Times Square, go to a show or hop onto a subway to anywhere else in the city. 
17103 Our family of 4 loved this hotel. It's clean, upscale, and close to all that Manhattan has to offer. We will definitely stay again! 
17104 Somehow, I did not expect much - because I was redirected to this hotel, when travel agent could not confirm my another reservation. However - it was very very good; it was - for now - the largest room I ever had in Manhatten, nice decor, very quiet. 
17105 Muy cerca del flatiron.Limpio,con habitaciones muy amplias,tv plasma gigante. Te llevas el desayuno a la Habitacion. 
17106 Booked this room last minute to visit a trade show 
17107 Found the room to be adequate and the staff very helpful. I would certainly stay again and plan to on my next visit. 
17108 No A/C Holes on my sheets, asked to change them told me they didnthave any more available For the price you expect more. I suggest Holiday Inn Chinatown, small but nice and Hudson very chic! 
17109 Este hotel esta fenomenal, tiene una entrada con una cascada y un hall enorme, las habitaciones son muy amplias y esta muy bien situado,encima de la gran central,he leido alguna critica del personal, a mi por lo menos me trataron muy bien y fueron muy agradables, yo lo recomendaria 
17110 We have our "girls' weekend" every December in NYC - have tried many hotels over the years - This one is THE best we've styed at - small, convenient. Friendly staff and very helpful. Clean rooms. 
17111 The Metro is a really nice. well run hotel in a great location. Large comfortable rooms and good breakfast, helpful staff. One drawback rooms facing West 35 st are very noisy. Try and get an internal room. 
17112 Very good. Stayed from Friday thru' Monday and wished I could've got the second weekend at the same rate. Very good for 5th and Madison, Mid town anyway and I would stay here again. The restaurant ain't half bad either. 
17113 I stay at the St. Regis Houston frequently, and they do an excellent job in all respects! Found out that I needed to be in Houston on short notice, and Vicki did an outstanding job in assisting me in finding a room and making a reservation. Thanks! 
17114 Stayed in this hotel in May 2012. Very good location. Lots of places to eat nearby. Close to metro station. The price is not so cheap and the bad thing is the room (very small)! 
17115 Small but very nice rooms, good shower, nice with fridge in the room, free WI-FI was excellwnt, good location, breakfast on beautiful roof-terrace overlooking ground-zero, only downside is the noice when they start working nextdoor early in the morning, but it wasn't too bad, WOULD RECOMMEND 
17116 Omar and the staff were very helpful and took extra good care of my husband and I. The hotel was centrally located, which was very convenient. We will be staying there again for sure. - Lynne and Aaron 
17117 Stayed there with spouse and three kids for a couple of nights (Priority Club reward nights) over Thanksgiving. Service was excellent, always respectful and helpful. Great location. Loved the modern room and the bathroom. 
17118 Fantastic friendly and such quaint UNIQUE rooms ! you must stay here if you're going to Houston ! Feel free to contact me with other questions. We were in room 509 and it was great :) Nice air conditioning too ! 
17119 We chose this hotel for its convenient location and price. But we did not satisfied. The rooms are very old and they smell dusty. even the blankets have holes on them. The receptionist in the evening time is rude and not helpful. 
17120 We stayed for a weekend. It was lovely. Great location, large and clean room. Beautiful, grand lobby. The only downside was the price of breakfast at the lobby cafe. TOO HIGH. 
17121 For $470 per night, you think they would give you a drawer to keep clothes? Oh. excuse me! This is NEW YORK! Find a better value. 
17122 The review title says it all. our stay was a pleasant experience. 
17123 The lobby is pleasant. The rest is SAD at best. Old and moldy, dank and damp.You get what you pay for. We will not be back. 
17124 Posizione semplicemente perfetta...visitare New York stando in questo hotel e' semplicissimo! camere buone perfetta per famiglie...Zona tranquilla a dieci minuti dal centro di Time Square con stazione della polizia di fronte...unico difetto per l'uso del loro pc si fanno pagare 1$ ogni 5min 
17125 This place was so awesome for the price and location. I will stay here again for sure when i come back to NYC. The staff was very friendly and they helped out with all my needs. 
17126 Just spent the days upto and including New Year in New York at the Alex. Great Hotel they couldn't do enough to make our stay the best. 
17127 Location is really good, 5 minutes by walk from Times Square Price too high for a very small room and a ridicolous breakfast 
17128 just a few meters to Times Square, but still surprisingly relaxed atmosphere! one minute to metro station and therefore in no time everywhere.... delicious breakfast (fresh fruit and toasted bagels... ) comfy bed, clean bathroom, very (!) helpful and friendly staff.... YES just perfect :-) 
17129 Very good Hotel, great location, great staff. Boutique style with modern room. Very good Bed. I got a room in the high corner and was an amazing view. 
17130 I loved my stay at this hotel. My view was amazing and the staff was so helpful with everything. Hip, trendy, well priced and conveniently located to everything I needed. See sara in the bar, she rocks!! 
17131 hotel normal , comodas camas limpio , pero muy viejo , igual lo vale la ubicacion 
17132 Travelled at Spring Break with teenagers and had a fantastic stay. Loved the location and the size of this property. Also found the staff to be very friendly and helpful. Could not have been happier and plan to stay again! 
17133 Great room, great service, great location near the subway. Only negative point: hotel restaurant wasn't open for dinner, and the breakfast buffet was sparse. But there are plenty of restaurant and diners in the area. 
17134 Front desk staff (Christian, Martina & crew) was very helpful throughout our stay. Great location just off Times Square. Rooms were clean and spacious by NY standards. Had tix to Mary Poppins and the theater was 50 feet away. Would stay her again. 
17135 I almost canceled after seeing other reviews. Location was perfect, no problem with long elevator waits, room was spacious an clean, and staff was helpful. Short walk to shopping and restaurants. 
17136 I'll do this very simply: 1. Outstanding location. 2. Very nice room (high ceilings, clean, cool windows, tons of light, nice details.). 3. Friendly and attentive service. 4. Very reasonable price. We loved it and will definitely return very soon. 
17137 This hotel was clean, the breakfast was great! Coffee, tea and hot chocolate were always available! Wonderful, helpful staff! 
17138 Roomy and clean suites. Comfortable beds and sensational pillows. 
17139 Nice size rooms but have never seen a hotel need a refurb like this one, Sockets hanging off walls, coming back to Ny in 2012 but not here. 
17140 Het enige minpuntje van het hotel was dat de metro onder het hotel loopt en dit is in de kamer (ik had kamer 309 op de 3de etage) duidelijk merkbaar (hoorbaar en voelbaar), wellicht dat dit in een andere kamer op een hogere etage minder is. 
17141 The Westin is exactly what I had expected: old school comfort. 
17142 Would definately stay here again. Staff were friendly, room had free wifi, comfortable bed, free continental breakfast, good value for money. We couldn't fault it. Asides from a small room but its right near times square so what do you expect...... 
17143 Staff very friendly, excellent breakfast, clean and spacious rooms and centrally located! What more can you ask for? I LOVE Embassy Suites and this hotel was excellent! 
17144 Unless you want an unwanted mid night visitor don't stay here. Fire escapes come right up to the window and none of the windows lock. Rooms are very small and the hotel itself is run down. While the location is great for your own safety, STAY ELSEWHERE. 
17145 I absolutely love Hannah McCauley, Steve and the restaruant staff at Ginger's Restaruant. they were friendly, eager to help and just lovely. They made my stay worth it, given some of the other not so good aspects of the hotel 
17146 This hotel has a great location short walk to time square .2 bedroom suite only has 1 bathroom off main bedroom not suitable for 2 couples. Hotel is old but extremely clean price was good for hotel in this location 
17147 me encanto todo, la ubicacion era fantastica!!!!! lindas habitaciones! los empleados del hotel muy amables, menos la de limpieza que 2 dias me desperto teniendo el cartel de no molestar. pero de ahi todo muy bien! 
17148 Rooms are like a home away from home with a living area separated from the bedroom. It's also pet friendly and the service was excellent and friendly! 
17149 J Fox and Showtime made our stay very enjoyable. They were very knowledgable and answered all questions. 
17150 Super Zentral direkt am Broadway. Die Zimmer sind gepflegt, Hatten sogar einen riesen Plasma-Fernseher im Standart Zimmer. Sehr netter Concierge, uns zeichnete er direkt eine nette Stadt-Tour vom Hotel aus und stattete uns mit den passenden Gutscheinen aus. Preis/Leistung wohl einzigartig in New York. 
17151 The rooms were incredibly tiny and the corridors dark and dingy. Not at all like the photographs. Reception staff were pleasant, however, the night time security staff were surly and aggressive. Take my advice stay anywhere but here it's basic! 
17152 We just returned from a four day stay at Casablanca. Every person on the staff is very helpful and polite. The rooms were perfectly clean, and the breakfast buffet was exactly as advertised. We look forward to returning 
17153 All was good until I ordered a sandwitch and 2 glasses of wine - the base price was ok but tax, more tax, ten dollar charge for delivery, and tip came to sixty-six dollars!! Insane!!! Bring your own food/wine and you'll be fine. 
17154 Hotel is very clean and staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms are on the small side but they have everything you need. Get a room over looking the memorial park, Nice bar on top floor. I would stay there again 
17155 Avevo prenotato x 2 adulti e mi hanno fatto pagare 30 Dollari al gg. per avere il secondo letto, sono arrivato alle ore 9 am e mi hanno dato la camera alle ore 15 pm. Stanza piccolissima, la porta del bagno picchiava nel letto, armadio piccolissimo, condizionatore rumorosissimo 
17156 ottimo hotel, personale molto cordiale e prevede facilitazioni per gli iscritti A CLUB. Molto organizzato per le famiglie con bambini e adolescenti. Da consiglare 
17157 We hadden een grote kamer aan de achterkant met 2 queensize bedden. Service in het hotel was uitstekend, hygiene was acceptabel. Locatie is echt perfect! vlakbij CP en 5th avenue, metro dichtbij, echt prima. 
17158 I loved this place. It is so 1920s it is almost spooky. Fabulous character, wonderful staff and top nosh inexpensive food which I would pay a fortune for at home. Right next to Michigan Ave so all the tourist sights were in easy reach. Would stay here again. 
17159 Great location! We liked Lower East Side, and espesially Ludlow street. A lot of nice bars and restaurants. Great for young people! The room was small, but OK. The staff was nice and helpful. The room was quiet, but did not face the street. 
17160 Enjoyable experience. Location was convenient for going both uptown and downtown. Walking distance to Central Park, 5th Avenue, Rockefeller Plaza, and MOMA. We stayed on an executive floor and enjoyed the included breakfast bar. Nice but expensive shop with sundries and souvenirs. 
17161 This hotel is lovely. Great location, close to the park and in a very nice neighbourhood. Quiet and upscale. Efficient bell, concierge and front desk staff. Nice room, clean and decent size for Manhattan. No complaints! 
17162 The hotel was comfy, great modern room and aesthetic, great gym, good wifi and my favorite location in the city. 
17163 Came here on honeymoon in October. Great location just a minute walk from subway station. Got a room on 31st floor overlooking the Empire State, excellent view. Had food once and it was great. Rooms were spacious and very clean and serviced daily. Friendly staff. 
17164 Convenient to a number of subway lines; walk to SoHo, east and west villages, Chelsea, Chinatown, Little Italy, etc. Room was pretty good for NYC. Front desk folks were very accomodating. Nice gym as well. 
17165 The staff is incredible and I have really enjoyed my long term stay here. The only downside is that the rooms and TVs are a bit dated. However, the bed and gym are all great. 
17166 Hardly any counter space around the bathroom sink. The bathroom walls were frosted but very much see-through. There was no coffee maker. 
17167 We stayed there for 5 days. Excellente location and friendliness of staff. Our room was big and comfortable. Breakfast is poor. I will recommend it. 
17168 Great place to stay, very stylish and rooms very comfortable. Very brief stay, but very happy. Staff a very helpful and will promptly resolve anything you find not 10/10. Doesnt look like a chain hotel, the lobby has an interesting bar and there's lots of life around 
17169 Just back from 3 nights at the indigo with my husband and 2 sons (aged 12 and 16) Great hotel, great location - L train nearby. Very helpful bellman. Loved the room - very spacious and bright. Free internet which the kids used a lot. Would definitely stay here again 
17170 Great location - just three blocks from Grand Central Station and many choices for ground transportation throughout the city and to airports. Room was adequate, very clean. Staff was courteous and provided an early check in. 
17171 Spacious room, Clean Bathroom, Great location and Breathtaking view! I would definitely recommend staying here. It is a short walk from here to the Magnificient Mile. I definitely recommend staying here for any trip to Chicago. I hope you enjoy this hotel as much as I did! 
17172 This was the best hotel that I have ever stayed in while in NYC. The rooms were great with comfortable beds. It is decorated very chic and the staff could not be friendlier. We will not stay anywhere else in NYC. We have found our favorite hotel:) 
17173 The hotel was under renovation, so we allowed for that; however, the rooms (we booked) two were small and the amenities smaller. We ended up having to buy our own toilet paper, which should tell you something. The location was wonderful, but I wouldn't stay at the Amsterdam Court again. 
17174 Die Beschreibung, dass das Hotel neu renoviert sei, ist veraltet. Insbesondere die Tapeten in unserem Zimmer sahen recht mitgenommen aus. Das Bad war sehr sauber. 
17175 Our 3 nights stay in this hotel had been really great, and service provided had also been very satisfying. Moreover, the duty manager Angie had been very helpful in assisting us with picking the best room available. In overall, our stay here was beyond our initial expectation. 
17176 Renovation with Four Season type bathrooms and decent size hotel rooms. Beds comfortable, rooms quiet. Better than expected. Big Bar worth a visit in the evening. Staff competent. No 24 hour room service though, and given this size hotel, should be expected. 
17177 Hotel muy centrico. con habitaciones no muy grandes, pero con camas inmensas. servicio de cafe gratuito durante todo el dia. un poco antiguo. El defecto esta en que el almuerzo se sirve en el hall, donde no hay muchas sillas y es poco variado. 
17178 I loved this hotel. It was in a great location and everyone was very friendly and helpful. I would recommend it to anyone. The rooms were clean and very nice. 
17179 Historic building, beautifully redecorated and reasonably priced (at least when I stayed there) for NYC hotel. 
17180 Administration efficency means above all making proud of a job crew. like Georgio, Valerie, Rosa, Beatrice, Bridget, Alvaro, Vin and ALL THE OTHERS Restaurant Employers. Congratulations to that golden medal team. Antonio Torres e Lourdes. 
17181 Hotel was very clean and the employees were very courteous. Location was a little more south than would have liked but still an easy walking distance to Michigan Ave. A good value for a great hotel. Would stay here again. 
17182 While we were staying they install an A/C in every room and a new elevator. See other reviews - the hotel is really nice. For me it is the best of affordable hotels in NYC. 
17183 this hotel is so beautiful. the lobby alone is stunning. right across from st. patricks church.. great location and amazing view! rooms were very nice too. highly recommend! 
17184 This hotel is what young people need for stay in new york! Very good service, this nice and modern hotel the pool is good one of the good nigth club is there in floor 12, I will be back soon 
17185 Had a very good stay here and the staff made the experince very pleasant. The lcoation is really excellent and the rooms are more than fine. The restaurant even serves good food which is always a bonus. 
17186 Pal naast het Empire State Building. Ruime kamer, beetje oubollig, maar geriefelijk. Voor NY-begrippen redelijk geluiddicht. Prijs/kwaliteit dik in orde! 
17187 My wife was reluctant to stay in a 2,or 2.5 star rated hotel but was thrilled with this hotel. CLEAN, friendly, great location, free internt access, computer use, fax, and free breakfast 
17188 Best of all though it is reasonably priced in over priced New York. Our new hotel of choice. 
17189 Rooms are decent, but not exceptional. Staff is helpful and friendly. Great hotel location; 1 block off Broadway and Times Square. Like good and inexpensive NY pizza at a place with great ambiance? Try Amadeus Pizza about 2 blocks up the street at 408 8th Avenue. 
17190 Had a great stay here the hotel is very well kept, the room was larger than we thought and all the staff were very helpful. 
17191 We had one of the cheapest rooms. So they were quite small and had shared facilities. Nevertheless it was great value for money. Excellent location, clean rooms and friendly staff. 
17192 We loved the Astoria - all our experience with the staff was of the highest standard from check-in to check-out time. Concierge were great and always helpful. Would definitely stay here again - not only for the grandeur of the hotel but also the location. 
17193 Service was great. hotel room and view was gorgeous. They even let us leave our bags after check out in a stored secure area for free!!! Of coarse we had to tip the bell men. Still a great offer. 
17194 Stayed there a few weeks ago for a wedding. The attention to detail and the service were amazing! 
17195 The staff is friendly, helpful and responsive and the rooms are clean and attractive. It's a comfortable hotel in a great location. I stay here often and feel well taken care of. Would recommend as safe and pleasant hotel. 
17196 The location is great! The staff is very nice! Beware of the internet use fees. They charge 10 dollars per day per device. If you're in Chicago just to relax, I definitively recommend it. If you're there to do work, it may not be your best bet. 
17197 Right in the heart of times square. Couldn't be better. Good service and our room was nice. The place is HUGE so beware. Every room has a great view. Housekeeping was always accommodating. Nice hotel and staff and everything you want is at your fingertips. 
17198 Nice location, knew the room was smal - but the smell in the room were horrible. The airconditioning sound like ten wild horses were powering the machine - not nice if you prefer to sleep.! Shower and bathroom area are very nice and clean. 
17199 Everything was perfect. Cannot fault a single thing. 
17200 Convenient friendly place to stay for business in or around Union Square. Rooms are quite small, and noise was a bit of a problem. But overall OK. 
17201 We booked through Priceline and after reading a few reviews I was a little worried. However upon arrival I was happily surprised by the smiling faces awaiting us. The staff here is beyond helpful! I would love to stay here again :) 
17202 Excellent central location-less than 2 blocks from Times Square and Broadway, short walk (less than 10 min) to Rockefeller Center. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Recently renovated- everything was bright and clean. Nicely decorated room with modern furnishings. Definitely coming back! 
17203 There is nothing especially great or bad about this hotel. The location is good, and the rooms are nice. If the price is right, go for it. I can't think of any special that says "go here," but I can't think of any reason not to stay here. 
17204 Had a great stay at the Marriott Magnificent Mile. Staff is incredibly friendly. Location is awesome. So many great dining spots within walking distance. Absolutely no complaints!! 
17205 The front desk was outstanding. My reservation was complicated because it was broken into three parts that were paid for differently. The staff made the transition completely smooth. The hotel is very conviently located just steps from Times Square. 
17206 hotel con una zona accoglienza sfarzosa, pratica e concierge efficente; utile per il passaggio all'entrata il piumino ed il passamontagna, danger - aria condizionata a palla; ad eccezione di questo,tutto ok molto bello e pratico 
17207 Ottimo per chi si trova a new york in vacanza, vicinissimo alla metropolitana, zona tranquilla, poco rumorosa, camere non grandissime ma pulite, sempre cambi quotidiani, nelle vicinanze lavanderia, farmacia supermarket aperta 24 ore su 24 e tanti altri negozi, veramente ottimo per chi non cerca l'eccelso. 
17208 Positive: large and clean rooms, very good location (some steps from subway); Negative: some of people staff are unhelpful; bad lightning in the room 
17209 The location is great - close to tourist attractions, shopping, subway. The staff is very helpful, room great and we were surprised to receive an upgrade as a HHonors member and were able to see the Empire State Building from our room. 
17210 Great hotel- we had a small interraction with a bed bug but the staff dealt with it amazingly and I would go back. 
17211 For sure not a 4 atara hotel. Good location, but terrible service, and in front of the hotel had an alert of bugs and rats in the hotel. Rooms without a temperature control. 
17212 The hotel is placed in a very good location but the room is noisy and the bed is not as bit as the hyatt standard bed. 
17213 All the staff are very helpful , they cannot do enough for you. The rooms are very clean and comfortable. We found the hotel perectly located for exploring Times Sq,5th Ave and central Park, very close to subway to get to lower Manhatten etc. would recommend to anyone. 
17214 Great rooms and spacious bathrooms, fantastic service and thw best restaurant on S. Michigan Ave. The staff is delightful with an incredible sence of customer service 
17215 Great smiles and total knowledge of the local attractions. 
17216 The New Yorker Hotel is an awesome place to stay within the heart of Manhattan- just a couple of blocks away from the Empire State Buildung. The rooms a modern and comfortable. I also can recommend this hotel for business meetings or seminars. 
17217 Great location on 49th St in the heart of the Theater District. Our room was very small and looked out into a ventilation shaft. The Hotel has had its better days. Tiny elevator hardly accommodates 3 people. 
17218 This is a nice Westin in a good location. Easy walk to all that you want to do, yet quiet (for Chicago). Our room was clean, well appointed and had a nice view of the river. Service was average. 
17219 i stayed here with my husband, sons and friends last august the room very nice location fantastic for the sights in NY near Central Park, Time square, 5th avenue, museums, shops and department stores 
17220 Just spent two pretty depressing days at Soho Grand. Long dark corridors, really gloomy rooms ( tho bed was v comfortable!). Staff were charming, but that doesn't make up for the generally 'down' atmosphere of the place. Plenty of better places to chose in NYC. 
17221 All in all a quite good hotel. The lobby looks really good, shame the rooms are slightly older. Good staff, everything is workin, the rooms are large enough, and everything is working as it should. Location is brilliant. In short - recommended. 
17222 Location is great, room is clean and tidy. Pity that they didnt offer me a suite with park view. Down side is they don't have lounge for platinum members, which means no free breakfast~~~Overrall, it's much better than other hotels in NYC, such as Westin Time Square (small and noisy...) 
17223 we were served by natalie who was very nice, profesional and helped us out immediately with better rooms 
17224 great service, great staff and an amazing hotel. will be staying here again for sure. 
17225 Nice lobby but that's it. * small rooms * bed bugs * terrible shower * overall terrible value for money 
17226 Hotel un po' vecchiotto ma a 5 passi da Time Square. Camera quadrupla(2adulti + 2 bambini) spaziosa, pulita, bagno pulito con cambio giornaliero degli asiugamani. Piccolo problema con il WC risolto praticamente subito. Ottimo per chi usa l'hotel solo per dormire vista la posizione centrale e l'ottimo prezzo 
17227 This was my first time staying at this hotel, and I would definitely come back. The staff was incredibly friendly and helpful (especially Erica), the hotel rooms were very nice, and the food was great! I definitely recommend this hotel! 
17228 Rude staff; not a good value for the price; security check to go to your room; small & claustrophobic room; inconvenient bed; loud music from the bar on the first floor could be on the fourth floor late at night. Will not be going there again. 
17229 Assegnataci camera di livello inferiore a quella prenotata. Pulizia scarsa. Concierge sempre affollato. Personale impreparato. Camere rumorose. Anche con colazione "inclusa" quasi tutto era extra. 
17230 Great property. Beautiful building. Really nice suites. Well designed, high ceilings, complimentary fast internet. Room service fabulous. Excellent staff, friendly, efficient, very professional. 
17231 We stayed here three nights. The room was elegant, the beds comfortable, the staff very friendly and helpful, and the complimentary breakfast delicious (pastries and authentic italian coffee). The location was ideal for visiting New York City--in the theater district, near Times Square, Rockafeller Center, and the MoMa. 
17232 We stayed here for 5 nights in October 2004 and loved it. Very friendly staff, great location near the Soho/Little Italy area, good rates, very clean and well maintained. Rooms are small but you expect this in New York unless you wish to pay up. Will definitely go back. 
17233 Gute Lage im Theaterbezirks. 1/2 Block zu 2 Metro Stationen 8th Ave und Broadway 50th Street. Gehdistanz zu shopping am Broadway. Direkte Metro Verbindung nach JFK-Howard-Beach od JFK Archer Blvd ca 100 Min.. Metro + Bus nach LGA ca 80 Min. 
17234 great location, great room, helpful and friendly service, location, location, location and this is the only place to stay in time square. 
17235 We stayed here for the weekend. The rooms are beautiful and clean. The staff is very helpful and overall compared to other properties we felt the price paid was reasonable. 
17236 we needed a hotel with clean rooms-good service-reasonable room costs-and a good location -we got the whole package- needless to say we recomend the st.james hotel to one&all joan&tom 
17237 well everyone i saw was nice they smile and say hi to me Ms. Evelyn check us in and she was very helpful and she help us with all the question we had., you have a great hotel and i will let all my family and friend know about it. 
17238 Good value and great location for turkey day in NYC! Clean. Lots of kids in case that matters. Rooms typical. Right in the thick of things. Go see the ballon blow up the night before and make reservations on the patio to see the parade. Bring warmclothes. 
17239 ambiente caratteristico, buona ristrutturazione...camere singole create per una persona ma molto pulito e confortevole...bagno al piano sempre libero ed ineccepibile. posizionato benissimo. 
17240 over all good hotel, door staff and house keeping excelent. fantastic location, area great for eating out, easy to get downtown subway near by. only problem the front desk staff,they need to go to charm school badly. would recomend this hotel any time. 
17241 The staff is very friendly and willing to assist.The rooms are neat,clean with ample space.The location could not be better.We walked to many places for eating and entertainment.I have stayed at this hotel before and plan to return. 
17242 Really helpful staff! Great stay. they really have a great pool it's really pretty and when it's hot outside, its amazing 
17243 The entire hotel is very dull, the reception, corridors, even rooms! There is hardly any lights. The room was too small, there was no place for our 2 suitecases. The bathroom was unbelievingly small as well. Good location, but I still wouldn't recommend it. 
17244 very noisy room ( the hortel club closes at 4am!) district not very sure the night, not a lot to see, only Soho but it is not so near! The room was big, no view Shower and no bath (King room!) Staff not at the level Really disappointing experience 
17245 Very nice hotel, i went with my family on a short trip and enjoyed it a lot. The staff were very helpful, very nice and spacious room... I will defenitly come back. 
17246 Me and my family visited New York for leisure and booked into the Hampton Inn. The hotel was trendy, clean and the staff very help full! The breakfast was good. The hotel is excellent value for money! 
17247 Sohotel is a good hotel in New York value price-quality. The hotel is very clean and the sleep quality is very good. The location is in Little Italy, just between the centre and the south of Manhatten.The free coffee in the hotel every morning is excellent. 
17248 This is our most frequent place to stay when visiting NYC. Great location just off Times Square and only a few blocks from Restaurant Row. Be sure to try the Edison Cafe, the ultimate NY experience. By NY standards, the rates are reasonable. 
17249 The hotel is very clean, nice location to Times Square.......but our room was on the 2 floor and we we're with kids of 5 and 8 years old.....we didn't slep well because of the music. We asked to be move and the answer was NO........... 
17250 Located not too far from Times Square (about a 10-minute walk). Very clean, friendly staff, slightly dated hotel but still very serviceable and good value for money. Stayed here on business trip and had no complaints. Internet service was spotty. 
17251 The Hotel is very well located. The room was clean although the bathroom does not have good ventilation. I felt very confortable walking around the hotel area even late at night.Staff were OK. Good for its price... 
17252 Visite este hotel en el mes de noviembre, con todo el parque michigan nevado, frente al hotel. Una maravilla. Volveria sin dudarlo, comodo, lujoso, escenario de muchisimas peliculas. Me fascino chicago, su gente y este hotel. 
17253 small rooms, but comfortable, quiet, clean with all the amenities. The location is great to walk to everything in lower Manhattan and close to the subway. Can't beat that on a short trip. 
17254 Sofitel is well situated and with excellent service makes a great place to stay in NY. 
17255 First time in NY. Get room upgrated to suite 
17256 Very quite, perfect locations in the middel of everything 
17257 Had a brief stay in New York the day before Thanksgiving, 2010. The room was clean and nice. Everything in the bathroom worked. The staff was nice and helpful. Ink48 was perfect. 
17258 We stayed here for a couple of nights - interesting hotel in a great location with really helpful staff. The lounge is a very welcome benefit as is the delicious free breakfast. 
17259 Een zeer onpersoonlijk hotel maar wel van veel gemakken voorzien.Schone kamers, gratis Koffie/Thee/Water op iedere etage. Prima bedden en mooi centraal gelegen. In- en uitchecken per computer. Soms wat lang wachten op de lift. Eten in het restaurant goed. 
17260 Unfortunately, this is a hotel that has lost its glamour. The doormen and concierge act more like thugs then hotel staff. Not very helpful, especially upon arrival. If you're a New Yorker, maybe ok, but if you have travelled, expect less than first class. 
17261 While the hotel could use some updating, overall it was clean and has a great location. Really the only negative was that the beds were small, my feet were hanging off..I shopped around online and this hotel was the best value by far. 
17262 This hotel was fab. Location is amazing, 2 minute walk from Empire State Building, and Macy's, close enough to walk to Times Square and Theatre District. Bed were so comfy. Rooms very nicley decorated too. 
17263 I've stayed at the Michelangelo several times, the rooms are always clean, on the larger side and the staff is very friendly and helpful. 
17264 This is a regular stop during my trips to Houston. It's always a pleasant experience - the hotel is appointed very well, kept clean, and has really nice people working there. The breakfast buffet is excellent, and the restaurant and room service have plenty of choices. 
17265 Great welcome; nice and cozy room; very good club lounge; excellent fitness center 
17266 Would recommend this hotel to anyone, in fact have already! Great location, great decor and great staff, what more does one need for a perfect stay. Room was ample size and bed super comfortable. Will most certainly chose The Maritime on my next New York holiday! Well done. 
17267 Great hotel, nice decor, clean and spacious (for New York at least)! The evening drinks in reception were also a nice touch. The location is handy for anywhere in Manhattan too. 
17268 Stayed there once during my first time in NY. Quite a basic hotel, with nothing fancy. Rooms are more to the small side but at least they are clean. Excellent location thought since it only 10 minutes walk from Times Square 
17269 Rooms were small and nothing special but locaiton was perferct. Price was good versus other hotels. Use window AC units that are loud. 
17270 We were very pleased with the funky decor, obliging staff and a super location close to the shopping and amusement action and a short walk from the lakeshore beach. SIR KENNETH BLOOMFIELD, NORTHERN IRELAND 
17271 Spent my birthday here, great location next to the water and fun local attractions (Kemah). Front desk staff extremely friend and helpful when I checked in. Great spot to just hang out. Hotel Decor interesting, not my cup of tea. 
17272 Fantastic location, we could walk everywhere.The rooms were basic but clean -made up every day and towels changed. The shared bathrooms were spotless and again were cleaned every day, as one would expect. 
17273 All I'm going to say is the SAME grilled cheese sandwich was sitting outside in the hall on a room service tray for THREE days. That's nasty. And I know the staff walked past it several times throughout the day. Nasty. 
17274 The London is a great hotel. What's better is should you decide to stay in your room for a day, you can - in comfort and elegance. Great job! This hotel is like home away from home! 
17275 Good value for money. Location is close to subway stations, making it easy to move around. Rooms are of reasonable size (for NY even good), clean and comfortable. Maybe breakfast does not make it into the top 10. 
17276 We stayed at The Beekman for 5 nights 16/11/04 -21/11/04. Very friendly staff. superb room and facilities. Great location. Well done Beekman. 
17277 The hotel was beautiful. Rooms were a good size with a fantastic view of Times Square! The hotel is centrally located in the Times Square area of Manhattan. Great hotel for first trip to NYC! 
17278 We had a nice stay, clean and good sized room. We found it to be a good walking location for most areas. Easy to get a cab or limo out front. 
17279 A very busy hotel, quite manic in the reception area but in a good location just a walk away from many tourist spots. The room was ok and surprisingly quiet. Expensive, but so are most things in NYC. 
17280 people in the front desk speak english ans portuguese. They are nice and helpful. Rooms are small, but clean and efficient. wifi and safe in the room. 
17281 I came to this hotel recommended by an expert in the hotel industry and he was right Everything was perfect and the amenities unexpected we received embroidered pillow cases with our initials We couldn't believe it Very good option for business and family travel 
17282 Positives: Great location, central to everything, nice safe area.. Nice sized room very geared towards business travellers (which we weren't), very clean, nice friendly staff. Negatives: A lot of noisy children in the pool area but this was just our bad luck... 
17283 Stayed at this hotel with my sister to celebrate her birthday. It is in a wonderful location, near Times Square but not in the heart of all the chaos. The hotel was beautiful and clean and the staff were helpful. I would stay here again. 
17284 We really enjoyed our three night stay at the Kitano. The staff was consistently friendly and helpful. It was quiet and we slept well. Will definitely return. 
17285 The mony saved on this Courtyard can get you a very good meal or a Broadway ticket. Very comfortable room and staff was very courteous. 
17286 Very comfortable room ,clean bathroom .Very good located .Friendly staff 
17287 Well positioned, attentive staff and well maintained, clean hotel. Enjoyed the city and enjoyed the hotel too. Suitable for a whole range of travellers 
17288 Not much to say. It is a beautiful modern hotel in New York City. Pricey, but I got a decent discount from a hotel web site. The subway is not close, you will need to use the bus, cab, or feet to get to the subway. 
17289 Extremely professional service. The manager (Juniors ) was extremely helpful and professional. The rooms were a little small, but its a new hotel and we were provided a room on the top most floor( 25 th) 
17290 Comfy bed, very very clean room and bathroom. 
17291 awesome service...stylish & modern rooms...amazing views of Times Square... 
17292 This is a great place to stay if you are visiting NY and going to Broadway plays. The front desk staff and housekeeping were very helpful in making sure our stay was comfortable. The room was clean and we had a great view of the Hudson River. 
17293 very easy to reach after a long walk in manhattan surprised by the continuous cleaniness of shared restrooms 
17294 Excellent service and super clean rooms. Management was very helpful and knowledgable 
17295 Good location. Close to Herald Square when you can shop till you drop. Only a few blocks from the West Village 
17296 Close to Times Square, Theater District, Central Park and tons of restaurants. Walkable to Fox Studios and NBC as well. Hotel was clean and the staff were pleasant. Typical sized room. Bathrooms a little small. Only 2 elevators that were fairly slow. Area for coffee and refrigerator and sink. 
17297 This recently renovated Hyatt has the best trained staff in my recent memory of hotels worldwide. It was a pleasure to stay there for four nights over the Holidays. 
17298 E' un hotel per lunghi soggiorni, la reception ad una certa ora chiude, per parlare con qualcuno dovete suonare il campanello. La pulizia della camera va pagata a parte. Ho trovato le lenzuola sporche, probabilmente non sono state cambiate. Se potete evitate. 
17299 Great little hotel with a wonderful restaurant. Three couples travelling together did not agree on everything, but we did agree Melo was really a good choice. The Bistro next door (part of Melo) was terrific and one block from Time Square!! 
17300 Location is excellent, right by Times Square. I could not find any fault with the hotel and the staff were so friendly and helpful. It has a family atmosphere rather than the usual staff/guest approach. I look forward to staying at the Paramount again as soon as possible. 
17301 Was at the Radisson for 5 days for work in NY and its a very good hotel, well located in the Central East Side in Manhattan... Lack of wifi in the rooms is a pain and the service could get better but all in all a great experience. 
17302 PERSONALE DISPONIBILE-BELLA GRANDE E PULITA LA CAMERA- ABBONDANTE, OTTIMA E A BUON PREZZO LA COLAZIONE - POSIZIONE ECCELLENTE E STRATEGICA - STRADA CON RISTORANTI, SUPERMERCATO, E ALTRE POSSIBILITA' DI PASTI. DA RITORNARCI!!!!! 
17303 My husband and I spent a night at the hotel with our family. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were modern and very comfortable. The pool was great and not expected for a NYC hotel. It was in a great location for restaurants and shopping. 
17304 Had a room with two queens, not a large room, only chair in room was desk chair, very comfy beds, 24 hour coffee in lobby, only about 7 or 8 rooms per floor very quiet. Easy walk to Broadway area, or just hang out in Bryant Park. 
17305 great location, didn't even have to take the subway 
17306 Best hotel ever!! felt like a princess!!! Huge rooms and amazing decor inside, beautiful, drinks expectedly pricey in hotel though 
17307 From the gorgeous lobby to the considerate staff in the concierge lounge, it was a great stay. The Palmer House is convenient to the State Street shops. It is also near Berghoff's, a wonderful German restaurant. 
17308 Room not clean, small room, small double bed, no tea/coffee facilities in room, staff not serviceminded, Club5000 breakfast very poor and served in a small untidu room, no free internet, luggagestorge at a cost of 4 dollars a piece, long wait for check-in. 
17309 Clean, spacious and trendy. Location was good and customer service was fine. Little concerned walking back at night as the area between the Subway and the hotel was a questionable but never had any issues. The kids loved the shower head in the bathroom. 
17310 My first stay while here on business was a good one. I got a large suite overlooking the river. The lobby was nice and although I didn't try the bar it looked pretty cool. Great location with lots of nearby restaurants. 
17311 right in the centre of all the main attractions a great place to stay 
17312 well worth having breakfast in the resturant as you look over times square and plan your day 
17313 Nice stuff. Great location. a little $$$ though. Will stay again. 
17314 Had a great time in NEW yORK. The Hilton was excellent. Clean well appointed room. We stayed on the 38th floor in a corner room with king bed. Great bed, great view. I would definately stay here again. 
17315 Publick armas ok, but the room totally run down. Wall paper loose with mold behind. Awoid. 
17316 My overall experience was wonderful, this is my 4th year staying here at the Double Tree for this annual event. My room location was excellent and convenient to exits, lobby, ice machine, etc. Even though the hotel was being renovated, I felt safe and comfortable. 
17317 muy centrico, incluye desayuno, con pub, piscina cubierta abierta 24 h y gimnasio Muy moderno y actual 
17318 Es un hotel clasico pero acogedor, la verdad es que no tiene grandes lujos pero es un buen hotel. En recepcion te hablan en castellano y te faciliitan mucho las cosas. 
17319 The rooms are SMALL, which is normal in the city. The room was clean and the shower was great! Next time I need to stay in the city I'll be back to the Astor. 
17320 My sons took me to NYC for my birthday and we stayed at the Waldorf. Everything about it was first rate! A wonderful extra was the Sunday morning brunch, I have never seen better. The only hotel room I have ever stayed in, that had it's own doorbell. 
17321 My room was tiny and poorly maintained. The closet had no shelves. Decor attempts to look contemporary and stylish but fails at cheesy and trying too hard. Staff were really unhelpful. Breakfast consisted of a poor selection of deli food. 
17322 I have stayed at the Palmer House twice before and this stay was as nice as before. The class, the cleanliness, the atmospher and location are all supurb! I will continue to use the Palmer House for my visits to Chicago. I just wish they were a bit more economical. 
17323 Very accomodating staff during each of the 6 to 8 times I stay each year. My stays are usually for two nights and any concern that I may have - needing a larger room, etc. - is always addressed to my satisfaction. 
17324 This is an excellent place to stay. Food is somewhat spendy but good. 
17325 This place is perfect for family looking for Times Square location. Rooms are large and clean, but the bellhops and luggage guys were the best in NYC, two thumbs up!! 
17326 The lobby was a bit small but when I went to my room it was very clean and comfortable. My girlfriend is a bit fussy but she had a wonderful time and loved walking to times square. The staff were so helpful and friendly.....definitely coming back this summer!!! 
17327 We stayed at Ink48 in April for a quick weekend trip to see a Broadway Show. The location was great for Broadway, but a bit off the beaten path for other destinations. The hotel is beautiful and rooms are very comfortable and the upper floor views have awesome views. 
17328 Have to agree with previous reviews complementing this outstanding hotel. Couldn't have asked for more. We requested a deluxe and quiet room and we were completely satisfied with the Casalanca. We will be back !!!! 
17329 bell'albergo, moderno e con camere ampie e con bellissima vista su Empire e Chrysler. 10 minuti a piedi da Grand Central e 15 da Time Square. Colazione costosa meglio andare nei tanti bar che si trovano. Personale cortese e sorridente, se torno a Manhattan torno al Millenium 
17330 Perfect location for a visit to NYC. Very close to the subway. A quick walk to Central Park, Broadway shows, great restaurants and tons of shopping. The hotel was very clean and comfortable. Every employee we encountered was friendly and helpful. Loved our stay. My new favorite hotel in NYC!! 
17331 My Stay at the Chicago Hilton and towers was very pleasent...very nice and they offered great entertainment they have an indoor pool and 2 hottubbs.....was about 10 minutes from the beach me and a freind walked not bad at all... the service was great thank you staff!! 
17332 My sister in law gave us a night at the crowne plaza times square as a gift and it was amazing! the staff are friendly and the rooms are great. We had a fantastic view of times square, we couldn't ask for more 
17333 Sono stato a NY la settimana scorsa. Hotel di vecchio stampo ma pulito; alla reception Antonio e Rocco favolosi parlanti italiano ma per il resto personale musone e scorbutico senza un filo di sorriso. Posizione ottima e centrale, colazione discreta. Sauna e massaggi sono gestiti da cinesi a caro prezzo. 
17334 Can not imagine staying anywhere else. The staff was so courteous, helpful and friendly. The room, location and overall service was excellent. Not one complaint. 
17335 Situato in una posizione perfetta, con una vista indimenticabile su Central Park. Personale ovunque gentilissimo. Stanza spaziosa e bene attrezzata. Tutto perfetto per una vacanza bella e "riposante". 
17336 THIS IS THE WORST HOTEL I HAVE EVER STAYED AT. No one had a clue what was going on. The rooms are extremely small and very noisy!!!!!!!!!! 
17337 The hotel was clean, staff was friendly, cost was less expensive than other area hotels, noise level was great (although we had neighbors we did not hear them), checkout was effortless (less than 1 minute), valet was prompt. Would highly recommend. 
17338 I would definitely stay again in this hotel! Excelent location, close to all the subway lines, clean room, enough space for two people, great shower. It has everything you need in a NY vacation 
17339 Stayed for another week at The Bowery in NYC. Another brilliant stay, service was brilliant, and the room was extremely comfortable, quiet and spacious. The Italian food at Gemma was amazing as always. Would highly recommend and I keep returning to this brilliant boutique hotel. 
17340 Just got back from a weeks stay. Hotel was comfortable and staff very helpful. Food in the bar was great and the service second to none. Good location with subway and restaurants very close. Would stay there again. 
17341 Great architecture, wonderful view and very well located. I`ll recommend The Standard Hotel to my friends 
17342 We loved the location of the Roosevelt as it was within easy reach of most major attractions. We would stay there again upon our return to NYC. 
17343 The Mandarin NYC is definitely one of the best hotel I've stayed at, the lobby is spectacular and the service was great, and the rooms and hotel in general is modern and has a very good energy to it. It is truly a luxury 5 star hotel. 
17344 Perfect location, a few blocks from training site. Neat, clean, quiet (air conditioner blocked street noise.). Shared bath was always empty. Is a sturdy old queen of a building, a tiny bit worn at the heels but a delightful dance. 
17345 Arrived Jetlagged from Europe and took shuttle bus on a short journey to get here. The pillows were the best of our trip. Location convenient for getting to airport, and for getting L from Cumberland to downtown for sightseeing. Bar and restaurant not very exciting, but were sufficient. 
17346 This hotel was great. The decor makes you feel like a VIP when you walk in. I might have to visit Houston again just to stay at this hotel! 
17347 We stayed three nights in their cozy beds. The desk staff resolved paperwork issues quickly and professionally. Great-looking place. Pleasant and happening neighborhood. Close enough for a jog in central park. We would definitely stay there again. 
17348 Hi there. Spent a week here in February with my son. Excellent location. Free coffee all day. Staff are very friendly and helpful. I will stay here again and recommend it to anyone. Rooms are not huge but plenty of space and very clean. 
17349 If you find a smart price is very good value for money! Quite good overall! 
17350 The rooms are large and clean. We had breakfast and afternoon tea - both were great. The only reason we did not give the hotel 5 stars is because upon checkout we had to wait 45 minutes (or more) for our car (we did call ahead). 
17351 A low budget hotel at a perfect location, only a few blocks from Times Square. The staff is very kind and helpful. The hotel, including the room, was always very clean. 
17352 A good place for a quick visit at a great value we traveled with kids and pets we all had a good visit. 
17353 The room was very cozy, but the set-up worked perfect for us. The bed was fabulous!!! We would stay here again in a minute!! 
17354 Nice hotel, good value. I had problems with internet in my room but they fixed it. Friendly staff. 
17355 Very nice hotel, Great Staff!!! I higly recommend this hotel to everyone who travels to Chicago. Supper!!!! 
17356 The hotel service was with one exception not competent in information of neigbourhods and the room it self is tiny. Moreover there is not possibility for breakfast at the hotel, even not at one expenses. 
17357 great location by subway and close to times square,broadway shows, etc. We walked to Central Park and back. The breakfast was very busy so go early. It is a bit pricey for a Hampton, but worth it for the great location 
17358 The staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was large and clean. The breakfast buffet was great! The waffles were world class! The location at 47th and Broadway is perfect or a New York weekend. 
17359 I spent quite a while shopping around for a central NYC hotel. I picked this one and was very happy with it. Reasonable prices, amazing location, friendly staff, and decent enough breakfast. Will be my first pick when I go back. 
17360 Very happy with our choice of motel Stan the bus driver was awesome. We recently stayed at La quinta in Manhattan and was equally pleased. The service to & from hotel was prompt and well done. We will be using your hotels again soon. 
17361 Great location - near Michigan right off Wacker. Concierge was AWESOME! Very helpful. 
17362 The property is in a good location. Close to the theatre's and Time Square.The hotel is new and quite clean.The breakfast is a great added value.There are also many good restaurants nearby on 9th ave. 
17363 Get a corner room... After a night in the city, looking out over 9/11 memorial project, statue of liberty, etc... Just really beautiful. Far from the theater district - but close enough to little Italy and soho. Big, clean rooms with great views at a good value 
17364 Amazing hotel in the perfect location. Executive rooms are definitely the only way to go. Lift is a little slow but it's great. I have stayed here about 5 times and will always return. Great value for money 
17365 Entree un peu deroutante. Excellente ambiance. Bar pour petit dejeuner tres reussi et convivial. Petite chambre avec probleme radiateur bruyant et inreglable et vitre qui ne s'ouvre pas. DOnc trop chaud. Pour le prix, on oublie la situation (112th st)et Sud Harlem a trois blocs. TAxi n'aima pas trop. 
17366 We got a great deal on Travelzoo and couldn't resist. Clean, comfortable, good breakfast in the AM, quiet room, close to the heart of NYC. Pool, sauna and steam room was a perfect way to unwind after some chilly weather walking. A perfect stay. 
17367 The gentleman at the reception desk, Warren, was very kind to us when we checked in. It was a horrible rainy day and my sister and I were exhausted. Warren helped. The room was pleasant. We were only there for one night so I have nothing else to say. 
17368 This hotel is in a great location and was very clean. The lobby area is beautiful. Our room was well-appointed with a huge king-size bed. The only problem was the very slow elevators. If you're going to a meeting, give yourself extra time or just take the stairs. 
17369 The hotel is contemporary, clean, comfortable and in a nice location. The gym and lake view were our favorite parts. Love being on the treadmill looking out on Navy Pier and the lake. 
17370 I stayed here for my birthday and it was a great experience. The room was very clean & up-to-date! The staff was very friendly & the service was very prompt. It's a great location and I am planning on staying here again. 
17371 The room door had a gap between the door and the frame that was nearly a half an inch and we could see the light in the hallway through it. Also, the door to the outside had the latch taped off, so it slammed every time someone let it close. 
17372 Lobby was somewhat confusing, My room was on the 12th floor and there were no signs directing me where to go. Overall, comfy and clean but the elevator was quite a walk away from our room. 
17373 One of the best Kimpon Hotels I visited. Only 4 blocks from Penn Station. I got a room with full view of the Empire State Building. Extremely clean. Wonderful service. 
17374 I was very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Its rooms were nice and clean, its location great and staff above par. All in all, a great deal I'd recommend anyone visiting NYC and wanting to spend more money on seeing the city than on a fancy hotel. 
17375 I used Marriott points to get a room for my wife and two girls, so they could see Wicked. They loved the hotel, very chic. There isn't a better location in Manhattan to stay. Easy public transportation all around. 
17376 This hotel is one of the most comfortable hotel I've stayed in. Great beds, large rooms, great facilities, friendly service. By far the best hotel I've stayed in during my visits in New York City. 
17377 Reserved a family suite with coffee pot, refrigerator, etc. Got a small two room suite with none of the items listed on the web site, not even a table with chairs. Bathroom small. Price high for what you get. 
17378 Excellent location and spacious rooms. Breakfast Buffet was pricey but not unexpected for Times Square. Better off grabbing breakfast at Junior's across the street. 
17379 Great location with subway just across the street...Cozy but comfortable and clean room...Character and charm of New York for reasonable price in Midtown...Staff ready to answer questions and check in was smooth... 
17380 Centrally located in the Galleria shopping area, this hotel is great. Clean, spacious room; friendly staff; and easy parking. Quiet rooms and ample closet space. I will certainly stay here again. 
17381 Albergo particolare, tecnologico. Pregi posizione eccellente e colazione, di fatto inclusa nel prezzo. Grosso difetto stanza veramente piccola, impossibile posizionare vestiti fuori dalle valigie. Il bagno e' senza porte ma con tenda, tipo cabina da nave da crociera. 
17382 The Carlyle is an Upper East Side tradition. The staff was friendly and efficient, and we especially enjoyed Bemelman's Bar with the Chris Gillespie Trio playing. 
17383 The service in this hotel was brilliant, but I must admit I was disappointed by the state of the furniture. The sofa was grubby as were the cushions on the bed. For the price I was expected something spectacular. The fantastic service made up for it however. 
17384 Comfortable hotel, good for a day use (not bad at $139 plus tax), just inside the airport, corridors and public areas could use a litte refreshing. Wi-fi for free from neighboring ATT hub, air conditioning not working properly (not indispensable), single-glazing windows yet not noisy. Corteous staff. 
17385 Certamente un albergo storico e lussuoso...ma una ristrutturazione alle camere non guasterebbe. Ad ogni modo ottima posizione centrale, ottimi ristoranti. 
17386 Pretty clean. A comfortable king bed. Quiet. Decent breakfast. Have troubles to find the hotel with my GPS. 
17387 Beautiful, clean, helpful staff - luxury services available. The best yummy beds -Can't wait to stay again. 
17388 You cant really go wrong! I think the hotel had been newly refurbished when we went... rooms were great, service was great, location was amazzzing. The only thing I'd say was that rates were quite high, but that seems to be the norm in NY. Would definitely go back. 
17389 The Hotel was perfect for me. I travel on business often to New York 
17390 Felt like a received a good value. Staff friendly. Easy cab to work. Plenty of choices for dinner in the area. Would recommend 
17391 As everyone says it's a very good deal (clean, good location), but unlike others we had a very small room with a dito bathroom, which was ok for a few days. I can immagine that "bigger" people face difficulties in this particular room. 
17392 Enjoyed the stay there with friends, although we weren't really in the hotel that long. Service, cleanliness are good. Location is great. 
17393 the best hotel, the best service. perfect! Strongly recommend it, its got lots of history and Oscars is one of the best restaurants ive gone to. 
17394 Great Hotel, Good location. check in smooth, hotel lobby just right level of ambience. Rooms very large for Chicago, nice flat screen LG TV, shower and Bath. Great views of the Lake. 
17395 The W awakens the senses and blends well with the greatness of downtown Chicago. Laurelin was great and offered excellent tips on how to enjoy a short stay. I enjoyed dining at IPO, the hotel's restaurant. My only complaint is that the snacks in the room should be complementary. 
17396 We stayed here over Christmas and had the most fantastic time. The location is great, the staff were extremely helpful and the hotel itself was luxurious. The bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in! If we ever go to NY again we would most definitely stay here again. 
17397 Room quality, hotel service, sleep quality, location.... All perfect. If you stay here you will not be disappointed. Fantastic fine dining also on tap if you want it. We really enjoyed it and would go again for sure! 
17398 The hotel has a cool lobby and bar upstairs. The rooms are really nice and the location is great. You are in walking distance of many restaurants, shopping, etc. 
17399 Yes the rooms were a "little" worn, but not that bad at all... All rooms have a FULL kitchen and refrigerator and are pretty good size. The LOCATION is PERFECT !! VERY VERY close to the Galleria area, and very good access to downtown. Would probably stay here again... 
17400 Stayed at the Algonquin 12/19/03 to 12/16/03. The staff were outstanding, the lobby, bar, and dining were superior. The room was cozy, clean and charming with down pillows (at my request). A very European hotel in the center of the action in New York City. I loved it! 
17401 Nice hotel, very good room but also very small. Cordial staff, good breakfast. Location is a little bit far from attractions, but good neighborhood with lot options to eat. 
17402 ABBIAMO PRESO UNA SUITE, E SIAMO STATI BENISSIMO,LA POSIZIONE E' OTTIMA LE CAMERE SONO GRANDI E C'E' PURE LA CUCINA ( HO 2 BIMBI )SOTTO L'ALBERGO C'E' UN RISTORANTE ITALIANO CHE CUCINA BENISSIMO E PIU' AVANTI SI PUO' GUSTARE UNA TIPICA COLAZIONE AMERICANA....OTTIMO DA CONSIGLIARE 
17403 Just like many prior reviews stated, it is a modern hotel in a terrific location. We had the AAA with breakfast promotion and thus made for a great deal. The room was in a corner on a higher floor. 
17404 Fabulous location across the street from Lincoln Center...smallish rooms and bathrooms (shower only), but that seems to be the NYC norm...very comfortable bed, friendly and accommodating staff (we arrived very late after flights canceled from Boston), reasonable prices. Would definitely stay here again. 
17405 Top of the line for the La Quinta chain, expanded breakfast options including hot items. 
17406 Ni ce clean inexpensve hotel with Extremely friendly staff. If you are looking for reccommendations from the staff ask Kevin Rowe..........for all his reccommendations for food. 
17407 Das Hotel ist sicherlich einfach. Man sollte aber nicht vergessen, was Hotels in dieser Lage normalerweise kosten. Die Sauberkeit ist top. Wer mit Toilette und Bad im Flur leben kann, ist hier gut aufgehoben 
17408 First visit to NYC and was very happy with the hotel staff and our 1 bedroom room. Location is close to Grand Central so using the subway system is a breeze, walk to Times Square, restaurants, and grocery stores nearby. Great Value and have no hesitation in recommending. 
17409 There are painfully few opportunities to stay in a property like this. Totally accessible, really great staff, it was a pleasure. The food was delicious and I would recommend this place to anyone. Why stay at a hotel when you can stay at a mansion?! 
17410 Close to all the main attractions in NY and very helpful and attentive service. Only downfall are the thin bed sheets which left us very cold at night !!! Not a grand hotel however, reasonably priced - you get what you paid for !!! 
17411 We stayed for 9 days, so we truly had a chance to test the service at the Millenium. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. We would stay again -- and would recommend to friends. We stayed on the 36th floor, renovated room, spacious for a NY hotel room. 
17412 The NY Hilton is a class act! very nice staff.Clean rooms,VERY comfortable beds! When I mentioned that my wife and I were there for our anniversary they gave us an upgrade to the executive level rooms.Great view on the 39th floor.very nice hotel! 
17413 My favorite hotel in New York City. The rooms are large and very nicely decorated, the restaurant, Insienne, is wonderful, and, most importantly, the staff couldn't be nicer. Walter at the front desk always recognizes me and makes it a pleasure to check-in !! 
17414 Hotel is close to everything and a great value! My family loved the two room suite so there can be some separation from each other! 
17415 I got a great rate ($189/night) via Playbill and impeccable, hassle-free service. This is a great location with very quiet rooms, perfect for seeing Broadway shows and Times Square. 
17416 Excellent location and service....the only knock on the hotel is that the rooms are slightly dated. Smallish bathrooms with tub-shower combos, but the slightly dated decor is well compensated by the location and service offered. Great fitness center here, as well. Will return. 
17417 The concierge at W hotel, her name is Lauren Oosterlinck, was the best concierge I have ever experienced! She was extremely helpful and positive, and made our stay even better. A good concierge makes a good hotel :-) 
17418 Stayed at The London to celebrate my daughter's 21st birthday.We really enjoyed our stay, location,staff & suite excellent. The beds were so comfortable & everything spotless. Had brunch at the Maze, great experience. We would definitely recommend this hotel. 
17419 the reception is very classy and original, the design of the entire place is top, its very cool at night, they have a club disco bar, and the brakfist is fantastic 
17420 Despite being evacuated due to Hurricane Irene, our experince at this hotel was great. Staff was super friendly and very helpful. Rooms were quite small but new and nicely appointed. Elevators were small and a bit slow. Free breakfast was marginal at best. 
17421 Always enjoy my stay here. Won't stay anywhere else! Close to everything I enjoy in New York. Very impressed with staff's attention to detail. Men at the door were very kind to get me a cab too - much appreciated!! 
17422 Great place to stay for a weekend trip. Small lobby area small bar, No FREE wireless internet. But overall it's a great place. 
17423 Nice location next to Grand Central and midtown events. We walked to Central Park, it wasn't that bad of a walk. 
17424 First time to Chicago would recommend Embassy Suites Downtown. Lovely comfortable beds, brilliant breakfast, friendly and helpful staff. Perfect location for 7 day family holiday would have no hesitation in booking again. 
17425 Clean neat. Here is my problem...not greeted as we got out of taxi. Nobody greeted us first time there didn't know to take elevator. Room clean. Really my problem was for the price I felt like I might as well be a ghost. No personal service and expensive 
17426 I chose this hotel as its reasonably priced and has an airport shuttle. The room was large, comfortable, clean and nicely furnished. There is a gas station next door which sells Pizzas etc if you need to grab something to eat. Overall, a good choice! 
17427 room was very large by NY standards. Clean, beautiful linens, comfortable bed, and wonderful staff. 
17428 Stayed here for four nights, $80/night on Priceline - incredible for Midtown. Room was clean, staff friendly - all good. 
17429 I love the W. I find the detail of design great and they go above and beyond with their level of service. 
17430 Our overall stay was great. The maid on Sunday was not as efficient as the one on monday. Also need better tv service. Couldn't get local CBS channel. But other than that it was a good time. 
17431 This is the SEXIEST hotel in new york at the moment. The hotel GREAT, scene GREAT, and the people GREAT. If you are a downtown person the location is the best and the property is beautiful. I will try the Miami location in Jan for new years. 
17432 Just stayed recently at the Palace for the 2nd time in 8 months and was thoroughly impressed both times. Very nice amenities, great staff, and close to the heart of it all. Looking forward to another visit soon! 
17433 We had only 2 nights in New York City and were grateful we picked this hotel because of its wonderful location. The rooms were compact but comfortable and all the staff we encountered were polite and obliging. 
17434 Net hotel met ideale ligging, metro/groot busstation en rondvaartboot op loopafstand.Evenals Times Square. Vanaf het zwembadje zelfs uitzicht op het Empire State Building. Ontbijtgelegenheid(prima!)direct naast het hotel. Helemaal niks op aan te merken. 
17435 This hotel is located close to both Mag Mile and State Street shopping. It is moderately priced and very clean. The staff is both friendly and helpful. 
17436 Not a bad hotel could do with redecorating the rooms as the decor looked very tired. The plumbing could do with updating as it was very old and noisey. The good thing was it was close to the Empire State Building and the major department stores. 
17437 A nice little, reasonably-priced (for NYC) hotel in the absolute heart of Chelsea. 100+ cool restaurants within 10 block raduis. Room very comfortable and quiet. Well appointed and modern, with stylish bathrooms tho no tub. For the money, I highly recommend it and will return when in NYC. 
17438 A bit to stiff when traveling with teenagers. Excellent for a business trip, though. Good service, good rooms. 
17439 The staff was so friendly at this hotel. Our rooms were nice, not exceptional, but very nice. Right in between Millenium Park and the river. Would definitely stay here again! 
17440 We have just returned to London with our 4 children after a wonderful stay at the Peninsula during Christmas. The Concierges were informative and very helpful. The rooms were excellent and housekeeping 5*. The hotel is in the BEST location for shopping and restaurants. 
17441 Great hotel. very clean and nice location and friendly staff 
17442 We loved out stay. It's the perfect Location - right around the corner from Penn Station, the Empire State Building and Broadway, Clean, comfortable rooms and great FREE breakfast. 
17443 Our room was small, but comfortable and spotless. The bed was so comfortable that I called the hotel after returning home to find out the brand. I wanted that bed at my house! Staff was helpful and friendly. Great location. 
17444 Great Location - Midtown South - with helpful staff. Hotel is situated in Midtown South with easy Subway Access - short walk to Times Square and just steps away from Hells Kitchen - (lots of great dining options very close by too) 
17445 My hotel stay was amazing, so was the service, so were the people! Location is ideal because it's very close to everything. Advise everyone to experience this hotel. The Inc lounge was awesome and so was the restaurant Serafina. 
17446 Right up to the Sofitel mark. Great rooms, warm welcome, good food and five minute walk from Times Square. 
17447 Friendly staff. Good value. Enjoy a clean comfortable stay. Wonderful shower and nice little lobby bar. Highly recommend. Really enjoyed the doorman : ) "showtine" 
17448 De ligging van het hotel is super. Toen wij aankwamen, was 1 lift niet in gebruik, dit is verholpen en beide liften werken nu. Wij hadden een kamer aan de achterkant van het hotel en totaal geen last van lawaai. Deze kamer was groot, een prima bed en badkamer. 
17449 Prima hotel. Gedeelde badkamer was altijd schoon en altijd vrij. Gelegen aan een rustige straat. Op enige afstand van de belangrijke bezienswaardigheden: het hotel ligt tussen Midtown en Downtown. Goed bereikbaar met metro via Union Square. Aanrader voor rustige nachten in de drukke stad tegen een relatief voordelig tarief. 
17450 It's a nice hotel. The rooms are clean, and the service is very good. It was significantly cheaper than some of the more expensive ones in the city. I thought it was a great value. 
17451 I love this hotel because of the location, staff and the overall service. I stay here often and wouldn't choose any other hotel. Very friendly staff! 
17452 The views are great. The restaurant is pricey and average. 
17453 Love this hotel, older property, has character, very well maintained, can't beat location. Continental breakfast is absolute best, friendly staff. Excellent value for money. 
17454 I've found Sofitel to be reliable worldwide and the NYC Sofitel is no exception. Location is great to 5th avenue and Times Square. Beds are comfortable. Very clean and euro modern. Bar was exceptional. Great Service all around. Nice size rooms. Will stay again! 
17455 near everything ,good food in the tick tock diner , clean rooms little bit small , but hey who goes to new york to sit in a room , only down side had to ask for tea and coffee making facilities 
17456 I was here for almost 3 weeks for business. Great location! Walked everywhere with short cab rides intermixed. Room was clean and modern. The staff was extremely accommodating. I would stay here again for sure! 
17457 Very good hotel. Very nice clean room that was good size and appropriately clean. Excellent location close to michigan and parks. 15 min walk to clark/lake subway to get direct line to ohare. Hotel was lacking just those small things tha would make it a 5. 
17458 Relatively recent refurb, and scaffolding still around the block. Reasonable size standard room with the usual facilities. One good point was the computer in the lobby connected to all the airlines allowing you to confirm and print off flight bookings. Very nice fitted gym on the roof! 
17459 Awesome restaurant and well trained staff. From the time we checked in we received special treatment. Wine, water, etc. Not your normal hotel experience. Great rooms stocked with free items. Modern rooms that are hip and comfortable. Will stay here again soon! 
17460 2 streets from Penn Station and 1 street from the Empire State Building. Hotel low middle range and old but clean. Friendly staff. Coffee or tea with muffins free for the breakfast at the lobby. Good hotel if you don't search lux or modern place. Wifi is available with payment. 
17461 The hotel was very nice, clean and great breakfast buffet!! Loved it!! 
17462 Always a pleasure to stay! 
17463 The room was old and carpet extremely dirty. This hotel needs some maintenaince. Location is great. Staff is very helpful 
17464 Hudson hotel offers lovely design but the rooms are tiny and not comfortable. Telephone, television, shower, lights were not working properly. No coffee/tea facilities. Way to basic for the price you pay!!! 
17465 Its a good location. Its a small room. It provides all you need. Its an average (expensive) price. Well, that is hotels in NYC!!! 
17466 What an Experience it was my first time in NYC. Props to Sean and Erika (bartenders) for the excellent and most gracious service provided. I'm coming back just because of them. Nice locations to subway near the 1 and Penn Station. Can't wait to do it again 
17467 Stayed here for a business/shopping trip in January 2012. Didn't get a lot of sleep due to very loud renovations going on. Good location, typical small NYC rooms. 
17468 Have stayed at the Bentley twice-both times excellent experience. Cabs easy to get, rooms clean and love the whole experience. I recommend this hotel to everyone I know that goes to NYC. I plan to return there when I need to be in NY. Staff is particularily helpful. 
17469 i've been there 2 nights, really nice the location and the hotel, service good, the only problem were the ize of the room, really small but in new york is quite normal... 
17470 I so enjoyed my stay at the hotel. The rooms were inviting, yet supportive of my need to get some work done. Meeting facilities were great as well. Would definitely stay again, for either business or leisure. 
17471 Hotel staff is very friendly, go to Elizabeth she will help a lot. Rooms where decent and clean. The hotel lobby is very nice with a nice breakfast corner. It's minutes away from central park and the price was magnificent. 
17472 Alecia was fantastic at the front desk. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. Would I do the hotel over again? Can't say I would, considering the cost, the noise.... Overall, it was just another downtown hotel. Cheers. 
17473 The service was absolutely good. The people who works there are really nice and helpful. The hotel itself is good and exceptional. The view from the hotel to brooklyn bridge was great. And the front desk manager Phillip Marino was really great to help us out with the room. 
17474 The hotel was superior at every touch point - from the moment we were greeted to riding up in the elevator with the doorman to plopping my head on your pillows for a great night sleep. Affinia 50 is terrific. 
17475 Stayed at the Hilton Times Square because my Flight was cancelled (paid myself Not the airline). Room was Big, especially for a Manhattan Hotel. Despite the Ton of tourists it was a good Place to stay. 
17476 Old style MichiganAve hotel. Historic old building nicely renovated. Great value for money and a wonderful place to use as a base for a weekend in town. Rooms are really nicely updated and good size. Breakfast service needs some attention ! 
17477 Newyorkcity is definitely one of my favorite cities in the world, and this hotel goes hand by hand with the city, except you can sleep until late 
17478 We have enjoyed every minute of our stay at the Swissotel. Spacious rooms, great views, amazing fitness club on 42nd floor. What views of the Navy Pier, the water everywhere...great! 
17479 This hotel is convenient to everything. Theaters, dining, clubs as well as Walking distance to all. 
17480 Highly recommended. Room was clean and beds were comfortable. 
17481 The Louetta Road Courtyard seems new; it's certainly clean and comfortable. Although not included in my July 2012 room rate, the onsite, cooked-to-order breakfast option was fantastic. The king bed was notably firm and comfortable. I'll surely return when family or work travel takes me to the Spring, Texas area. 
17482 It looked like there were recent improvements done to a place that has a long history in Chicago. Everything that I needed was there and the staff was very hardworking. It is located downtown near alot of good places for shopping and dining. 
17483 I've never stayed in a W. This is the cheapest W in town. It was fabulous. Everything is top notch. Service was amazing, and decor was trendy. Rooms and hallways were a little old, but that's standard in NY. Nicest place I've staying in NY. 
17484 I wouldn't say our stay was terribly bad, but it wasn't good either. The room was small, the shared bathroom not clean, the breakfast not tasty and the staff not very friendly. The positive aspect was the price, but there are better hotels out there in the same price range. 
17485 Had a room with 2 double beds on the 33rd floor. Clean and plenty of room. Service and staff were very nice and helpful with directions and information. Would stay there again. Noise could not be heard in our room. 
17486 The room is small and the furniture doesn't really fit into the room. On the positive side the noise from the street is not loud, but the norwegian party in the hallway last night was. I Would not choose this hotel again. 
17487 Traveled with family with teenagers and another family. Service was great from front desk to housekeeping. Gave extra towels, coffee. Room was ok beds were very comfortable and pillows!! Very Clean Location was good, Liked having later Check out. Restaurant a bit small 
17488 Nos ha encantado el hotel, estaba muy centrico, pero sin ruidos a las noches y unas vistas maravillosas, eso si, desde pisos altos y el trato ha sido muy bueno. Habia de todo saliendo del hotel. 
17489 Relatively new, good fitness center, excellent staff, very nice lobby, nice little pool with a neat little waterfall, clean and very comfortable room, good desk, good internet access (surprisingly good for a hotel!) Everything worked! 
17490 Rooms are small but are clean,comfortable. Staff is great, friendly and helpful 
17491 I recently stayed there for a week. It is an old Bld. but my room was totally renovated - it had everything I needed - very comfortable bed, super bathroom - business center, and very helpful and friendly staff. 
17492 We have stayed in other NY hotels. This for us is tops. The rooms are second only to the W in Times Square but about $100 a night cheaper! You will not be disappointed. This is a cool place for discerning people. 
17493 Absolutely loved it!!! Perfect location, friendly staff, very nice lobby, beautiful updated room and very competitive. Has 2 bars and a restaurant and computer/internet room. Just half a block away from Times Square and next to all the Broadway theaters. Will definitely stay here again and recommend to friends. 
17494 Rooms are small, but very comfortable. Great location in the lower east side, and very friendly staff. A nice little breakfast available in the mornings, and overall a very nice experiecne. By NYC standards, the prices are very reasonable, and you'll enjoy your stay. 
17495 We had a wonderful "staycation" at the Swissotel! The location can't be beat and we were upgraded to a corner suite overlooking the river and lake. The staff were friendly and helpful. The bed was very comfortable. And the pool and jacuzzi were a nice option. Great stay! 
17496 Great hotel, professional, efficient and friendly staff (Zack) that goes above and beyond, super friendly doorman (Raul and Dan). Highly recommend. 
17497 the staff was fantastic - from the doorman upon our arrival to the front desk at check-in and housekeeping at the end of the night. Our room was perfect - clean and a good size. The location is perfect. 
17498 Check-in was unpleasant. The bathroom sink drained very slowly and the room was dirty. This place gets worse every year. We will not be back. 
17499 Great hotel, clean, modern, location rocks, cannot say enough about it. GREAT! Our first time in NY, researched hotels on the web. Picked the right one. 
17500 The room was clean, and I had no issues with my stay. 
17501 This historic hotel was amazing. The bed was devine and our suite was fantastic - but I would expect it to be so at $600 a night. The service was the very best and I would definately go there again. 
17502 We always try to stay at the Iroquois when possible. Very close to the theatre district plus convenient to anything in midtown. Hotel staff is very friendly (especially wanted to note Vanessa, Lisa and Bill). It's very comforting to have the staff remember your name when you return. 
17503 Staff very helpful. Arrived around lunchtime and was able to check in without any problems. Rooms are very small, so would go for bigger rooms next time. Very clean and excellent location. Close to 5th ave, times square etc 
17504 Room is clean & cozy, fun decoration! Just short walk from the Penn Station, safe & convenient. Will stay there again for sure. 
17505 The lovely hotel Blakely is out of the noise and crowds of Broadway but with a small walking disance you will be there or at Central Park. The rooms are beautiful and wll kept. Breakfast is nice and service is excelent. 
17506 Just so everyone knows, this is a transient/SRO hotel. What this means is that you'll be rooming with generally unsavory. It's a safe neighborhood, but not this hotel -- its not intended for tourists. STAY AWAY. 
17507 Clean room, modern room, average size. Nice clean modern bathroom. Only problems were (1) no hot water for an 11 a.m. shower and (2) climate control unit in room did not respond to changes. Overall, would stay here again if I could get a good rate. 
17508 I booked a two-night stay for March. Was referred to revenue manager to discuss bill discrepancies, but repeated calls were not returned. 
17509 - Hall inesistente. - Camera minuscola e con aria condizionata ad altezza "gambe" attaccata direttamente alla finestra (un rumore manco a dirlo). - Colazione imbarazzante, era meglio se non la davano - Mancano i teli in bagno e dopo averli richiesti ne hanno portati solo 2 :( 
17510 Great location for access to tourist sites by day and local neighborhood feel at night. Nice location across from museum park and very spacious room. Will definitely stay here again. 
17511 This is a no nonsence hotel where everyone from the door man to the cleaning person does their very best to make sure that you are pleased. I cant wait to go back to NY to stay at this Hotel. 
17512 It has no ammenities and looks a little sketchy when you first enter but the rooms were immaculate and the location is prime. Don't be scared off this place will work nicely if you are on a budget. 
17513 excellent customer satisfaction, they take care of us. our room was upgraded even without asking it. the staff is friendly and courteous. the hotel is well situated with only 1 block away from time sqare, nice shopping, etc. 
17514 Great location, right off of Times Square. Perfect size hotel, not overwhelming or crowded. Very clean and modern features. The rooms were really nice and comfortable with very accommodating service. Will stay here again and recommend to everyone. 
17515 Hotel was awesome. Wonderful staff and great breakfast, a 5 minute walk to Times Square and 2 minutes to the Subway. 
17516 The room was very large and clean. The location was very convenient for walking to train, MOMA, etc. The fitness center was great! Actual free weights, clean with nice equipment in good working order. The staff was friendly and helpful. 
17517 Hotel was modern and had a great hip vibe, rooms were very clean and in great location 3 blocks from times square. Mission control is the center of the hotel and could pay more attention to staffing levels for customer needs. Overall would recommend this hotel for low maintenance travelers. 
17518 Perfect location, excellent customer service, and clean, very large rooms! 
17519 Very nice and clean British style hotel. All provided. Very clean with everything available. Manager Glen very helpful and accommodating 
17520 I enjoyed my first hotel overnight stay in New York City. Hotel is very close to all of the nightlight of the city without being in the main bustle. 
17521 Dit is een echte aanrader!!!! Het personeel is geweldig aardig en behulpzaam! Ivm met de sneeuw was het bij ons de vraag of we terugkonden naar Nederland. Zij hebben alles voor ons uitgezocht! In 1 woord geweldig!!!!! 
17522 Excellent location for tourists. The vintage charm of the hotel makes you feel like you're in someone's home rather than a hotel room, which was great for us. Staff was very professional, courteous, and helpful. SaraBeth's restaurant and bakery is awesome. 
17523 Brilliant view of the skyscrapers of New York. Gorgeous bedding and very comfortable beds. Room was nice, clean and modern. Restaurant and bar area beautifully decorated, with lots on offer. A great base for all of the sights. Would highly recommend this hotel. 
17524 I love this hotel! It was a great experience! It was clean, the beds were comfortable,it was very quiet for being on I10, and the wait staff were so nice. I don't have one thing to complain about. I will stay again when I go to Houston. 
17525 Stayed for business. Can't beat location for where my meeting was located. Rooms were clean, but showed their age. Fitness facilities were acceptable (two or three treadmills, an elliptical, and some freeweights). There was an inside pool, but I didn't partake. 
17526 This was my second stay at The Blakely. It's a sweet little hotel with a GREAT location to shops, theatre, subways. Service was excellent. Rooms are spacious (by NY standards). Concierge was very helpful and made all restaurant suggestions/reservations. No disappointments. Would definitely stay there again! 
17527 I got this hotel through the lastminute web site and spent valentines weekend here with my wife as a birthday present for her. A great hotel overlooking ground zero. and close to subways to get to anyother part of the city easily. 
17528 We really enjoyed our stay at the Hilton. I will be straight to the point, great customer service, clean room, and definitely reasonablly priced for the location. We were so happy the hotel was near all the action of time square. 
17529 Just back from our second visit to the Affinia Manhattan and had a great stay. Hotel rooms still huge and great beds and pillows. Fab location and great staff, can't wait to stay again. 
17530 Luxury hotel, cheap price, best service...no other words! 
17531 This is my third stay at this hotel in the past year and the experience couldn't get any better. Excellent service. Wonderful room. Attentive and helpful staff. Always a pleasure to stay here. I'll return. 
17532 modern rooms free WiFi and a nice surprise as there was complementary Continental breakfast the bathroom was stylish and clean well we were on the 10th floor and waiting for the lifts was long 
17533 My wife and I wanted a quick escape to Chicago and found this place in a quiet neighborhood. It is close to many attractions (we went to Second City). The staff was wonderful and the room was fantastic. We couldn't have asked for anything more. 
17534 We asked for a quiet room because of previous reviews and got a room who's windows opened onto a enclosed shaft. The aircon had just been removed for winter and the room was stinking hot and stuffy. The hotel's answer to this problem was to leave the windows open. 
17535 Centrally located...great rooms....great AM buffet....very friendly staff....overall great experience and would definitely stay there again. 
17536 The hotel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful. This was a great location. We were close enough to the Galleria so it was not a far drive and far enough away from the traffic. The breakfast buffet was nice. I would stay at this location again. 
17537 I got an e mail offering special rates for this hotel. The staff was as nice as they get. The rooms were niceLy decorated. The only downside is fireside restaurant but you can go across the street to isadoras for snacks or breakfast. 
17538 I can't say enough about how accommodating this hotel was. We were very happy with the room, the amenities and the staff. The shuttle to the various hospital facilities was well worth the stay. This hotel is very worth the money for the stay and the shuttle usage. 
17539 Our flight to Phoenix was canceled and Continental put us up in this AIRPORT hotel for a night. Convenient location and surprisingly comfortable for a Marriott. This hotel features 100s if not 1000s of small bats in the trees in-front of the property (see pictures below). 
17540 We found this hotel online, what an amazing hotel with superb staff....Lauren and Holly were some of the best conceirge's we have found, they even got us seats to a sold out show to Jersey Boys. Have a great time at a great hotel. 
17541 I checked into this hotel because of AMEX fine hotel program. Didn't get a room for five hours. When I did then bathtub didn't work. Called the manager who said they didn't have an equivalent room to move me to. Called AMEX and the hotel found a room. Very sad. 
17542 Very friendly,clean,nice wifi,central, will stay again Bastiaan 
17543 I stayed at the hotel for 2 nights during a recent business trip and was extremely happy with all aspects of the stay. I had a renovated room which featured a great bathroom (rain shower, 2 sinks). The staff could not have been nicer and I cannot wait to return. 
17544 Nice downtown hotel. Clean, friendly, very good buffet breakfast (for extra $15). Stayed after thanksgiving for 4 nights, $230 per night including taxes. Great view for part of the rooms (see photo attached). 1 Mile from Mag. Mile. 
17545 A regular guest, I find the staff engagingly warm and friendly. The newly decorated rooms, handsomely done in beige, white, and gray, make the hotel seem new. Minus: the Continental Breakfast is too expensive and less than ideal. Best of all, this hotel has Location, Location, and Location! 
17546 Modern business hotel located one block from bustling Times Sqare. Swift check in and immaculate rooms, seek to be upgraded to the "Executive Club" floors, the furnishings are a little better and you get free breakfast etc. Very pricey ($600), but sets a high standard for a business hotel. 
17547 We spent 2 days at this hotelinclub class room 
17548 We loved every moment and treated with great kindness 
17549 We would return in a heart beat 
17550 El hotel esta fenomenal situado. Lo mejor la terraza para cenar con unas vistas impresionates. Las habitaciones estan bien, aunque los cuartos de bano muy antiguos y como no...la moqueta en la habitacion no podia faltar!!!!! 
17551 Very nice hotel, clean, and friendly staff. Location was perfect, right in the mix of Time Square. Our hotel room was very nice and private with a great view of time square. In hotel parking. I would definatly stay here again. 
17552 estuvimos muy felices una semana en este hotel que es muy seguro dia y noche, excelentemente ubicado y las habitaciones d lujo. Lo unico k sugeriria es k pongan internet gratis 
17553 Excellent location at 100 metres from Times Square. The convenience to all tour activities and theatres was great. Most staff were very obliging and happy to assist while the happy hour in the cafe provided a very enjoyable end to the day, every day. John S 
17554 very good located... friendly staff, helpful and always with a smile... rooms not too big but you have enough space. The bed is good, comfortable and clean... I love the olor of the soap.... will recommend it to everyone... very good price quality...!!! 
17555 In the heart of all the action. Rooms are oversized..some with 2 seperate bathrooms. 
17556 Enjoyed our 3 night stay at the Loews Regency - no complaints whatsoever. Room was clean, service was efficient, and location was excellent. Great stores nearby, a short walk to Central Park. 
17557 We were here for 3 nights, the hotel is well positioned in the city, within easy walking distance of Penn station, times square, and loads of others. The room was comfortable and clean. Overall a great hotel. 
17558 Fantastic location at an affordable price. Staff friendly & rooms small but clean & nice. Would definitely recommend and stay here again. Steps from Times Square & great value. 
17559 Albergo confortevole, non proprio a buon mercato, personale molto gentile (come tutti a NYC). Buon punto di partenza per molte escursioni, un po' meno per ristoranti e vita notturna, se non si vuole abusare di taxi e metropolitana (vicinissima e comodissima). 
17560 The place was very busy with conventions. Room was small and not very nice - showing its age. For vacation, preferred staying at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square. 
17561 The hotel was outstanding. It is in a GREAT location and the free breakfast each morning is the best spread of food I have ever seen at a hotel. This is the only place I will stay at in New York City. 
17562 Perfect location, clean room, good service I definitely recomend this hotel.. Had a great time! 
17563 A nice little hotel in china town, a few blocks from a metro, spacious, clean room, and very comfy bed and pillows. The complimentary breakfast at a nearby restaurant is a bit sub par. Over all, we had a great stay at Mulberry hotel during recent visit to NYC. 
17564 Nice very modern hotel right on ground zero, fantastic views, good breakfast not a problem getting around on the subway, different lines and stations on nearly every block. The higher the floor the better the view 
17565 No free internet, noisy rooms and some not very pleasant people at the front desk. Concierge desk were awesome, but for the price, I wouldnt stay there again. 
17566 in the heart of midtown - walk everywhere. rooms were just fine. I paid $250 per night not bad for NYC would come back here 
17567 My only complaint was that we kept finding earwig bugs in the bathroom area! Other than that, it was a nice hotel. Great location for a beach visit AND an Astros game. And, the breakfast and happy hour was great! 
17568 + Great location + Nice helpful staff + Lovely rooms (2 booked) - Internet access in each room $10 per 24 hours - too expensive - No tea making facilities in room. Recommended 
17569 A nice hotel, in a nice location,I've stayed there three days and it was awesome days, good and kind people are working there and helpful ones, clean and all are served in there. I just enjoyed the hotel all the most important things are there 
17570 The only reason to stay here is because of the location. The service isn't great, the rooms are only so-so and the amenities are just average. If you can afford to go somewhere else, please do. 
17571 Most I have ever spent for a hotel room, but worth it. Outstanding service from staff, beautiful large room and bathroom, amenities, everything. Great soundproofing. My new favorite hotel ! 
17572 The perfect little hotel for a stay in NYC! Perfect location! Rooms are a bit small but very nice. Especially nice were the breakfasts in the lobby which came close to a family breakfast. :-) 
17573 On The Ave is the best value for your dollar in NYC. The price is reasonable, the location is perfect, and the service is great. My daughter got sick and the hotel staff was incredibly kind. 
17574 Desayuno lleno de gente con pocas mesas y sin panqueques!! Loinda es un encanto!!! 
17575 good location for carnegie hall or central park. Gives impression of old old worn out big Hilton-Factory. Service ok, too big for feeling cosy. Cheching out in business hours very slow because there are LOTS of people in such a hotel... Many conventions etc. 
17576 Nothing special! 1. breakfast bad and very easy 2. bed too high and too soft 3. big problem to open the window (i don't like aircondition) 4. bible in a drawer Absolutely happy just from location in city center. 
17577 Amazing Hotel, Amazing Service & Amazing People made it a very special stay. Highly recommended. For a relatively small hotel, the styling was lovely, however this was made up for by the room design and typical W flare. 
17578 Very friendly front desk staff. Nice, clean, large room. Everything was very satisfactory during our stay, including the continental breakfast. 
17579 Great location for the theatre district. Clean, big rooms with lots of little touches to make you feel welcome. We didn't feel like we were staying in a "typical" NYC hotel and we've stayed in a few different boutiques and big-chain hotels. I will definitely go again. 
17580 The hotel is decorated classically. Love the wooden feel in the room. And as other Hilton, very comfortable. 
17581 Very modern interior and pleasant atmosphere. Well located. Breakfast was very expensive as it was not included in our tariff. Internet throughout the hotel and a reasonably well equipped gym..................... 
17582 This hotel is an absolute gem. I would class it as a boutique hotel for sure. Great location, very helpful staff and wonderful amenities. The only disadvantage would be no coffee/tea making facilities in room. Our room was small but really cute. I highly recommend this hotel!! 
17583 Great location, nice hotel....we had such a nice stay in New York first and foremost because of this place. 
17584 Just off Time Square, close to a lot of sights and the metro. Very friendly staff, Rick's Cafe great for breakfast but more particularly for the evening wine and cheese (which is complementary. Would recommend this hotel without hesitation. 
17585 Personnel were very congenial and helpful, I enjoyed relaxing in the bar, nice to have a coffee shop there too. 
17586 Best location, however watch out women!! too dim lght in your bathroom, never enough for make up!! not too much water preasure. VERY COMFORTABLE BED!!!!!! no free internet in rooms (too bad) 
17587 Central Manhattan hotel, 200 m from the Empire state building, no wi-fi in the rooms which are small, dark but clean. No breakfast included but attached bar serves good and various breakfast options. Would reccomend it for the location! 
17588 Great Location. The service is always great at check in and check out. For the cost a great downtown MI AVE hotel. 
17589 I enjoyed this centrally located hotel. The staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful. 
17590 Great service, accommodations are superb. Staff is friendly. 
17591 Very modern and right on the lake. The beaches nearby are great in the summer and the Navy Pier is a good time too. Not far from shopping and transportation either. Great decor and trendy restaurants and bar in the hotel. 
17592 Thought the hotel was very nice, located downtown so close to much there. Had to pay for parking like any downtown hotel but rooms were clean, internet worked well, nice starbucks for coffee and was clean. 
17593 We stayed at the Alex Hotel 5 nights, booked the suite,very nice and clean,quit expensive if you don't spend a lot of time in the hotel. I prefer a location near Central Park. 
17594 This hotel is in an excellent location, right next to Grand Central Station, have stayed in this hotel twice now and loved, would definately stay here again-not at christmas time though, far to busy. 
17595 This was my first trip to NYC and Maryann, the Guest Experience Manager went out of her way to make our trip enjoyable. I would highly recommend this hotel based on price, location, cleanliness and overall experience. 
17596 We stayed here over the Easter weekend. The room was very comfortable, the staff were all very helpful and friendly, the location was very convenient for walking to many places, it's also very close to the subway. 
17597 Greta location, quite,easy check in,good service,elevators, and staff. Rooms clean and better than average in the city. 
17598 Our stay was very nice and Paula who assisted us did everything in her power to make our stay as enjoyable as possible. Thanks Paula!!! We will definitely be back!!! 
17599 Wonderful hotel and exceptional staff made our trip a very memorable one. 
17600 This hotel is brand new and I could not fault anything. The rooms are spotless, everything works and the location is great. The continental breakfast is extensive and of good quality. The front desk staff is courteous and efficient. 
17601 Staff were so friendly throughout our 3 night stay. It is an absolutely charming hotel. Great location yet inside the hotel it is so tranquil. Rooms are adequately sized with all comforts 
17602 Breakfast and wine and cheese all included. 
17603 my husband and i really enjoyed our stay. helpful, friendly staff! very quiet, HUGE suite. nice aveda products in the bath and everything was neat and tidy. we loved it and can't wait to go back. 
17604 This was location for a conference. Room was outdated but quite and lacked many amenities you would expect. Bathroom was small and outdated. Elevator system works well. Food served for continental breakfast and at reception was poor. 
17605 Little did I know that this hotel was the very same hotel made famous by a scathing power point presentation back when it was called Double Tree Club. It seems that the General Manager is still the same and he is still running a very poor property. It's a shame. 
17606 Nice big room with a comfy king bed and a great view of Houston. Room service was great, airport shuttle too. The loud wedding was luckily 18 floors below. Not far from Montrose area. Overall a great value though downtown needs a bit more services/nightlife on the weekend. 
17607 I like the style of these hotels...good value for a N.Y. hotel. Have stayed at Chicago one too. Similar. 
17608 We stayed here for three nights in July and I really liked it. The hotel is clean, modern and stylish although the rooms are small - but this is New York. Really friendly staff and good location too. I would definitely come back. 
17609 Great value, large rooms, mini kitchen which was very good when travelling with a toddler. Good location - walked all over Manhatten from here. 
17610 With the ability to shuttle to IAH and park your car at the hotel for the duration of your vacation, this is a great value. And the night manger was the most helpful ever. 
17611 Stayed here for business. OMG, very nice. Staff and service was GREAT!!! Bed was verrry comfy. Love the Bathroom, was as large as sleeping area. Can't go wrong if you stay here. Nice balcony that over looks the pool. 
17612 Na verdade nossa viagem foi em maio de 2006. Excelente em todos os aspectos!!! Adoro Nova York, e desta vez nossa viagem foi mais do que especial!! 
17613 Stayed in quite a few hotels in NYC and this is one of my favorites. Small almost boutique, clean with delightful staff who always smile. Will stay here again. 
17614 My stay at this location was good. I have stayed here several different times and have had not problems to speak of. Rooms are plenty big, beds are comfortable, and bathrooms are nice. Associates at the front desk are always more than helpful...very friendly. No complaints from me. 
17615 My wife and I stayed here for a special birthday recently. Check in was a breeze at the automated KIOSK, no waiting! Staff courteous and competent. Bell staff was good until right at checkout, we did end up loading our own car. Good overall experience. 
17616 I think this is a very good Holiday Inn property. Great desk staff. Clean room. Everything works. Very happy. The in-hotel restaurant was a very pleasant experience as well. Better than I expected. 
17617 Great location. Rooms are large, clean and comfortable. Staff friendly and helpful. 
17618 This is realy a nice and viby hotel. Staf is fab and the rooms are amazing. Specialy the sky line of New York. 
17619 The staff was clueless and rude regarding the property. Room was decent, not the best I have stayed in. Food could be better. 
17620 Everything about the room was good except that they are a little on the cramped side compared to the other Motesl 8's I have stayed at. But, I would stay at this hotel again just the same. 
17621 Stayed at the Affinia Dumont during Thanksgiving weekend. Selected it based on the excellent reviews from tripadvisor.com. My high expectations were met. Just as all the other reviewers have commented.....large, clean rooms; friendly, prompt staff; nice amenities. I'll definitely plan to stay there again. 
17622 I have done numerous seminars in hotels all over the USA; the Holiday Inn Houston Intercontinental Airport banquet staff was absolutely the best. Everyone was attentive to our needs and always available. The personnel were outstanding and most helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel for meetings/events. 
17623 For a Chicago hotel, the room size is great. And, you get fridge and microwave. Shopping and dining just outside the hotel, or enjoy the food onsite. Clean rooms and friendly desk staff. I have been to Chicago many time and I know that I will stay here again! 
17624 I've stayed here twicw with my wife. The location is perfect for shows, walking distance to attractions, etc. 
17625 The South Loop Hotel's location is great if you're attending a convention, but don't look for much else nearby. The hotel staff was friendly and the rooms weren't bad. 
17626 Soooooo close to everything: subways, theatre district and more. The concierge service was awesome giving the best advice as only locals can. Will definitely stay again. Thanks guys!! 
17627 I was very pleased with my stay. The check in girl was more than helpful. My room was clean and comfortable. The breakfast was very satisfactory, except they do not offer tea, only coffee! The shuttle service to and from the hospitial was great. 
17628 Loved the wine reception on the roof. Nice staff, small but clean and lovely room. Good central location. Get your Kimpton rewards card before you stay! Umbrellas in the closet for rain, MP3 player in room. All and all I was pleased. 
17629 The hotel is in a fantastic location, right next to times square. The hotel is fairly clean, and the rooms are of a good size. The staff are a little abrupt and sometimes unhelpful. The price was fair, and I would stay here again! 
17630 after reading reviews was not sure about staying here. after spending 5 day at the milford it was great would surely stay there again 
17631 I had a pleasent Vacation in New York City the staff was very friendly especially Natasha and Joselyn real nice people, Breakfast was excellent and Location perfect only one block away from Broadway, hope to come soon. 
17632 The location is great - right next to the 8th Ave line - and it's a good (if slightly dull) neighborhood. Rooms are small as one would expect but clean and functional. A great value for Manhattan 
17633 Just return from our holiday here. Loved everything about the hotel. A special thank you to Paulina for her great help whilst making the booking. 
17634 Great location to McCormick place and nice to walk to waterfront. Hotel is shabby and needs updating. Heating problem, hallways dirty, hallways shabby, rooms & bath clean, but shabby, staff friendly, need fridge in rooms Adjacent restaurant food so-so, wait staff and bartender very good. 
17635 Stayed here for 4 nights with my husband and three teenagers. Was good value for money. Greta location and the breakfast was good. Would stay there again.Friendly helpful staff - My husband accidentally left a shirt in the wardrobe and they found it and put it aside for us. 
17636 Julie and Timothy werre very friendly and very helpful. Service was fast, lobby area was very clean. I couldn't ask for better service. 
17637 Well I stayed in this hotel and my mother, Elizabeth Whitman clogged the toilet. It was about 12 inches and very circumstantial. We did not get a plunger up to our room for 2 hours and the whole room smelled like rotten eggs. But nice hotel definitely come 
17638 great location on main street across from park, hotel is very old but that is part of the charm. room was fine, bathroom was very small and out-dated! comfy sleep, friendly staff. we never ate at the restaurants but it seemed busy enough. 
17639 Hotel is on Canal Street - so a busy, noisy area but it was very clean, small but reasonably sized room, and excellent service. A good option and the only reason I might not stay here again is a preference for midtown area of NYC... 
17640 I like the neighborhood, great food around. Enjoyed the Downstairs bar and restaurant. Rooms aren't amazing but well worth the price. 
17641 Location,location,location. This hotel exceeded my expectations. Very chic and classy. The staffed help me with my cheesecake adventure to bring home my sissy in-law a piece of NY cheesecake. The sheets still smelled like softener, wow... The staff was amazing, the defiantly have my future stays at NYC. 
17642 Great location for a business meeting in the Galleria area in Houston. Proximity to many things, including Memorial Park for a run, works perfectly. Very nice property and amenities. 
17643 This is a fantastic little hotel in a great location! Very friendly staff and excellent facilties. Rooms are a little on the small side, but nothing to really complain about. 
17644 bewust gekozen voor dit centraal gelegen hotel, heel Manhattan snel bereikbaar via de metros die bij het Central Station stoppen. Super hotel, aardig personeel, regelen alles voor je als je maar betaald! 
17645 Convenient location, right next to IAH. Nice rooms (standard hotel room), really good breakfast buffet, great pool area. My only complaint is that there were no sheets on the bed to use as a blanket... just a sheet that covered the mattress. Delicious cookies too. 
17646 Top hotel - booked through Mr & Mrs Smith and we were not disappointed. Location perfect for exploring and right opposite the NY Yacht Club Clubhouse! Great hotel in a great city - will be back again. 
17647 It was a good Hotel .Staff were good and Hotel was well maintained. 
17648 I was in New York to visit my actress daughter. The hotel was in a perfect location for New York theatres. The room was comfortable,very clean and contemporary. I loved the lobby lounge are with bar and fireplace. Very resonable price for a very nice New York hotel. 
17649 Got the hotel on Priceline.....never expected it to be as awesome as it was! It's located in the heart of downtown, everything is within walking distance. The hotel itself is very nice and clean. Will go back for sure!! 
17650 The hotel has a great appearance, staff were friendly, knowledgeable and professional. I would stay here again and recommend it to all. The view out the window was great. 
17651 This is a wonderful hotel, and its located in the perfect spot along 5th avenue. Stayed on business and our event was amazing, it went flawlessly! 
17652 Poor service, unfriendly staff at front desk, not a memorable experience 
17653 This was the filthiest hotel I have ever seen!! I could not even spend the night there. Our king-size room only had a king size bed and that was it. No furniture!! There were roaches in the hallway. I would not recommend this to anyone.. 
17654 Tolles Hotel vor allem wenn man in den obersten Stockwerken wohnt PS: Das Eckzimmer ist von der Aussicht herrlich 
17655 Not a very welcoming hotel, the reception staff were unheplful and not very friendly, the room was ok but nothing special. 
17656 Nice place. Loved the very modern decor and the glitzy decor effects. Interesting room shows wear: ding'd up doors, walls, furniture. Clean but in need of some paint touch ups, coffee makers in room sure would be nice. Not bad for $120/night though. Breakfast was awesome and very reasonably priced. 
17657 Liked the quieter street rather than avenue location of this hotel. Peaceful nights despite construction outside our window. So convenient for walking around Manhattan! The service was excellent and we got our money's worth. 
17658 Over rated and over priced. Stayed several nights. Nice public rooms, but average hotel rooms (quite small and very dark). Best features are the location and the "burger place" - hidden behind the curtain in the lobby. 
17659 Likes: Rooms very clean. Room service great! Car service to Rodeo Fiji water upon arrival Attractive Pool area Paris made her vid here! Movie stars Dislikes: Long walk to Rodeo Movie stars support staff clogging the elevators Small pool Smallish washrooms 
17660 I stayed at Hotel Derek for 2 nights. Staff was helpful. The room's heater was not working but I was moved to another room. Parking is chsllenging and valet service is super slow. Self parking is not an option only valet. Overall satisfied. 
17661 I stayed in alexander hotel on june 2012. It is a very bad hotel, bad service, i catchers bed bugs, no air conditioner, no hot water, don' t refund your money. No body response for the problemas in the hotel. 
17662 hotel molto famigliare - molto comodo e vicino a time square -molto accogliente e personale molto gentile moi sia andati con mio figlio di due anni 
17663 l'hotel e' nella zona piu' viva di New York, moderno, design, pulito, stanze molto confortevoli, personale gentilissimo. Mio figlio di 18 mesi si e' divertito quasi piu' di me. Assolutamente consigliato 
17664 This hotel was very nice. The staff was pleasant and willing to answer any tourist questions. I would recommend their restaurant ONO for dinner. 
17665 A small, very personal hotel with the friendliest and most gracious staff, nicely appointed and with some nice extras. If you're staying in midtown and want a change from the huge corporate hotels, this is the place. 
17666 Nice spot in SOHO, small rooms fOr the price. The staff was very helpful with travel arrangements and restaurant suggestions. 
17667 Great location, fabulous room, friendly staff. I would come back in heartbeat 
17668 Stayed here for a few days last month and everything was top notch. I had an especially nice experience in the fitness center because of a very nice man by the name of Robert who went out of his way to help me...highly recommended! 
17669 We recently visited NYC and were totally impressed with Pod 39 and its staff. Centrally located in Midtown Manhatten, we were just a few blocks from Grand Central Terminal and many landmarks. Thanks again to the wonderful staff at Pod 39! 
17670 I'm so glad I found this hotel! Affordable, large rooms and exceptional service. Great location! 
17671 Easy access to great locations. Lobby very sheik. Love getting fresh apples. 
17672 Staff is very nice and offers perfect service. If you are a couple, I recommend the option "Romantic Rendezvous", my girlfriend appreciated a lot ! 
17673 My friends and I took a girls trip to NY and stayed here. We had a phenomenal experience! The staff made us feel very safe. They were friendly and very knowledgeable. The rooms were great!! The spa was amazing! This is definitely a place I would stay again! 
17674 Ottimo hotel proprio a Times square comodissimo alla metropolitana e alla stazione degli autobus pulito e personale cordiale. Wi-fi a pagamento..caro. Consigliato in posizione veramente strategica con camere ampie pulite e ben accessoriate 
17675 Das Hotel hat eine Top-Lage und ist sehr ansprechend. Wie alle New Yorker Hotels aber nicht ganz billig... 
17676 I stayed at the Waldorf for a few nights. The room and common areas were all very quiet and clean and comfortable. I really enjoyed my stay. The staff was very nice, all-smiles, making for a great place to stay. 
17677 Nice hotel, beautiful lobby, very clean, very close to the airport. 
17678 Very small bathroom, paint and plaster peeling from ceiling and wall. VERY expensive room service 
17679 I found the Comfort Inn on the lower East Side to be like coming home to Virginia. Everyone was friendly, the breakfast fresh and inviting and it was soooo easy to get around NYC. I was able to walk 3 blocks to the conference and I will definitely return! 
17680 Not as good as the last time I was there....cheap bed, pillows. For $300+ night you expect more. TV remote didn't work, sinks and tub plugged. the location is great, central but far enough away from the zoo in time square. 
17681 Very nice hotel, great lobby bar and great rooms, get a corner room as they have amazing views! 
17682 The hotel was beautiful inside and out. The food scrumptiousand the delivered on time.The front desk agent was sweet and kind. The Housekeepers were pleasent and friendly. (Max) my dog loved his bed.We both overslept due to comfort.Will definatley return ...........SOON Best in at Westin ! 
17683 great service with clean room. the head chef was very friendly. for a short quick stay the hotel had very comfortable bed. the shuttle service was excellent. 
17684 Amazing location, on Fulton Street, right across the street from WTC. Staff are courteous and helpful. Rooms are terrific--- large by NYC standards and what you can expect from a world-class Hilton hotel. I'll stay there again when I visit the City. 
17685 The front desk is the first team people see and your team was great! They are just that great!!!! They were friendly, and were very quick to support us with printed directions to dinner at night as well as our meeting location in the morning. 
17686 horrible experience, room is dirty, dirty blankets, towels has holes, never been vacuumed, dirty carpet. light bulb are out, they never replace it 
17687 We visited NYC for 8 days, we booked 2 room suite. This place was awesome! Evrything about our stay was great but we did have some rain. who cares , your in NYC. 
17688 We stayed 7 nights during our vacation. A wonderful staff. Every one of them were nice, helpful, and friendly. The rooms were very clean, and breakfast was a great way to start the day. Perfect location too. 
17689 My boyfriend and I found a deal to spend three nights here - we both thought it was great! We lucked out and had very nice, spacious (for NYC) corner room. Staff was universally friendly. 
17690 Our visit to the Hilton Garden Inn was great. It was a wonderful experience. The room was clean and the staff was very professional and courteous and treated us with the utmost respect. 
17691 El servicio fue muy bueno,la habitacion era para los 4 , muy comoda. Iguamente nuestro objetivo era pasear todo el dia y el hotel nos recibia con una buena ducha y una comoda cama. Lo que mas me gusto fue la ubicacion muy cerca de Times Square a 4 cuadras. 
17692 Extremement bien place Beaucoup de possibilites de restauration autour Bruit de fonds (generateur) en continu Porte pas tres etanche au bruit et a la lumiere, serrure vieillote Ascenseur anciens et peu rapides Tres bonne literie Propre 
17693 We stayed at the Sofitel NYC last weekend. Great location close to everything. The staff is amazing I was really impressed with how friendly and accommodating they were. Do not be shy to ask for anything. 
17694 This place is very chic, young & hip, and very centrally located. The staff is exceptionally friendly. I would not reccommend this place if you're in the mood for rest and relaxation however. There is a nightclub just parrallel to the lobby and it can get pretty loud in there. 
17695 We spent one night this lovely hotel. Easy walking distance to Times Square, Theaters and Restaurants. The hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay there again. 
17696 Well located! Beautiful hotel boutique and rooms, a little bit unpersonal but really helpful staff. The restaurant is a must and a place of new yorkers visit after office. The cuisine good not spectacular. It is a great alternative if you do not want to expend a lot of money. 
17697 We had a great four day stay at the Michelangelo. A very comfortable room, well maintained, great staff. Even when full, the hotel does not feel crowded or rushed. Great location for good eating 
17698 I visit New York City three to four times a year and always stay at the Beacon. You will feel like you are in a NYC apartment. Having the awesome Fairway market right across the street is great since all the rooms have kitchens. GREAT home away from home. 
17699 Wir hatten auch ein Zimmer im Hilton und im Hyatt, beide hatten weder was Grioesse noch Komfort angeht beim Bett eine Chance. Das Fruehstueck war amerikanisch, also Ham egg pancake zum selber machen. Am Sonntag war das Obst sogar frisch geschnitten. Sofort wieder! 
17700 My boyfriend and I went for my 30th and it was a fantastic experience! We had an amazing time in the penthouse loft. Would highly recommend if you are willing to splurge. The balcony's along are worth the price! 
17701 Aside from not having the key card machine working at the front desk...it was a pleasurable stay...good location and Dream is across the street which offers top 40 music on the roof top deck. 
17702 Such a great hotel near Central Park. They always upgrade me without asking (for Starwood status) and the suites have amazing views. Both Norma's and the Burger Joint offer top food and even the room service is great. Definitely one of my favorites in New York 
17703 We really enjoyed our stay at this hotel. The room was clean and nice. The staff was really helpful. And the location was great. The walk to Times Square was not bad at all and very close to the Empire State Building. We would definitely stay here again. 
17704 Friendly helpful staff. Excellent location, good rooms considering New York. Breakfast a great bonus not usually included in NY hotels 
17705 Great hotel - with free wi-fi, spacious jr suite, and great location to NY attractions. Close to Grand Central & airport shuttle. 
17706 Un asco de hotel y de servicio 
17707 Incredibly easy for work travelers, very clean, internet connection always works, decent rewards program, good workout facility, very convenient to the Energy Cooridor of Houston. The staff always is helpful and courteous - overall, easy and clean; what more could you ask for on work travel. 
17708 Great decor. Friendly staff. Awesome location. the M Lounge is a perfect place for drinks. Half off cocktails on thursdays. 
17709 4 days at the very pleasant Hotel Wales. Clean, quiet and the room with pull out sofa, fit 2 adults and 2 teens quite comfortably. The staff were professional and helpful. We would definitely stay here again. 
17710 Hotel in posozione stratop...10 secondi dalla subway...posizione centrale ideale sia per il divertimento che per la vita familiare,,camere pulite personale molto gentile... 
17711 Overall. a very nice experience, but construction banging started each morning at 7am like a vibrating jack hammer alarm clock. Great location, nice amenties...maybe they could provide earplugs for as long as the construction goes on! 
17712 We were thrilled with our three-day stay at the Affinia Gardens. The spaciousness and upkeep of the suite, the friendliness and efficiency of the staff, and the excellent location were all first-rate. This is now our hotel of first choice in New York City! 
17713 Located on the corner of 50th and 3rd this hotel is a short walk to Grand Central Station, Rockefeller Center, American Girl (if you have daughters), two different subway lines, terrific well-known restaurants, you name it. The staff was amazing! Suite was newly renovated. Amazing place! Trust me! 
17714 my huisband and i stayed here for the Nov weekend. It was wonderful. Had a room on the third floor, great view. clean, bed comfortable, and staff pleasant. Complimentary coffee and pastries given between 8 - 10 am. Close to parking garage, and all entertainment, piers, eating establishments 
17715 Service poor. Heat low, and room smelled of bleach. you HAVE to upgrade the room and the hip chic style is just sad. 
17716 Stayed here for two nights, great people, great view from the top. But we were on 4th floor, over looked a patio and was woken up by construction at 6:40am on a Sunday Morning. Kinda of wish it was closer to a subway station 
17717 I wouldn't really give this hotel a 5 star rating except for it's in NYC The location is awesome. The staff were great Room was spotless & much bigger than normal rooms in NY. I visit NYC a lot & I would stay here again for sure 
17718 Room smaller than my bathroom at home. Bathroom unbelievably tiny, you had to hold your hand over your head to turn around in the shower stall. Never again. 
17719 Een week in The jewel verbleven voor een touristisch bezoek aan NY. Ik kan hotel van harte aanbevelen! De kamers zijn in zeer goede staat en zeer netjes. De ligging is ideaal in het hart van mid town Manhattan. Het hotel heeft gratis draadloos internet en flesjes gefilterd water. 
17720 I wouldn't stay at this hotel again, the rooms are small and there are no heating, the carpet is dirty with mildew and the price was too high for what the hotel offers. 
17721 We stayed here for a long weekend....great accomidations, wonderful room and very clean and well appointed, excellent bar in the lobby; service was superior and very friendly.....can't tell you if the dining was good, we ate out.......we'll go back for sure..... 
17722 100yds off times square, easy access from the Newark bus - Bryant Park. Good friendly staff, bars and restaurants nearby. Quiet air con. Good state of bathrooms. 
17723 Our company had our yearly business meeting at the Sheraton Brookhollow location. The representatives showed good customer service skills and worked well together with me the coordinator of the meetings so the meetings would be a success. The food, rooms and service was excellent. 
17724 certes, les toilettes sont sur le palier, certes la climatisation est bruyante, mais on est a deux pas de tout ! l hotel est propre. en resu;e il y a tout le confort necessaire, mais pas plus. bon rapport qualite prix. 
17725 I came to Chicago for a weekend to visit and see a relative's play - it was only 3 blocks away! restaurants were across the street, bus that took me downtown was 3 blocks. Breakfast provided a good selection. 
17726 This is a boutique hotel with great rooms and a great location at a very reasonable rate. I would recommend it for the business or casual traveler. 
17727 This is the worst Hotel I have ever seen, was conned in to booking as was told that the room we had booked had en suite facilities.......How wrong that was!NOt even a sink in the room, dirty bed sheets, staff that frankly couldnt care less about anything.Please DONT stay here. 
17728 A great place to stay. Navy Pier, Michigan Avenue and the Willis Tower are all within walking distance. A nice view of the Chicago River from my room. Beds are very comfortable. Exercise room has lots of machines so no waiting. 
17729 This was the cleanest & newest LaQuinta I've ever seen. I was pleased and well satisfied with everything. I would recommend this to anyone. Rooms were very spacious. 
17730 Very spacious room. Clean, comfortable with helpful service. Could use a vending machine for late night snacks without resorting to room service. Located right in the Galleria - massive shopping centre. Cheesecake Factory right outside the main door!!! 
17731 As a business traveler, I stayed in a wide variety of hotels and the management and staff made me feel like I was staying in a 5 star hotel. I was very please and when traveling in the territory I will look again for a La Quinta hotel. 
17732 We started at another hotel, but it was less than habitable, so we ended up at the Americana and it was affordable, close to all of the attractions, and clean. It is within steps of David Letterman's studio. 
17733 Pros -location -nice and clean -friendly and helpful bellman Cons -small and slow elevators -front desk not friendly/not willing to help 
17734 overall of the hotel is fair , it is on good location so we can reach MoMA , underground and Time Square by minute. 
17735 Booked this hotel back in the summer before it opened for a friends weekend in New York. Perfect location for plays, shopping, restaurants. Excellent breakfast. Rooms very clean and people at the desk were very friendly. Fantastic price for this location is New York City! 
17736 This is a very nice place to stay, very clean rooms very comfortable with no bad smells. The only bad thing is the location, which is in a run down area of town that is trying to evolve into a nice area. 
17737 Not the most luxurious, but it certainly does the job. While the staff is extremely courteous, the room itself is nothing special. Morning breakfast that was included was convenient, albeit not very good. The beds were pretty comfortable at least. 
17738 This hotel is really good. Next door to the WTC building sight with a fantastic viewing terrace on the 20th floor. Looks brand new and modern. It has gym facilities and a restaurant. 
17739 The hotel was right on Michigan Ave, (great for shoppers). The beds were so comfortable. Only wished I could stay longer !!! 
17740 This is a wonderful hotel! Excellant location. Guest service was outstanding - very helpful bellstaff. And everyone knows what great beds Westins have. While I was here on business, I plan on returning with my family for a weekend vacation. 
17741 We stopped at Fitzpatric Manhattan for 3 nights and loved every minute. Central location for all big attractions and walkable to Times Square, Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Rockefeller Centre etc. Room comfortable and cozy, staff fantastic and helpful and lots of Irish charm! Would recommend this to anyone. 
17742 Leider ist stimmen der Standard und die Realitaet nicht ueberein. Das Hotelzimmer war dreckig und staubig, der Wasserhahn tropfte nicht nur, sondern das Wasser lief als Rinnsahl aus dem Hahn. Zudem Renovierungsarbeiten. 
17743 Clean, modern, new, rooms a little small but it's NY! Def good location, close to everything. Loved the way the place smelled :) 
17744 Zeer klantgerichte aanpak, met voor aankomst email om te vragen naar specifieke wensen/eisen. Kamer in orde en wireless prima in orde. Ook onbijt was meer dan prima. Daarnaast is de ligging bij Times Square helemaal top 
17745 This is the hotel to fulfill our dreams. From arrival to departure we were immersed in luxury. Staff, food, decor , bed linen, we could go on forever, this is worthy of 6 star rating. We will be back-) 
17746 Stayed on 14th floor, could look out of my bed and see Lake Michigan! Two bathrooms for one room...such a plus! 
17747 Girls weekend out with tickets to Broadway. Room was perfect, full kitchen, provided menus for restaurants that would deliver (it was snowing), housekeeping provided corkscrew and extra chairs immediately. Breakfast was very good and made this a real value for a New York City hotel. Highly recommended. 
17748 Het is een uitstekend hotel als je New York centrum wil bezoeken. Zeker in prijs kwaliteit verhouding. 1 tip: kijk achter de toiletspiegel daar zit toiletpapier en zeepjes. Wij kwamen er pas na 5 dagen achter. 
17749 Always stay here when I come to manhattan as it's clean, good value fork eu, right near the subway and there is a fantastic diner nearby ( called gee whizz) the family rooms are spacious and the staff friendly 
17750 The hotel is located right in the middle of Times Square, but I experienced little noise in my room. The were spacious accomodations made it convienent to share the space with another person (2 separate rooms, 2 doors into the bathroom). 
17751 We booked the deluxe queen and we were not convinced with the deluxe part. We paid almost $500 for a tiny room. The view was nice of course. Apparently you van find a better rate on the AmEx site but they told us after :(... 
17752 Nice location, spacious room with a kitchen, extremely helpful staff. Highly recommended if you are bringing your family to New York. 
17753 The hotel is in a nice neighbourhood with decent eateries nearby, friendly staff, good breakfast, very clean with nice pool. 
17754 Midden in downtown Houston. Rond het hotel meerdere restaurants te vinden. De winkels in de buurt van het hotel zijn niet echt bijzonder, op een half uur van het hotel is de Galeria mall deze heeft alles 
17755 My title kind of sums it up. Very covent hotel as it's locates in the airport. The staff are very nice and friendly. The restaurant and bar upstairs are good. However, the rooms are very dated now and in need of a major remodel. Other than that no real complaints. 
17756 juste en face de la gare situation tres centrale : pres de macy's, de times square, de B&H et une station de metro tres pratique dommage que l'entretien de l'hotel laisse un peu a desirer, bien que tout soit propre, la literie tres confortable et les chambres spacieuses 
17757 i had a great stay could not fault the hotel it was quirt clean loverly room right in the centre of midtown between time square and grand central station. there is a great little dinner a fwe doors up as well i did find it expensive though, but very comfortable 
17758 The accomodations at this location were not at all what I am accustomed to when I stay at a CS. The hotel and its furniture were outdated, the breakfast was disappointing, our room smelled and the carpeting was dirty. Beds were comfortable. 
17759 Dolores at the front desk always takes good care of me with my reservations. She is pleasant and very helpful!! 
17760 I had to stay here for one night. The quality of the room was ok. You get free wifi which is a good thing. I found there was a bit poor cleaning in my room. But since I had been awake for 24 hours I didn't bother complaining. 
17761 Nice hotel, nice rooms and ok location, but really weird staff, only the doorman was a nice guy, the rest donks, sorry but who they think they are.Get some decent people who know what nice service is, 
17762 Good clean hotel which we found to be well located and directly in front of Central Park and the National History Museum. Though we only stayed for three days the room was large and the staff helpful. 
17763 Very happy with my stay. Staff was helpful and friendly, particularly the doormen. $14/day for internet access. Close to subway lines and great restaurants along 2nd Ave. 
17764 While the price may be right, be forewarned that New York City apparently still has smoking allowed in hotel rooms. I am sitting unhappily in one as I write this. The front desk staff, while courteous, tells me there are no rooms available to move. Stay away! 
17765 I have been to NY a bunch of times but never stayed in the heart of Times Square. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay! The hotel was awesome and the staff was exceptional, especially Amanda! I would definitely would stay here again! 
17766 Impossibly small rooms for an outrageous price--800 a night city view and could barely fit a rollaway and mediocre food. Rooms are a bit worn, mold all along my bath tub. However, the service at this hotel is beyond compare. 
17767 a fantastic hotel, convenient, great staff, particularly Drita! This has fast become the first choise for both business and pleasure in the city. Having stayed here four times in the last two months I will be back and back and back. 
17768 Great hotel, friendly staff. We booked a single room, and it was tiny even by NYC standards. The bed was barely big enough for 1 person let alone two. The Staff was nice enough to upgrade us!! 
17769 The perfect location!! you are actually two or three block from every where you will like to go! Will always go there when back in New York! 
17770 The Chatwal at EVERY level delivered a fantastic experience!!! Value, Room, Spa and Restaurant, we were not disappointed at any level. 
17771 Stayed here for 4 nights with 2 other friends. Great hotel and the room was extremely comfortable. Fatima, the concierge was very helpful and informative. The hotel is located only 1 block from Time Square. Overall had a great stay and would definately return again. 
17772 If you discover you've been overcharged, don't expect any assistance from the Assistant General Manager, Daisy Miranda. This hotel must be desperate for cash. I would not stay in this hotel again and would not recommend it to anyone. 
17773 of course the rooms are small etc. but hey it's Manhattan and it's cheap, clean and has friendly and helpful staff. would stay again. 
17774 Right in the heart of Times Square and the Theater district. Very clean, comfortable, knowledgable staff and I would definitely stay here again. 
17775 Prima hotel voor deze prijs, alhoewel, het kan goedkoper! Locatie perfect, east side, metro dichtbij en taxi kostte niet meer dan 8usd (broadway bv). Standaard kamers zijn klein, niet echt een plek om lang in te vertoeven. Leuke receptie en kleine bar. Goede voorzieningen (flat screen, ipod station), nette badkamer(s). 
17776 Stayed here for 2 nights between Christmas & New Years in 2011. Extremely helpful staff, well appointed and spacious rooms and perfectly located to access all areas of the New York City. Complementary breakfast however wifi was not included (a small ding). Highly recommend. 
17777 I visited this hotel during my vacations in US. Love this hotel in the heart of the Manhattan, 2 mins walk to Rockefeller's centre and also very close to time square. Rooms are nice and cozy. Free Internet available in the lobby area. Overall a nice stay. 
17778 All staff, but particularly Maria at the front desk were so helpful and accommodating. Answered all questions and made recommendations for dinner nearby which was superb! It was just a quick getaway, and I wish we could haved satyed longer. Will definitely be back! 
17779 Excellent customer service. Everyone was very attentive from the valet to the bellman to the front desk. Rooms are very sound-proof and the beds are EXCELLENT! I slept like a baby! My only complaint is that my double room was very small, especially in the bathroom area. 
17780 Stayed here the weekend follwoing NY Eve, was a price that was very cheap, $250 for 4 nights. Its basically a travellers hostel jazzed up, but well worth the value. Offers shared bathrooms and private, comfy bed and basic eatery. Good for a budget travel plan. 
17781 If you're after budget accommodation in New York without the shared bathroom experience, this is the place to stay. The rooms are an eclectic mish-mash of furniture but it all works. Small, comfortable & in a great, central location. 
17782 Affinia 50 is located in a very good place,near 5th ST. The rooms are cozy and clean. The staff is kind and friendly and will help you in every request you make. 
17783 Size of rooms are big, great location but lighting in room are terrible for makeup. Internet is not free and is quite expensive as there are no sharing between devices. Internet is free at the business center. Friendly receptionists and staff 
17784 I just can say nothing but good things about the Hotel, the staff so sweet and the room was great !! The food is so good, the location is great, I can walk everywhere and be on time to every appointment. Thank You for Everything :) 
17785 great hotel with a magnificent view. great clean rooms with a lot of space. 
17786 Friendly staff, great accommodations. Would definitely revisit!! 
17787 I debated back and forth about where to stay for this trip and i will never regret choosing this little gem in the heart of Times Square. The rooms are a little small, but the service is AMAZING!!!! I am actually headed back there tomorrow. 
17788 Relaxing, welcoming atmosphere. Good rates. Spa delivers on all levels. Rooms are roomy and clean 
17789 The standard at this hotel is really low! very small bedrooms, beds and bathrooms... it seems to be on a boat. it is absolutely overrated, especially for the real pour service it is offered. Don't try to wait for room service... they will simply ignore you. Bad experience overall. 
17790 Very nice staff, well located, clean and sofisticated. 
17791 Stayed on Valentine's Weekend and the Hotel, Room and Service were fit for a King ...and Queen. From the moment we arrived and met Crystal at the front desk to the time we left we totally enjoyed ourselves. Great location, great hotel and great time. We will be back soon. 
17792 Hotel velho, sujo, com equipe sem educacao!... Alem disso, nao vale a pena de jeito nenhum ficar gastando US$ 500,00/diaria naquele "hotel", que, para mim, de 3 estrelas nao tem absolutamente nada!... 
17793 Upon entering the hotel the bell staff were very attentive. Once I checked in, the front desk person was also very pleasant and attentive. My room was quiet, clean and comfortable, the view was spectacular. I completely enjoyed my stay. 
17794 My bed in this hotel was absolutely delicious. Crisp linens, great pillows, comfy mattress. Some people complained about the street noise but my room (538) faced a courtyard so it was dead quiet. Free (and fast) wifi is a nice perk. 
17795 Great location, friendly staff. Easy to walk or subway to anywhere. Nice buffet breakfast. Will stay again. 
17796 Very reasonably priced for a central Manhattan location. The room was clean and comfortable, although the bathroom was very small. 
17797 I've stayed there for 1 week in February. The hotel is old but renewed. The best thing about it it's the localization close to Times Square, Central Park, etc. It's also one block close to a Subway station and 2 blocks from the Madison Sqaure Garden. I really loved it 
17798 stayed here 4th - 7th October 2011. Great spot for access pretty much anywhere downtown/midtown right up to Central Park. Hotel seems fairly new and facilities are good and all is clean. Staff are friendly and helpful. Recommended. 
17799 Hotel mood is the tops.rooftop pool and bar are amazing and 1 of a kind in NYC! No complaints whatsoever. 
17800 Everything about the hotel deserves a rating of 5. Great deal, great hotel, and great breakfast! 
17801 Just returned from a 4 night stay. The property is beautiful and the service is excellent. You can't beat this location!!! 
17802 We found Club Quarters online while researching our 4 day summer stay in Chicago. What a great place, comfortable, easy 2-3 block walk to the Double Decker bus stop at Willis Tower Sky Deck attraction and a 4-5 block walk to Michigan Avenue attractions. 
17803 great hotel.excellent deli across the road.great value for breakfast. Take ear plugs as the windows are not double glazed and the noise from the traffic is non stop at all times of night.horns are beeped for fun in new york.if you can get $149 a night it's fantastic value.very central. 
17804 nice big rooms and even bigger bathrooms nice timesquare views from the higher level floors 
17805 A hotel that is in walking distance to Sonic. The hotel is kindof hard to find the front to. The rooms are nice. They do have a fan in the room. The room was nice size, and they do have free local phone calls. They also accepts pets. 
17806 Sofitel NY is uitstekend gelegen. Goede en vriendelijke service. Prachtige kamers. goed restaurant en gezellige bar. Personeel is meestal tweetalig : Engels - Frans. A/Cub leden genieten een aantal interessante privilegies. 
17807 We loved this hotel. First time to New York and was a great location. Room had great view of Empire State and a guitar-perfect. Excellent, friendly and very helpful door and desk staff. Foyer bar was bit expensive but lively! 
17808 we stayed at this location and it was so pleasant.front desk attention is very good,henry is a very good worker,thanks henry for your attention.we will be back soon. clear lake restoration plus roberto saravia m. 
17809 Stayed here in December 2006 on a girls trip. I can not say enough good things about this place. It was absolutely wonderful and is in a great location. i wwill definately be back. 
17810 Definitely a good starting point in central Manhattan 
17811 Plesanr staff. Good breakfast restaurant. The wine at the rooftop bar is highly overpriced however. 
17812 if you have a busniess trip and you don't need a room service and good price hotel with a nice location and close to the galleria that hotel what you need, free parking are available for you, the staff was helpfull i had an issue with the visa. 
17813 Where to start? The bedroom was not a bedroom. More like a loft. The only way to enjoy NYC. The staff are friendly, the food is excellent. The room service divine. I loved the Cow Shed Spa. Great steam room. 
17814 I stayed the weekend of Jan.13-15, 2006 this hotel is well kept and very clean. Its located in a good safe area, near buses and train. Walking distance to restaurants and shops. I enjoyed my stay and have no complaint about staff or housekeeping. 
17815 Room was comfortable, hotel was beautiful, staff was helpful. My husband and I had a wonderful time. We are already planning our next weekend stay. 
17816 Couldn't find a better location for our purposes - right in the theatre district. Good selection to eat at breakfast buffet, but be there EARLY since it is busy and chaos reigns once everyone is up and hungry. 
17817 this place is awesome. walking distance to everything!!! small rooms but what do you expect, it is NY!! at least they tell you the square footage, so you are prepared. clean, friendly staff, perfect!! 
17818 Only remark could be that the room is a bit small, but quality is great! Hotel is very good and good located. 
17819 We found our room way too small with only a very small window and the carpet was not very clean. I asked if we could be moved to a room with more ventilation and they very kindly moved us to a corner room which was better. Great Location though! 
17820 ESTUPENDO HOTEL EN UNA DE LAS MEJORES ZONAS DE HOUSTON, CERCA DE LA GALLERIA Y OTROS MALLS, RESTAURANTES Y TODOS LOS SERVICIOS, MAGNIFICAS HABITACIONES (ESTUDIOS) MUY BONITAS Y CON TODOS LOS SERVICIOS, UN HOTEL DE LUJO SIN OSTENTACIONES Y DE MUY BUEN PRECIO, ALTAMENTE RECOMENDABLE! 
17821 I've always wanted to see Times Square, and the Hilton Times Square provides the perfect location. The staff is awesome and we got free water and chocolates throughout our stay. Thank you Eddie; and yes we will be back soon. 
17822 Awesome desk service, Hotel is unlike any I've stayed in. The downstairs transitions into a "night club" type seen at night. Rooms are clean and super unique, Def a good stay 
17823 Doug and Kathy are doing a great job! They were very helpful in assisting me with my reservation. No doubts,next time i'll stay in this hotel! 
17824 Although the room was small (but what NYC room is not), the bed and pillows were soft. The bathroom was recently renovated and very nice. Never had a problem with any of the staff and they were friendly and helpful with all of my needs. I would stay again. 
17825 Hotel situato in posizione strategica.Si raggiunge velocemente tutti i siti. Camere pulite calde e confortevoli(vacanza effettuata a capodanno). Personale cortese.Dispone di ristorante e prima colazione di cui non ho mai usufruito,quindi mi astengo da giudizi.Consigliatissimo!!!! 
17826 The hotel is in a really good spot for shopping and sightseeing just around the block from Empire State and over the road from Macy's. There is an Irish bar over the rd. Food good,rooms nice 2 queen sized beds in room. 
17827 I booked it through hotwire.com for $120.00 a night. Good price for 3 start hotel near 4th of july. It was a suite with full kitchen with king size bed & a separate bedroom. Good for a family vacation. Room was nice and clean. Nice place to stay in Manhattan. 
17828 Loved this hotel! Perfect location in New York City, as it was only a stone throw away from the hustle & bustle of the big apple. Hotel in itself was basic, but our room was of good size. 
17829 I never regret staying there. Travel is stressful enough. By staying on the airport grounds, you skip traffic, parking and hassle. BLT was good, room service timely, and staff friendly. Walk underground to your gate 
17830 We could not have found a better location for visiting during Jazz Fest. Hotel was very close to parks and music venues. Our room overlooked the Navy Pier, and we watched the fireworks from our hotel. We found excellent restaurants in the area around the hotel. We would stay again. 
17831 hotel is small, unfriendly and offers nothing.......my advice is to stay clear of hotel felix 
17832 El Hotel muy bueno, atencion del personal, servicio. Exelente donde se encuentra ubicado para la gente que no conoce NY. 
17833 The location is perfect for lower Manhattan adventures. Walk across the street to SoHo or venture a bit to Little Italy. Treck down Church to the WTC sites. Extremely clean and super-helpful staff. We went w/ kids. Next time, just me and the wife. 
17834 Awesome hotel super close to Hells Kitchen & Time Sq Clean White and utterly modern. Compact but fully equipped rooms. Easy check in and out. Perfect. Would really reccommend. 
17835 The perfect hotel in the middle of Manhattan close to 6th ave , and everything. Elegant hotel with perfect service, clean like every hotel of this chain. 
17836 Great location. Walking distance to Times Square, Empire State Building and shows. Rooms were a little small, but to expected given the age of the hotel. Staff was courteous and friendly. Security was great. C 
17837 I get sent to NYC for work and I've jumped between various hotels, this is the best hotel I've stayed-in in the city. Great rooms, on a quiet street, good location for work. But all of this comes at a high $ cost... 
17838 Great, affordable, clean hotel with amazing staff. We had a wonderful time! 
17839 Hotel che mi ha molto soddisfatto dalla camera (grande e sofisticata)al bagno ,zona circostante non di prima qualita' ma a 15 min a piedi da Times square.. Il complesso e' ancora in fase di costruzione ,ma nel complesso un ottima soluzione per chi viaggia a ny lo consiglio. 
17840 Took my family to the City for Mother's Day. The staff is the best. Clean modern rooms with the best bed ever.Will return soon. 
17841 Great place! the rooms are like a home away from home. very clean and great service. my boyfriend and i were there on business and the staff made our stay unforgettable. Im even thinking on sending Randy at the front desk a thank you card for all his hospitality. 
17842 Hotel was in a great location. The happy hour and breakfast for free really make it feel like you are getting extra. The kids loved the room. Parking is expensive, but it is Chicago so it is expected. We had a great time. 
17843 Bril hotel. staff very plesent could not do enough for you. Free breakfast as much as you wanted. perfect location across the road from madinson sq gardens, ten mins walk to times sq. would recommend. 
17844 This was a "Mystery hotel" offered by Expedia. (Only knew the area and stars before I paid) Only 80$/Night. One Queen nonsmoking Included: Continental Breakfast, Free Wireless Internet. Breakfast on plastic plates OK for that price. V. Small room, but quit area. Even found free street parking in the snowstorm... 
17845 Extremely tiny rooms charged at a 5 stars rate. The hotel is not more than a four points sheraton. Completely overrated, I can find better deals in NY for 250 bucks per night. 
17846 It was worth the price, clean sheets, clean toilet and shower. Warm water was no problem and the empoyees are very friendly and helpfull. The location is perfect, just around the corner of Times Square. When we return to NY we certainly book again the Da Vinci. 
17847 Great View, Great service...Everything was very clean. People were extremely friendly. 
17848 had a great time .. the hotel is located in very handy .. We plan to go again in June or July 
17849 Was there for the weekend with my wife and everyone in the staff was real nice, We had room service, used the concierge and visted Einstein and everything was awsome. Thanks to everyone. 
17850 Great location, basic hotel, clean, not 4star, but ok for short sight seeing/shopping trip! Don't expect more, and you will have a good few days stay. 
17851 Een goed hotel met een continental breakfast voor slechts 4 dollar. Mooi gelegen tov Central Park (2 blocks), tegenover Carnegie Hall en gunstig tov de Metro (bijna alle lijnen binnen 3 blocks). Een aanrader 
17852 very good stay at the hotel even alone. Great location, close to central park and 5th avenue. 
17853 Just stayed at Morningside Inn - fixed up, painted up - unbelievable value for price, clean, safe and NO BEDBUGS !!! Good stay - very happy. 
17854 Don't know why this hotel has some bad reviews, its a brilliant Hotel in a superb location, its clean the staff are super and the beds are so comfortable (with sheets changed everyday), its the best sleep ever, will definetly go back for sure ITS FANTASTIC 
17855 Nice hotel with a great fitness centre although uless you are a priority club memeber you pay $10 per day to use it. Hotel is expensive especially the bar Apert from that a good hotel if you are staying in New York for a few days. 
17856 I had a spectacular view from my room!!! Probably the best in Chicago. Holiday Inn has definitely come a long way because I never expected this.... I have zero complaints about my stay. 
17857 If you are after the centre of Times Square here is the place to be, great music 24hrs, but if you would like a relaxed surrounding W Down Town is great. 
17858 Great hotel! Staff was very nice and helpful. We used Priceline. Rooms were small (European small). Little walk to Michigan for shopping about 5 blocks, nice walk tho. Would stay again. 
17859 Optimale Lage fuer New York in unmittelbarer Naehe des Times Square. Freundliches hilfsbereites Personal. Kein Luxushotel das hoechsten aAnsruechen genuegt, aber Preis-Leistungsverhaeltnis fuer New York sehr gut. Wir wuerden dieses Hotel sofort wieder buchen. 
17860 Spent one night here in January, 2009 and had one of the best experiences ever. Lovely, clean, quiet hotel with great views from the windows. Comfortable beds, great water pressure in the shower. VERY nice desk staff...Can't wait to return! 
17861 A boutique hotel in a great mid town Manhattan location. It's Friendly staff and understated charm made my stay very enjoyable. I would stay here again. 
17862 Booked thru hotels.com. Thought I'd prepaid for two queens. Got there and sold out. Sorry. U get two doubles. Read the "fine" print is what I was told Hotel too busy and crowded. Elevators are horrible 
17863 Will not stay here again 
17864 A perfect hotel for visiting all that New York has to offer, excellent value, super location, adequate space, believe all hotels are limited in this city, staff very good, would recommend this hotel? 
17865 The Savoy is a wonderful hotel with an awesome location, easy parking available and close to all sorts of activities and walks. The Highline is within a few blocks, cabs are easy to hail - it was a perfect stay. 
17866 2 blocks from the A express on 125 makes this a convenient alternative for touring or conferences. Staff was helpful. Area felt safe even at 1am arrival. 
17867 Stayed last year - great location near Empire State and trendiest hotel ever stayed at. Will stay again 
17868 My daughter and I have just spent a fabulous 6 days in Newyork. After reading mixed reviews about the Millenium Broadway hotel I was really pleased with the service and the room. The location is excellent just next door to Times Square. Will definetly use this hotel again. 
17869 Stayed in the Comfort Inn Manhatten from January 17th to 20th. Good hotel, great breakfast each morning. Superb location. And so easy to get to the airpport. Would reccommend this hotel. 
17870 I stayed here in 2010 and in two years this hotel has improved drastically. Great staff. Newly updated rooms. Excellent location. Huge room by Ny standards. It is a huge hotel, so expect throngs in the lobby. Friendly staff and comfort galore. Well-priced for the broadway adjacent location 
17871 Hotel was very clean and comfortable.. Great location, very affordable and nice breakfast. Will stay here again. 
17872 Very friendly and professional staff! Everyone seemed happy, the hotel and room smelled and was sparkling clean! Bed was comfy and a great nights rest was enjoyed....Thank you to all the staff that made my stay enjoyable! 
17873 Take a quality hotel and spice it up with fun - cooler decor and quirky things like a telescope at the elevator landing and all of a sudden you are well rested and pleasantly surprised. Gym is adequate/good. Restaurant was very good food ( a bit pricey). 
17874 So enjoyed our visit! Must recommend Balance health club. Enjoyed the BEST. Yoga class Nice touch. The 2 bathrooms on the executive level Staff was exceptional! Best coffee and they found me some decaf teas! Hated to leave Wonderful location... Close to everything 
17875 Great location, just a few doors down from Macy's and around the corner from Madison Square Gardens. The room was spotless and had good facilities. The highlight was the king bed with adjustable firmness. Free wi-fi and gym facilities are also massive bonuses. Staff were friendly and attentive. 
17876 awesome place to stay in Chicago because it's in walking distance to everything!! 
17877 Definitely not a 5 star hotel more 4 star but comfortable enough. Rooms very pleasant. 
17878 Ottima la posizione: un minuto dal bellissimo central park e due minuti dalla meravigliosa time squAre...ottimo il servizio, ottimo anche per la pulizia, veramente gentile Elisabeth del front desk!!!!!! 
17879 Poor concereige service they caused more problems than they solved. Long waits for elevators. Lots for employees that just did not now how to help customers. 
17880 We were in the hotel during "Irene". The housekeeping and reception staff were wonderful ! We had dinner in the restaurant and were happy that we didn't have to leave the hotel that night. The room (a corner-room) was ok with a good bed. The location is super. 
17881 Our stay at the Best Western President's Hotel was great... It was centrally located and we were able to walk to most of our destinations.. I would definitely go back... 
17882 I had a mixup in registration form Priceline.com, Ellen at the front desk went through hoops to correct the problem. If your there and have a problem ask for Ellen, she is the best.... 
17883 The rooms were very small but updated and nice. Perfect if you are just using to sleep. Location great walk to many of NY best known sites and easy access to subways. Very friendly and helpful front desk and bellman. 
17884 What a pleasure! Attractive, spacious, comfortable, reasonably priced (for NYC) in a great midtown location. Friendly, helpful staff went out of the way to please. Stayed here based on tripadvisor[--]reviews and we plan to return to the Sofitel on our next trip! 
17885 As said... Spacious rooms and great location....still... Internet was down, ac dates back from the 50... All in all... At the rate i had i could not complain! One i will return to once it is updated a bit. ( staff and cleanliness are not an issue) 
17886 Next to Hancock bldg and Water Tower place. Rush St nearby as were the beaches. Breakfast & parking very expensive. 
17887 customer services and housekeeping does very very good job ...judy and dolores at the front desk and leivy my housekeeper very good job 
17888 Nice hotel in a good location to explore New York. Just take a taxi or the subway and your near everything. Very clean and comfortable rooms. 
17889 Hotel is goed gelegen zuiden van Manhatan, dicht bij Soho,Brooklin Bridge enz.... Het is super basic maar zeer goedkoop.Goed om enkel te slapen. Matras is als een PLANK, lakens zijn wat versleten maar alles is net.Douche kraan gaf een ronde straal water.Vriendelijk ze doen hun best 
17890 Hotel a 100 metri da Times Square. Camere pulite ma abbastanza piccole(tanto per quello che ci devi fare sono ottime).. Colazione semplice. Cosa dire?....... Consigliato!!!! 
17891 quite reasonable cost for new york $85 for a double room.great location just of union square but on a quiet street.lovely atmosphere not fancy but great decor.shared bathrooms but spotlessly clean and never had to wait to use.beds very comfy with tv/dvd player in room.would definately go there again 
17892 very nice hotel .. modern .. fancy ..clean .. but the room was small ! in a good location and Etienne & Apollo were very helpful .. they helped us .. and they were very respectful and I think I'll back to this hotel 
17893 Nothing to complain about. Great location, friendly staff. Nice clean modern room. Fantastic 
17894 Amazing, clean, in de middle of NYC no complaints just perfect. 
17895 My husband, teenage son and our dog stayed for a weekend. Great pet friendly hotel, close to all the sites. The room was big by ny standards, could use bathroom upgrades, but was very clean. 
17896 Rooms and showers are clean. Very small rooms. Lack minibar, iron, robe etc. Corridors feel like prison with steel doors. Beds are great. Worth 100-150 $ / night 
17897 Nice room but very dark. Great location for theatre goers. 
17898 colombus weekend the stay was over priced with the air conditioning not working for few hours, there was no apologies from management. rooms are small. but the gym is free, and its a great location would wait when the price is great before booking 
17899 I loved this hotel. Great location and brilliant staff. The area is a bit touristy and doesn't feel like the "real New York" but for tourists it's great. 
17900 I read mixed reviews about The Alex. After spending the weekend at this wonderful hotel I felt obligated to share my great experience. If you are looking for a quiet, clean and comfortable place to stay in Midtown Manhattan, The Alex should be high on your list. 
17901 Nice atmosphere, good and personal service. The room was more than satisfactory considering the price level - clean, nicely fitted out etc. Beautiful 'old style' decoration and a homely atmosphere, including Matilda, the hotel cat. Certainly more value for money than similar priced NYC hotels I've stayed at. 
17902 The rooms are small but very clean and we had everything we needed. The staff was very helpful and this hotel is in a great location near many popular attractions. We were very happy to stay at Hotel Chandler and would go back again! 
17903 Nice place supernice staff i love the room and the location of the hotel. next time we are in new york this is were we want to live. 
17904 This is probly one of the nicest hotels I have ever been to it is in the heart of downtown Chicago with great views the hotel room had bath robes and a mini fridge they had cable and great dining in the lobby. 
17905 Stayed her for 5 days in August and was impressed by all parts of the hotel. Spacious rooms, excellent service. Food and drink is very expensive but this is 5 star. Superb location and great courtyard bar. 
17906 hotel molto bello pulito e ad un passo da tutto. ho soggiornato 5 giorni in questo hotel ad agosto e molto bello le camere sono grandissime e in 5 min sei a time square 
17907 Mr. Alim, the manager, was very accomodating and made our stay enjoyable. We stay at this hotel often and love the service. Beds were great. 
17908 Good value and good staff in a nice location. Room featured a great shower and good bed. Only downside was limited closet space and no space in the bathroom for medicines and toiletries. The rooftop seating area is a bonus. 
17909 Un hotel consigliato, molto pulito, stanze molto grandi, letti confortevoli e personale molto gentile. Vicino alla Grand Central, sulla 42esima, per prendere la metro, ma molto comodo anche per prendere i vari autobus che passano sulla Lexington per spostarsi. Lo consiglio molto per tutto. 
17910 My family of 4 stayed here in August. It is an awesome location. Walking distance to most theaters. Staff was very helpful. We were not in the room long but to sleep so size didn't matter. Will for sure stayed again and recommend to family and friends. 
17911 The hotel was great. Very basic, but comfortable and clean. Area looks a bit far but in the end it isn't all shops are a couple of blocks away. 10 min walk to Times Square or Madison Square, so perfect location for tourist and price is reasonable. 
17912 Rooms need remodeling. During the week is very noisy if you are trying to get some sleep. The gentlemen who works nights in front desk as customer service needs intensive training. He definitely doesn't know how to treat guest. 
17913 Stayed a sunday night at the motel. Good service, provided continental breakfast. Rooms were clean and neat. 
17914 friendly crew and fantasic terrace; learned it was the largest for a hotel in all of NYC; most visitors from Europe; friendly atmosphere and very cordial; was staying on business and appreciated the quiet room and the good night's sleep; would recommend to friends and family 
17915 We stayed in one of their newly renovated rooms, and it was beautiful and very roomy. We also had family meet us a day later, and we were able to get their room across the hall from us. The front desk staff and concierge were very friendly and helpful. 
17916 Much overrated, but a great location! Very hip bar with view to pool, which is enclosed in glass. Rooms, like all Manhattan rooms, are small, really small!! We felt claustrophobic in our room. 
17917 SHORT AND SWEET--------loved this hotel and would definately stay again. Rooms very nice with useful kitchenette. great location. some nice eateries near by. try metrocafe. bagels fantastic 
17918 muy bueno el hotel, lo mejor la ubicacion, lo peor el ruido a la noche. Nos toco una habitacion a la calle y mucho ruido de autos y maquinas ue sacaban la nieve!, Las habitaciones son chiquitas pero lindas, comodas y limpias.-Recomendable 
17919 Great place...Stayed with my husdband for two nights...Bathroons never occupied...Room small but clean and neat...Great price and Great location...Friendly staff...Close to almost everything...Highly Recommended!!! 
17920 I stayed at the Hyatt with The Metropolitan Detorit Chorale from Michigan , Feb 2002 andt sang at Carnagie Hall. Everything was great! I am returning May 2003 to sing at Carnagie again and am looking forward to my stay at the Grand Hyatt. 
17921 Rooms are a good size and well designed. They have that something often lacking in chain hotels in the same category. Everything in the room was clean, new and good quality. The public areas and lounges looked great and had a friendly atmosphere. 
17922 We went down for a wedding. The suite was spacious and clean. The hotel staff friendly and the snacks were great if you have kids. The location was easy to find as well. Would stay there again. 
17923 The suite was clean with all the ammenities. The staff was courteous and helpful. The proximity to the Michael Debakey VA Cancer Center was definitely a plus. 
17924 The Buckingham is located close to restaurants and theatres. Central Park is nearby as are the shops of Fith Avenue. The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff friendly and knowledgeable. 
17925 This hotel had everything...perfect location, friendly, helpful staff, beautiful, new room and decent price. Despite being within walking distance of everything we wanted to see and do, the hotel was a quiet oasis. Simply perfect. We will be back! 
17926 We had a mid sized business gathering there and the hotel did a great job--conveninet (rail to airport), nice facilities, and really top shelf service and attentiveness. Food was quite good and reasonable. 
17927 I decided to stay at this hotel to save a little money before meeting up with my daughter's softball team. It was modern but not maticulous. Breakfast a little shabby but the room was comfortable and modern. The room hada funny smell but nothing major. 
17928 We enjoyed our stay. we were pleased with the staff, they helped us most days with different things. The internett-system was not good, though, but we managed. The room was average, but the beds were a bit better than average. We chose Sohotel because of the location and price. 
17929 Perfect location in the heart of NYC, yet an oasis unto itself. Once you enter the hotel, you are transported to a serene and opulent environment. Service is impeccable. The rooftop bar also offers one of the best views in the city. 
17930 Stayed here for 2 nights in Sept 2012. Right across the road from the park area and Lake Michigan which is a nice walk into town. It's approx 1.5 km into town if you walk. Hotel clean and room was a goid size. Would use again. 
17931 Trendy hotel die gewoon niet centraler kan liggen. Op 50m van Times Square. Heel vriendelijke bediening. Het ontbijt is iedere dag hetzelfde maar valt zeker niet over te klagen! We gaan zeker nog eens terug naar NYC en naar Room Mate Grace. Een echte aanrader. 
17932 I just completed a 5 night stay at the Thompson LES. Each and every employee was very friendly, helpful, polite, and learned/used my name each time they saw me. It was a very enjoyable place to stay - one I will go back to. 
17933 Great Hotel, just renovated. Free breakfast, Free local calls and free internet in the room. For the price I've paid, it was great. The King size bed and the large TV were awesome. A very great deal ! 
17934 divino hotel, muy antiguo pero re mantenido. no dejen de ir al bar de arriba, mad 46, excelente, solo para adultos, pero cn mucha onda. 
17935 I travelled to New York with my eight year old son who was visiting a school friend who lives in New York. The hotel could not have been more welcoming, helpful and happy to see us. The location was wonderful with everything within easy reach. We will book again soon. 
17936 Great Hotel, friendly staff. If given the chance would stay at again. 
17937 My boyfriend and I stayed here for Valentine's Day for a "night out" in the city. We really loved the pool/nightclub area - very unique! The rooms were very clean - although small. For the price and being in the heart of the city I would def recommend it! 
17938 I've stayed here a couple of times. The rooms are always nice and clean. Bathrooms are great with a separate tub and shower - at least the rooms I have been in. Also, great location in the city. 
17939 After reading the reports on Trip Advisor we were very apprehensive about the hotel. On arrival the check in was efficient, helpful and polite. The room and facilities were excellent. All the staff we met were friendly. Our regret was we didn`t get to eat at this beautiful hotel. 
17940 i have to recommend this hotel. we have just spent 2 weeks at the jolly madison, everyone is so nice and the staff go out of there way to make you fell welcome. great location , very central, will go back. 
17941 Novotel is an ageing and conservative hotel with excellent location at times square. We paid 275+ for a standard two bed room with no breakfast and no internet. After one night out of four we decided to try something else. 
17942 Clean, friendly and just 10 minutes from Time Square, what more could you ask for. The air conditioning was a saving grace due to 90 degree heat outside. 
17943 Abbiamo trascorso un ottimo soggiorno in camera con salotto e angolo cucina ,perfetto per prima colazione. Strategici per linee della metropolitana. Avevamo la camera con vista sul memorial 9/11, primo impatto commovente nel ricordo delle vittime 
17944 Da consigliare 
17945 It was a good experience. Room was ample and clean. Location is very good. From the elevator to the room it could use some upgrading or renovation, still good but showing signs of wear and tear. Inside the room very good, clean, updated including bathroom. 
17946 Excellent hotel for business in the area, but also close enough to walk to most Central Chicago attractions. I was impressed by the staff's professionalism and attention to detail. My requests were honored and I was treated like an old friend. 
17947 Amazing Hotel, Pricey like all the other NYC area hotels. But I would stay there again if I could. It's right in the Heart of NYC. 
17948 Very nice location, very helpful front desk , Dinah Adibu from front desk is an angle,Thanks a million. 
17949 I stayed here last summer and was pleased. Nice staff and loved the inside of the hotel lobby. Room was clean and bed was very comfortable. I will be staying here again this summer as well. Already have my reservation. 
17950 Great hotel, terrific late night bar, however the current construction is a real problem. Demand a south facing room over 56th St. The construction is on 57th. 
17951 All I can say is wow. I travel and I am in the Hospitality business and this hotel has it all! If you want a spacious room with good service, this hotel is it! 
17952 These apartments are amazing..I have stayed here 3 times with different groups and its ideal..great value and has everything from tv, couch, kitchenette and lots more..wouldnt stay anywhere esle if i go back to NY 
17953 Customer Service was awful, coming from management themselves. Not a people friendly atmosphere, rude, not at all helpful or understanding. If they are overworked and underpaid that is not the traveler's fault. I will never, ever book a room with this hotel. 
17954 Can walk to Central Park, and still be close to all the action in the south part. Nice clean rooms and great breakfast in the Honors Lounge! 
17955 Great hotel,friendly staff and ideal location for WTC and statue of liberty but everything else is only a subway or taxi. We thought because we were downtown location would be an issue but it was great,stayed 4 nights,great beds. 
17956 Fantastic location. Friendly & Knowlegable Staff. Large comfortable rooms. Great Restaurant. Highly Recommended. 
17957 1e kamer: te klein en met te weinig bedden. 2e kamer: herrie van de verwarming. 3e kamer: herrie van de verwarming. 4e kamer: prima, want in het nabijgelegen blakely-hotel. 5e kamer: veels te hete verwarming, in combinatie met lichte rioollucht 
17958 Great Location for Broadway Theatres and Shopping. Hotel was great, as was the service. 
17959 We stayed in Hotel Indigo Chelsea for 2 nights. Nice, contemporary and clean. Two minor drawbacks: the bathroom has no evacuation & the restaurant staff was a little sloppy. This hotel is highly recommended. 
17960 We stayed 1 night before our 7 day cruise to Bermuda. The hotel was outstanding and the staff exceptionally helpful and friendly. Only con - no coffee in the room and if you want coffee before 7AM you have to go next door. Excellent location - on Central Park. 
17961 It is an amazing experience, good service,great concierges,incredible room. A fantastic view!!!!! 
17962 What a find for NYC. Reasonably priced, perfect location, clean comfortable room. Staff was personable and welcoming. Will surely go back. 
17963 Cozy? I mean small, but the amenities were great. Desk folks were knowledgeable. Breakfasts were great. Centrally located. Near subway. Theater right next door. What more could you ask? Nice place. 
17964 loved the morning coffee and juice, great beds, showers, lovely remodel. 
17965 I've ever been in many hotels in Asia, Africa, Europe and Americasand this is definitely the worst one I've ever seen. Avoid it. 
17966 We stayed there for 3 nights and loved it. The room is very clean and the location is very strategic. Very close to N.Michigan Ave (walking distance) and various attractions (e.g art museum, field museum). Nearby there're plenty of excellent restaurants including P.F. Chang which is just next door. 
17967 Een prima hotel. Keurig onderhouden en prima service. Kamer werd heel goed schoongehouden en regelmatig schone lakens. Een klein minpuntje was het smalle bed (140cm) voor twee personen en de krappe douchecabine. Maar verder niets dan lof. Ook het personeel was prima; heel behulpzaam en vriendelijke. 
17968 Wonder little place, very close to Time Square. Rooms are small but that is typical for nyc. Room was very clean and comfortable. Staff was wonderful in taking care of our needs. We would recommend this hotel to our friends and relatives. 
17969 Needed a break in N/Y before our journey through the States, nice helpful staff, rooms clean and large, and the is a deli on the door step, alround good place,Oh and less than five mins from Times Square!!!! 
17970 I had a wonderful stay at this hotel, it is right in the Mall Parking Lot area. Also next to tons of resturants and movies and fun places for the children. Plus free breakfast and dinner! The staff is wonderful and very helpful ! will stay again. 
17971 Perfect location, close to all major midtown attractions, small but clean room. The only issue was not working a/c. Would sugguest to all, but not in the summer! 
17972 I have to say that I was nervous about even going to New York (bed bug situation) but I was very happy with our stay at Indigo. The staff was great and the hotel was great! Not one complaint. 
17973 My friend and I stayed here and thought it was the nicest hotel we had ever stayed in. The staff were so friendly and helpful and the hotel was immaculate! Great location, close to everything. Would 100% stay here again and recommend it to anyone going to New York. 
17974 Family trip (kids 10 and 13), Dream offers a lot to discover for parents and kids. Pool is excellent and roof top bar awesome. Staff were super nice. 
17975 Great hotel,very large rooms with a lot of space, nice kitchen with everything you need. Very comfortable beds. the stuff was nice and helpfull. The location is great and the price is more than reasnoble. 
17976 Fantastic hotel. The room had a nice view and was well appointed. All of the hotel workers that we ran into were extremely nice and so accommodating. The concierge was the best as was Raul working the front desk. Great bar with great service! I would definitely stay here again. 
17977 Close to times square and walking distance to most sites! subway station is 1block south, easy to get around and enjoy the city that never sleeps! 
17978 Never had such an hotel, looks like a prison, long queue to check in to check out, no service, luggage room at 4$/piece, not requested wake up call at 4pm, very old, room and bathroom damaged 
17979 Super Lage, alles bestens zu erreichen. Nur ein paar Schritte vom Times Square und Rockefeller Center entfernt. Sauberkeit war o.k. bis grenzwertig. Service der Rezeption sehr nett. Zimmerwechsel, da vorher Raucherzimmer, war kein Problem. 
17980 Frette linens, Asprey amenities, suede walls, cool furnishing, amazing room gadgetry, and amazing service. Great breakfast at the Lamb's Club. I've stayed at some of the best hotels in the world, and this ranks along with them. 
17981 Great stay at Le Parker Meridien. Very nice hotel, quiet, good view, very comfortable. Would recommend it. 
17982 Really clean and HUGE room!! Great hotel and price. 
17983 $40 for a family of 4. Not only it's probably the only hotel in the world that charges for its pool, but there's no disclosure whatsoever of this highly unusal charge on their website, so they get you when the kids are tugging to go. 
17984 Lovely room overlooking fifth ave...up on the 11th floor....one side of the mattress was funky....mentioned it to the front desk...20 minutes later 2 uniformed men appered with a new king sized mattress! Amazing! Fabulous millwork...beautiful baths...lots of waters...perfect location..a few blocks to the opera....shopping...a few blocks to the theather! 
17985 Fantasic, exciting, elegant...wonderful location and great staff. 
17986 Truly a great hotel with great qualities. It was a incredible stay with great service and be sure to get an upper floor if possible for terrific views. 
17987 Stayed at Doubletree Suites for 3 nights in NYC. The location is excellent and the security is great would stay at doubletree again. (but stay out of the mini bar a can of diet coke is $3.50 ) 
17988 The best way to describe this hotel is; great location, fantastic and fun staff, one of the best boutique themed hotels I have visited. Fun view from the room. Pool is fantastic! 
17989 Very close to Times Square easy to catch public transport from and the stuff is very friendly and helpful. However the rooms are very small and a bit pricy for what you pay for. 
17990 Staff is very motivated, helpful, courteous, knowledgeable - staff is of the highest quality. Huge breakfast included. Location unbeatable. Four subway lines within three minute walk. 
17991 Loved this hotel. Very close to the Broadway and all the action. Hotel was clean and quiet. Bedding was great. We especially enjoyed our "corner room" with five huge windows looking out across Manhattan. Staff was pleasant and helpful. We highly recommend this hotel. 
17992 posizione strategica: a piedi ottimo per central park, 5th street, brodway e time square. Camere caldissime, ampie, pulite, silenziosissime. Servizio i soliti americani poco pazienti con italiano che parla poco ingele. Evita hard rock cafe si mangia da schifo, prezzo abbordabile per hotel dove ci devi solo dormire. 
17993 This was a great hotel...no doubt about it! Very reasonable, clean, and a comfortable place to stay in the city. Fancy enough for me. Good location 1 stop away from Grand Central! NYU neighborhood is always fun and interesting. Very nice staff, Cool rooms! 
17994 We arrived early-they allowed precheck in-(room wasn't ready)they stored our luggage (the valet was wonderful) and the valet parking was excellent-just pulled in front of the hotel and everything was done for us. 
17995 We enjoyed our stay here. We did have to wait for our room, but were comped drinks in the lounge which was very nice. The room was clean, beautifully decorated, and had a great view. I didn't find anything dated or inadequate. Would stay here again. 
17996 good base for central new york no coffee or tea making facilities in room we stayed for two nights and it served its purpose basic el cheapo rooms but good location 
17997 The rooms were o.k. three years ago and in the mean time redecorated! The staff was very attentive and helpful. 
17998 The Sofitel on 44th Street is like comfort food. You can't go wrong. Big comfortable bedrooms, cushy beds, bathroom with separate bath and shower, great amenities, wonderful service, great location. 
17999 The staff at this hotel is very friendly and helpful. I especially want to commend Zakiya for going out of her way to help me and a colleague find a quiet place to work on a project. 
18000 This Hotel is brilliantly located for anyone wanting to do the touristy things in NY - it is only 2 blocks away from Times Square and a 10 - 15min walk to Empire state and Rockefeller center. 
18001 We went up to Houston during spring break to visit my folks and we got a good price on the hotel and enjoyed our stay. 
18002 Spent three nights at the Novotel in mid-April 2005; after this, I wouldn't even think about staying anywhere else in New York. Excellent overall value, very nice rooms, friendly service, perfect location 
18003 the ideal place for a New York vacation! 
18004 This was our second stay at this location. Hotel is clean and comfortable. The breakfast has a nice variety. Hotel offers shuttle service to the nearby medical district. Hotel staff is friendly and accommodating. 
18005 Great hotel to stay For the rates we got it could not have been better Quiet and clean rooms equipped with all you need even flat screen tv and iron and ironboard Friendly reception Great place to stay - metro station right in front of the hotel 
18006 We came from Gatineau and stayed for 4 days at the Indigo in beginning of October. It was very nice. Thanks to Tom and the lovely staff over there. We had a wonderful time ! 
18007 I went for 9 nights to NYC with my girlfriend for a holiday. The hotel is about a 100m walk from the centre of Times Square so is in an ideal location! The rooms are cleaned and the staff also ok. 
18008 Excellent location, great atmosphere, very polite and helpful front desk and concierge staff. Design hotel with small but cosy rooms. The experience was even better because of David ( from concierge) who gave us perfect restaurant indication and got us last minute table reservations. 
18009 Excellent hotel in terms of guest service and comnfort. AnneMara, Leslie and Sanela provide a perfect approach guest relations. Nothing is too small to deal with and they always manage to make booking extremely easy despite often changes. They always make me and my family extremely welcome. Thankyou 
18010 Perfect location for shopping and sightseeing. Very nice staff, clean rooms. The bar is super cool with live Jazz music Wednesday and Friday - Speakeasy 
18011 Really a bad experience. The hotel is more like a cheap supermarket than a hotel. Better to stay in a youth hostel (which are pretty good in New York). 
18012 Definitly Four Seasons material. People were pleasant. Suite was comfy and classy, service excellent, high tea was great. Breakfast was good dinner was average. Location quiet..all in all worth the stay! 
18013 The hotel was adequate. Very basic no amenities and very noisy with the trains going passed day and night. No parking. However in a very cosmopolitan area, close to cheap souvenir shops and close to subways. Took about twenty minutes to Times square on subway. Would not stay here again. 
18014 Considering this places reputation I was far from impressed with the service levels. Check in was a disgrace and not organised. Maids left our room door open when they'd finished cleaning and overall, we felt it was poor value for money. Won't stay here next time. 
18015 Great location, right near Penn Station. Easy walk to Theater District, Flower District and all subways. Large clean suites and helpful staff. 
18016 Muy bien comunicado, muy amables y serviciales. Buen precio. 
18017 Great location - 3 blocks to Times Sq, 2 to 8th Ave subway Mid-town, but QUIET side street (48th betw 8th and 9th) Clean, recently renovated room (FYI, rooms are small) Very friendly/professional staff Good facilities (business center/coffee shop, etc) 
18018 stunning remodel of this vintage property. comfortable, beautiful, peaceful. trendy isn't a word i would use as i've read and heard about this property. it is a lasting minimalist property that will stand the test of time. 
18019 Enjoyed the decor and style of this hotel. Parking is a little on the expensive side. 
18020 we have been very satisfy by the quality of service and by the very good location of the hotel. Team was always very helpfull and available. Very romantic hotel and the location is just perfect for holidays in New York. 
18021 Beautiful spacious well appointed room. Spotlessly clean hotel with excellent service. Travelled with a small group and each any every one in the group was more then satisfied. We plan to book again next year. 
18022 This is a great location with superb security. The rooms are nice as they are suites. Although, not exceptional service, as there are better in New York, the location can't be beat. 
18023 On The Avenue is a hidden gem on the Upper West Side. Decently priced, nice rooms and very accessible to downtown via the 1 two blocks away. I stay here almost every time I'm in NY. 
18024 The hotel is one of the best in NYC. The only problem is lack of a full fledged restaurant for a stylish dinner or lunch 
18025 Just stayed with friends at the W city Center and had an amazing experience. Wonderful interiors, great staff, brilliant concierge called Eden, great location. Would highly recommend to anyone for business or pleasure. Carmen and Amy 
18026 I stayed at the new Courtyard Marriott last month. It was great! Nice, new, clean, great comfortable beds. The staff was amazing and they were very accomodating about a late check out. The best the upper east side has to offer. 
18027 Excellent location. Nice room. Great deal that included parking. Breakfast at Norma's is fabulous but expensive. 
18028 Indoor pool was open until midnight, temperature was perfect, jacuzzi great too. We arrived 10:30pm and thoroughly enjoyed those items. Fitness center was great the next morning. Breakfast was OK -- the staff didn't maintain it, we had to keep asking for basic things (bowls, cereal, pancake batter, etc.). 
18029 Very convenient location right off Broadway.Definitely not a plush hotel but adequate. 
18030 staff are awesome - room and location are great!!! but again with the 15.00 a day for wiifii 
18031 You know there's something wrong when it feels like a wonderful dream to step out of this hotel onto the streets of NYC in August. Never come here... you will regret it for the rest of your miserable days. It will change you for the worst. 
18032 Stayed here for three nights using priority club points. Location was great room very small. Breakfast was ordinary. There is an ATM in the lobby. 
18033 Good value for a 3 bed room. Staff cleaned our room everyday. Very close to downtown, galleria mall and Lakewood church, the main event of our trip. 
18034 The Hotel Felix achieved the unbeatable combination of great value; comfortable, immaculately clean and well appointed rooms; friendly, helpful staff without a trace of stuffiness; and cozy, inviting lobby and bar. We loved it and would absolutely stay again. 
18035 Really enjoyed the trip to Chicago and my stay at the Holiday Inn downtown. The rooms were good, fitness area was what I needed, but more so, the staff was very friendly. 
18036 If you fly out of IAH, this is the place to stay. The shuttle service gets you there quickly, and it is an easy drive off of the highway. You also get a quick, hot breakfast to get you going on the road. 
18037 Very satisfied. Not our first time in this hotel and will not be our last. I really do wish you could have given this survey in my mother language. I really do not understand what I have accepted in the 'Bedingungen und Hinweise '. 
18038 The hotel was nice, clean & quiet. Nothing grose or stinky about it. The room was big and nice. The hotel in not new but it gives a feeling of characture. We would stay again. Good location. 
18039 Spent three nights during September 2012 in this great small boutique hotel. Excellent location just a few streets away from both Central park and Times Square everything for all your tourist needs. Immaculatey clean and well maintained. Will use again when travelling to NY. 
18040 Excellent visit. Staff was very friendly, room was spacious and clean/never had such so much space in a NYC hotel, breakfast was filling and the view was great. No complaints at all. 
18041 My sister and I just got back from our trip, I was so happy I chose this hotel, best location if you want to shop Fifth Ave and take in Time Square. The staff was so nice and helpful, the beds where so comfortable, I would stay here again. 
18042 The rooms were nice. Our room had a view of Lake Michigan, the marina and Soldier Field (Chicago Bears). Although, there is not much within walking distance - we took taxis most places. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The service was spectacular !! 
18043 We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights and really enjoyed our stay. The room was very clean, comfy and modern. Staff were very helpful and friendly. We have already recommended this hotel to some of our friends and we will definitely stay here again. 
18044 Out room was outdated and the bathroom very small and outdated. We were on the 20th floor and carpet old and the wallpaper peeling off the walls. Location is great, but that is it. Would not stay again. Shame this has the Hilton name. 
18045 Excellent hotel, nice people view, since the bellboys to the boy's breakfast. I recommend for sure. 
18046 Loved this hotel!!! The loacton is great! It's close to the 1 train, which will take you to all parts of the city! Hotel was clean and staff was very friendly!! I'm an SPG member and will definatly be back! 
18047 I stay for a weekend, and the rooms were nice and clean. 
18048 This was a trip to Houston to see family members. Every thing went well. the hotel was conveniently located for our stay. 
18049 Fantastische ligging, ook het feit dat er een concierge service aanwezig is maakte het een stuk aangenamer om verschillende restaurants uit te proberen. Kan zeker iedereen dit hotel van harte aanbevelen. 
18050 This is the 5th time I've stayed at this hotel while in NYC on business. The staff are always so accommodating - helpful - and always with a smile. From the Bell staff, front desk to the restaurant breakfast crew - they are terrific! Thank you for a great stay! 
18051 Very enjoyable stay. Rooms were clean and confortable. Fine location. Service was great. Recommended. 
18052 Good sized King room for NYC. Rooms on each floor that end in 01 are end rooms and much larger. No views in these rooms. Great 2 night visit, couldn't be happier. 
18053 Our organization had a terrible time paying for lodging through our corporate credit card. If you plan to use a corporate credit card, i would go somewhere else. Our employees ended up charging their room to their own credit cards. 
18054 Das Hotel ist an sehr guter Lage unterhalb des Central Parks und nur 10 Gehminuten vom Time Square entfernt. Die Zimmer sind sehr klein, was in NY aber normal ist. Besonders hervorzuheben ist die beeindruckende Skybar, die sich im ca. 14 Stock befindet und eine hervorragendes Ambiente hat. 
18055 This is one hotel that i agree with all the reviews great hotel great service and great perks included in the price of your room 
18056 rooms ok, bed also ok not very luxury but excellent location people from the front desk very helpful when we next year going to New York , for the price i take this hotel again i recommend this hotel cheap en exellent location 
18057 We loved the location. It's an easy walk to the best shopping and there are tons of restaurants within a few blocks. The hotel itself is clean and has a very contemporary beach style going on (unique for a city). The rooms themselves are a bit tight though. 
18058 staff was very professional and accommodating to our family. place was clean. breakfast was good, though a little more variety would've been nice. i would stay again! 
18059 Fantastic hotel with very nice and friendly staff. The room were also very nice. 
18060 Very friendly staff good location and good price, but very small room, room very hot not able to control the heat, but would stay again nice free breakfast , vending machine out of water each night we stayed 
18061 top! perfekte Lage, mitten im Zentrum und die Aussicht war ein Traum 
18062 Hotel has direct connection to the Grand Central Station - great if you use the Subway, very convienient. Stayed in King Room, comforable bed, large walk-in-closet, and decent bath size. Beautiful decor. Cleaning staff did a good job. Concierge was not too helpful though, was disappointed about that. 
18063 We like the hotel, very convenience and nice. The price is also reasonable. 
18064 The room was VERY small and our hotel window looked into neighboring buildings. Location was OK, but I feel, everything considered, that there are better values elsewhere. 
18065 The hotel was in a convenient location, the staff was very helpful with directions and went above and beyond to get us a cab when needed. Definitely will stay again while in NYC 
18066 Our first visit to New York this hotel was in a great location for seeing the city in two and a half days. the staff were all very friendly and our room was always clean and comfortable. 
18067 Loved this hotel. Everything you needed in a clean, simple room. The desk staff were extremely helpful and pleasant. Parking was a little bit of a pain, but it's NYC! So close to everything. It's truly a 'Gem'. 
18068 Good hotel. Somewhat pricy. Staff very helpful and professional Why do you want 100 characters for this? I am about to quit entirely too much trouble l 
18069 I stayed in the Alcove room....with the fab bathtub...staff was outstanding especially Tatiana the concierge. Bartender made me feel very comfortable having a drink alone until my friends met me..In love with the Royalton... 
18070 My boyfriend and I cam for 6 days to this hotel. It's on a quiet block which was nice, the rooms were small but the staff was friendly and the place is kept super clean. We will be back this summer for sure! 
18071 Amazing style, friendliness, cleanliness and convenience near Central Park. Every expressed need is met by hotel staff. 
18072 I will definetely be back and i will recommend the hotel to everyone I know. The rooftop terrace was ausumn 
18073 We treated ourselves last weekend and stayed at your property. It reminded us of the Amalfi Coast. The rooms were top notch and your restaurant notable. Thank you for an enjoyable weekend. 
18074 We stayed in the Wellington last year and are booking again to go back in December. 
18075 Fantastic classy hotel, great staff & service. Warm & friendly. Interesting bar , Norman & Eric will look after you 
18076 Me and my friends had the best time the staff was so helpful and great with directions and questions. Our rooms were beautiful big rooms big bathroom and very clean 4th floor restaraunt downstairs was great and kareoke too! We will definately be staying here again for sure! 
18077 muy bueno , muy confortable, buenisima ubicacion lo recomiendo , todo funciona, excelente relacion calidad precio , buenisima ubicacion , dos cuadras del EMPIRE STATE BUILDING, Y 10 cdras de times square, y dos de MACY S lo recomiendo definitivamente 
18078 stunning hotel, great staff! rooms are lovely, you get free drinks and there is even a white noise thing in your room to ensure peaceful night slepp. Beds are so lovely, really liked it here. 
18079 This was a nice hotel for Manhattan. The room was really clean and very quiet a big plus in NYC. Our room had a proper shower ( not just a shower in the tub ) which was really nice. I would stay here again. 
18080 wow- 20 year Anniversary trip & 1st timers to NYC ..but not last!! Crowne Plaza was AWESOME- Location was AMAZING!! Felt extremely safe & secure entire stay. Staff sooo friendly & helpful- LAMAR is the MAN!! would strongly recommend this HOTEL!! You can't go wrong- trust me!! 
18081 the casablanca hotel is an oasis is a mad full on city, you walk through the door and are met with very helpful friendly staff. the rooms are lovely and they smell good!!! cant wait to get back. 
18082 Modern hotel attached to Greenway Plaza with easy access to I-59. Convenient to Downtown and Galleria. Not a negative thing to report! Provides Government Rates. 
18083 This hotel is very conveniently located on 42nd by the Grand Central Station. Our room was very small but the bed and pillows were great! It's huge, so you may feel a bit intimidated entering the lobby. 
18084 The club lounge is excellent! If you are an SPF gold or platinum member, I recommend this hotel! 
18085 This is a great place to stay. It is not luxurious, but it is clean, safe, and located in a great neighborhood. I have stayed many times and am always pleased. 
18086 This hotel is great for budget travellers. The rooms are small but clean. The hotel location is close to Manhattan. We enjoyed our stay 
18087 This is a really classy, clean, retro hotel with a very accommodating staff. I got a great deal on Priceline through name your own price and was so thankful! Definitely a 4 star. 
18088 Great value but a little out of the way. Rooms were clean and service was good. Only negative was doorman who tried to stear us to a gypsy cab for his benefit. 
18089 super nice quiet larger bed room and bath with seperate living room and kitchen like area free parking clean just behinde the galleria love it great for a budget also 
18090 Estuvimos muy bien atendidos, todo el mundo muy amable, gran cuidado y limpieza. Lo que menos, la comida, pero para mi eso es en todo EE UU. 
18091 A nightmarish place - walking the hallway to my disgusting room was like being in a creepy Stephen King horror movie. $300 single per night is outrageous for such a dump. Owners - You are a disgrace. 
18092 Nice hotel, convent location, nice room, had a small pool 
18093 Accommodations were solid, well appointed. The most interesting thing about it is the now rehabbed former "Pump Room" and the companion "Library." It is a true chick magnet. 
18094 I loved this hotel!!! The service, the people!! All was great. Its near the subway. Very clean, (maybe the bathro needsca window) but all is clean. We visit New York this sumer and this hotel is great for vacation, we are going to come back soon. 
18095 Excellant price- great staff-beautiful rooms.Well stay here again. 
18096 Hotel was okay. Needs renovation. Not terrible, but dated. Room was spacious. Bed was comfortable. Sleep was peaceful. Stayed for two nights on floor 19. Very quiet. Loved the fridge. Would stay again. God willing. 
18097 if you want to know anything about this hotel just watch this video and you'll get a good idea of what it would be like. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgBE1L8_WUs&feature=related 
18098 We like the location of Courtyard. Hotel staff very helpful especially the happy Irish guy at the concierge. Quiet location and Times Square is within walking distance. Restaurants and convenience store is at your doorstep. 
18099 Cerca de todo restaurants buenos Carmines, John pizzeria, shake shack, Amy bread , cerca de m &m , Hershey , Disney store y toys r us. Hay cafe , in piano bar, Los cuartos estan limpios pero no modernos necesita remodelacion alfombras, cortinas y colchas. 
18100 although it's good location, i didnt like the rooms. it is expensive if you compare it to its prices 
18101 Es un buen hotel.Esta muy bien situado y su relacion calidad precio es mas que aceptable.Podeis ir a este hotel tranquilamente. 
18102 l accueil etait pas correct, la chambre etait petite et le lit etait des plus inconfortable 
18103 St giles is a convenient place to stay in the City. # blocks from Grand Central and within easy walking distances from many attractions. It is always very clean, the staff is extremely helpful and friendly. It is a great value. 
18104 If you want a bit of bohemia and experience New York like a New Yorker, The Soho Loft is my hands on recommendation and my favorite place to stay in New York.... 
18105 Fantastic Times Square location for good price. Clean room, good bar, steps from all the action at Times Square. Great for families with young adults, teenagers. KC 
18106 E' vero, camere piccole, ma arredamento di design originale. Molto tranquillo, splendidi i bagni in comune, grandi e forniti di ogni attrezzatura. Personale efficiente e gentile. Posizione centrale e vicino a luoghi di grande interesse. Lo consiglio a chiunque voglia fare una bella vacanza a NYC 
18107 Great location and service. Everyone that I came in contact with was very kind and helpful. When I come back to the city I will make a reservation with Off Soho! 
18108 a beautiful, very well maintained facility. Not a walking distance to the Galleria. Beautiful rooms, and an outstanding exercise room. Service is excellent and very prompt. A business traveler here - highly recommended 
18109 Overall great service by the staff. Room was very clean. Breakfast was available at 3:30 in the morning. Pool needs a little maintenance. Great place to take your family on a vacation. Overall good stay. 
18110 The Hilton offers a comfortable room in Midtown, close to major tourist attractions. We stayed for two nights during the Christmas season. The room was $125 from Priceline. Comfortable, good service, safe--they ask everyone entering after 10 pm to show their room key. 
18111 De locatie is super! Straat uit en je staat in madison sqaur park. Metro 23street vlakbij. Kamers klein maar elke dag schoon gemaakt met nieuwe handdoeken. Airco werkt prima. Ontbijt stelt niet veel voor maar goed te doen. Receptie vriendelijk. Ik zou hier zeker nog een keer naar terug gaan. 
18112 Bathroom sink partially clogged, cold shower, paper thin walls and the rattling noisy, stop and start heating unit. 
18113 Really like the Bowery Hotel in NYC. Rooms are great. Bathrooms are excellent. Location couldn't be better. Staff are basically courteous. Forget about drinks in the lobby at night. Too hip and cool for regular people but enjoy a quiet afternoon tea in front of the fireplace. 
18114 great clean hotel nice location and great views but they didnt have a pool or a spa but anyone can walk the hotel floors at anytimes i had a person knocking on my door at 11:00pm wanting to use my phone 
18115 Fantastic location, average service, quality of sleep very low due to sound insulation problems. Probably will not stay again. 
18116 4 night stay was marvellous. Fantastic room. Clean, very comfortable and modern. Service was good and staff were understanding of our minibar incompetence! Great hotel and bar, although expensive. Would stay again. Enjoy. 
18117 So nice and big! Rooms are so comfortable and VERY spacious compared to typical manhattan rooms. Staff are very friendly! very nice location. Cant wait to stay there again! 
18118 This is a great location. This hotel is in walking distance to just about anything you wamt to do in NY Times Square area. The staff was pleasant and very helpful up to the minute we left. 
18119 Just a standard hotel. Great for business travel. The bar was well stocked with friendly clients. I had a salad that was good. The hotel has a strange layout but this doesn't really matter. I'd stay here again. It's close to the airport (IAH) but not too close. 
18120 My mother just returned from the Double Tree as our house has been unliveable for the past 2 weeks,the staff went extremely friendly and I would like to give a special Thank You to Benny in the restaurant for taking care of her special requests in the mornng 
18121 I've never been disappointed - if you ignore the staff who think they are superstars in black. Great location, rooms, bars, food, restaurants. I little bit of chic luxury. 
18122 I am well traveled and very familiar with NY hotels. This was by far the best hotel I have stayed in. From comfortable beds, to friendly staff and a rooftop bar ~ this is a definite winner. I plan to return - great value - great service! 
18123 We had a great stay at your hotel. Great location just 2 min walk to Times Square. The staff was exelent and very friendly. The hotel and the room was clean and treandy. The european brekfast buffet was to die for. I would defenitly come back. 
18124 Because the hotel was booked, I was upgraded to a suite. The room was magnificent and the bed comfortable. The valets and bellboys were very friendly and polite. Personalized service was provided every time I used the phone. I felt totally pampered my entire stay. 
18125 Charming location-you feel more like a resident than a tourist. Yet restaurants and shops and Central Park close by. Our room was large, clean and well-appointed. Staff courteous and friendly. Room came with an umbrella which came in handy. 
18126 This hotel was great! Very clean and the staff was solicitous. Also fresh cookies daily and a great location. The room was small but adequate, my whole family shared a room with two doubles. 
18127 Honestly I hated New York city because of this hotel! I remembered the movie derailed, stay away from this place! Pennsylvania hotel same or similar rate way better 
18128 average hotel. Very, very noisy at night from traffic. Rooms interesting but dated decor 
18129 The headline says it all. Met Rufus Wainright in the lobby! 
18130 Good location but expensive and our room wasn't clean and smelled horrendous. Glad we were only there one night. 
18131 I was not expecting a lot because of some of the reviews, but the room was great. Comfortable king bed, large room, nice pool. Excellent front desk staff. Walk to Lincoln Cemter. Would stay here again. 
18132 Easy check in, quick check out, close parking, with a hotel discount. Will stay again. 
18133 hands down this place is awesome. big comfy room .... I mean really big!! stayed here on our honeymoon and loved it. the doormen will help you find your way around the city. just ask them anything. bar is very cool as well. 
18134 I stayed here in August with my son. Tiny room, but excellent quiet area. Staff was great. 
18135 The Sofitel has very comfy beds! We were very close, walking distance, to the theater, Times Square, Grand Central and great music and bars! Sofitel is a great midtown place to stay. We had a wonderful time and great drinks at the hotel bar - try the white grapefruit martini! 
18136 Great hotel if you don't care about luxury. We stayed 4 nights and we were most of the time in the city. The shared bathroom was nice and clean. The rooms are clean, cosy and practical, the location of the hotel is awesome. 
18137 Took a little getaway into the city this weekend. Got a decent rate at this hotel. Check in was smooth and pleasant. Room was very nice. We had a standard queen and I found it to be spacious and nicely decorated. Perfect location in Times Square. Would stay again. 
18138 Perfect location, amazingly quiet. I haven't slept as well at home. I ended up here using hotwire and even the price was fantastic. 
18139 Excellent location. Our room was quiet as it was less than 3 feet from the next building. So, nothing to look at. Room was small as is typical in NY. Bathroom quite nice. Everything new. Was a good value for the $$. 
18140 I was in Chicago on a business trip and decided to try the intercontinental this time. It is centrally located within walking distance to some of the best restauants and bars in the area. I would highly recommend staying here. 
18141 Nice, compact hotel. Don't come for the quiet room overlooking the park, but come for the lattes, food, and vibrant scene 
18142 Awesome room, close to everything and very clean. Most of the staff was very nice. Will probably go back in November. 
18143 cant speak highly enough of this hotel,clean,perfect location,2 min from macys,5 min from times square.price was very good aswell,rooms were clean,beds were very comfortable,will be back when in this great city again,just dont use the fone or mini bar,very expensive,would recommend to anyone tho,great value in a great city 
18144 We booked the Hotel for one week on tripadvisor reviews. We were not disappointed. The room was clean, large enough and quiet. The staff was extremely helpful whenever we needed any help. We will definitely stay there again. Thank you for making our stay in NY so pleasant. 
18145 Stayed at this hotel for four nights and was very pleased. It's very "trendy" but the rooms are so comfortable. Outside, it's a tad sleazy (by UK standards at least) but you just walk past the porn shops and you're in Times Sq. We would stay again! 
18146 Needed a hotel close to Penn Station, resturant and show and this was a pleasant surprise. Wonderful staff and beautiful room. We will stay here again and recommend to others. 
18147 Stayed here during hurricane Sandy and we were well looked after by the staff who were all excellent, from the barmaids to the doorman they were first class. Comfy bed, reasonable sized room with king size bed. Great location, literally 50 paces from Times Square. 
18148 I strongly recommend this hotel. Spacious rooms, comfortable beds, convenient location, friendly staff...etc 
18149 Me gusto la ubicacion ya que a unos pasos puedes llegar al Central Park. Moderno y su precio no esta tan de locura como otros hoteles de la zona. 
18150 Small rooms but superb location, right next to the 47st metro. Good place to sleep after very busy day. Elevator is slow but could be tolorated. The rooms are clean. Nice staff. Good lobby. I would recomend the hotel. 
18151 Amazing stay,the room and the bed was comfortable,great location the staff were very helpful I intend staying here on my next business trip to Newyork 
18152 great location and value. make sure you ask for a room not near the elevator if you want to sleep. breakfast was great. concierge was great. would stay there again. so clean, nice rooms. can't beat the price in NYC 
18153 Hotel bien situe proche de central park environ 15 minutes, 2 subway a 5 minutes.Raport qualite prix parfait pour qui veut une chambre simple, propre et calme. Pour nous parfait uniquement pour y dormir. 
18154 Booked for 4 nights in Mid December. Great location, attentive staff, rooms overlooking Times Square, meet every request. Will book agian next Christmas Season. Concierge Desk was great. 
18155 Ho soggiornato all'Hudson Hotel dal 15 agosto al 20 agosto 2008, ottima posizione, buon ristorante, i due bar molto ben frequentati. Le camere sono molto piccole ma confortevoli. Ottimo per una clientela giovane e alla moda. 
18156 Perfect location. Cozy small rooms, comfortable bed. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Complimentary wine in the evening was an added bonus. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
18157 Great service and an awesome pool! Highly recommend for a weekend getaway! 
18158 Nice hotel at a perfect location for first timer New York tourist. Important notice: Upgrading to lounge level is both pleasant, cheap and conveniant. Breakfast with a view included. Free beverage and Wi-Fi 24-7. Light meal in the evening. All in all a bargin. 
18159 Great room! Great price. Parking was a problem. Staff very nice. Great Location 
18160 Our family drove through the night to get to Chicago for a last minute planned wedding. Alan from the welcome office was just that--extremely welcoming & accommodating. He made our family feel very comfortable. The room was spacious and clean. We would love to stay there again. 
18161 The rooms are slightly small but the rooms are well designed and bed which moves makes up for the size of the room 
18162 L'hotel non e' un granche'ma si trova in una posizione veramente OK 200 metri da times square il prezzo della camera e' molto conveniente tenendo presente che sei a NEW YORK una delle citta piu care del mondo 
18163 This hotel has terrible service, they don't follow health guidelines for injuries and the list goes on and on. I would never recommend anyone stay here. They are a flea bag motel, I wouldn't even consider this a hotel. Rooms are nasty!!! 
18164 Great location, close to china town and little italy etc. Very very noisey though with train right out window and between room and room was very bad aswell. rooms were small but clean. Friendly staff and helpfull. 
18165 Great spacious rooms, friendly staff and perfect location. Only thing was noise from the street which is fine if you are a good sleeper. 
18166 This property is in need of renovation. Furnishings seem very dated. No restaurants within walking distance. 
18167 My family and I just came back from the NYC Fashion 26. Very nice hotel, well designed. The staff was perfect. Easy and ultrafast check-in. Rooms were small but nicely designed. Very well located. Highly recommand this hotel. Hope their price won't go up. 
18168 Great service would deffo stay again it's quite near to main tourist places and subways only thing missing was a bar 
18169 The Park Central Hotel is located in an ideal spot in New York, New York. The staff is friendly and professional. Hotel is walking distance from Times Square and multiple eating establishments. 
18170 I have stayed at On The Ave a number of times and it is always a pleasant experience. Personel is always very helpful and pleasant. Furnishings are great and the neighborhood is fabulous. I have recommended it to others. 
18171 Love the hotel and the location. It has great service and the concierge was marvelous!!! They arranged all my events for my birthday weekend and gave great suggestions. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. 
18172 Zum schlafen super....der Rest ist eher Praktisch gehalten. Lage war sehr Praktisch, direkt an einer Subway Station. 
18173 Despite being a huge convention hotel, the service was excellent from checkin to checkout. Great location on Chicago River & walkable to restaurants & shopping. Too far to walk to McCormick Place Convention Center. It's a hike to El with luggage so take a cab. Would stay there again. 
18174 Wonderful hotel and staff! I could not have asked for anything more...near Grand Central Station and was close to Times Square. Great place to stay! 
18175 Just what we expected from Homewood Suites-very courteous and helpful staff, very clean and comfortable rooms. Good breakfast. Very pleased! 
18176 Irina Borukhov was the definition of a hospitality manager. Absolutely enjoyed my stay because of her efforts. A+ to her. Room was a decent size for the city. Only complaint was cab horns blaring. But a very nice hotel in a great location overall. 
18177 Stayed for a weekend night. Reception was great. Room was modern with plank wood like flooring. Only quibble was a very noisy private party in the roof restaurant till after 1:00 am. Would stay again. 
18178 better than marriott downtown but stay at the omni for same price is my recommendation. windows are not double glazed so loads of road noise. wont stay at this hotel again. 
18179 Great location and the best doorman in the world - Brian! 
18180 A hotel that has most of the things you want in a hotel but lacks that little extra touch that makes it stand out. Service is ok, but not very inspired, especially not in the reception. Food is alright but again nothing to write home about. 
18181 We stayed here because we wanted the extra space. The room was very clean and the staff efficient but not as friendly as I am used to at other Hilton properties. Will most likely try the Hampton Inn or Hilton next time we are in NY. 
18182 room was ok but bathroom had poor lighting which was good as mold on ceiling and around the tub was awful bed was comfortable but furnishings were old the hall was full of housekeeping carts all night long (four on my wing alone) 
18183 Fabulous location, lovely clean and comfortable rooms and nice staff. I would definitely recommend this for a stay. 
18184 The rooms were dirty, I had an awful stay. There was no wi fi, bad smell, and a lot of humidity in the rooms and hallways. 
18185 Stayed for 2 nights while visting my office and friends in New York. The hotel was excellent and provided comfortable rooms in a great location. The staff were very accommodating,friendly and professional. I can't wait to return 
18186 I was never in such a small room, beds are very small and you are not allow to get into some of the bars/clubs of the hotel unless you are register. Honestly a big deception. 
18187 Loved the penn hotel in NYC. Great value for money and my partner and i will be definatley goin back in years to come. Being australian i felt more at home in NYC than i would have felt in Sydney. Thanks NYC for having us. 
18188 Best hotel ever. Had a jacuzzi in my room and they brought the compimentary breakfast up to the room in the morning. Excellent service. 
18189 Although this is an older property, the people could not have been friendlier during our stay. It is conveniently located and a great price. This will be our "go-to" La Quinta when staying in Houston. 
18190 very small room and heat wasnt the greatest... but attentive staff, frederic fekkai bath products and rain shower. clean room with minimalist but chic decor. def stay again 
18191 For the price, this hotel is really not worth it. The entire place needs renovating - tired, dull and poorly equipped. The staff were helpful and pleasant, but your money would be better spent elsewhere... 
18192 Stayed at the newyorker hotel its 34th on 8th ave great hoel very central,lovely staff and the tick tock diner is class,TGI Fridays is not far away and the molly wee irish pub on40th street is the place 2 go,staff couldnt do enough for you. 
18193 The room was incredible (City View Studio King) - the high ceilings, the in-room soaking tub, great bed and great view as well. Of course, the staff was tremendous as well. Kimpton is doing a lot of things right! 
18194 This was a wonderful place to stay....great location, wonderful service, "boutique" size, Aveda toiletries- loved, fabulous bed.....would definitely stay here again!! 
18195 Important to know: the nice room pictured in the Hayden Hotel Web Page simply does not exist in the hotel!! They cheat! Their room are rubbish!When I told this to the doorman he simply smiled (and my payment was already done!!)Don't go there!Man adviced, saved for half! 
18196 good location: near many interesting places, but not too 'touristic', subway nearby. room very small, but quiet ! And well furnished. Cleaning service was excellent, also very friendly and service-oriented. Late check-out was not possible - annoying when you leave in the evening. 
18197 Loved the Savoy........rooms are very small...but once you walk out hotel door.....you can go north, south, east ,or west and find tons to do.......its a well kept secret..... 
18198 Stay in Crowne Plaza has been a incredible experience. Services, qualities rooms and amenities, etc. The experience begin from the reception, when Evelin, who knows what is the best way for showing to the guests the friendly of New York, tell you hello. 
18199 4nts-I love the hotel- we had a beautiful suite-incredible design and quite comfortable. The staff was professional. Everybody speak english and spanish. Location was great to visit times square, 5th av and is in front of port authority the bus terminal. I would recommend the hotel 
18200 Beautifull Rooms & a great Bar. Beside the Cristler Building & Grand Central Station. Perfect for a weeked break 
18201 The hotel is cool and nice. The location is excelent, but service is very automated. The reception was very mechanized, and not sympathetic, and nobody was avaiable to help me with my lugagge. 
18202 The location and value of this hotel is hard to beat. Rooms are typical Marriott, but are clean and roomy enough. 
18203 El servicio de este hotel es de los peores que me han tocado, abrieron mi puerta del cuarto 10 min antes de la hora del check out para literalmente correrme. Jamas regreso. 
18204 Location,location,location. This place is at the heart of it all. Great price and great rooms 
18205 How wonderful to find such a customer friendly atmosphere in Chicago. Also good selection of tapa type dishes in lounge and great breakfasts on the menu. I'll be back again! 
18206 Second year at Hotel metro for girls weekend away with my daughter and sister. family room looking right up at Empire State Building. The staff there could not be nicer, even concierge with very dry affect. 
18207 Excellent location right by Grand Central Terminal Staff couldn't be more helpful, in all respects. Rooms very good and clean. Good restaurant, not too expensive. We will book again when we next visit NY. 
18208 Great room. Close to everything. Great value. Breakfast every morning. Quiet rooms. And for all the floors and guest in the building elevators were extremely fast. Plus cookies at check-in :-) 
18209 Our family shared a two-bedroom suite while attending two graduations and found this a wonderful place to stay, eat, and get to our varied destinations. Even one glitch with the a/c was fixed immediately. The concierge exceeded our expectations. 
18210 Very expensive in any other services but you can bid on priceline to get a good price if you want to stay close to Times Square. Staff and service are bad. Location is excellent and safe 
18211 Local charmoso, bem situado..! perto da melhor area noturna de New York...Amazing! 
18212 complimenatry breakfast, friendly staff. small hotel yes, but perfect for 2 people. 
18213 great for just one night, very compact rooms, sometimes sharing restrooms with others. Location great for walking to midtown Manhattan and west side of NYC areas of interest 
18214 As a frequent traveller nothing extradinary to say about this hotel. The rooms are a good size and we had a great vew of the Empire State Building from the 14th floor. A great perk was that breakfast was included. 
18215 Great location and clean. The rooms seem a little outdated but that did not take away from a great stay at this hotel! We will be back! 
18216 We spent 10 days and can't compaint, Front Desk Clean and friendly, Rooms very clean and organized, bad TV signal, Pet friendly 
18217 this hotel was very clean, and staff was very helpful. it was close to the subway- and great for my walk to the javitz. the food was great in the lounge..fun place to stay- would love to come back in the summer. 
18218 Fifth stayed on NYC, far better than other 4 star hotels in NYC where we stayed before, even far better than Sheraton on 53th St. Very clean room, chicken ideal at the end of those long days in NYC. I will come back definitely with my children again and again. 
18219 Great price for New York City. Location is convenient to subway stations and Penn Station for trains. Room and bathroom fairly small but clean and comfortable. Cold continental breakfast is fine. Free computer use in downstairs business center for those travelling without their own laptop. 
18220 The Westin Times Square was a great location to get to parts of the city. The room was large and very clean. We booked the hotel with our Starwood points so the price was perfect! 
18221 Very nice stay. Great staff. Just a bit pricey for no room service. Rooms are small but nice. I had a great view from the 18th floor. I will visit again soon. Hopefully there will be some type of special package deal. 
18222 This hotel was a godsend. It was clean, quiet, friendly, and right in the middle of the action. We will absolutely be back. For <$180 in the LES we were expecting the worst but got the opposite. 
18223 Luxus pur - alles vom Feinsten und Besten. Toller Service - unbedingt 15 Uhr Teatime in der Lobby mitmachen! 
18224 Great Location. Friendly service. Nice breakfast. Clean rooms. Over all excellent stay. 
18225 We stayed here for 2 nights. We did not spend a huge amount of time in the hotel but it was enjoyable when we were there. Good service from everyone and great location. Parking is expensive of course. 71 dollars a day. 
18226 My husband uses a wheelchair (paraplegia) and we found the roll-in shower fantastic. the hotel is very central and in a se rue location. NB When visiting NY the Greyline tours are wheelchair accessinle 
18227 excellent location. can walk anywhere in midtown from here. close to all broadway shows and david letterman show. clean room with a good view of broadway. great internet price for a times square hotel. only drawback during our june 2004 stay was the balky air conditioning system. 
18228 I had to stay in this hotel by chance as I was to stay somewhere else but somehow they got oversold and I landed up in this hotel. And am I glad !! One of the best value for money hotel in Houston !! 
18229 Staff was unfriendly and not flexible with reservations. Had to postpone my trip to Houston because the city was being evacuated for Hurricane Ike. I was still charged for cancelling my room. Unbelievable. Great location, but so are a bunch of other hotels for business travelers. 
18230 Great location and large rooms for NYC. Staff were helpful upon check in, friendly. Overall hotel experinece was great. Lobby with free Wifi and comfortable seating areas. Room was clean. Bed was very comfortable. Lack of well placed electric plugs for the iron. :) I'd stay here again! 
18231 Just wanted to say thanks for a great weekend Oct 20/21st. Many thanks to Sandra Esp for her great custmer service. My wife and I greatly appreciate the getaway in Time Square, so much to do in only a weekend. Crown Plaza is right in the heart of it. 
18232 The hotel is in the best location for a very reasonable price in august ! The room was small but nice and comfortable ,hotel service and the stuff were very friendly.the price is including nice American breakfast and a cocktail in the bar.very lovely 
18233 Traveled for business. WiFi great. Refrigerator, microwave AND coffee maker in the room! Helpful and friendly staff. 
18234 It was my third experience at this hotel and still enjoy it as much as the first time: great location, great rooms, and a top service. Employees are nice and helpful, and very professional! I will for sure choose On the Ave for my next trip to NYC! 
18235 We picked one of the newer rooms and it was well appointed and included wifi - about the same as an older room and adding on the wifi. Great location! Drawbacks are the slow elevators and yes, the heating system was a bit odd/loud. 
18236 Perfect stay here. Breakfast was great, with fresh fruit, Starbucks coffee, and excellent omelettes. The wifi is free as well as parking. Access to shopping and restaurants is the best you can find in Houston. Wouldn't stay anywhere else. 
18237 Try to get above fourth floor and enjoy the neighborhood. 
18238 Right next to subway and busses. Clean. Ask for courtyard room. We bought fruit and yoghurt at the local deli. Fridge in the room. Breakfast very basic. The room was fairly small but adequate. Airconditioning a bit noisy but efficient. 
18239 This is one of the worst holiday inn I've been to. The room is not clean. More importantly, the wall is so thin that I can hear what exactly the next door is doing. The price and location is good though. 
18240 Fantastic location, logical price, clean & the personal is kind & helpful. The only negative point is yhe age of the hotel so don't wait for modern furniture, bathroom is small. 
18241 Great Location, great brand but very poor quality of rooms! Dirty carpets, noisy toilets, 18th century air-conditioning! I could hardly sleep because of the renovation work going-on! Quite disappointed though customer was much decent! 
18242 This hotel was fantastic. Two-minutes from the Belmont Street train station, close to nice cafes and shops. The rooms were spacious, clean and well-appointed. The lobby had a great open fire and was comfortable and well furnished. Breakfast was excellent. Friendly staff. 
18243 I stayed here Year ago great service then, and when they found out I was staying again they gave me a cool view, and the room is a little bigger. Drita was really nice to me when I checked in. I can't Waite to come back. 
18244 Just what you would expect from any Interconintental - amazing design, comfortable rooms, guest services that are incredible and CARE, and the food/drink at the restraunt was amazing - fresh and modern. Overall a wonderful experience. 
18245 I stayed here for thanksgiving, loved the hotel, we could watch the parade from our room. Love the view restaurant , within walking distance of just about anything you would want to do. If not subway stations were nearby. taxis pick you up at the door.excellent hotel 
18246 Very happy with the Hilton. Across the street from subway so you can get anywhere pretty quickly. The staff were good but really kept to themselves, which i like. Not very central but easy to get to on the subway. Cool TV's in the rooms! 
18247 We got a free upgardae to a Junior Suite on the 29th floor so it couldn't have gone better. We had previosuly stayed at the 4 Seasons (always onthe 29th floor out of pure coincidence) and the hotel was more than up to their standards, if not so grandiose. 
18248 Andaz Hotel 5th ave New York, Totally renew hotel. Ideal for young couples with no Kids. Close to time Square anda Central Station. Modern room, superb decor, excellent and $$$ lobby restaurant (one should have breakfast there once) 
18249 Excellent!!! Great hotel accomodations and facilities, awesome room service, cleaningness and perfect location. I will recommend it always! 
18250 Fantastic location but for $200/night, I would have expected a larger room. My room was smaller than any hotel I've stayed at in NY, London or Hong Kong where rooms are notoriously small. There are many, many better options near the Mag Mile and in River North so look elsewhere. 
18251 Recently took a quick business trip to NYC, stayed at OTA. Nice hotel, nice location, very nice people working there (Joane and Wenilda up a the front desk were particularly kind to this weary traveler!). I'd definitely stay there again. 
18252 Not your usual large Hyatt hotel. This is a small well appointed boutique hotel. It's New York and the rooms are on the small side but don't disappoint. The service was very attentive. 
18253 Used our rewards points to upgrade. Have stayed previously and have found this hotel to be in a great location and the staff friendly and knowledgeable with very good recommendations of restaurants and travel. 
18254 This is one of the worst hotels I stayed in my life. The hotel is dirty and the rooms are very small and low-level I recommend not to come to this hotel at all costs 
18255 Friendly staff, well located, beautiful hotel. Wi-Fi was a bit weak but worked. Huge, comfortable room and bathroom with a tub and shower. Expensive but would stay here any time and look forward to doing so again! 
18256 Our family stayed at the Doubletree for one week visiting the city of Chicago. We were pleased with the hotel and the staff was helpful in meeting our needs. The location alone is great, but as the mother of our family, cleanliness rules! We would stay here again..most certain! 
18257 Het is een groot hotel, erg gunstig gelegen tussen 2 metrolijnen en vlakbij Central Park, 5th Avenue. Absoluut een aanrader. Redelijke prijs voor redelijk hotel (niet spectaculair maar ook niets om op aan te merken). Wij gaan zeker nog eens terug. 
18258 Great feel, very well located, will come back again. Thanks for a great time. Walking distance to everything you need in New York with all the access to the tourist stuff you need. Thanks for a great time. 
18259 Outstanding location, rooms, and commitment to customer service. Love being able to have a quiet room in the heart of Manhattan. Highly recommend! 
18260 stayed here on girls trip to ny,only hotel that would guarentee two double beds.large,comfortable room,fab beds,big bathroom with great shower.good location on quiet street but 2 mins from bars diners and short walk from times square.theatres ect. 
18261 The hotel is clean, rooms are excellent and the staff is polite, but if you want excellent internet service to work, this is not the hotel for you. The hotel's free wi fi is provided by Lodgenet. It is worse than dialup and drops constantly. Definitely not for business travelers. 
18262 One more thing I did not like when you shower the water does not go down fast so you are standing in s pool of water which is nasty and the sink water also would go down very slow too 
18263 Great luxurious hotel. Subway close by, walking distance to the shops. The room was very wonderful, large and had every thing I need it. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was ok. 
18264 Stayed there for a weekend with some friends. Good value and clean rooms. Rooms are a bit small but thats usually the case in NYC. The terrace has a great view and the location of the hotel is nice and quiet. Would stay again. 
18265 I spent one night at the Shoreham. The staff was very friendly and the room was very clean with modern decor. The location was ideal - easy walking distance to Times Square or Central Park. Would stay again. 
18266 Great location and design. Nice bar. All the rest mediocre. Rooms are too small, noisy, without sun light ( the courtyard ones) and the service nothing special. Next time in NY i will find another place... 
18267 Moderno, comodo, excelente calidad precio en el centro, aunque para comer por los alrededor un poco complicado a no ser que comas pizzas recalentadas... 
18268 My wife and I booked through Jet Luxury Resorts for a Valentine's Day excursion. Location is great, attention to detail is impeccable and the rooms very brand new and so clean. Great gym I worked out in all 3 days and a very helpful staff that treated us like royalty. 
18269 My recent stay here was uneventful---in a good way. The staff was ever helpful, the room pleasant and the location on the Upper West Side couldn't be better. Simple, but fine. It is a reasonable (by NY standards) and very nice alternative to bigger, more expensive properties. 
18270 This turned out to be one of the best all around hotels I've stayed at. Easily the best customer service from the valet drivers to checkin to custodial staff. Room was comfortable and breakfast was good. I can't think of a single thing that needed improvement. 
18271 great price, great hotel, great staff, great location away from the craziness that is times square. just wonderful 
18272 good location, easy to find and it's very close to Time Square. There's a bus station around the corner. I should've explored the area or ask front desk about restaurant or mart around the hotel, but I didn't see one near. 
18273 We stayed at City Club hotel 7 nights in april 2011 for our wedding anniversary. The hotel has a very good location with lots of good restaurants around, the staff are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are large and comfortable. We had a queen bed room. Highly recommended. 
18274 This was a great central place to be in NY city.clean friendly, nice size room 
18275 I was upgraded to a suite which was nice on the part of management. The location is excellent, the service is great but the rooms and bathrooms are dated and in need of upgrading. 
18276 Enjoyed a quick city break at the Hilton. Easy check-in, lovely comfortably sized room, great bed, couldn't be quieter on the 19th floor. Always a good location for business and the theater. Planniing our return! 
18277 Stayed there for 3 nights and loved it. Definately non-traditional, but we loved how it was modern and hip. Host Eric and Manager Connie made us feel at home and took care of making sure our stay was memorable. We would stay here again without hesitation. 
18278 This is a very nice property in an absolute great location. The rooms were clean and spacious. The bar was convenient and provided a late night spot for some good eats as well. Don't hesitate to book this fine establishment. 
18279 No frills hotel great for our family of 5. Two beds, sofa bed dining area, fridge, sink and microwave. Saved us from needing 2 rooms and was minutes away, by foot, from Central Park and Rockefeller Ctr. 
18280 Very pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Good rates in the summer- very clean, very nice personnel, great "extras" including courtesy lounge. Stayed in a 3 person suite with 2 bathrooms! Highly recommend. Also a time-share, but they weren't pushy about it. 
18281 The hotel is so old and very dirty, rooms are so small and the AC leaks. Furniture is very old and look ugly. Carpet is very filthy. When we had a bath the water was yellow and look awful. 
18282 Hotel bellissimo e soprattutto molto pulito!camere enormi con finestre molto grandi che ci permettevano di guardare new York dall alto!consigliamo anche la struttura perche' a due passi da Times square.l unica nota negativa il costo wi-fi:14 dollari al giorno.obiettivamente esagerato x una struttura di questo livello. 
18283 I travel a lot for work and pleasure and this was one of the nicest trips yet. The staff and accomidations were amazing. I felt at home right away. This will be my new place to stay in NYC. 
18284 I'm in a room w/private bath, mini kitchen, tv, double bed, Strengh - location, wireless internet free in the room, staff very kind. Weakness- the noise coming from 8th avenue 
18285 This hotel was great! It was very clean and comfortable. The continental breakfast was terrific. I would highly recommend this hotel. 
18286 I was traveling on business and only there for one night but I would definatley go back! I was upgraded to a suite which was nice as well. 
18287 Returned to the Soho Grand for 3 days over MLK weekend. Had a great time as usual. The people at the concierge desk are always extremely helpful and very pleasant. The remodeled rooms look great. 
18288 The front desk was very friendly, the concierge was helpful with shopping direction and restaurant suggestions, even the bellmen were helpful and most courteous. We had a lovely room and will always stay here when traveling to New York. 
18289 We had a very good trip location was exactly what was needed. Staff was a little aloof but got things done. Very little help with directions but found our way. Rooms were nice comfortable and reasonably priced 
18290 Wre will return 
18291 I was very pleased with the hotel. The rooms are quite big and comfortable and its location is the best. It is situated in the middle of Times Square, near theatres, lots of restaurants and stores. The staff is very friendly. 
18292 The location is great for downtown Chicago. The front desk is professional. That's about it. They devote the whole 5th floor to smokers and that is all they tend to have if you check in late. For people with asthma or allergies I HIGHLY SUGGEST ANOTHER HOTEL! 
18293 This is an excellent hotel! The staff were pleasant and helpful whenever we needed them. The location of the hotel is perfect for the subway and within walking distance of the sites. The rooms are large, clean and well equipped. It's also reasonably priced. Highly recommend this hotel. 
18294 We stayed here last year and enjoyed the location and cleanliness at the GEM in chelsea. The rooms were tiny, but we didn't mind too much. We weren't there to wander around our room, we were there to explore NYC! 
18295 Very expensive. Was probably once the height of cool design. Now in desparate need of refurbishment. Service was good but room was horrible. 
18296 Beds are great best slEep I have had in a long time, staff was great and very accomadating anything I requested was done, I would definintle stay there again. 
18297 This was an exceptional hotel for or business trip to NYC. The staff was incredible, the rooms were very nice, the view from the gym was terrific and lastly the restaurant was exceptional. 
18298 Always easy to relax at this hotel. We have stayed here several times and always very nicely treated by all. We will be back after Christmas to take advantage of after holiday sales. Love the beds and fluffy comforters. Nice job Doubletree! 
18299 Great location and great price. Rooms a bit outdated but service was great. Would stay here again. 
18300 Stayed here with my wife for one evening for my birthday. Great location...right in the theater district. Amazing customer service...great rooms...elegant but high tech. The bathrooms are not to be believed...great showers! Highly, highly recommended. 
18301 We really enjoyed our stay at the Sheraton Tribeca. It is centrally located to areas like Greenwich Village and Soho. The hotel staff was great, in particular the bell staff. David was a particular favorite of ours. We would definitely stay here again! 
18302 Nice hotel but compared to its relatives, like the Morgans hotel on Miami beach, this hotel is more "normal". For ordinary, modern people with a feel for contemporary design it is great. Location in mid-town close to all attractions. Not luxurius, but homely. 
18303 I stay here periodically for both business and pleasure and always have a great experience. The refurb has made it even better. New style, fresh. Great service. Not cheap but you're paying for a fantastic location and it's far and away my favourite NYC W Hotel. 
18304 Enjoyed our stay at the Sofitel. I appreciated the staff - very friendly and were as involved or uninvolved as you wanted. I do think the hotel is pricey, although the location, cleanliness, and accessibility were outstanding. Very quiet hotel. 
18305 Staying on a budget, this was the option to take! Placed in a perfect location walking distance to everything, all the attractions and more! Rooms were small, though on a budget it was a perfect choice! 
18306 Great place to stay if you don't mind sharing a bathroom. Rooms are small be perfectly adequate and have small sink. TV and free wi fi a real plus. Bathrooms were always clean and you always know which ones are available from a sign within the room. 
18307 Conveniently located and newly remodeled, i always choose this hotel when in NYC for business or for pleasure. Antonio Goodman is an exemplary employee, always with a smile on his face! 
18308 lovely hotel nice rooms very large reception/lobby its tough to fault this hotel would i go back it would be a big YES 
18309 Recently renovated, the Ink48 is the perfect place to stay. Close to the Hudson River and Times Square. Beautiful terrace at the top with a great view of MidTown Manhattan. Conveniently located near 9th avenue and its restaurants. Our room (DeLuxe with a view) was very spacious and well equipped. 
18310 I was in NYC for business and pleasure for five nights. The Renaissance Times Square is an a great location, close to many interesting sites and destinations. The staff (especially the concierge service) is very helpful. The next time I'm in NYC, I will stay here again. 
18311 Went there for a girls weekend to meet my cousins and sister. Close to everything, walked a thousand miles! Classic beautiful hotel and would definitely go back! Drinks in the bar were a little overpriced but everything in New York is! 
18312 I had a fantastic view of Times' Square. If you can get a room on a high floor with a view, do it. The hotel was fine, but it was all about the location. 
18313 Lovely hotel, welcoming staff. Room are very spacious with large comfy beds. Definitely recommend. For tourists the hop on hop off bus stops just outside. Also only a short walk to grant park and museums. 
18314 This is a great hotel for a visit to NYC. The hotel was stylish and modern and the staff was friendly. 
18315 Perfect location for a short trip to NY, complimentary breakfast, free Wi-Fi, clean room and the bath, fair price (relatively to NY center), AAA discount. 
18316 La camera era spaziosa e ben arredata. Il bagno molto funzionale con doccia perfetta. Alla reception hanno risolto rapidamente e con gentilezza ogni nostra richiesta. Assolutamente da raccomandare per chi voglia soggiornare in questa zona di Manhattan 
18317 The Shoreham is the perfectly located. For those who like smaller boutique places with only 9 floors. Perfect for 5th Avenue and RadioCity. Rooms are small but that's not a surprise in this city. Front desk very helpful. 
18318 Very good sofitel experience but very dispointed regarding the bar and restaurant since it does not meet Sofitel 5 star standard. Nevertheless, the rest was fine, very welcoming staff, very nice room and location 
18319 i was in new york from 12 to 20, i make a reservation at the azure, the girl at the front desk was really nusty, the hotel is umbeliveble small, the room are the smaller i ever see, also is really expe, 
18320 Good location and staff are OK. But room was not very clean - cockroach in bathroom. And wireless is spotty and slow. 
18321 Stayed six nights on business. The hotel is an oasis of calm in hustle and hassle of Manhatten. The staff is excellent. The rooms are clean and well kept. A good nights sleep every night. 
18322 The hotel itself look like a motel room is not bad at all staff not really nice. Besides room was prepaid and hotel is holding in my credit card. More than i already paid. Hate this hotel politics. Location very close to. Roosevelt metro station orangeline direct to Mydway airport. 
18323 Amazing hotel! Staff is friendly and the service was phenomenal. When I come back to NYC I'll stay here. The bar in the top floor was pretty cool. The only bad thing is that they don't have a pool, but everything was amazing. 
18324 After a recent 2 night stay (last week) my arms stated scratching and had red rash like inflammation. Have heard of bed bugs in NYC hotels before, but it's never come true at other hotels. It's a painful and terrible 'first' with the klimpton 
18325 The service here is not up to the standards of good midtown hotels. 
18326 Traveled to NYC for a family vacation and this "suite" hotel made Manhattan quite accessible. Walked to most of the must-do touristy places but returned to this oasis where terrific restaurants were plentiful. Staff helpful, rooms spacious and beds quite comfy. Highly recommend...... 
18327 Great location Fab staff Nice FREE continental breakfast 1 minute to most Times Sq attractions Subway station outside Small rooms Excellent rate thru Expedia UK Stayed 5 nights and would highly recommend this hotel! 
18328 Exceptionally well manned staff - a refreshing experience in NYC. 
18329 Stayed for a long weekend. Arrival was quick and smooth, staff was nice and helpful. The room was a central park king room. Nice lighting, HDTV, and turn down service. Never saw a maid, but everything was kept clean and tidy. Had a nice stay, would do it again. 
18330 The only positive thing this hotel has going for it is its location on Michigan Avenue. Hotel rooms are old, run down and yuckie. I wouldn't stay here again. Beds were nice and staff was helpful. 
18331 Great location. The room was a good size for a single traveler or a couple. Room was not really clean - coffee pot had grounds/filter leftover from preious guest. Service is fine but not extraordinary. 
18332 Very basic Sheraton near times square. For the business traveler, Sheraton towers across the street is much better value. No wireless in the rooms. Seems to cater to groups of kids. Staff is nice. Restaurant in hotel is marginal. 
18333 Unfortunately street noise can be heard all night - had a corner room - nicely decorated - but noisy. Restaruant closed at 10pm. Good location. 2 elevators were not enough -had to wait a long time to get one. 
18334 We were shocked at how outdated this hotel was compared to web photos. Furniture was very old. Bathroom tiny and was not clean, hair still lying in shower! Beds were very comfy and clean. We renamed this hotel The Bates Motel! 
18335 I stay here because of the hotel's location, the variety of room choices, the hotel staff (housekeeping, reception, doormen and concierge service) and the great bar next door (Niles). I will stay here as long as I continue traveling to NYC. 
18336 Goede ligging, overal dichtbij. Geen fijne , gezellige resto's in de buurt, dan meer richting Greenwich village gaan. Goed, mooi hotel, grote kamer ! (hadden king luxe) maar geen ontbijt/lunch/diner mogelijkheden, alsook geen bar in hotel. naast hotel wel bistro, maar heel duur om alle dagen te gaan. 
18337 Disappointed in our room it was worn and dated no coffee or tea making facilities at 500 dollars a night I would have expected more. However the hotel location was good, the reception area was classy and the food was exceptional. 
18338 Location, Location, Location......we were able to walk to shows, pubs, most places which was great. Customer service was excellent and the rooms were very very comfortable. Views from the room was extraordinary. We will probably stay here every time we stay in NY. 
18339 Had a great time at the Tribeca Grand. Right in the middle of the action in downtown, NYC. very good lobby bar with pleanty of space to chill. 
18340 Much appreciation to Ms Annmara Gayle and her infectious Jamacian charm for a wonderful reception to the Barclays Intercontinental Hotel in NY....a favorite for business or weekend stay. Jim McAdam--Singapore 
18341 Wonderfull lacation, excellent service, exellent staff. 
18342 Locations is fine , it was a wonderful and close to everything room excellent 
18343 Always stay here 
18344 Especially love the front desk assistants by Elizabeth she was great 
18345 Although my stay at the Hilton Houston North Hotel was brief the staff was welcoming and professional, the roon was very comfortable and the lobby was a great setting for several business meetings I had scheduled. I look forward to staying there again soon. 
18346 Questo bellissimo albergo poco conosciuto albergo si trova in pieno centro ad un passo da tutto. alla reception sono estremamente cortesi, ci lavora anche un'italiano trapiantato a new york da trent'anni, Lo consiglio sicuramente. 
18347 Lovely hotel. Superb location. Wonderful rooms. Very cool bar. Friendly and efficient staff. Pricey but you are on 5th avenue. I like the idea of the free wine in the lounge in the evening, but the red was awful. I'll definitely stay there again(if I can afford it!). 
18348 Everything was great. Could not have been better. Ask for the NY1 package 
18349 The Cosmopolitan Hotel was wonderful. The hotel was so convenient to shopping and restaurants. The subway stop across the street made it so simple to head uptown for the theater and musuems. The staff was very efficient and most helpful. You can't beat the Cosmopolitan for location and value. 
18350 EVERYTHING was top notch from the check in women, Gold Upgrade to a FANTASTIC room by NYC standards, Norma's (pricey but perfect!), and even the barbershop. Did not have a single complaint which is rare for me. 
18351 It was a wonderful place to stay; close to Macy's, Times Square, 5th Ave., subway. The hotel is small, but upscale. We loved the convenience and hospitality. 
18352 came to party, they facilitated. this is the only place i will stay in NYC from now one. Seriously $170 per night in midtown, that is amazing. i was with a buddy we had a blast. hell yeah Yotel. 
18353 Worth every $$ , the staff is on point, the rooms are well appointed and the location could not be better! This property is a winner! I will definitely be back! 
18354 Wonderful stay at the Muse. Just like the other reviews say--short walk to everything, yet a quiet, funky spot. Will stay here again! 
18355 New hotel, great location, great rate... Clean, safe, helpful staff 
18356 Thought the hotel was great and the staff was friendly! The staff helped with everything we needed and took care of us with quick service. 
18357 Despite the hotel being near the freeway, it was able to provide me a comfortable time to rest and do my work. The breakfast buffet was a delight. One of the best places I have ever tried. 
18358 Clearly a value, large suites, extremely clean and modern. The staff is great and the location can't be beat for being central to everything. Very quiet. 
18359 Only 50 bucks more a night than the LaGuardia Airport Lodge. 2000x better. 
18360 We enjoyed our stay at the W. The room was clean and efficient, the staff was very friendly and helpful (especially Lauren and other concierge) and the location was great. There was easy access to cabs and the subway station was about a block away. We would book again. Brian 
18361 I must say I really enjoyed my stay here! Very close to downtown without the downtown prices. The staff was great as well. I enjoyed the free parking! Thank you to all of the staff for assuring my family and I had a great stay! 
18362 The location of City Suites was perfect. We had a short walk to Wrigley Field. The hotel was comfortable and the rooms were adequate. For any baseball fan I would recommend staying at City Suites on West Belmont in Chicago. 
18363 I enjoyed my stay in the Belvedere, really liked the room, a King Deluxe! Reasonable too given its location. 
18364 Merveilleux, accueil parfait ,service excellent, vue imprenable sur manhattan, confort exceptionnel, au moindre tracas tout le personnel se met en dix pour vous aider. Prestation hallucinante, ...un film de science fiction ! 
18365 Room was really small, even considered the average in NYC. Not clean, noisy, had to change room key almost every day because it didn't work. The location is very good, but this is the only good point. Internet didn't work in room, only in the lobby. 
18366 Beautiful property, well situated away from the bustle of the mid-town frenzy during holiday time.Service was good but rooms are just fair.Bathrooms are well equipped but a little ancient.Rates are exorbitant for this time of the year! 
18367 Just stayed at the Millenium Hilton recently for another stay. Andre on the front desk was great (as always). You can't beat the service, size of rooms, location and overall ambience!!! 
18368 Everything here was great. Our room on the 20 floor was roomy and CLEAN a bit of street noise but is to be expected in Times Square. All Staff were very helpfull especially Anthony ( Consierge). Will stay here again if we ever make it back. Patricia Fox 
18369 Great location for central park and close to theater district, extremely friendly staff. Easily accessible to the subway and convenient to the Time Warner shops where you can get anything you need. A great location for many attractions in the upper west side. Would definitely stay there again. 
18370 First we got room with no hot water. The maintenance guy told us the water is fine for him. We insist to move to a different room, with hot water. New problem - no WiFi. Service is mediocre, at best. Location is great, rooms and bed are very small. 
18371 I didn't expect much.. so it was great to check into a convenient, tidy, clean hotel with nice staff and great service. Loved the room. It was quiet and reasonably priced. I'll stay there again next time I'm in NYC! 
18372 Small smelly room. Thought by name and star rating as well as location this hotel would have been better. The staff was friendly however. Location excellent. Hotel needs to be renovatedl 
18373 I sponsored a training seminar here for 3 days. Close to airport and easy to find. Staff was totally courteous and helpful. Rates are good. Hotel is nice. Meeting room was good for up to about 30. A/C out in hallways - hot. Rooms nice & cool. 
18374 Hemos pasado seis noches en este hotel. Excelente en todos los sentidos: la ubicacion inmejorable, las comunciaciones con el metro o para ir al aeropuerto muy buenas, la atencion personal, la limpieza etc, Sinceramente lo recomiendo 
18375 We stayed at the Hotel Sorella on a Saturday night in November. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The downtown view from the room was fantastic. The room was very clean and well designed, with a really comfortable bed. I will definitely stay there again. 
18376 On The Ave is a really classy hotel, located litterally on Broadway it has really stylish, clean rooms. The staff are friendly, informative and genuinely good people, i can safely assure anyone who is visiting New York that they will not be let down by any element of the hotel 
18377 Very good service, nice staff but a minus for the internet, the rooftop bar and the small room. 
18378 Great check in with wonderful helpful staff Hagar and Milicha. What a fantastic location. Our second visit here cannot fault it. Looking forward to an early dinner before a show tomorrow. Upgraded again due to platinum priority club status and we look forward to complimentary breakfast tomorrow. 
18379 Enjoyed the quaintness of this old hotel. Location is great for everything that you want to do in New York City. I really enjoyed it here. 
18380 pieces of carpet remnants, dirty bedding, plumbing in bathroom doesn't work. not as bad as it was in the 90's with crack addicts,dealers and tv hookers all over. strip joint adjacent to hotel. not a place for kids, save your money for a better place. 
18381 Wow! Very nice hotel in heart of Chicago. Rooms very nice, great bath, comfy beds, large TV and mini bar in room. Movies and room service were expensive, and parking was $54. Do self service parking down the street for $35 a nite. Groovy lounge area, nice outside garden. 
18382 It is personal, well positioned comfortable - a quiet corner in the midst of the excitement of the big apple. 
18383 An accomodative friendly staff matched by a good mid town location and well equipped rooms. I have stayed in many mid town hotels in New York and found City Club Hotel to be one of the best priced high quality small hotels available. 
18384 The room was clean and comfortable, but dated and worn. The hotel is lovely, but the concierge and other desk staff members were rude. The location was very central, but it is was a very busy hotel and the elevator situation was terrible. 
18385 Great location, friendly staff and very clean hotel. I would stay there again. As a Starwood preferred guest - I received a late check out and an upgraded room. Terrific! 
18386 ESTE HOTEL ESTA MUY CERCA DE TODO, ADEMAS TE OFRECE OPCIONES Y ASESORAMIENTO Y RECOMENDACIONES DE LOS LUGARES QUE PUEDES VISITAR DE ACUERDO AL TIEMPO DE ESTADIA EN NY. ALTAMENTE RECOMENDADO DANTE Y TRINIDAD - CARACAS-VZLA. 
18387 In short, not what we expected from the Waldorf Hotel in New York, good location but a very busy place day and night. Would not recommed this for couples or families, more a business / confrence / wedding hotel etc. 
18388 Great rooms with full kitchens. Large bathrooms with all the amenities. Very quiet so I slept like a baby on a very comfortable bed. Crisp and soft linens, pleanty of closet space. Wonderful front desk who is very helpful. The doormen are especially helpful too. Overall a great NYC experience. 
18389 Prima tappa del nostro viaggio di nozze..... Assolutamente favoloso dalla lobby alla camera con ogni genere di comfort, pulitissimo e i ragazzi della receptionist assolutamente carini, simpatici e disponibili.... E poi NEW YORK bellissima come sempre! CONSIGLIATISSIMO!!!! 
18390 La chambre executive, Hilton New York est bien situee sur les etages superieurs. Par contre, la variete du petit dejeuner continental inclus etait un peu decevant pour nos sejours (3 jours de suite). On aimerait utiliser au prochain sejour a New York. 
18391 Great location to Time Square..Hotel staff was exceptional..couldn't have been more helpful...Great breakfast..again staff was very friendly and helpful...small rooms but very clean..Loved the warm cookies served in the afternoon...always asked if I wanted a bottled water when I came into the lobby...would stay there again.... 
18392 I have stayed at this hotel on multiple business trips, and I would highly recommend it. It is nicely located right in the heart of the city, the staff is friendly, the rooms are clean, and the rates are very reasonable. 
18393 I enjoyed my stay in New York Inn, the roow always was clean, and the staff are very kind people. Is a old building but I believe is getting better.. 
18394 What a beautiful hotel. This was my second time to stay here and it is my favorite hotel in Houston. We stayed in a 2 bedroom suite and loved how perfect the space was. The people working here could not be any friendlier or more helpful. Perfect location. 
18395 Waren 10 Tage im Park 79 Hotel, hatten ein super ruhiges Zimmer, das Bad war munzig, das Zimmer war ok und sauber, der Rest des Hotels jedoch nicht so sauber. Die Lage und das Quartier ist aber super! 
18396 Convenient to the airport for sure. Pretty good amenities in the vicinity. But staff at front desk did their job and not much beyond that. Breakfast and work out facilities were disappointing even by HI standards. And for $149/night I expect a little more than just adequate. 
18397 We love the hotel, very clean, small but perfectly functional, great service and excellent location with interesting history, staff was very helpful which it was nice since some people in the city were very cranky; We would definitly go back. Highly recommend this hotel. 
18398 I stayed in this hotel and I must say it has soul:) 
18399 i actually did not get banged by the bed or the furniture. my husband and i could move around the room without running into each other. there was actually a large chair for comfortable reading and relaxing. 
18400 excellent accomidations. Rooms were luxerious and I felf pampered 
18401 This is my 2nd visit to the Crowne and I love it here. From the warm greeting at the desk to the interactions throughout the place. Rooms are clean and well maintained. thanks. 
18402 Hip without attitude, most comfy hotel bed ever. Very clean and my room 619 was totally quiet. Hotel feels modern European. Yay. All the taxis know it also! 
18403 The sheets were disgusting and the service was terrible. 
18404 excellent hotel, very clean and friendly. i stayed there for 4 days wonderfull breakfast and lovely free muffins and coffee my corner room on 26th was sunny, the view on skyscrapers perfect stop loking and choose it !! 
18405 Fantastic location. Fantastic service. Beautiful building and GREAT room! Great design! But a nice boutique feeling...nothing feels assembly line here... and that Concierge service alone is worth the price of admission...simply loved it! 
18406 we paid 195 on the sat before christmas. got it on priceline. i cannot understand why these people pay 500 and above. the hotel was terrific 
18407 We stayed at the hotel during August 2011. We were afraid of Bed bugs and choose the hotel based on the reiews on Trip Advisor. The hotel was clean and located near time square, NO bed bugs. Good basic breakfast. Staf were OK altough not very nice, Overall - recommended. 
18408 Wij zijn zeer tevreden over dit hotel. Ligging is uitstekend. Direct bij de metro, dus zeer snel in downtown Manhattan! Kamers zijn niet groot, maar wel zeer schoon. Iedere dag schone handdoeken! Vriendelijk personeel! Er liggen zat restaurants in de omgeving. 
18409 This was the perfect hotel in a great location close to 5th Avenue on one side and Macy's on the other. Clean, recently remodeled, good service and a great price. There was always a security guard out front which we liked at night. We would stay here again. 
18410 Location of this hotel is brillant, right beside central park, times square and 2 min walk to 5th avenue shopping. Rooms have a lot of space, comfortable beds, great tv and clean. Staff were always helpful when needed and helped make NYC a great trip! 
18411 Modern, beautiful, in a very good location. The rooms are small, but very clean and well designed. You really fell you are in NEW YORK! 
18412 As always, an excellent experience ! The hotel is conveniently located, provides good value for the price, and has an outstanding, dedicated staff that is always available. 
18413 Really good value for money and fab location. Room not massive but did the job. We were on the 4th floor in a corner room, not too noisy at all. Bed comfy, couldn't complain. Would definitely stay there again. 
18414 OK location. Well-run. Staff smiles, no bugs, everything works. Reasonable rates translate into >> smallish rooms - but clean. Great mattresses ! Breakfast ! Would go for it again. >> Wine & cheese restaurant on the premises too cheesy for me, sorry. 
18415 My husband and I stayed here last week and it was incredible. we hadn't been back since it reopened and it was worth the wait. We booked our package from http://compete4yourseat.com and they provided us with a great rate when combined with our flight 
18416 This hotel couldn't be located any better if you want to stay near Times Square. Its right next to it, but on a quiet side street - so perfect! The room was clean, the size good, bed was comfy and the breakfast was nice. Service was polite and professional. 
18417 Just stayed at Parker Meridian. Friendly staff, Excellent! onsite restaurant for breakfast at Norma's. Expensive morning coffee but Starbucks across the street. Don't forget your bathing suit to enjoy a swim with a wounderful view of the city on the 40some floor. Will be going back without a doubt. 
18418 Staff was friendly and helpful. Check-in and checkout went smoothly. Room was very clean, bed very comfortable. Had a great stay and would highly recommend. Easy access to subway. 
18419 Just don't expect a big lobby...staff treats visitors like Royalty.b Friendly and went out the way to help. Beautiful old building....in the beautiful upper west side.... 
18420 This hotel was quite nice with a beige color theme and good service. The food was quite good and the amenities were ample. I would recommend this hotel for upscale travelers who like a a business oriented hotel. 
18421 A great family hotel. We shared a one bedroom suite with our two teenagers and everyone was happy. There was enough room to spread out and the kitchenette was great for snacks and breakfasts. Service was also terrific. The entire property is fresh and clean. 
18422 Rich at the front desk remembered my name after our first meeting.Johnathon at the front door was very helpful. The housekeeping staff was very friendly. The bed and pillows were great. We will go bak for sure 
18423 Super Hotel mit hervorragendem Service. Schale Obst auf dem Tisch, Betthupferl am Nachtisch, pik saubre Dusche und Badezimmer. Toller Zimmerservice 
18424 Great hotel, nice rooms and perfect location! Highly rec! 
18425 Een perfect hotel qua ligging maar ook de kamers zijn groot en goed ingericht. Direct om de hoek ligt de Times Square en is een prima uitvalsbasis om de stad te ontdekken. Ook het personeel is vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Kortom een echte aanrader. 
18426 I love this hotel, it's got a convenient location, newly remodeled, extremely clean, EXCELLENT staff, and the marble bathrooms are huge (compared to most hotels i've stayed at in NYC). Definately worth the $130 we paid/night (so much cheaper than the Metropolitan hotel, YET the experience was MUCH better). 
18427 Ez check in. Small lobby, help was efficient and spoke english! Elevator was quick. Room, mine on 18th , the top floor, was small, but clean. Very quiet. Easy to get to, right off 6th ave. 
18428 Had to spend a night in westchase and landed up here. Was a bit concerned seeing the property and neighborhood but sheena the receiptionist put me at ease and was very helpful. Thumbs up for the customer service. Room itself is ok at best. 
18429 Was happily surprised with the hotel. Nice quiet location away from Times Square. The room we got was update, although with two twin beds. The bathroom was small but acceptable. No two double beds in the hotel. 
18430 Have stayed here twice for business- but I have been very satisfied - will be staying here again next year. Close to downtown and close to the university of Illinois Chicago - I walked everywhere I had to go. 
18431 Situato a pochi metri da Union Square, si contraddistingue per la pulizia degli ambienti e per la cortesia del personale. Prezzi nella media newyorkese. Pochi servizi ma tutto sommato a New York a cosa servono? Comodo per la wireless lo Starbuks posto innanzi all'albergo. 
18432 The hotel is being remodeled. Great location. Nice hotel. Room was nice. There were a few things in the room that need to be fixed. I was suppose to get an I Love NY package with my room but I did not get it. 
18433 Nice room, nice facilities, mediocre fitness and pool. Costly internet connection @ $9.95/day PER DEVICE! Phone+iPad+computer+wife's phone = $40.00 ! That to me is. Little rediculous. 
18434 A great hotel for comfort and location. Have returned to this hotel on four different occasions and have never been disappointed. The staff are efficient, friendly and professional. Its like a home away from home. 
18435 Didn't cost that much, I had gotten a discount. Was right in the heart of downtown. A lot of other people complained of small rooms, but I had gotten a pretty big one. Friendly staff. Its not the Ritz Carlton but It was safe clean and comfortable. 
18436 Big trucks. Loud clanks. Revved engines. Beep beep beep. I wish I had known they were building something right outside my window. Forget about sleep if you face the noise. 
18437 The staff here are friendly and helpful, the rooms are clean and the location is terrific, near subway and the Empire State Building. A great place for families. 
18438 We stayed here for 2 nights as part of a coach tour the hotel staff were friendly and really helpful. The hotel is a great location for so many of the sights. Just around the corner from the Empire States building. 
18439 it was ok, not the best, chain town smells very bad, but the subway was very close which was very good, hotel staff helpful, room clean, but abit noise as the subway runs right next door 
18440 All the workers were very nice and available. Room service was fast and the bell men were terrific... Everyone were well dressed and respectful. Also I was able to do a lot of networking there view that I was there on a business trip. 
18441 As a frequent business traveler to NYC, I will always try to book the Residence Inn Times Square. Rooms are comfortable, quiet and perfect for relaxing or catching up on business. Breakfast buffet is outstanding. And the hotel staff could not be more accomodating. 
18442 We verbleven in dit hotel van de Holiday Inn omdat we de volgende ochtend vroeg moesten vertrekken vanaf Houston intercontinental? Het hotel ligt op geen 5 minuten rijden van de luchthaven. Kamer en bedden waren uitstekend. Het parkeren van de auto is er gratis, wat ik een belangrijk pluspunt vind. 
18443 4th visit to this Hotel over the years, and still a pleasure to stop here. Good location and facilities. Will return! 
18444 Convenient, clean, professional, friendly. Nothing but superlatives. Great service, meals, and people! 
18445 This is the smallest hotel room I have ever had. The room was furnished nice with a very contemporary feel, but the bathroom was tight and not comfortable to use. No more than one person would be comfortable in this room. 
18446 Overall this hotel is pretty good, with quite small but fairly well kept rooms. The selling points are the fantastic location in relation to Times Square, the beautiful lobby, great bar and snacks, Dean and Delucca adjacent to the lobby and a fantastic breakfast buffet in the mornings. 
18447 Hotel is only 2 blocks from Grand Central Station, subway and Express buses to JFK and LGA. Lots of good places to eat nearby as well. Room is comfortable and clean, with microwave, refrig and coffee maker. Staff is very friendly and helpful. A great value. 
18448 The hotel is in an amazing location accessible to all main points of interest. Absolutely perfect, if you want to stay in a clean no frills hotel, with a great location and easy on the pocket! 
18449 This is the perfect hotel. Everything about it. I can't think of anything bad to say. Come to think about it, I can't say anything mediocre about it. Service is perfect, food is perfect, room was awesome, (suite) and it was amazingly quiet for being steps from Times Square. 
18450 Staing at the Mandarin Oriental New York was a wonderful experience. I was just there for one night but I know that I will return in the future. Their staff was quite helpful and sincere. I'm already looking forward to my next trip. 
18451 This is a great hotel for NY. It's centrally located and it close to the subway. The rooms are decent (small but clean). They don't give you shampoos and lotions. But it's a good value. Don't pay for WiFi. Just go next door to the coffee shop. 
18452 What a great experience. this hotel pampers to all your needs. Awesome decor, right in Times Square. the staff is amazingly helpful. Wiil be going back soon! 
18453 great location, clean, nice room and very nice. The stuff were very kind. You'll find a dinner outside if you want to eat breakfast close. I was supposed to sleep there one night and decided to stay another night 
18454 Nice hotel well situated and good staff. Overall not bad. Serafina, the hotel's restaurant was sketchy. Attitude of the staff for breakfast was less than I expected. They were basically rude. The rooms themselves were much smaller than advertised but they were clean. 
18455 Waited in line to check in over one hour, most of that time only one clerk available. So far, customer service is dismal, room is old, aiur conditioner doesn't work effectively ... I've been here less than an hour and I already know I will never stay hjere again. 
18456 Stayed at Dream for a weekend. Loved the service, eye for detail and location. Staff was extremely helpful. Lunch at Serafina, facial at spa, drinks at Ava lounge. Stellar weekend. Room was comfy, clean and the bed was a cloud. Highly recommend staying there and will go back. 
18457 Was greeted by some of the happiest people I have ever seen. Many restuarants around the hotel so not that hard to get dinner. The rooms was small but comfortable and very clean. 
18458 Well located, clean and recently renovated rooms. Normal NYC street noise. Room was large and comfortble, with a separate seating area and large desk. large and modern bathroom. 
18459 PLUS: location, shuttle, staff very helpful, within walking distance to many attractions, trolley stop at corner, pool, outdoor deck MINUS: rooms were small (but we new that before going), restaurant very pricey, poor lighting in room (my kids got sick of me complaining about this). 
18460 7 day stay. Got an upgrade at checkin, large clean room, good view, friendly staff. Great location, steps from subway. Close to shows, Bryant Park, restaurants. Will stay here again. 
18461 Metropolitan Lexinton. Fantastic. Good location. Great Hotel. Ask for a king (bigger room). Loved it. Breakfast is great worth every penny. Ask for very hot water for your tea. Loved it, loved it, loved it. 
18462 The room had mold, contacted the GM and they did nothing, so I took photos, see below, don't stay at any cost. 
18463 Great location. The rooms are small and the hotel itself is stylishly decorated. There are some cleanliness and room maintenance issues that need to be addressed. Overall I was satisfied and would stay here again. 
18464 I usually stay here when I visit Chicago great rooms and a great view I usually stay in room 974 or 1274 great service and every room has a flat screen in it !!! 
18465 I stayedd here with a friend and the staff was very RUDE! They overcharged us and when we tried to recover our money, it took us months to solve it. I do not recommend this hotel at all. 
18466 Great stay, staff super friendly. Great location, close to everything. Would definitely stay there again! Room clean, bed super comfortable. Let us check in early. Comfortable ballrooms for meeting purposes 
18467 Our room was clean but very small. WE were not prepared to pay so much for our night stay there before the Road Scholar Program began. We did have very good service. 
18468 Not the type of place I would normally stay in as I find Boutique hotels more personal. That said I found this a very nice place to stay in, good rooms, interesting location, excellent views.. All in all worth a visit. 
18469 Service was impeccable. Everyone was really helpful, friendly AND happy, which always makes or breaks the service experience. Great rooms, funky, modern and great location! In a midst all the happenings, you can really feel the energy from the meatpacking district. Easily best hotel i've stayed in... an all rounder! 
18470 This was the smallest hotel room I've ever seen in the U.S. Stayed there on business last fall and wasn't really impressed for the price. The only upside was the in-room snacks - Dean & Deluca. 
18471 The hotel is great! Clean rooms, in the middle ofmanhattan. You can walk to all the highlights. The people in the hotel are really nice, special thanks to elizabeth Cacovic. She makes our stay completed 
18472 Best hotel I've found in NYC! Great people, great value, great location. When we come back, this is where we'll stay. 
18473 Hampton inn times square south was great value for money. The staff were helpful and friendly and the rooms were always spotless. The free breakfast, whilst quite simple, was convenient. I would stay there again. 
18474 Nulla a che ridire,moderno,nuovo e accuratamente pulito;ottima posizione,meravigliosa la praticita' e tecnologia nelle stanze,buonissima la colazione servita su terrazzo con musica e reso accogliente in qualsiasi ora della giornata...nn ho trovato davvero difetti,ci tornerei sicuramente! 
18475 The hotel is very well localized, close Central Park and Broadway. The unique problem was a noise inside the room during night. Until now I don't now where that sound was coming, maybe from heater system. It was almost impossible to sleep well. 
18476 We stayed 3 nights, the room was comfortable, the location was superb, the staff was helpful... I would recommend this hotel to everyone!! 
18477 Stayed here for a day and was on the club floor. Room was really hot; just did not seem clean to me at all. Staff was nice and helpful and the hotel is close to the airport and the shuttle was great. Hotel just needs a desperate redo. 
18478 I didn't expect great food at an airport hotel but the crabcakes were wonderful, It was an unexpected surprise and better than crabcakes that I've had at great seafood restaurants. The great dinner made my overnight stay a treat in a busy travel week. 
18479 While the rooms are very small, I love staying at this hotel. It is very clean, good buffet breakfast is included, nice workout area and great location - all at a very affordable price. I visit NY at least once a year and usually always stay here. 
18480 The room was amazing! Great bed, great bathroom and nicely stocked mini bar. One weird quirk I noticed is no free WiFi. 
18481 Enjoyed our stay at the Benjamin but it was missing the little perks it once had like evening turn down and soft music playing in our room on arrival. 
18482 Nice and clean room. Design everywhere. Everywhere nice music. Location is good and i found hotel very quiet. Bed is very small such as room but after all this is ny. Nice neighbourhoud with nice restaurants! Staff was efficient and correct. 
18483 Greta hotel, great value, great location. nice staff. jessie was really nice 
18484 I always stay at the pod, it is clean, staff is lovely and it is a very good value for money if you consider the hotels in New York City. 
18485 this is perfectly located and well price noting to complain. If I go back to NYC I would stay dthere again. it<s a little bit rustic but for the price you are not even a block away from Macy<s and the empire state building. 
18486 I booked the Belvedere based on information I found online. The staff at this hotel not only exceeded my expectations they went above and beyond! Next time I visit the city, the Belvedere will be my first choice. 
18487 Wonderful location but resting on past glories. Garden Terrace closed. Bars cordoned off for private parties. 20% of gym equipment not working. Outside noisy sewage pump truck. Food pretentious. Smoke alarm in room not serviced properly. Room decorations grubby. What a shame. 
18488 Stayed at this hip hotel on my recent visit to nyc recently. Very good location. Nicely designed, clean, friendly staff. Eventhough my room was kind of small, but it`s not a big deal. It was $150/night during the time I went. I thought it was reasonable. 
18489 There was someone else's trash in the bin, the towels were filthy, there were brown stains all over the sheets, the toilet didn't flush, the 'fitness centre' was an unlit service corridor filled with bins, use of the internet is expensive, and the staff at the desk were incompetent. 
18490 I stayde there this is for the second time. The hotel have a great service and great location. I will back soon to the Park Central! 
18491 I've stayed here twice now and really don't see any reason to stay anywhere else.The Art Deco hotel is very pretty and the prices are reasonable. It's a great Mid-Town location, close to a sub-way entrance and they have a remodeled diner downstairs that is open 24 hrs. 
18492 It,s not a big hotel, but have a nice classy style, great service from front desk to house keeping, the junior suite's rooms are spacious, cleanliness is great, well located and great value. 
18493 Great location between Central Park and Times Square. Old hotel, very dated but clean room and friendly service. Our room had a king size bed and was a good size for a New York hotel. Would stay at theis hotel again. 
18494 It is an okay hotel that meets expectations on cleanliness, amenities, etc. It's selling point however is its very friendly staff particularly those at the front desk, shuttle service and the restaurant. Stayed there for 10 nights. 
18495 This hotel is in a great location. Walking distance to great shopping and wonderful restaurants. Customer Service could have been better. Check in agent wasn't a smooth and welcoming experience. Location is awesome, but not sure i would stay here again b/c of service. 
18496 on july 23 we were checking out the elevator gets stuck with 3 other guys and no kind of fan. and when i get out i was not offered any water but one guy went to the hospital for heat exhaustion. joevargas@gmail.com 
18497 Fantastic location, great value for money. Well recommended to all. Friendly staff and clean hotel. 
18498 Beware! This hotel should not be allowed on any search site! Like throwing money down a drain,because as soon as you see it you have to go find somewhere else to stay! 
18499 beautiful hotel in a quiet place in nyc. still, excellent location. great staff, especially the guys at the door. rooms are big and clean. equiped with a kitchen and a fridge with an ice machine, so you dont need to spend a fortune on water 
18500 I stayed here in February this year. The location is great I have to say. On the downside the windows were very thin and the road noise outside was obvious. The hotel was very clean and I could stay there again although I will probably look elsewhere. 
18501 We met friends from New Zealand for a day in Chicago. Smooth check-in. Wonderful, knowledgeable, friendly concierge. David, the friendly bartender. Rooms were all recently updated and very comfortable. 
18502 Booked this hotel on a recommendation from a friend, and could not of been happier. Location was good, staff friendly and accommodation was perfect for my needs....if I'm in NYC again will be staying again. 
18503 My husband took me to Eventi Hotel to celebrate my birthday. The hotel and staff were awesome. The hotel is in a great location. They made us feel welcomed, especially Stephanie (concierge). Thank you Eventi for a great birthday. Maria 
18504 Hotel is right across street from Macy's! Walking distance to many attractions. Hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. Rooms were clean and good size for NY. Plan to make this my NYC hotel for the next visit. 
18505 We stayed 2 x 1 week stints in Manhattan. Chose Sheraton Tribeca mainly on price and recommendation from my brother. The hotel is standard modern design and nothing flash. Clean, good value and convenient to subway. Free wifi in lobby. 
18506 the location is amazing. if you pay cash you receive a discount. the rooms are fine for the price you pay. Nothing else in the city esp considering location will be this cheap that is clean and decent. Front desk staff are either really nice or rude. 
18507 great stay, helpful and friendly desk, clean and bright room. will be back 
18508 Fantastic location, friendly and helpful staff and great value for money. I would definately use this hotel again. 
18509 Room was good value for money. Hotel in a very convenient location. Stayed there more than once. Staff was very friendly on arrival. 
18510 Very much enjoyed this hotel. Extremely nice and comfortable. Good location. Breakfast buffet was great as it contained healthy options in ADDITION to your usual (eggs/bacon/sausage/toast), such as yogurt, fruit, oatmeal, cereal, etc. Will definitely come back if the price is right. 
18511 Yes, great location. But there are better places nearby - The Library, Dylan and Roosevelt for example. For the price, the Bryant Park is far better. 
18512 hotel di grande charme, elegante, ma estremamente accogliente con personale qualificato e gentilissimo con tutti, sia signori in abito da sera che turisti con pantaloni corti. soggiorno indimenticabile 
18513 A really good hotel. Good location near plenty of subways and with views of times square. The room we stayed in was a good size, cleaned every day. The staff were really friendly. Overall, very good! 
18514 Stayed here for three nights in June, great location, good hotel but expensive. Rooms were a good size and in decent shape, bathrooms were quite small. The hotel is about two blocks from Radio City. 
18515 Good Location and decent value for the money. Concierge service a little below average. Make sure you do not get a room facing the street; otherwise, you will think you are in New Orleans at 3am 
18516 excellent location lovely decor in public areas. room ok. despite previos reviews read before travel we had iron and hairdryer in room. staff very friendly polish tea rooms next door fantastic. would definatley return to this hotel. 
18517 great hotel in the heart of the city, close to everything. excellent amenities (pool, jacuzzi, computer use etc) and good service. only drawback: the room decor is too 'flowery' (although beds are comfortable and bathroom well equipped). 
18518 Loved the location of this hotel - stayed in 1 room with 2 queens with a 2yo and 4yo. the Biggest toys r us ever seen across the road. Great access to broadway musicals.. I love NYC... and cant wait to get back.. 
18519 Love this hotel. Perfect location, reasonable rates, great staff...and a quite all right continental breakfast included! 
18520 Ottima posizione, vicinissima alla metro. Albergo pulito, con una buona colazione. Camera ampia. Struttura che avrebbe bisogno di essere ammodernata. Dotazioni del bagno limitate (manca bagnoschiuma). Complessivamente ci tornerei 
18521 Have stayed in hotels all over the world, but this is by far the the smallest and most uncomfortable room I have ever stayed in. It is far from being worth the cost. 
18522 Stayed for the weekend, visiting family. Clean, comfortable room, good food in restaurant. Friendly staff. No self-parking but weekend valet parking quite cheap. 
18523 ho trascorso il week end , posizione ottima ma camera decisamente al di sotto delle attese, piccola, senza frigo bar e rumorosa causa vicinanza motori aria condizionata, il nome Hilton di solito garantisce standard superiori 
18524 Good location, good service, good rooms, decent room size for NY 
18525 The staff could not have been more helpful. the room aws as the picture and the "cafe" was a great spot for grabbing a "cuppa" and to sit after a day walking 
18526 Found this hotel in room-saver coupon magazine. Very good price. Friendly staff. Room was in great condition. The bathroom is very spacious. They have basic cable which was okay. What I liked about it the most it was that it had a gated parking lot. 
18527 Friendly staff, clean building and rooms. Beds are very comfortable and rooms are spacious for a standard room in NYC. I'd definitely stay here again or at another Club Quarters location. Great view of WTC. 
18528 this was recommended but oh boy what a disaster its shabby uncared for and very unfriendly and unhelpful staff never again it was our first night in NY and the experience of staying there could quite easily have spoilt our whole holiday..... thank god for the waldorf 
18529 Een chique zeer aangenaam hotel, met uiterst vriendelijk personeel. Kamers zijn netjes en goed geoutilleerd. Voordeel van dit hotel is dat er een bar is en een zeer goed restaurant waar je uitstekend kunt ontbijten als wel dineren. Een aanrader. 
18530 Good midtown location. A little pricey at an average of $270USD per night. Rooms were a little tight - okay for a single traveller but a bit much for 2. No restaurant onsite. Complimentary internet access. Bathroom was decent size. Other than a bit small, room was clean and neat. 
18531 great hotel! great rooms! great location. need i say more? this is a very friendly place. lovely rooms and cental location 
18532 I love this hotel. The location is great and it looked beautiful with all the Christmas decorations. The concierge was really good, in fact all the staff are really helpful. The rooms are a spacious and the beds are soooo comfortable.....we slept like logs. Wouldn't stay anywhere else now. 
18533 Might be ok if it was updated and if the bathroom didn't get puddles after every shower due to poor design of shower and a shower curtain that is too short. 
18534 Business trip to NYC. Hotel was very nice and in a great location. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
18535 Beautiful hotel and accomodating staff. Great recommendations on restaurants. Called for a bellman for our luggage and barely hung up the phone and he was there. 
18536 Would stay again in a heart beat! Was as good as the other reviews said. Staff were so helpful. Loved New York and The Hilton Garden Inn! 
18537 We had an excellent stay: the staff was very polite and accommodating, the hotel is in a great location and has a pool, our room was surprisingly large for ny ! 
18538 Excellent location, spacious rooms, very clean, friendly staff. Poor internet quality, dirty windows need to be cleaned on the exterior. The rooms are very big with an excellent and useful kitchenette, the beds are extremely comfortable and the pillows too. 
18539 We stayed 3 nights at The Peninsula. The staff from concierge to reception to waiters do their utmost to provide excellent service. The rooms are lovely. Only drawback is the price. 
18540 We stayed here with our 3 young children and found the hotel to be both welcoming and comfortable. Really big rooms and very comfortable beds. 
18541 I only stayed for one night, but this hotel is very nice, it has great location. Its sort of a funky hipp hotel, the lobby is very nice but dark! The room is kind of small, but the bed was amazing! Would deffinetly stay here again, no question. 
18542 Cet hotel est un peu decale personel charmant tres bien place petit dej cher mais tres correct. Le meilleur burger de new york est dans le lobby. Chambre malheureusement un peu veilles.la piscine au dernier etage tres agreable ainsi que la bar bien que petit. 
18543 This is an average hotel,but a great value. The room was average and rather small,but, this NYC. It is an excellent location and can easily walk to the attractions. The staff was friendly and I will return if I am in the area again. 
18544 There service was great! I thought the front desk people were very friendly. I like how close the location was close to Macy. 
18545 excellent location, friendly staff, but do yourself a large favor and skip eating at the hotel. food was unclean on three occasions (the 3 times we utilized room service). 
18546 Fantastic rooms, amenities, location and service. Enough said. Didn't try the restaurant but hope to do so next time. 
18547 we stayed here on August 2nd. Large line for check in, completely impersonal staff. Charge for holding bags if you arrive before check in time. Much better hotels nearby. 
18548 The hotel was very nice and in a great location. Free coffee and tea in the morning was nice. My only criticism is that the fitness room was a joke. The TV didn't work and there were no weights and they could update the cardio equipment. 
18549 Great location, great staff, and good breakfast. Would highly recommend. Rooms are small, but very clean. 
18550 I stayed at the Benjamin for a night in January for business. Picked up a room for $125 via Priceline and was upgraded to a suite. Clean, comfortable and quiet. Great location - on a subway stop, near good restaurants, java, etc. I highly recommend this hotel. 
18551 Loved the trip, enjoyed the hotel 
18552 Check in very friendly. Housekeeping staff awsome. Will be back to see Toronto blue Jays play the yankees. Plenty of restaruants to choose from. Would recommend to family traveling. 
18553 Property claims to cater to business travellers but has no in-room safe...??? Staff also seem to be clueless regarding basic aspects of the property and surrounding area. 
18554 Nice hotel in Greek town. Not much to do in the neighborhood but eat. Plenty of good Greek restaurants. Rooms clean and comfortable. 
18555 The hotel is nice but nothing fancy. Location is fantastic for shopping, dining and all the best of Chicago. Be sure to check out the Shanghai Terrace rooftop restaurant across the street (at the Penninsula) 
18556 We were there in July on business. Room was well appointed being on the club level. While non-smoking I did notice a faint smell obviously from the previous visitor. Great location on the river and a very good breakfast served each day in the restaurant. I would stay there again. 
18557 el servicio, la atencion , las habitaciones parar en las towers del new york palace, superaron mis espectativas ademas el acceso al club tower es excelente ya que contas con atencion de bebidas y apetizer desde las 6 hasta las 21 
18558 My wife and I stayed here while in New York to see 'Best Man' at the Schoenfeld theatre. The location, service and value were great! We were able to walk to a good restaurant and then to the Schoenfeld. I would certainly stay here in the future. 
18559 Good stay with clean rooms that get the job done... Fast check in... Fast elevators... Good fitness center. Good value for the price. Also a very good location. I reccomend this hotel to anyone traveling on a budget it will be fine. 
18560 Our first stay in New York. Great hotel with perfect location, close to Times Square and Broadway. Superb service from every single member of the staff - customer in focus! Room size perfect. We highly recommend this hotel when staying in NY. 
18561 Fantastic location, walk to Broadway, Times Square, Central Park, and subway. Very clean, very comfortable beds (and Pillows!). Staff helpful and cheerful. Reasonable prices for this part of Manhattan. Room size also generous for this part of town. And the 24/7 available coffee is wonderful. 
18562 Most convenient hotel in NY value and proximity wise. Away from the Times Square loud crowd, yet close to there, also walking distance to Rockafeller! Went with kids since they were in elementary, now high schoolers! 
18563 The hotel is really beautiful and it's in a great location on Madison and 38th. It doesn't feel like a hotel at all.....it has a homey atmosphere with 5 star service. 
18564 Warm & intimate. Very soothing for a perfect mid-town location. 
18565 Very nice hotel. Its not the newest but clean, comfortable and very well priced. The noise from the airport is minimal. The bed was comfortable and I like that there are no unwashed comforters. Can't ask for much more. We will stay here again. Breakfast was good too. 
18566 Just a 1 Night stay. Comfortable nights rest. Would stay again. 
18567 Spent 2/19-2/22 here and it was the best overall value I ever exp. for NYC. As usual for NYC small rooms but u only sleep there. Highly reccom. 
18568 This hotel is clean, in a great location (not right on top of Times Square), fab free breakfast and the rooms are a good size with a fully fitted kitchen. Would definitely stay here again if in New York. 
18569 We stayed here before visiting the Downtown Aquarium on our way to NASA/Galveston. I was an average hotel for an average price. Not much to say. It served its purpose for this tired family. 
18570 3 stars hotel,old (obvious from the air conditioners),expensive for 3 stars(executive room for around 330 $ and was a non refundable!),,location is amazing honestly,,the street outside the hotel is smelly ,,hotel is like 5 minutes walk from broadway,M&M store & hershy's store,,1o minutes walk from time square 
18571 Stayed for just one night during visit to JSC and USRA. Good location for that. Feels small scale and familiar. A bit hard to see it from the Bay Area Blvd. Complimentary WIFI nice. 
18572 Extremely nice and very well located. Extremely nice and very well located. The lobby always smelled like a garden and the staff is some of friendliest ever met! Bathrooms a little small but incredibly clean. 
18573 This hotel is great! Large rooms, nice staff, excellent beds, close to the subway and all that for a good price. Another plus is the attached restaurant. We would definately come back here mext time. 
18574 Excellent hotel, great room, convenient to subway. Will definitely stay again. 
18575 A quiet clean hotel with a friendly staff. 
18576 Great Hotel, great area. Blocks from southern central park, walking distance to 30 Rock. Always stay there when I go to NY. Thouhg rooms on small size, hense NY. Great clean rooms, confortable beds. Quite hotel. 
18577 We had a very comfortable suite at good rate for 5 adults. Convenient location for shops/transport etc. Staff very friendly. Rooms very clean and a great views from the 30th. Some minor wear and tear in room but nothing significant. 
18578 Noisy!!! I was charged in US$37 for a 1min international phone call. It was the highest charge i received for a phone call in life!!! I made a claim about it by e-mail to manager but got no answer. Travellers, beware!!! 
18579 First time at the edison hotel, very clean, staff very helpful, but most of all is the location we are both in our 60s we walked to Empire State Building,Rockefeller Center,Central Park,and Times Squar is the end of the street. 
18580 anytime we are in ny. Sooooooo nice, great rooms and seldom i get even a terrace! Nice staff, esp nr mooney and the guys at the reception. Food is good -not so easy in ny- and breakfast is amazing at murals 54. Location? Perfect. I will always go there. 
18581 Found this hotel by accident - one block away from Grand Central Terminal. Location is great, room was great and the service was outstanding by every staff member I encountered. Rates are reasonable for New York and this hotel is a great value. 
18582 We stayed at this Marriott for one night before leaving on a cruise out of Brooklyn. The location was perfect for getting anywhere in Manhattan. The room was clean and had all the usual amenities. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. We will definitely stay here again. 
18583 Very friendly staff. They are by far the most helpful of any hotel stay I've had. Room was clean and comfortable. Wine and cheese bar was great. They even had hot coffee ready for us during the nor' easter we had a few days ago. 
18584 Room was small as typical in NY, but clean & nice. Flat screen television & CD player in room. Staff left a little something to be desired, and the elevators were somewhat slow. But for the price, in midtown is was great!! I would stay here again anytime. 
18585 I was there for a wedding- the hotel is expensive, but definitely meets and exceeds expectations. Lovely experience. Staff was friendly and quickly repaired a mis charge with no hassle. Great accessible shopping and a variety of great restaurants in the neighborhood! 
18586 Een fijn eenvoudig hotel op een uitstekende locatie, alle soorten van openbaar vervoer voor de deur, maar ook heel veel winkels en intresanten bezienswaardigheden op loopafstand. Het hotel heeft fijne bediening je word goed geholpen als je iets niet weet. 
18587 Looking for a nice ubication, you got it in a great clean and confortable hotel. 
18588 Beautifull hotel, extremely helpfull staff. However if you are sharing a room, and do not feel comfortable about the idea of doing your "toilet business" in a bathroom without door, I would not recommend this hotel. The bathrooms are adjacent to the room open plan (no door no wall). 
18589 going to the website and looking around my expectation was something out of the ordinary and in fact found the place to be quite ordinary clean, modern, good value, competent staff.....no real complaints just nothing special 
18590 So ugly, unclean, plenty of noise. Never seen a room so ugly like that in my life. Garbage in the court and inside a trap for rats. Check-out immediately after one night there. Pay attention to the electricals broken! 
18591 Your concierge Kaitlyn Lawlor was absolutly magnificent! She was the most helpful person that I have met in my 13 years of traveling to NeoCon. 
18592 Ci sono stato in aprile 2011 per una settimana in viaggio turistico, camere piccole ma comode e pulite, zero rumore di notte.Personale gentile (la chiave elettronica non funzionava ma subito si sono prodigati per sostituirla) e soprattutto....a due passi da TIMES SQUARE!quindi in posizione ottima! lo consiglio a tutti!quindi...buon viaggio! 
18593 from the people to the room to the food and location was excellent. I would recommend to anyone visiting the big apple. 
18594 hotel tres agreable, j aime y revenir, emplacement ideal up town 
18595 Extremely friendly and attentive staff. Always well cleaned rooms. I travel a lot so am picky about where I stay and this is my hotel of choice in the price range in NYC. 
18596 I have just come back from New York I stayed in Hampton inn time square its only 3 star but the service in a 5 star its clean tidy and the staff are so helpful and breakfast was great too 
18597 The staff at this location does an excellent job. They are efficient, friendly and helpful. The management takes great care in keeping the grounds clean & attractive, as well as keeping everything in good repair. 
18598 From check-in to the valet and the concierge...everyone at this hotel was helpful and extremely nice. We had a great time and loved the location. Definitely recommend it. Make sure you grab a cocktail in the Whiskey Sky bar...great view of Navy Pier! 
18599 Excellent location, great service,forever views! I went there for a business meeting and will definitely come back for a weekend trip. 
18600 Aurelia greeted us warmly and was very responsive to our requests for information and assistance. The room was quiet, clean and the bed was comfortable. Freeway access was easy and there are many chain restaurants nearby. 
18601 very nice and comfortable Hotel with access to any part of New York within minutes. Affordable price and Clean rooms. Will recommend it to any traveler or family with Kids. Will sure stay again in April 2013. 
18602 The Alden hotel was a excellent place to stay at for our girls night out. The service was awesome and every one was professional and nice. I will definatly stay there again and I would recommend my friends and family! 
18603 We have tried all the top hotels on our regular visits but this is the best for our regular mad shopping trips, convenient for everything (even taxi's in the rain) and if there has ever been any problem it has been solved immediately. bert.demarco@gmail.com 
18604 Check in quick, lobby was pleasant. Exterior could use some attention, otherwise clean. Pool was nice, breakfast was standard - waffles, cereal, the usuals. Staff was very nice. For the price, would definitely stay again. 
18605 We stayed in this hotel on our visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised at the cleanliness of the rooms. Rooms were all updated with great views of the city from the upper floors. There is a pool on the roof level also. Overall a friendly staff and perfect location! 
18606 Hot water not working - given a lame excuse day 1 , now as we get ready to go to a conference- day 2 no hot water. Toilets do not flush appropriately. All I can say I hope we can get moved to another hotel. THIS IS ABSURD 
18607 Loved this place - stayed here for four days for work. The rooms ARE SMALL, but people! this is manhattan, so understandable. i loved the place and the vibe - and esp the apples in the foyer!!! will definitely return! 
18608 We really enjoyed our stay at the Marquis. The rooms were great and beds were very comfortable. The location right now Times Square was amazing! 
18609 We stayed here for 3 nights,prior to a 6 day coach tour and found the hotel was in a good location for midtown Manhattan.The Breakfast Buffet was good value and quality and the staff very friendly and efficient.We would definately use this hotel again. 
18610 Not knowing NY , we took a gamble on this hotel, very pleased 
18611 Will go back next trip to NY. My only complaint is no coffee in the rooms. Everything else was first class. Hope to go back in December. Can't wait. 
18612 This hotel was very convenient to see sites of mid-town Manhattan. Good size room, good service and competitive rates. 
18613 Excellent location, but rooms and service was not up to expected level used for IC. No special treatment for ambassador members. Nice pool, but fitness room only on charge, as well as wifi. Rooms in old part need urgent update. 
18614 Faultless. Nice staff, location to envy all others, and excellent room as you would expect from a Hilton. I seriously hope the HGI Times Square don't let the many positive reviews affect future stays but I doubt it. Keep up the good work! 
18615 a great hotel, extremely comfortable bed, on a quiet street, with great service form the staff, clean, and great location. I cant say more, fantastic! 
18616 This hotel was more than what I expected. Great location , good service, clean rooms and the price was not too bad. The only thing is that the rooms are small but that is expected of any hotel in NYC...Would stay here again...Texas 
18617 Stay 2 nights in Queen Executive Suite and I simply love it. The special pillows delivery was late the first evening and the manager fixed something very appreciated the next day. I can't wait to go back ! 
18618 I give it two thumbs up. Beautiful Place. Beautiful Rooms. Staying there every time from now on. It's not some little dinky place. Someone actually put a lot of thought into designing and decorating. 
18619 Stayed here for a mini stay-cation. It is pretty expensive, but you get what you pay for. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room was very clean, quiet, and modern. The duvet covers are very heavy, but they will bring you normal, lighter blankets to sleep with upon request. 
18620 Easy walk to Times Square. Great location for Broadway shows. Subway entrances nearby to get you where you need to go. Service was good. Wallpaper peeling on the walls and cosmetic issues were the only problems. 
18621 Really large, comfortable room. Nice beds, fridge, micro,coffee maker. Clean pool and Hot Tub. Excellent toiletries 
18622 Business chair and desk are top notch. 
18623 Very good location, very good service. Everything clean and serviceable, but the rooms are very standard. Nothing to complain about, but not outstanding. 
18624 Sito nel cuore di N/Y buon rapporto qualita' prezzo.La mia valutazione scende a scarso perche' sono "solo " due mesi che attendo la restituzione della cauzione del 10% nonostante abbia inviato 3 e-mail per le quali non ho avuto alcuna risposta. Purtroppo se dovessero insistere con tale atteggiamento perderanno clienti 
18625 Il n a pas pas de toilettes a la reception de l hotel pour les enregistrements tres matinaux. Les chambres trop etroites, sans charme pour un hotel quote 3 etoiles! L emplacement est le seul point attrayant de cette adresse. 
18626 The Hotel is very clean and very comfortable. Comprable to other Hilton Inn brands. Pros: It's walking distance from the Galleria Mall so if you are going shopping this is a great value. It's two blocks from Loop 610 and about four from Hwy I-59. Great Location. 
18627 Derron has an excellent attitude and is helpful and always shares a smile plus helps with luggage and taxi's. The W on 50th and Lexington is a great experience! ask for Derron! 
18628 Stayed here for a couple of nights for a business conference. Sure, the rooms are small, but how much room do you need? This is an older hotel that has been nicely renovated. The price is reasonable and the location is close to restaurants and everything else in NYC. 
18629 This was our first trip to the Big Apple. We found that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean. Our thermostat had a malfunction and the maintiance person was there within 5 minutes to repair. The breakfast was very tastey with many choices. 
18630 This hotel was very clean, the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. It is a quaint hotel with a soothing astmosphere. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will stay there in future trips to NYC. The location of the hotel is great also. 
18631 Non troppo costoso per Manhattan e davvero ben posizionato ma la nostra camera era piccola, rumorosa, sporca e maleodorante (il bagno puzzava tremendamente di umido)! Letto comodo, personale cordiale, pessimo affaccio, alcuni piccoli oggetti personali sono scomparsi dalla camera... Buona la colazione al ristorante accanto (convenzionato). Hotel da evitare. 
18632 Spent five nights at this hotel, nice location near river, very easy to get about. Only about a 10 minute walk to Michigan Ave and shopping, many places for dining right in the neighborhood. Bar in hotel was pretty expensive, big city prices. 
18633 My family and I arrived very late (3am). Our room was terrific. Recommendation: Try to get an upper room on southeast side to get views of Empire State Building and Bryant Park. 
18634 considering the high prices in new york, this is excellent for value for money. great location, nice an clean rooms, helpful staff and free internet. only the restaurant would need some change. reccomandable 100% 
18635 did book this hotel as the offer with 87$ excl.tax was one of the cheapest fares for good located hotels. Room was nice, had some charm. Unfortunalty Internet ist expensive. But just 1 block away is a coffee with free wifi, so paying is not worth.... 
18636 My family stayed at the Affinia 50 in June. The Affinia is a clean, well-managed hotel in a great location. The staff is very friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious and nicely decorated. This hotel is well-priced for its location and accommodations. We will definitely stay here again! 
18637 I had read most of the previous reviews for the Casablanca Hotel and agree with the #1 rating. Besides being conveniently located, the staff is exceptionally attentive (special kudos to Peter Pryor), the rooms are clean and quiet, and the refreshments available in the lounge were both plentiful and delicious. 
18638 Found this hotel at a third less than other hotels in Manhattan so my expectations were low. But the place is very nice and right in Times Square. Good thing too, because I got stuck here during the hurricane. 
18639 Great Hotel Grreal location, good value- Go there! 
18640 This was my 2nd time at this hotel and it was as good as I remembered. Excellent location, and my request on booking for a view of Time Square was met. A good hotel for the price in New York with easy access to shops, and theatres. 
18641 Its Time Square location is very convenience for city walking around time square and nearby area. The subway entrances also are very closed by. Safe and sound area even aafter midnight. Services are just fine not really could say as they always be busy with guests. 
18642 I would like to give a personal Thank You to Robert The Bellman. I've been staying at this hotel yearly for the past four years and he has always been very helpful and takes a personal interests in making sure my visit to NYC is enjoyable and successful. Gracias Robert!!! 
18643 Nice hotel, close to park and easy walk to shopping. Stayed with family and suite with pull out couch perfect. Parking expensive but included with Expedia rate. Excellent service. Even provided a mini fridge for milk exc. 
18644 Older hotel which is centrally located. Close to subway stop and walking distance to many sights. Bargain price for New York City. Friendly and helpful staff. Old-fashioned elevator added to ambiance of hotel. Would definitely stay here again. Best kept secret in NYC. 
18645 stayed 5 nights in feb staff were very helpful and upgraded us when i told them it was my wifes 50th room was spotless and cleand evey day plenty of delis around to eat in or carry out and good location for site seeing already planing next trip 
18646 A very good value. The rooms are small and too warm, and the beds are not especially comfortable, but given the price of the room and the location of the hotel, it's a good choice for midtown. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
18647 It is well worth the additional expense to have access to the executive club room and the lovely Tower rooms. The service was impeccable, friendly but not intrusive. The fitness area was never over-crowded. We will be back. 
18648 6 Columbus is located right in Midtown Manhattan with easy access to restaurants, subway and a mall just accross the street. The staff and service was excellent from arrival to departure. I definitely recommend booking this hotel for your next trip to NYC. 
18649 Great location, friendly staff, beautiful room....This is a great hotel to stay at to avoid the crowds of some of the Midtown West hotels. Would definitely stay there again. The staff gave a great recommendation for breakfast during our check-out---the Palladium diner on 53rd and Madison. 
18650 The hotel was fine, but it was incredibly noisy. There was a party going on until late and the sound traveled up to the eighth floor via the courtyard. Based on the noise I would not recommend the hotel although the accomodations were good and the staff was very courteous. 
18651 when we want to back to hotel, all of us say lets go home and relax.metro very close.Taxi in new york very cheap and easy to find. whenever we come new york again we will definitely stay THE MARMARA MANHATTAN. 
18652 We had a wonderful 6 night stay at the Lucerne in January. The Upper West Side location was great (close to subway, Central Park, museums) and it was good to be away from the hyper activity of midtown. Hotel is nothing flashy but clean, comfortable and extremely quiet. Highly recommended. 
18653 Have stayed here multiple times when in Chicago for business, usually very good option and close to a variety of good eateries within walking distance. Usually quiet, but sirens can awaken you in the middle of the night, clean hotel, good, attentive staff. 
18654 Ottimo hotel, in posizione strategica a quindici minuti a piedi da Time Square e annesso a Grand Central Station( metro e treni) 
18655 Camere grandi e confortevoli con ottima insonorizzazione. Unica pecca : aria condizionata troppo alta nelle zone comuni. comunque giudizio positivo 
18656 Very good location. The hotel is old. Ideal for vacations with friends. 
18657 Pre Sandy stay for one night excellent! Stayed there due to great reviews and they surpassed expectations. Would recommend and stay in future for sure. Great location, not too busy. Staff very helpful. 
18658 Hands down the friendliest hotel staff I've ever encountered. The room was modern and spotless. The bed was very comfortable. I would most definately stay here again. 
18659 Hotel eccezzionale, grande, bello, pulito, ben collegato, unico neo....aria condizionata al massimo!!!! 
18660 Hotel Blake is my favorite hotel! Best stay I ever had! Great service! I will definitely check out Custom House Restaurant (inside the Blake) when I come back to Chicago. I heard they won several awards and are one of the top restaurants in the city. Enjoy! 
18661 Great hotel, modern clean and helpfull personal. near timesquare and two blocks away from the subway. Relax atmosphere. The room is fully equipped. 
18662 excellent staff, perfect location, quite, large room has everything you need.. 
18663 We enjoyed our time at The Warwick, (again, its our 3rd time). It is clean, well priced, very well located, and has a really helpful staff. We will be back again and again! 
18664 Le stanze degli hotel anglosassoni sono tutte piccole, questo fa eccezione, una camera di dimensioni normali, curatissima nei dettagli e fornitissima di tutto. sempre in ordine, rifatta anche 2 volte nello stesso giorno, e non capita spesso. staff cortese e efficiente, grande soggiorno 
18665 The hotel was excellent. Our bedroom was big and the bed fantastic! It was everything good. The only negative thing was a rude recepcionist. 
18666 I stayed only 1 night but I feel very comfortable with my kids. The room very nice, clean, good service, quite. I'd like to go there again for next time. 
18667 Loved the location in midtown NYC. Handy to subway. Very affordable (by NYC standards) and clean. Our room had a private bathroom but I understand most do not, so that is a consideration. The rooms are TINY and the beds a little uncomfortable - bring your own pillow maybe? 
18668 Can't hide the small rooms, but they are perfectly formed. What do people really expect of a budget hotel in the middle of Manhattan?! Rooms funky, clean, comfortable and great value for money. Don't forget to check out the roof terrace at dusk. Will return next time in New York. 
18669 I waited 1 hour to check in! There was a large restaurant convention in town, and the hotel front desk was clearly understaffed. I counted 22 people waiting in line ahead of me. The free cookie couldn't take the sour taste out of my mouth. 
18670 Third time in New York - best time so far. Besides the chilling weather we had a wonderful stay. The Plaza Athenee is a beautiful boutique hotel - I can highly recommend it. Our room was spacious and niely furnished - service is perfect from start to finish. 
18671 Hotel Warwick excelente. Recepcao experiente, rapida. Fiquei hospedado na suite que leva o nome do hotel (muito amplo), confortavel. O sofa e' um pouco duro para durmir nele. Servico de quarto e limpeza otimo. Recomendo. 
18672 Amseterdam court is not worth the money. Location was good, but room was not clean, bathroom was not clean and beds were harder than a futon. Pictures are very deceiving. 
18673 Holiday Inn 57th Street provides spacious + clean rooms with good views (choose North Tower rooms). Rates are ok for this location, though staff could have been more helpful sometimes. Only three blocks from Lincoln center. Would go there again. 
18674 I have had the pleasure of staying at this hotel several times. Entire staff is top notch! No problem with noise. Area is as safe as anywhere in Medical Center or Houston CBD! 
18675 I really liked this hotel. The entrance and reception is beautiful. Rooms are comfortable. Good location with excellent choice of restaurants in the surrounding area. 
18676 Good sized clean room. Somewhat tired equipment. Great breakfast. Good location. Friendly staff. Handy Supermarket next door. DIY Laundry. Very efficient Chambermaids. Shame about the quality of American TV, but you can't have everything !! Slamming doors and wooden floors a bit of a distraction. 
18677 My husband recently had surgery in New York, we needed a hotel suite with a kitchenette, he also needed a recliner chair. The Plaza Athenee had the chair delivered for our arrival - they delivered lots of ice for his painful shoulder. Nothing was too much trouble - great staff. 
18678 Good mid-town location and spacious rooms make this place good value by Manhattan standards. Only con was the noise coming up from 49th street below our apartment in the small hours - if you want quiet at night, ask for rooms away from the street. 
18679 This hotel is the perfect location if you are going to the theater. Our room was very nice. Not large, but big enough for two people. The lobby is so pretty and the front desk staff was friendly. 
18680 Great service. Especially our baggage handler Jose C! He was very helpful and understanding when we had questions about the hotel and its amenities. He really put forth more effort than what we expected. Thank you so much. 
18681 Nice hotel. Rooms are very spacious, clean and get a visit from the maid everyday (not all hotels do this). The price was right. The location could be better meaning there's not much in the way of grocery store or convience store in walking distance. 
18682 Great hotel Staff was friendly. Room was very clean and the hotel is located with easy access to subway and central park. I would stay there again and recommend to friends. 
18683 We stayed here as recommended by my daughter. Short walk from Penn station. Very clean and comfortable room. Very helpful staff. Great location for Empire State Building, Times Square and the Theatre District. (Used by a lot of airline staff, so got to be pretty good). 
18684 The Marriott Marquis is the nicest hotel in NYC. Beautiful room, beautiful view, and Beautiful lobby. Ask for a renovated room, so much nicer!! 
18685 The Midtown Club Quarters won't change your life, but it has adequate rooms, reasonable Manhattan prices and a great location. Food options, drinking establishments and public transportation are all a few steps away. I've stayed at this particular hotel many times and will do so again. 
18686 Nos gusto mucho el hotel, bien ubicado, las atenciones muy bien, todos muy agradables y dispuestos a ayudar... La habitacion un poco pequena pero la cama y almohadas formidables... Volveriamos nuevamente.. 
18687 Stayed here in November, lovely hotel, really nice decor in room really clean. All the staff were very friendly and helpful. Food in wheeltapper was really nice my only complaint was that the portions were too big!!!! Great place to stay in New York and really central, highly recommend 
18688 Overall a clean hotel, no real massive issues, very good location. Only issue was when we wanted to get our bags collected from our room and we waited a good half hour to even speak to the baggage folk. Overall good though. Wouldn't stay there again tho. 
18689 Don't stay here! Gross!!! Looks nice from the outside horrible inside! 
18690 Convenient location, great service, all the amenities. My first trip to New York was a pleasure staying here. Close to subway, friendly and attentive staff, consistently clean room. Bar/restaurant, diner, business center, fitness center, and coin-op laundry all on site. I would stay here again and recommend it to others. 
18691 Third stay in New-York and certainly the best hotel I have seen : very good price for NYC, not far from the metro, in a living distric and nice people. I would really recommend this place to my friends and will certainly come back ! 
18692 Great looking hotel, right near central park, trendy bar and lovely cherry wood room. However, service was slow (especially the bar), breakfast was very poor (quantity) and the room was a little noisy. Overall, I enjoyed my stay in the Hudson and being near central park was great. 
18693 we stayed there 3days.everthing is wonderful..we liked very much:) 
18694 Excellent location and friendly atmosphere. Roomservice very good. Restaurant ordinary but little used by us. Will probably contact hotel directly next time we need accommodation in New York. 
18695 Haven't been here in a while but was happy to be back. Same great service and the heavenly bed and shower, well, heavenly. Great lobby bar for a nightcap. Kudo's to the valet on the drive who offered dining suggestions, grabbed us cabs and was very cheerful and professional. 
18696 Stayed at the Westin River North. Excellent location, close to resturants, shopping and entertainment. Accross the street from the House of Blues. Also stayed in the summer time and walking distance to Millennium Park. Number one Hotel choice when staying in Chicago 
18697 I don't want to duplicate other reviews but the hotel was perfect, great location, great staff. The concierge service was best I ever had, even better than at the Burj Al Arab :) I even tipped them!! 
18698 This hotel is for those who want a great location at a reasonable price, but can overlook the general condition of the rooms. 
18699 This is a good place to stay in NYC when in NYC on business. The breakfast food is good and the hotel staff is excellent. They have a nice business center with free printing. An easy walk to Macy's. Times Square is further but still not a bad walk 
18700 Everything was clean, the lobby and the rooms were modern, and the beds were very comfortable. And the location is just perfect: while it is situated on quiet residential block, it is a very close walking distance from all the shops, restaurants, the lake, the beach, and the pier. 
18701 Check in was a bit of a challenge but other than that we had a great stay. We were in a jr. suite which was very spacious and we were able to get a 4:00 check out which was much appreciated. 
18702 After reading the positive reviews here, I was delighted to get a room here for $200 a night (including taxes and fees, via Expedia.) My experience was great; I really can't think of even the smallest thing to complain about. Spacious, clean room, nice staff, good location. 
18703 I loved staying at Country INN and Suite. Breakfast was GREAT. FRont Desk Clerk was nice and friendly. IT was a nice and quite hotel which I was expecting. A+++ thank you 
18704 The breakfast is the most amazing buffet i have ever seen it has every food you could want. A very good Hotel Location is the best you can walk into times square! 
18705 La verdad, era bastante bien. Pero tampoco nada espectacular digo. Aunque la limpieza y la ubicacion son geniales me gusta mas un hotel con caracter. 
18706 We appreciated this hotel for its convenient Midtown location, and its price which, while somewhat expensive, was reasonable for a Manhattan hotel with this level of quality. The room was clean, quiet and comfortable. 
18707 Prijs/kwaliteit is dit een zeer goed hotel. Het hotel is gelegen op nog geen 100 meter van Times Square en dicht bij 5th Avenue. Ook het zwembad dat zichtbaar is vanuit de lobby en de bar is een leuk extra. Het hotel is zeker een aanrader!! 
18708 Great hotel, good location, staff very friendly and knowledgeable. Some traffic noise on the lower floors, but overall great. Would stay again. 
18709 Hotel location was perfect for downtown shopping. Rooms were very clean and updated. Tenth floor pool and workout facilities were enjoyable. Easy parking (structure attached for $28/day). 
18710 Loved the style of the hotel and the location is just perfect. The staff, warm service and the social media team made us feel like home. 
18711 I have stayed at the Roosevelt many times. It was another pleasant stay of 3 days January 2-5, 2012. See my previous reviews of this hotel. 
18712 Excellent location. There was plenty of squaremeters in our suite with reasonable price. Staff were nice and friendly. Only minus was that room was little bit "oldish"... =) 
18713 The Congress Plaza was a great hotel for travelers who want a nice hotel in a good location, but do not need five star extras. 
18714 Walking distance of the museums. It was clean and nice. No complaints. The bathroom was tiny, and the hotel was a touch old but it did not affect the quality of my stay. Parking was expensive. We parked and walked 2 blocks and saved more than half. 
18715 Great Location.Perfectly Clean.Extremely nice and helpful staff. 
18716 I have to say that I will not stay here again because the air conditioning was too powerful and blew right on me. It was a good location and the staff was excellent and very helpful. They made the place better than three stars. 
18717 I stayed here two years ago and I am very pleased! The location on the 32nd Street is unbeatable. The room with comfortable beds and the weereless... I really enjoyed my visit here! 
18718 Dropped in for a Sunday brunch & it was great. They have an upstairs casual & downstairs more formal area both of which are great. The food was excellent. 
18719 Very well located. Good furniture, nice breakfast, great rooms. Close to charm places at NY, but not as busy as near Times Square. 
18720 Avoided absolutely this Hotel! For two days we have been without water in room. Stinking and very dirty... Don' t go in this hotel !!!!!! 
18721 We spend four nights at the Blake. The location is very convenient: near the blue train and close to the Art institute. The room was clean, pleasant and quiet. We didn't try the breakfast but it looked OK. Overall an nice stay at the hotel Blake. 
18722 Nice clean hotel, room is larger than most rooms you get in hotels for this price in or near time square, staff are very friendly and helpful, slightly dodgy neighbourhood but that cant be helped and only a couple of blocks from portauthority and subway systems 
18723 prima hotel, op loopafstand van veel bezienswaardigheden. Comfort van de kamer was minder omdat wij vanuit het raam tegen een airco unit aankeken en het geluid van deze unit zeer indringend was. De kamerprijs moet hier eigenlijk op worden afgestemd. 
18724 key point of this hotel is that is connected to the mall.. beyond that rooms are old.. I could noticed that all hallways are so outdated, roof squares are even deformed.. so property is in need of a general update. 
18725 After booking on line I called. I was impressed with Brian as he gave me information that I needed. Being the 1st time in NYC I had many questions. Everything went off just right. Thanks 
18726 Great location, amazing staff provides great service. Location is ideal. Have stayed here several times and the hotel is consistent in the fantastic service they provide. I will continue to be loyal and would recommend to anyone traveling to NYC. 
18727 Everything that we asked for was resolve. We stayed for nights in the hotel and everything was perfect. The location is perfect. I recomend this hotel and I'll be back. 
18728 Tolles Hotel mit Multimediazimmern, TV auch an der Badewanne, Hallen-Pool ganz oben 
18729 Stayed in YOTEL New York in Aug 2011. Had a nice and pleasant stay. Although quite small, the rooms are modern and well designed. Good price and friendly staff, and 5-10 mins walk to the middle of Times SQ. Great location ! Highly recommended ! 
18730 I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the hotel, and customer service. Also, the location was wonderful. Much better than I had expected for a New York City hotel. 
18731 Pre-war (WWII, not Iraq) elegance makes for a peaceful respite from the worries of the world. Hardwood floors with inlaid borders, wonderful bedding, stereo/CD/DVD/VHS with classical music, attentive staff, and friendly residents make this location a temporary home, if only for one night. 
18732 We had a very large room with 2 double beds, very comfortable. We apreciated the place of this hotel, as it is very close from central parc and quiet. (the carpet could be renovated). We would also recommend the restaurant Serafini which is very good. 
18733 I stayed here 2006 great hotel clean now it is dirty and threadbare WHAT HAPPENED. I was going to stay again in 2011. 
18734 We stay for 9 nights.The service of this hotel was always perfect. The amenities were good too. We recommend this hotel, very good zone too. Don't doubt in staying here, is really good. Enjoy! +10 
18735 Brilliant, stylish hotel with a residence feeling. Great design and rooms, Super friendly staff - my preferred hotel in the city from now on 
18736 nice hotel in great area.small rooms only drawback as we stayed 4 nights before moving on to boston and had a fair amount of luggage.great bar and several intersting people passed through while we were there 
18737 we stayed from from sept 24-27 yes there were roaches yes the girl at the front desk is always sleepy but location and room were ok we will be back! best places for indian lunch west of new deli a block away 
18738 Sicuramente strategica la posizione dell'hotel che non offre alcun servizio se non a pagamento. Neppure l'aria condizionata funzionava in modo adeguato.Sono stata in America 34giorni e tutti gli alberghi offrivano il servizio internet gratuito. 
18739 Good price for value, Very Clean and comfortable bed. 
18740 I'm almost afraid to tell too many people about this beautiful place. I don't want the prices to go too high or some of the services to go away. Let's just say you need to check it out for yourself because some of the secrets I won't share. 
18741 If you have the money to get a suite then the hotel is worth it but I was with my son and didn't want to spend alot of money. The room was OLD and was so small. The bathroom was old and no shower just a bathtub. 
18742 Paid over $1000 for 3 nights and did not get the requested bed type and was charged 15 per day per device for Internet access. The internet should definitely be complimentary. 
18743 Stayed here for a weekend in April hotel has beautiful views Comfortable beds Bathrooms a little small Cute telescope in rooms I lovedbwalking on the nearby promenade Would come back! 
18744 In this area of NYC a hotel with less ambient music and vivid as the neighbours from the Hudson. Breakfast and dinner was a bit disappointing (for Europeans?) but the rooms were fantastic. Spacious, very clean, quiet. To go back! 
18745 Great cost/benefit relation. Charming and luxury hotel, near all the major NYC attractions, you can early walk to central park, and times square (a little farther, but still). Breakfast kind of poor. 
18746 Modern and nice. Good vibes and very clean. Service is good too. Rooms might be small but as every other new/renewed hotel in NYC. 
18747 I stayed here knowing I was arriving late from DC one night and not wanting to expend too much. Clean, good service and perfectly nice rooms - the whole experience comparable to say a small Doubletree hotel. The location cannot be faulted - it is extremely central. 
18748 We were there last Christmas and enjoyed every piece of it. Yes, the rooms were small but I didn't care since the location was great. It was right next to the Empire State Building. The price very reasonable for a location like this! Would go there again. 
18749 A parte l'ottima posizione dell'hotel vicina a tanti punti di interesse e alla metro, ho notato uno scarso servizio alla clientela e ne sono rimasta molto delusa. Ho avuto bisogno di chiedere alcune informazioni alla reception e ogni volta mi sono poi dovuta arrangiare da sola per risolvere i problemi. 
18750 We loved it here! It was a brilliant location just a block away from the Empire State Building and near the subway. The staff couldn't do enough for us. The room was perfect other than it was a twin bedded room rather than a double. We'd definitely stay here again. 
18751 Great Location right around the corner from Times Square. Friendly staff, rooms were small but most are in NY. Recently renovated and very nice. 
18752 Posizione fantastica, vicino a tutto, mezzi comodissimi. Personale molto gentile e disponibile, un po deludente la colazione (poco posto a sedere, troppa gente, poca scelta). Camere molto grandi, letti spaziosi. Ci tornerei 
18753 Very convenient location for the subway downtown. Shops locally and close to Central Park, easy walk to theMet. Staff friendly and helpful. Bed comfortable. Heating system good. Our room had only one bedside table which was very inconvenient - our onlly criticism. 
18754 Staff helped with my luggage, which is often unavailable in American hotels at this price. Gym is great except they need yoga mats for floor stretching. The hotel mistakenly recorded my reservation but i showed themmy confirmation and they immediately accomodated me. 
18755 The Wellington was nothing fancy. We waited in a really long line to check in. The room was clean (bathroom was spotless), but the bed was a bit uncomfortable. The Wellington served our purposes well as it was inexpensive and in a central location. 
18756 This hotel is in a GREAT location and was the perfect choice for me and my friends for NYE in NYC. The room was beautiful, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay at the Wyndham Chelsea West again. 
18757 This hotel is very friendly. This was our first stay in New York and they were very friendly and helpful. Donald the bellman spoiled us and gave us great tips for getting around. Convenient and clean. 
18758 Rooms are spacious and clean. Bar area is a great scene. And something you don't often get in ny...the staff is friendly, courteous and really makes it a great experience. 
18759 Let me just say that I love Westins, if I could stay with them everywhere I went, I would. They are very consistent and this one doesn't disappoint. Lovely room, lovely beds, in the heart of Times Square if that is what you are into. 
18760 I was in Houston for business and stayed at this hotel. It was good value for the money and was comfortable and clean. I liked the bed and the pool was nice and warm. i would stay again. 
18761 We booked this hotel last minute through priceline, so we did not know where we were going to be staying. It was the best location you can ask for...right on michigan ave! The room was beautiful and it had a great view! 
18762 I've stayed in this hotel several yimes. If you get a renovaqted room then it'spretty nice. Otherwise you're looking at 20 yr old bathroom floors and low counters and old everything. Needs help. 
18763 The room was basic, which is what we were looking for. However, the bathroom was full of mold and mildew. Just want a clean room. 
18764 Very accommodating at check in. Rooms are comfortable. Although mattress was not great. Wonderful location Would stay here again while in NYC. Wish discount on brunch was included Very clean. Had enough towels. 
18765 I found this hotel to be perfectly well-situated, staffed with knowledgable professionals and a nice change from the gigantic Manhattan mega-hotels. My room was large by NY standards, well-maintained and the bed, was ridiculously comfortable. I'm a SPG member, so this is my new default hotel to book in NY. 
18766 We went here for a quick weekend getaway. We walked all over Manhattan. This is just a few blocks from Times Square to the south and Central Park to the north. So convenient to the subway as well. Hotel was contemporary, sleek and clean. Had a great stay. 
18767 In the heart of Times Square close to Subway, great breakfast, Starbucks on site, Junior's and other restaurants across the streets in every direction, first class service, quick check in and out, oversized comfortable rooms. Value for money 
18768 What a pleasant surprise to find a "roomy" hotel that is clean, well lit and well located in New York for the right price. Paid around $200 for a Thursday night the weekend before July 4th. Would absolutely stay there again. 
18769 I've stayed at this hotel before and return because of the great location and friendly staff. I would definitely recommend it but do wish their restaurant wasn't quite so fancy/expensive. 
18770 The breakfast wasn't so good as we expected. The person who cleaned the room stepped on everything on the floor (clothes etc). Good location, nice neighborhood, and the staff were great (except some of the cleaning persons). 
18771 Good hotel, clean big room, comfy bed, helpfull staff Well located for access to subway network Fine basic hotel. 
18772 Great position.....great staff...we had a penthouse suite - 2 balconies! We will definitely stay here again when returning to NY! 
18773 Fantastic hotel with a great team, always willing to help in any way they can!! Beds are incredible, just wat u need after pounding Manhatten streets for 10hrs!! Will be back. 
18774 The staff is great, always ready to meet your needs always smiling and most important they always remembers your name.. This is the best extended stay hotel with the best value around. Clean rooms, exceptional service and a great value. I would recommend this place to everyone.. 
18775 The only helpful person there was Natasha. Everyone else yelled at us. Rooms are not what they look like. Bathroom leaked water. It's about 10 blocks from time square. The staff ruined my last day there won't stay there again. 
18776 I stay here when I come into town. It's like a mini apartment with stove, refrigerator, kitchen sink, and a microwave. The staff are excellent and very friendly. If you are staying more than 1 day It's a great place to stay. 
18777 We just returned from a girls weekend in the city and stayed here. It was a perfect size and location. The staff made us all feel comfortable and welcome. 
18778 nice and close to the red line train and lots of great restaurants. small room but clean and well kept up. would stay there again. 
18779 Friendly with great service.Excellent front desk service.Knowledgable staff. 
18780 Pleasently surprised by the service and room emenities and quality. Very friendly staff and a great and quiet location just off the mafnificant mile. 
18781 The Lucerne is a very nice basic hotel. My room was small but very comfortable. Not much of a lobby but a nice area--close to Columbia University. 
18782 Stayed for one night in July. LOcation in theater district was perfect. Small room but clean and comfortable. Staff was very helPful 
18783 The 100 year old Algonquin is a treasure of old world elegance with an excellent restaurant and a warm and friendly accommodating staff in a prize location between Times Square and Fifth Avenue!We loved every minute of our stay!!! 
18784 Wonderful hotel with large, clean, nicely appointed modern rooms. Comfortable lobby with interactive information screens and customer service-focused staff; smooth check-in/check-out and helpful info from concierge. Conveniently located to Rockefeller Center, Times Square, 5th Ave. shopping, restaurants and multiple subway stops. Would definitely stay here again when visiting NYC. 
18785 Not clean, unfriendly staff, dark rooms, a lot of noise from elevator and club/bar. Gym closed and no information about this was given before hand. Bad bathroom products. Other guests complained about the same thing when we checked out. I would never stay here again. 
18786 our room was over the front entrance so was not very quite but apart from that we would stay there again 
18787 Stayed for four nights in May. Personally I have no complaints, the hotel is cheap, room is good (ok wallpaper is plain ugly), it is well located. The price/quality ratio for this hotel is excellent. Would recommend to friends & colleagues of mine. 
18788 The Marriott Marquis is located right on Times Square so excellent for tourism or business. Staff were OK and the Room was also average but spacious. The central bubble lift is a nice touch. 
18789 stayed for 3 nites, rooms are ultra small, basic, but beds are superior......wont stay again, since so many other choices in NYC are available. 
18790 Terrific hotel. Stayed 3 nights in July and enjoyed every minute there. Terrific location also. Booked reservations online for a very low price. Truly a five star hotel for a two star price! 
18791 I highly recommend it. Can't beat the convenience and the staff couldn't be more polite and helpful. I used my Chase points to get a discount on the room so I can't comment on the price. 
18792 Upgrade to a suite at this hotel and enjoy unusually large rooms with great views and access to Union Square restaurants, shops, and trains. 
18793 Club Quarters is a membership hotel for business. I have stayed at this location many times over the past 5 years. Room was small but effecient. Everything works as it is supposed to and there are electrical outlets accessible where you need them! 
18794 We liked being downtown close to walking distance to everything we wanted to see. The bathroom was small and no place to put toiletries and such, but the mattress and pillows provided awesome sleep. We enjoyed our one night stay here. 
18795 This hotel is located in Times Square - located near many hot spots. The elevator system is very efficient. The staff were friendly and efficient. The rooms are a nice size and clean. The views from the upper floors are breath taking. 
18796 Stayed for 3 nights and was very impressed with this hotel. Rooms were clean, spacious and smart. Reception staff were friendly and helpful suggesting good places to eat. Excellent coffee and cookies early evening. Such a good location An excellent choice! 
18797 Poor. Called Hotel manager 1 day after I left. Mentioned I was calling regarding bed bugs. I was attacked on my foot and ankle. They put me into voicemail and never returned my call. That said alot. 
18798 I was upgraded to a room with a king bed: it is a good thing I was alone. The room was very small. There would not have been enough space for two travelers with one suitcase each. But all in all, clean, comfortable, if a little too cozy. 
18799 Lovely property, excellent lounge and great service staff. Weekday construction is over-the-top noisy, but ends at 5PM and doesn't happen on weekends, so bearable. Once the work is completed, this is a fabulous property. Will definitely return again. 
18800 Very clean but basic rooms, good view over central park. The only downside is the distance from Downtown. For a weekend it may be worth paying the extra to stay downtown as what we saved by staying at this hotel we ended up spending in taxis. 
18801 Alex in the restaurant is a superstar. The pool was really cool and neat. 
18802 I loved this hotel. Pros: Strategically located, close to Broadway andTimes Square. The stunning bedroom was huge! I appreciated the complimentary coffee and /croissants and the cleanliness 
18803 Cons: The lobby was not that great. 
18804 Good price and good quiet location. Nothing fancy. Room had a small kitchen area and our room was at the back of the building which was super quiet on the 10th floor. Couple of good bars around the corner. Check out the Black Sheep for a beer. 
18805 For a city trip it is a nice and clean hotel. It's not five stars, but you may not aspect that for the price you're paying. The hotel is across the street from Penn Station and it's location is ver confinient if you want to see all of NY. 
18806 It is the 3rd time we stay at this hotel and every stay is better than the previous one! Great location, clean rooms , good restaurant and the staff is very welcoming and helpful. Will definately stay there again 
18807 I stayed at the Hilton Times Square, New York last week and all I have to say is GREAT SERVICE! Employees like George really make the difference, I would definitely stay there again just because of the service. Also, good breakfast! 
18808 This is a good hotel in a great location with extremely friendly and helpful staff. I wouldn't t think that would make a difference but it does. The hotel staff definitely make this place worth a try. 
18809 Stayed here w/o 26th April. Great location, friendly people and clean rooms. Restaurant next door is great too. Very reasonably priced. 
18810 Could not ask for a better location right in the heart of times square. Very large hotel and good service. Would stay here again. 
18811 So bad experience. I booked this hotel from priceline. When we arrived there, the front desk asked us pay more. I can not believe it. The room was not cleaned up at all. I never lived in a hotel like that. I won't go there anymore. 
18812 I actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate -- much lower than the usual price! It was a lovely hotel, beautifully appointed, walking distance from the places we wanted to go. We would highly recommend the Fairmont. 
18813 The hotel had a much older feel to it. What I love is the space, the own restroom and small kitchen for the price. 
18814 This is a small hotel in the heart of NYC with nice little rooms This is NYC.Do not expect acres of space! but we were very comfortable.the room had a small kitchenette area which was very useful 
18815 If you want a place in Manhattan, and not throw away $500 a night...this is well-located, extremely mid-town, and yes they're renovating.. but that's a good thing. After all, it is only a place to sleep, not to throw a Debutante gala! 
18816 Ideal hotel fro exploring Manhattan. The hotel is on Times Square with numerous Broadway theatres within walking distance, 
18817 Nice rooms, new and clean. Located around the corner from Macy's. Bar area is nice and comfortable. Luggage checking and retrieval was a confusing process with a line for luggage and confusion as to where it was stored. 
18818 I have been a weekly guest at the W Union Square New York and the high level of service has been exemplary and unparalleled to like priced hotels in the area. I would highly recommend staying here above all other W's in New York. 
18819 from the time we checked in to the time we left there is only praise for the staff, clean,quiet room on the 18th floor, comfortable bed. fabulous location. will return. 
18820 We had a good time and every facility we were looking for. It was a bit above our budget, but worth it for a comfortable stay, especially as we were upgraded and had a suite for the weekend. Parking is expensive, but convenient. 
18821 Stayed one night in May. Front desk clerk (Mary) was atrocious. Not pleasant whatsoever. She didn't want to be there.....I didn't want her there either. The rooms were clean and spacious. In room microwave and frig was very convenient. Great rate as well. 
18822 Staff knows the meaning of "excellent customer service" 
18823 The hotel was older, rooms on the smallish side, however the staff made the experience so incredible. The restaurant was amazing. Will stay here again. 
18824 New, clean and close to subways and attractions in NYC 
18825 Great location, easy access to subway and walking distance to Macy's, Times Square and much more. Very noisy from the street but that's New York. Concierge very helpful - hotel restaurant has excellent food 
18826 gran bel hotel entrata spettacolare con colonna acquario. ottima posizione vicino metro si va a piedi a time square, central park e 5 strada e madison avenue 
18827 stanze grandi e molto pulite. ottimo lounge bar servizio ottimo personale gentile no wifi gratis. aria condizionata ingresso molto forte 
18828 This hotel is located in a great spot near Times Square. The room is clean and adequate. Breakfast is included! The hotel staff is very professional and helpful.THere is even a small fitness room and a nice rooftop deck. 
18829 great hotel right across from Penn Station. you can't beat the location when coming/going by train, coming in on LIRR, etc. good size rooms for NYC. 
18830 As expected hotel, with usual amenities. Staff are friendly and helpful, close to shops and sites. Parking is expensive, however parking across the street is $12 less a night. 
18831 I thought the location of the hotel was prime for downtown. The size of the rooms was on the small-average size. The tv's inside the room were nice 42' plasma. The room was decorated ok. 
18832 Hotel muito bem localizado. Grande e com bastante fluxo de pessoas , como muitos na regiao da Times Square. Lobby sem atrativo. Os quartos sao espacosos, porem a decoracao precisa ser atualizada. Atendimento impessoal 
18833 The Pierre is a great old hotel. Our room was very spacious and cozy. The staff were very helpful and attentive. It is in a great location, in walking distance to almost everything. The Pierre is a great hotel and if you get the chance to stay there, go! 
18834 Great front desk team. Rooms are a bit on the small side but we are in Manhattan. Elevators can be slow at times, but can be overlooked. Good proximity to Koreatown and the subway. 
18835 The breakfast service at the Pub was terrible, the waitresses always looked tired, unfriendly, unwelcoming. We had vouchers for Continental breakfast and they didn't seem to like that. The portions got smaller every day and the pastries were not always fresh. 
18836 Goede uitvalsbasis, juist tegen over Carnegiehall. Vlakbij Central Park en met metro om de hoek. We hebben geen gebruik gemaakt van ontbijt en diner. Maar daar zijn meer dan genoeg mogelijkheden nabij. Ontbijt, zelfs gelijk er naast (zeer goed). 
18837 visite de la premiere chambre: vue sur un chantier construction d'un bulding!!!!!! pas terrible chambre pas tres grande et salle de bain exigue apres ns avons pris une suite!!!!! plus d'espace et grande douche avec un prix majore!!!!!!! 
18838 for $225/night plus tax we had an excellent room - plenty of space, quiet, attentive housekeeping. The bathroom was a bit worn but otherwise the room was excellent value for NYC hotel over the xmas holidays. 
18839 This price in Manhattan is very competitive, 3 min to metro station by walk, very close to 5th, Time square.... The boss also upgrade our room to a higher level. anyway, it's worth to stay in future again if you pursue cost performance. 
18840 The hotel was really nice and clean. It was in a great location right on the river. They have a bar on the 15th floor and it was just amazing ending your night there see the river and all the lights of the city. 
18841 The best thing about this hotel is the location, it looks right onto central park and is within walking diatance of all the main attractions Staff all very friendly. The rooms are all spacious and clean. Overall a great hotel 
18842 If you want to be in the heart of the tourist and theatre district in NYC, this is a good choice. Rooms were clean and quiet. Our room from the 37th floor had a great view of Times Square. We were eyeball with the New Years ball. 
18843 Awesome hotel-the best staff ever! My favorite part---the Boom Boom Room- top floor lounge-just wish I could have been there with the "in" crowd after 9pm...maybe in my next life! The room was funky with a view to die for! 
18844 ... however, I wouldn't spend my own money on it. For the price, you can get better. My advice is either go cheaper or up the ante and stay somewhere nicer. Starbucks in the lobby was convenient - yet again proving my point above. 
18845 When in new York, all I really care about is clean and quiet. This hotel was both. The rooms were a little tight and the elevator was kind of slow, but those were the only real downsides. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Would definitely stay here again. 
18846 The rooms can be a little small, but this is a clean hotel and you can walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, Penn Station, etc. as well as the subway. 
18847 I've been to Eventi more than once, and always found it clean and comfortable. This week, however, I was in town on a special occassion, and without any prompting the front desk clerk had champagne sent to my room. It was an unexpected, nice touch. I will definitely be back. 
18848 Very nice accommodations and convienent to the medical center, museum district and zoo. I will definitely stay here or another Crowne Plaza. The hotel has a very modern feel and comfortable bed and chairs. The restaurant and room service is fairly priced. 
18849 Great weekend at the Benjamin. Exceptionally friendly and helpful staff, only complaint would be the elevators are a little slow. Fantastic NYC location--great amenities! 
18850 I stayed at the Senton, Room 704 on August 2, 2010 and was bitten several times by bedbugs during the night. 
18851 A very pleasant stay. Clean, quiet room in outstanding neighborhood. Try and get to the complimentary food and drink served daily in the lounge. One of the more pleasant hotels in NYC. 
18852 Poor 1st impression. Minibar contained former guest sonic rt 44's (disgusting) plus dirty room srvc tray in front of my room upon arrival. My issue was that guest services didn't seem to care. It's ashame b'cuz I prob won't stay again. 
18853 Dont take a chance. Dont stay here! Rude service people, rude managers, and tiny rooms. 
18854 What a pleasant surprise. Great room,service and location at a reasonable price for NYC. 
18855 My stay at the Intercontinential was amazing. The staff was quick to help with any questions we had and the room was impeccable. The location right on Michigan Ave. was also very ideal for shopping. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
18856 Its a new hotel, walking distance to financial district, soho, battery park.the rooms are clean and efficient, staff is friendly and great way to see an ethnic neighborhood in New York. It was nice to see Chinese ladies practicing tai chi in the morning in the park. 
18857 My second stay at this hotel..Great room,comfortable bed,super bath. Service was great. Upscale accomodations... 
18858 Had a great stay here. Just around the corner from the Empire State Building and if you chose a cityview room you get a great view of the ESB. Also a few steps from the subway. All facilities one would expect and comfortable bed! 
18859 Elizabeth in Guest Relations is an exceptional employee. She has a great attitude and I received the best service from her. I would recomment this hotel 100%. I had a wonderful experience in NYC thanks to this hotel and its great service. Thanks for your hospitality, John Venuti 
18860 todas las personas que trabajan ahi son muy amables , yo estube una semana y se portaron de lo mejor , en especial maty el shuttle driver, mayra la recamarera, valencia y antonia, es un maravilloso hotel con un maravilloso equipo de trabajo 
18861 stanza un po'piccola e con poco spazio per gli effetti personali (eravamo tre persone in una double)ma pulita. spifferi non indifferenti dalla finestra ma vista magnifica.posizione strategica un po' per tutto e personale sempre disponibile. colazioni caotiche, frettolose e troppo "americane" possibilmente da evitare. comunque, nel complesso, giudizio favorevole. 
18862 Dirty...run down...scary.....don't bother. Run, don't walk someplace else. 
18863 Room was very nice and updated. Great location. Check-in was a bit slow, but not terrible. Asked the doorman to hail a taxi for a short ride to a business meeting, and upon finding out our destination, offered a ride in the hotel's car service, which was great. 
18864 ottimo hotel, personale gentile e disponibile, a 2 passi dal Madison square garden, fermata metro a 50 metri 
18865 First time at the Hudson, was in the City by myself and the location was great. The rooms are small but for myself that was just fine. 
18866 My teen-age son and I stayed here and it was great. Exceptionally clean, good service, and the price was what I call "New York City reasonable". I still can't get over how quiet it was. A great relief from the noise and bustle of the city. 
18867 Ana Maria Hussar was very cheerful and accomodated my needs perfectly when I checked in to this property. She is a definite asset to the front end of the hotel and should be highly commended for her excellent customer service. 
18868 This W Hotel is everything that the W Brand stands for; unique design, excellent location, extra special attention and care to it's guests. I always stay at the W New York Times Square when I am in the city for business and will continue to do so. 
18869 Good location. Nice inside and rooms are lovely. I'll be back 
18870 Room was clean, with a very good bed. Bathrooms still old, with shower curtains instead of glass. Location couldn't be any better, few steps from the Times Square. 
18871 Great little hotel. Understated elegance right next to Central Park. Wonderful experience and service. 
18872 There is nothing special about this hotel, so if you are looking for charm or beauty, this is not it. Old rooms, clean enough but not usual Westin quality. Great location and very nice doormen and front desk staff. 
18873 Incredible staff, facilities, and amenities. I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone and everyone. NO complaints AT ALL. I've stayed in a lot of places and the service/friendliness here was absolutely perfect. Room service and food in restaurant is pricey but you definitely get what you pay for. 
18874 Stayed here a couple of days ago for an overnight getaway. Was sooo pleased with the accommodations, location and the professionalism of the staff. Hope to stay here again soon! 
18875 Everyone from the guest to front the office were a be help thanks to all for a wonderful stay will visit again. 
18876 Disappointed. Reception area and staff nice. Room, although clean, needed renovation. The corridors were dreary and carpet looked old and worn. Area outside felt rundown and we got taxis rather than walked at night. Probably wouldn't stay here again. 
18877 This was a busy hotel over Labor Day weekend. The customer service reps., valet personell, and housekeeping were all outstanding. The Suite we stayed in was very large and we really enjoyed the space. 
18878 Great location, great pool. Fair price for the location. Restaurant and parking on site. 
18879 Stayed here for 3 days. It's in a great location if you want to be in the city. It is very clean. Worst elevator service I have ever seen. Small restaurant for breakfast. You have take the breakfast in your room. 
18880 We selected this hotel for the mix large room, location and affordable price and got exactly that. Not the most fancy but a very good compromise for a family week-end. 
18881 Simeon was professional, curteous, and respectful. Room was comfy with a seperate living area. Good location. Bell man was playing shady tricks with cab buddies. I would book car service ahead for long trips. Was mostly there to party, so the bed was important and comfortable. 
18882 Perfect location, very comfy, quite, safe and a nice staff. As with all luxury hotels, the front desk is polite, helpful & just a touch snobby. However, the doormen, restaurant staff and ESPECIALLY the housekeeping staff were are genuinely friendly. Highly recommend. Will stay again. 
18883 This Super 8 is one of the nicest Super 8's I have stayed at. The rooms were very clean. The staff was excellent. 
18884 Had seen reviews complaining about multiple elevators... For this place I'd take 3 more. Service value and quality, oh, and then lets throw in location.. You can't lose... 
18885 This place is amazing. The rooms are clean, the views of the park are spectacular and the service is splendid. You really can't ask for more. Stay here! 
18886 My room was so big nice and clean. The staff samantha and paige were very nice and the breakfast was very good. I have no complaint everything was great. This was my second time staying can't wait to come back. 
18887 To keep this short and concise, this is a great place to stay. Nice rooms with a view if you have a high floor and look towards the river. Manager "Justin Scarpa" was extremely accommodating. Staff was also helpful. 
18888 We had a last minute rate...99 for 1 night before return to Venezuela. Great location! Clean and Large room. No breakfast 
18889 Beautiful room. Location in middle of China Town and few blocks from Little Italy. Subway is only a few blocks away. Head to O'Neals bar/restaurant. Beautiful decor, great food and Sex in the City was filmed here a few times. 
18890 Quite a pleasant, clean and comfortable hotel, after all, all we did was sleep there and make coffee in the morning. Helpful staff at front desk. 
18891 We love this hotel! We have stayed there before and were updated to a huge suite this time since it was our anniversary! Nice bedding, 1 1/2 bathrooms beautifully decorated rooms, terrific staff and great location. Highly recommend. 
18892 The four nights we stayed in the New Yorker Hotel were great. We had a small but very nice room with a view. The remodeled room was nicely decorated, and the bed was very very comfortable. 
18893 We stayed here about 3 years ago. Great location and rooms. Will definitely be back. 
18894 Close to subway. Close to some good restaurants and parking. Great neighborhood. Very friendly and accomodating staff. Loved the "for all guests" balconies on the 14th and 16th floors. 
18895 The hotel is old and the rooms are very basic but the location is amazing! It's right in the heart of times square. You don't spend much time in the room anyway when you go to NYC so its definitely worth it. The hotel staff was also very friendly. 
18896 Powdered eggs. While I can appreciate a free breakfast at a hotel chain, I don't like powdered eggs. It's not that hard to make eggs. They were out of a staple item-butter. 
18897 The Roosevelt is terrific! Large rooms, friendly staff, sumptuous breakfast, all in a great location. It was walking distance from Broadway shows, very convenient in midtown. I got a great price from TravelZoo.com. Highly recommend The Roosevelt. 
18898 I stay at this hotel at least twice a year for business and it is always very clean and the staff friendly and helpful. I love the indoor pool they have and the beds are almost as comfortable as sleeping at home. 
18899 The hotel is clean and well maintained. It's located in the heart of Medical District and is very convenient to Rice University if you're headed there. 
18900 OK because of location. Otherwise I would stay somewhere else next time. 
18901 Spledida camera con vista su time square, bagno dotato di ogni confort, personale molto disponibile, ottima location. 
18902 Muy bien ubicado, precio justo y personal muy amable. 
18903 Great hotel with wonderful service. The rooms reminded me of European hotel rooms, a bit small but certainly nice and comfortable. Extra fees for parking and wifi. Hotel had scaffolding on the outside, but the inside lobby was beautiful. Tapas restaurant had good mojitos. Enjoyed our stay. 
18904 The hotel is well located, downtown manhattan, spectacular view-37 floor-, room size very acceptable & well equiped, stuff friendly...memorable experience. Would definitely recommend staying here. 
18905 Even though the hotel needs an update, the location and friendly staff makes up for that. 
18906 perfect location near central park/5th ave/rockefeller centre. subway at end of street made it easy to get around the rest of manhattan. best burger joint in hotel lobby room had a view of central park 
18907 We had an upper floor with a great view. Room was clean, nice and quiet. Only three rooms on the floor. Free water was great as was the free internet. Good security. We really loved it. 
18908 We stayed here for a week. The reception was very friendly and good. The twin bedded room was not to spacious, but not to small neither. The hotel was clean. No bedbugs. There was a good restaurant connected (North Square Restaurant). A pity that the breakfast buffet was quite small. 
18909 standard Doubletree, comfortable, well-maintained, nice shuttle service as needed to area restaurants and shops. This is important on weekends as few nearby restaurants are open Sat-Sun. 
18910 Breakfast buffet was very good too. Like everything in Houston, it is far from everything else, but hotel has good parking facilities. 
18911 Stayed here over a weekend, had great access to everything in the city (though Wall St. itself isn't all that exciting!). Recommended. 
18912 Hotel was clean. Room was clean. Mattress was terrible. A/C Sufficient. I would stay there again provided they had new mattresses. All the amenities in the world mean nothing without a good night sleep. 
18913 The staff where really great I could have not asked for such a great service very helpful and friendly in all ways customer service was tops the view of time square was sooo good I liked the view of my room the cleanliness of the room 
18914 Hotel Westin at Times Square is in an ideal location. The concierge is perfect and knows everything that is on in town. The best thing is that most rooms have a view, unlike most other hotels in NYC. The breakfasts give you a great start to a busy day. 
18915 Location was great. Staff friendly. Hotel mediocre,rooms small but clean. Peter. 
18916 The Hilton North Houston crew was very friendly during the entire stay. Everyone was approachable and customer friendly. The hotel is big with lots of ammenties and the rooms were very clean and comfortable. 
18917 Disfrute mucho mi estadia ahi. Es muy confortable. bien equipado, muy bien ubicado. Excelente trato. 
18918 The hotel lobby itself is small, but it offers a decent breakfast selection daily. The best feature is the access to subway lines that reach all over Manhattan. Rooms are comfortable. I heard no noise from the other rooms, even though the hotel was packed. 
18919 Great attentive staff, awesome bar in the lounge and rooftop, all around a good place to stay in Chicago. It is a few blocks from Michigan Ave but the cool lobby, staff and lounge make it all worth it. Room was also very spacious and decorated very well. 
18920 Stayed there 4 nights and I had a great time. Had a perfect view on Saint Patrick's, Huge room, very quiet. Very helpfull frontdesk and concierge Again the bar is a great place to hang out, food is good. Perfect NY location 
18921 VERY tiny itsy small room. Bathroom as well. Eventually left the hotel after one night. 
18922 My wife and I stayed 3 days on business/leisure. Pro's: Great Location! 3 blocks from 5th ave, across from Waldorf Very Friendly staff Free hershey kisses Nice bath products Cons: Small Small Small rooms Expensive Not enough outlets in room Crazy busy check in 
18923 Nice and clean hotel, about an hour ride to and from downtown Chicago, taking the orange line... paid an average of $128 cause of the jacuzzi, really not bad at all... 
18924 Modern, comfortable size and reasonable pricing for NYC accomodations with efficient staff 
18925 During the time I stayed at Crestwood 290 the staff treated me as if I was family.Malcom the night clerk was very helpful when I asked about the hot spots of Houston and local restaurants that's good. 
18926 ... when we got up in the morning, I said to my wife "it's like we're sleeping in our own bed" ... everything was so comfy and warm ... that's how good this place is. 
18927 Excellent place to stay particularly if you are visiting the Space center (only 2-3 mins drive). Rooms are large and very clean, breakfast was good and the staff were extremely friendly and helpful -great recommendations for evening meal. Superb value for money. Michael B 
18928 alright the rooms could be bigger and beds could be larger and more channels on television 
18929 Stayed with my family here on a business trip. The location and rooms were o.k. Nothing special, though the size of the room we had with 2 beds was quite spacious. The kids really liked the rooftop pool, though it's too bad they are only open until 6:00. 
18930 The Beacon totally exceeded our expectations. The rooms were very large, especially for NYC. The service was great, beds were extremely comfortable. Had a spacious, homey place to return to after a long day of sight-seeing. Will come back for sure!! 
18931 The staff at the hotel were warm and made our stay perfect. The cafe staff specifically went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable while we waited for check-in. The rooms are small but in NY I think this is standard. All in all, I would highly recommend. 
18932 Bien situe car a cote de la 5eme avenue. Chambre minuscule pas belle. Par contre c est propre. Rien a dire de plus mais je n y retournerais jamais 
18933 This hotel was a lot of fun. It is full or energy and the hotel staff is excellent. If you are looking for something diffferent and for a great price, this is it. The bars are awsome!!! The food is great and priced reasonably. 
18934 White glove service from the beginning. We were offered champagne upon check in and quickly was shown our room. The room was very small but it's NYC so I expect that. 
18935 Excellent location, good concept but the rooms need to be renovated: they are just OK for a short stay, but nothing is really enjoyable, the bed is old as well as the carpet (I would not walk barefoot...). There are much better in NYC for that price... 
18936 As in all my experiences with La Quinta the staff was great-morning, noon and night! Clean room and wonderful bedding! Easy access from my car to my room. This hotel location was perfect for my meeting Thank you La Quinta! 
18937 Very quiet and nice hotel, close to shopping mall and lake. They don't include breakfast but the room is equipped with coffee machine and microwave. We have comfortable stay there. I would recommend Rafaello Hotel to other travelers. 
18938 Great place but a bit expensive at over $400 per day. Of course it is in the center of New York, world's most expensive neighborhood. walking distance tyo most shopping, and other site seeing places, restaurants, theaters, Time square, and everything else New York is famous for. 
18939 Horrible..The front desk was helpful. They should do background checks on the lowlife that stay there. Times change. I used to rent monthly years back. wasn't like this. 
18940 It's a bit pricey to stay in this hotel but the location is good with the sub just below the hotel... 
18941 Really cute hotel with great staff and customer service! Love the location, could see Lake Michigan from my room. Also, had great drinks at the hotel bar. Rooms were very cute with a modern and trendy look. 
18942 Very new hotel with extremely well trained staff. I have to specially recommend the Concierge services where both Kat Bride and Adrian Proietti showed great knowledge on everything we looked for, allowing us to have great moments on different attractions. 
18943 i stayed at the westin time square dec 18-20 had a nice stay there. make sure to get a corner room, they have great views. service was ok. remember this is not the ritz as far as service goes. 
18944 The rooms are huge, the staff absolutely lovely, location handy and the price is great. They have two bedroom suites which are enormous and sleep 6+ easily. The rooms are always clean. We stay here every time we come to NY and now so do all our friends. 
18945 Rose was a great help at the front desk. We booked through priceline and she was able to give us double beds in all 3 rooms right next to each other. The hotel was in a great location and very clean! The pool was great for the little ones! 
18946 As with most NYC hotels it seems, small dark room, no tea&coffee facilities but a bizarrely large fridge! Great location though! 
18947 Hotel staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms a good size, well stocked. Living room area a great bonus. Extensive breakfast menu. Would have no hesitation recommending this hotel and would definitely use it again. 
18948 You know in the movies and on TV when they show you that amazing long shot of central park? That was the view from our room. And the room itself was amazing. They thought of everything. We felt like royalty. Expensive but well worth it! 
18949 Goed hotel maar de kamers waren klein, al hoewel dit normaal is in New York. airco unit maakt wat lawaai maar hebben we s'nachts uitgezet.Verder alles goed aardige bediening en voldoende handdoeken. De metro is kortbij. 
18950 A small gem on a quiet block between Madison and Park, lovely rooms with contemporary English elegance and a consistently high level of service. A good value. Stayed because business associate recommended it-he is a regular and I understand why. I'll return! 
18951 We stayed here one night and loved the hotel. The staff were friendly and helpful. Our shower lacked some water pressure, but otherwise, our room was perfect. We had great views of the hancock building next door and we easily walked everywhere we needed to go! 
18952 Competent staff, very clean rooms, comfortable bed, reasonably priced and good, complimentary breakfast selection. Property is convenient to Times Square, subway and the "Hell's Kitchen Market," weekends, is just down the street. 
18953 I had such a wonderful stay at the Thompson LES. Beautiful rooms that manage to capture the excitement and electricity of the city whilst maintaining a deep calm and relaxing ambiance. 
18954 Great hotel, great service. Great location in NYC. In the middle of the blizzard when good service went out the door at shops and restaurants, Eventi was outstanding. 
18955 Bathroom was VERY small along with a small room. Not that clean either. Great location though. 
18956 This is a typical NYC hotel - everything is a little cramped but the location is fantastic for Soho. Minutes from great restaurants and shopping. Staff was very nice and helpful. 
18957 El hotel esta muy bien ubicado pero esta muy lejos de ser un 5 estrellas. Las habitaciones son muy chicas, los banos son muy viejos y chicos. La gente en el front desk son muy poco ambles y no estan dispuestos a facilitate la estadia a nadie. 
18958 Outside the building looked a little lack luster, but the room was clean and appeared modern. The breakfast was pretty decent and location was excellent. The staff was friendly and very helpful, can't really complain. There was free cookies so that's always a plus. 
18959 Well located, small but comfortable clean room, large TV, good hot breakfast. All of the many staff that we dealt with were helpful and friendly. Clearly the management here make a point of training staff well. For 99 bucks/ night, what more can you want in Manhattan? 
18960 Stayed here for 2 nights while attending a funeral. Ver nice, clean rooms. Great beds, plenty of pillows, pool, breakfast, newspaper. Stay here, you will enjoy it. 
18961 I was shocked by the size of their standard room , and their queen bed is like full size 
18962 Don't bother argue with them no one listen 
18963 The only thing they have is location 
18964 De winkel van Prada is zeer aan te raden, Dean & Deluca is zeker de moeite waard op Broadway. Union Square, heerlijk met een park vol eekhoorntjes. Heel schattig. De Brooklyn Bridge overlopen, te bereiken via China Town. Restaurant Balthazar in Soho, restaurant Pastis in Chelsea 
18965 Excellent location, the room was clean. The staff was nice. 
18966 The servers at the restaurant we the best. Very helpful and friendly. The AC in the rooms was not very good. Had to keep the curtains closed and could not get the temperature below 72. Found out it is not an AC unit but a water chiller. 
18967 Was a Guest of Delta airlines. Beautiful historic and upadted hotel. Great location. More european Botique style hotel. Toured Cary Grants flor he lived in for 12 years with beautiful verandas overlooking NYC best views in the city. Close to everything. 
18968 A great hotel- excellent rooms with great amenities and good views...spacious enough considering NYC hotel rooms. Superior, friendly service and the hotel boasts excellent bars for amazing people watching in a cool, trendy neighbourhood. Pillows and sheets were so good - I asked brand names! 
18969 Easy to get everywhere; rooms are spacious and very comfortable. 
18970 The hotel was nice, good location, and very friendly. They also have a late night pizzeria that will deliver to your hotel room. 
18971 I had a pleasant business stay. Rooms are very clean. The location is superb. Internet access was included. However I am very dissapointed that they charge a $10 fee for accessing the Gym ?! Not impressed. 
18972 Based on the reviews here it looked ok, it was not. I checked in, saw my room and checked out. Old, dirty and just plain bad. Makes a Motel 6 look like the Ritz 
18973 Das Hotel liegt in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft zu allen Subway Linien und dem Times Square. Das Hotel ist angenehm schlicht ausgestattet. Die Zimmer sind leise und sauber aber ziemlich klein. Insgesammt absolut zu empfehlen 
18974 Decisamente il contrario delle foto! camere brutte...non curate e personale non professionale... solo comoda la posizione difronte a central park... i bagni pessimi...e la colazione molto scadente... i bagni sono troppo piccoli...l'unica cosa buona in camera sono i cuscini........... 
18975 I stayed one night for business and had a good stay. The location is great - attached to the wonderful Galleria mall. The staff was friendly and the room was comfortable. While I had a unique room situation, I enjoyed my stay. 
18976 Room was too small, squalid and dirty, the bed and the bathroom door were broken. It was noisy all the time and the air conditioner seemed to explode. The service was not the best and the staff not friendly and we paid about 200 dollars per night, what an impudence! 
18977 best locetion best stuff nice, clean,nathing bad!! 
18978 needs a renovation - breakfast was small in a very small room, no place to sit - every day, bed and bathroom were clean - location was perfect 
18979 Fantastic position just in front at Central, beautiful inside, best place to stay for a tourist for a ragionable price. 
18980 The rooms look like ikea (not really my idea of luxury) but the service at the hotel is great! Great bar scene. I am kind of a clean freak, and I wouldn't rate the bathroom as pristine...the room itself was ok...but the location is excellent. 
18981 When you can get a warm cookie any darn time you want, what more can you ask for? And the pillows are fantastic too. Attend conferences here annually and the amenities are perfect. Nice restaurant and bar. Professional, customer oriented staff. I'd stay again and again. 
18982 The staff was amazing. Very friendly and they went above and beyond to ensure I had an excellent stay. My boyfriend was here on his summer vacation/birthday and we stay at The Mave and he loved it. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and family. 
18983 Wer eine preiswerte Bleibe in NYC sucht, ist im Bellnord Hotel genau richtig. Die U-Bahn Station ist direkt um die Ecke und mit dem Express ist man schnell Downtown. Die Zimmer sind zwar klein aber Sauber und auch ansonsten vollig ausreichend. 
18984 This is a standard Hilton hotel with professional staffs and clean rooms. Very good for business travelers. 
18985 Stayed in this hotel for couple of nights last month. The hotel is charming and sweet. Very friendly stuff(especially Mourad ) great example of customer service. Great location. Definitely would stay again and recommend to friends and family. 
18986 Expensive neighbourhood. Loud reconstruction works outside start early. Clean. Small. 
18987 The Sanctuary is chic, affordable and in a great location. The only down side is the size of the rooms. They are beautiful and very clean but very small. It's the perfect hotel if you don't plan to spend alot of time in your room. 
18988 Comfortable hotel in a fabulous location within easy walking distance of Central Park, the Lincoln Centre and Times Square. Quiet rooms with good bathrooms and good housekeeping service. Excellent service with a special mention to Ricardo Alvarez who went out of his way to assist us. 
18989 Came here recently for a national conference and really enjoyed my stay. My room overlooked Michigan Avenue with big spacious windows. Comfortable bed, good shower and plenty of space. Plenty of meeting room space as well. 
18990 and enjoyed our stay. Breakfast was great. Staff was great overall, except for the desk clerk who was less than helpful at check in. We were happy with our stay. We were impressed with the complimentary amenities, such as laundry and internet, as well. 
18991 This hotel is great. Courteous accessible staff, clean comfortable contemporary rooms and reasonable parking next door! The location is near everything and cabs are right outside. I will stay here again in fact this is my hotel of choice now. 
18992 This hotel is very close to Hobby airport. It is clean and pleasant. Hotel staff was friendly. Room was spacious and clean. Bed was comfy as well. I would stay here again. 
18993 great hotel very clean nice quier area with lots of pubs and restaurants close by but be careful of rooftop restaurant fantastic view but drinks very expensive 
18994 I wish I could carry this property on my back and stay in it in every city en route. We travel back and forth between Louisiana and Arizona every year and ALWAYS choose this great place for the first night. Keep up the good work! 
18995 Hotel location is excellent. Majority of staff very helpful. Great sized room. Would recommend hotel & would stay again. 24 hour store & Pharmacy downstairs. Memorable stay in the greatest city in the world. 
18996 Veldig nedslitt. Upersonlig. Dyrt. Dyre restauranter i bygget. Ikke gratis wi-fi. Likevel, fantastisk beliggenhet 
18997 as above. great hotel in a great location-midtown manhattan, near carnegie hall, broadway, lincoln center and near a, near a subway stop.clean, spacious, functional rooms, with many nice amenities in the hotel including great breakfast restaurant (open until midafternoon), an inexpensive, good hamburger restaurant, and a nice light breakfast restaurant/bar. 
18998 Free internet so thats a bonus. Great staff very friendly, enjoyed the free breakfast around the corner. room size was adequate. whenever we had a request it was answered very well. 
18999 I like the W brand, and the feel of the hotel lived up to it. Service was generally not as good as others that I have stayed in, concierge had a slightly dismissive manner and the cleaners literally waited outside my door for me to leave (late checkout). 
19000 Best hotel in New York City! Great location and feel. We felt like we were in another world. 
19001 Great valued hotel for my first trip to NYC. Good location and the plan we booked included a wonderful "full american breakfast". Some people were paying up to $14(I think) per person for this. No doubt I would stay here again 
19002 I found this hotel after an uncomfortable night at another hotel we had booked on-line. It's a bit more expensive, but well worth it. It's a great hotel in a great location. 
19003 Relatively new. Small, but comfortable room. Free wifi. Good free breakfast. Housekeeping left something to be desired. Dod not replace proper towels, etc.even when we asked 
19004 We were very comfortable at the Hotel Blake and we really had a chance to relx. Loved the view, the personell were very friendly and helpful.....we will be back soon! 
19005 Very surprised by the level of service of this low budget hotel. Service on par with any big chain. Front Desk clerk was courteous and rooms were cleaned. Suggest renovation of the rooms. 
19006 il fatto che sia vicino a tutto sopratutto time square ,sembrerebbe dar valore all'hotel, ma tutto finisce li'!!!!camere piu' o meno pulite, abbastanza silenzioso, ma ripeto per il prezzo forse ci si puo' accontentare!!! 
19007 tres bien place (a cote de l`Empire State Buiding et de Times Square) mais l`etat general de l`hotel est bien moyen et le petit dejeuner tres decevant (salle minuscule ou tout le monde s`entasse et buffet devalise par les arrivees continuelles) 
19008 Rooms were small but nice. Great location for walking around New York City. 
19009 Staff helpful, room upgrade to view empire state building foc! Will have many happy memories of our wedding day there as we were made to feel really special, thank The New Yorker! Hopefully be back soon! 
19010 Very dark hotel. Some concierge were very helpful, others clueless. Sometimes gave inaccurate information. Nothing free here - you pay for every single thing. Not for children. Location is ideal for midtown tourist attractions. Good bathroom - fixtures, towels, etc. 
19011 Spent four nights at the Essex House in February 2005. For the price I thought it was one of better values I have found in NYC. Room was fairly big by New York standards, clean and comfortable. I would certainly return. 
19012 Starck ha dato il meglio di se.... le camere sono piccole ma confortevoli, tipico arredamento di design con lampade molto particolari..... bellissima la lobby ed il bar molto molto accattivante.... da passarci almeno una notte..... molto fashion 
19013 we stayed there marathon weekend at their tower suite which was spacious for the four of us.We got breakfast included service was great 
19014 Mooie, ruime kamers. Uitstekende bedden. Uitgebreid ontbijt. Zeer goed gelegen. 
19015 we changed three times the room before we left the hotel. We couldn't believe what we saw. The rooms were so dirty. The mattresses were broken, a lot of waste, bottles, tissues, dust, mud under the bed. Dirty walls. Mold on the wall. Stickier carpet. Dead flights. No clean bathroom. 
19016 Wir hatten Zimmer im 22. Stock mit Terasse, was in NY ziemlich einzigartig ist. Fuer die iphone-Generation ist das Hotel wohl zuwenig chick aber Vintage kommt ohne Gadgets. Grosses sauberes Zimmer. Hotelrestaurant fuer Morgenessen empfehlenswert. Lage genial. Timesquare, Eataly, Highline etc. alles innerhalb eines 10-15 Min. Fussmarsches erreichbar. Preis/Leistung perfekt 
19017 One of best residence inn.........one will ever find. Very nice, clean and convenient........in the heart of mid-town area. Rooms are equipped with the most comfortable and cozy beds one will find. Very good breakfast and restaurant............as well as very pricy. 
19018 The location is great, and I loved having Starbucks in the lobby. Room was just okay though and housekeeping wasn't very good. 
19019 Clean but dark rooms...price is alot much than it worths...furniture is getting old...location is good..car rentals are close..central park is close..fitness center is small but ok...i was hoping better because it is a butique newyork city hotel with a very high price level..but hardly satisfied... 
19020 Clean, quiet, simple...understated good taste, thoughtful decor, refined sensibility...very well done. Oh, and a good bargain too! I'll definitely stay there again if I'm in Midtown. The Roof Garden is going to be really nifty when it's done, especially in decent weather. Bill O'D -Chicago 
19021 Great location, great value, clean rooms, staff friendly and helpful 
19022 Outstanding accommodations, very clean and well kept -- pricey but what in NYC isn't -- close to Times Square and theatres. 
19023 Remember our stay here fondly. Great Staff friendly and helpful. Location excellent. Overall a great place to stay. Going back in 2011. 
19024 Very convenient location near Grand Central Station. Nice decor...modern and airy. We got 2 adjoining rooms b/c we are a family of 5 and that worked out fine. Front desk and concierge staff were helpful and friendly. 
19025 I loved the Belvedere for the friendliness of staff, its location, necessary amenities, attractiveness of it along with the smaller size. 
19026 Stay here! You won't regret it! A beautiful hotel, with all the amenities and charm for a fun, romantic get away! 
19027 Unless you just want to pay for over the top luxury, why stay anywhere else? The Kimberly is part of why we love NYC. Great staff. Great rooms. Great location. Can't wait for next year, it'll be our fifth year in a row at the Kimberly. 
19028 Great staff, comfortable bed, huge bathroom, complimentary cafe and drinks makes this incredibly good value. Right on Times Square. We will definitely return. Thanks to all the staff for looking after us so well. 
19029 Nice hotel, quiet during the week we were there. 15 mins subway ride to Times Square. 2 mins from Ground Zero. All staff were professional. 
19030 - nice view to central park - you can reach a lot of sightseeing highlights by feet - taste the Burgers in the hotels "Burger Joint" - the hotel-team is very friendly 
19031 We stayed one night, the staff was great. The foyer was really small, but decorated very nice.The rooms were smaller than I thought, but the bed was very comfortable. The bathroom is very small, there is just a shower only. In walking distance of lots of places. 
19032 Stayed at the Jane this weekend. Rooms are small but comfortable &cozy. Staff is excellent. Extremely clean bathroom(which is shared).Only negative:slow elevator.Highly recommended!If you ever get the chance,give the Jane a chance! 
19033 Our first visit to the USA and we definately weren't disappointed. The staff are so friendly and accommodating and nothing is too much trouble. If we are ever fortunate to visit Chicago in the future, we will be sure to stay in this hotel once again. 
19034 For $79/night, it was a fine value. We were there just one night. The location is very convenient. I never utilized 'service', but questions were answered with knowledge. There is Buddy Guy's Blues Club across the street. Free internet service in the lobby. 
19035 Great hotel! AWESOME LOCATION! The rooms were good size, just took a while at the reception to check in. Otherwise totally loved it! 
19036 Great little hotel. Very friendly staff. Very clean 
19037 Stayed here for 4 nights at the end of January. Room was on the 27th floor with a great view of Times Square. Very clean and spacious room. Really helpful check in staff. Can't find the slightest bad point about this hotel. 
19038 Very clean and modern. Swanky feel. 2 good bars. Love the fireplace. Have used the lobby for business since and it's perfect. No one bothers you and there is Internet service. Highly recommend it for that. Very comfortable. 
19039 Acommodations are a bit old fashioned but roomy, the breakfast buffet is limited - you have to go early or you'll end up empty handed. It is conveniently located near the subway and near many korean and asian restaurants 
19040 Excellent service, great location, nice accommodations. Personal touches make this a 5-star recommendation! My wife celebrated her birthday during our stay here, and the hotel's customer experience manager arranged for a special treat for her on her birthday. Since a nice touch! 
19041 We stayed for one night. The room was clean but quite small. Location is great; you can get around town easily from here. Major compliment: I think that this hotel has the nicest staff I have seen anywhere in I don't know how long. Friendly and helpful! 
19042 Das Hotel liegt perfekt um New York zu erkunden. Up Town und Down Town sind innerhalb von wenigen Minuten per U-Bahn erreichbar. Die U-Bahnstation ist nur wenige Meter vom Hotel entfernt. Das Hotel ist sauber, das Personal freundlich. 
19043 If you get a room on a high enough floor, you can see from the museum campus to Navy Pier. It is a beauiful hotel with great rooms and an awesome staff. 
19044 Le Marcel reste un hotel abordable pour New York. Bien situe pour Greenwich village et SOHO, assez central. L'hotel se distingue par sa proprete, par l'amabilite de son staff toujours disponible a rendre service. Excellent rapport qualite prix pour New York. 
19045 Certainly a good budget place to stay given the cost of most accommodation in Manhattan. However, there is currently a lot of building work going on to one side of the hotel, so it would be worth confirming your room is ot next to this. Work starts at 7am! 
19046 Our room was very large and clean! Breakfast in the hotel restaurant was very good, but not really cheap.The location is very good for all midtown attractions - to walk! Also the subway is not far to walk. Would stay again here!!! 
19047 We loved Fitzpatrick Manhattan. The staff were wonderful especially the bartender Carol... she is great, every bar should have a member of staff like her. We will definately go back!! 
19048 The hotel is very clean and very high-end. But, it's one of the noisiest places we've ever stayed--external construction work until midnight each night, very metallic doors slamming (think college dorm slams), loud hallways, and lots of kids. Our staff person at check out was VERY rude too. 
19049 Nice facility, nice location, good rooms, good breakfast, nice small gym with new precor equipment. The only problem is no service. Long lines at reception and often only one staff working. 
19050 A little hard to find off the hwy. lobby was ok. Carpets are filthy. All walls need either paint or wipe down. Staff was very friendly. Cleanliness alone would prompt us to stay elsewhere. 
19051 Large spacious room, good staff and great location. I was very impressed with the size of the room and the quality of accomodations. Everything a business traveler needs is all there. 
19052 The staff was very helpful and friendly. Hotel is historic with a beautiful lobby, good quality rooms 
19053 Located near great shops, few blocks from broadway, flat out amazing! 
19054 Great Hotel and Great Staff. Stayed here for a meeting. Great bathrooms! 
19055 Wonderful rooms, great service, and reasonable prices. We won't stay anywhere else in NYC. Larry, Steve, and Antoinella make you feel like you're home. 
19056 Sostato 3 notti. Stanza spaziosa,bel bagno,ghiacciaia di piano con distributore di bibite. Ottima colazione a buffet. Spazi e camere pulite e curate. Insomma CONSIGLIABILE 
19057 great and fun place to stay. centraly located and nice people. can recommend it to everyone! 
19058 Great service, great rooms, and great location in NYC. Away from Times Square, so it was nice and quiet at night. 
19059 Por la tarde, el bar del Hotel hudson es uno de los lugares mas frecuentados por gente cool. Un ambiente moderno y sofisticado, lo hacen uno de mis bares preferidos en NYC. 
19060 Hotel is on the expensive side, but not out of place for Manhattan. Location is fantastic, central to all major attractions and shopping. Room was not vacuumed, which was disappointing. Amenities very ordinary. No extra service. Staff are helpful in the lobby but non-existent at the doors. 
19061 Did a 3 day group meeting for 45 people. Meeting facilities, food, and staff top notch. Hotel near shopping. Sleeping rooms great. Nice pool. 
19062 This hotel is amazing,views of river where lovely to wake up to, The concierge Jeffrey was amazing and helped us with broadway tickets and flowers in the room as asked for We will be back for Xmas 
19063 We stayed at this hotel in March 2010 - we thought it was a lovely hotel - beautifully decorated, the staff were polite and the room was immaculate and clean. The hotel is a good walking distance to all major attractions. I would definitely recommend this hotel to people. 
19064 hotel very central to 5th avenue and walking distance to all the main shops.walking distance the park. 
19065 Good experience here, good location across from the hard rock cafe. Not in the core downtown but within walking distance to some good restaurants. Rooms can be a bit small, but reasonably priced for Chicago. 
19066 Great staff, great location but the room was so tiny that we barely moved! Very close to the American Museum of Natural History and central park, close to subway station. 
19067 Staff was wonderful everyone greets everyday 
19068 Love Carlos the bellman,Maria check us in. Had a good room on 5th floor Riingo pancakes were great 
19069 The hotel is very well-located. Rooms are small, but clean, very comfortable. Staff was very accommodating. Fitness room small but well-equipped. Restaurant beside hotel provides room service and has an excellent menu. 
19070 Good size rooms. Very clean. Lovely big foyer. Great view of Chrysler Building from our window. Comfortable beds. Next door to Grand Central Station. 
19071 An iconic new York establishment ....my room wasn't great..didn't care..just loved the whole thing.....brilliant! 
19072 Definitely not worth the money. Old hotel, poor breakfast, promised Internet but it did not work (even with help desk support), no thermostat in room. I will never return. 
19073 PROCHE DE TIMES SQUARE, QUARTIER QUI VIT JOUR ET NUIT, RESTAURANTS, BOUTIQUES, THEATRES... PROCHE DES LIGNES DE METRO ISOLATION PHONIQUE DE QUALITE TRES BIEN PLACE POUR POUVOIR VISITER NY ET PROFITER LE SOIR DES DIFFERENTS SPECTACLES. 
19074 Great location, extremely quiet - never heard any other guests in other rooms, great extras - breakfast, evening social, free laundry services. 
19075 We were looking for something close to Wrigley but what we found was a nice hotel within walking distance to everything. Great neighborhood...close to shops, waterfront, restaurants, and bars. We loved this place and would stay again. We had a room outside of the el but we barely heard it. 
19076 We were at this hotel late August on a family trip. Had a room on the second floor.Staff was friendly and very helpful, especially because were there with little children. Didn't eat the hotel though. 
19077 Hotel is clean and only for staying the night perfectly adequate. Staff is friendly and helpful, coffee machine morning available. Very good Base to discover the town, on foot one has however everywhere a good footpath, or you can take a taxi. Very good value for money. 
19078 Very helpfull,friendly and professionel employees. Location is perfect for a first impression of the city. Clean and spacious room. Good price/value for a city like this. Lot of possibilities for breakfast,lunch and diner at walking distance. 
19079 The hotel was lovely, very comfortable and a great location. All of the staff were really helpful and friendly, I wish I could remember all of their names. A great idea as well to serve guests wine at 5pm every day! Would definately recommend. 
19080 This hotel was in an excellent location close to Central Park. The room was small but room enough for 2. The bedding was comfortable. Nice complimentary breakfast in small dining area. Room was clean. 
19081 I stayed 2 days early june and I found the price excessive for the room I got. Close to the bar, noisy, small, not a nice view. Smell of smoking. The 2nd day I finally got another room. This time higher floor, lighter but no safebox. Concierge staff very nice. 
19082 We stayed there while we were moving our daughter to NYU. We used Marriott points to stay there. The location was good and felt safe. The room was equiped with a fridge, microwave and tea and coffee. the staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast was very average. 
19083 Can't give it a full "excellent review because Shuttle service was not the best other than that service was informal for the most part, but they did their best to accommodate. 
19084 Had a great stay. The hotel is very comfortable, the room was surprisingly large for a major city. Everything was very clean and the staff were very friendly. The location is just off Times Square, but is not overly busy and is very convenient for getting around. 
19085 We were on our second honeymoon and stayed here 2 nights. Enjoyed the experience a lot. Thank you. 
19086 This was an exceptionally pleasant stay at the Howard Johnson. I did like the location of the place but some parts of the hotel i did not like such as the rooms. The staff was friendly as well. 
19087 Just stayed in Fitzpatrick for a week over Christmas. Excellent hotel in a brilliant location and very friendly staff. Could not find one fault. Highly recommended. If you are planning on staying there, there's a great Irish bar just a minute away on 3rd Avenue - Pig n' Whistle. 
19088 I liked this hotel, the location is excellent, literally walking distance from Times Square with the brilliant Carnegie Deli almost opposite. The rooms are comfortable and the staff are always on hand. 
19089 Yeshaira Robles is the one and only reason why I stay at your hotel. She is the definition of customer service. She always knows be my name when I arrive and always anticipates my needs during my stay. She is a true asset to your hotel!!! 
19090 So close to Times Square, Broadway Show, Subway Stn, prity much everything. Loved staying here, will certainly stay there again. 
19091 We stayed a week in this hotel the location and staff was excellent! We enjoyed our stay and will recommend it highly. Breakfast everyday was a great bonus. Rooms were clean and neat 
19092 for a busy and expencive place like NY this was a very good hotel. the beds were a littlebid smal but clean. We liked it here. 
19093 El hotel esta muy bien situado, pero es muy viejo y no esta bien conservado .Las habitaciones dan sensacion de sucias y los encargados de la recepcion esta desbordados y no atiende. 
19094 No hotel that is rated a four star or above should have rooms this small. I'm 5'9" but my knees hit the bathroom wall when sitting on the toilet. Its a "trendy" place but you should stay somewhere else and drop by the bar. 
19095 The hotel staff were polite and helpful. Our room was very clean and nicely decorated. The beds were extremely comfortable. The kids absolutely loved the hotel elevators. 
19096 We came for the Bayern Munchen v. Manchester United soccer game on July 25th. The room was $109 for 2 double beds. Big enough for myself, husband, and 2 kids. The room wasn't beautiful, but it was clean and the price was right. 
19097 Room was ok, but I loved the free wi-fi, most places charge a fee for that. 
19098 Really like the friendliness of this hotel and its furnishings were very nice. The front desk staff couldn't have been more helpful and the complimentary breakfast was great! The hotel is in a nice location, close to upscale restaurants and shopping. Really enjoyed ourselves here! 
19099 Front-line , desk, servers excellent. Management staff aloof, kind "all hat, no cattle". I was told my type of customer (CORP) were allotted specific room areas..."you people can't have those rooms". Downstairs. 
19100 We had an amazing stay at On The Ave with our young children. We loved the communal terrace overlooking NYC as well as the spacious rooms and attentive staff. Overall an awesome visit! 
19101 Will definitely stay here again. Customer service was very nice, gave us a free upgrade to a king size room. 
19102 My only complaint about this hotel was the elevator could take a while during peak hours. Otherwise this was a standard Marriott with the usual amenities. We were a family of four in one room, doable. Great location near Times Square, easy walk to most of broadway theaters. 
19103 The place is walking distance from several attractions and affords easy access to public transport. The room was comfortable and ample for two nights for our family of four ( two little children) since we spent most of our time outside. 
19104 What i like about this hotel is the location and the quality for the value. It' s like having an appartment in ny. since this is an express type it means the services are minumum. But you have more than you need! 
19105 I was very surprised how nice this hotel was...and the staff was exceptional. The location was great and the rooms were clean. My only complaint is all the noise that came from the street, I heard it all even though I was on the 22 floor. 
19106 This hotel is in a great location near Michigan Avenue shopping and dining. The suite was wonderful! It was large and the minibar had a great selection. Also loved the rain shower shower head and large shower area. The service was great, too! I would strongly recommend the Raffaello. 
19107 I was in this hotel in 2006 and I reported it as excellent. Last experience has not been the same. Rooms are out dated, and need to be upgraded. 
19108 the place waws ok...nothing too special. The bathroomwas very small though. the bed was all right. the lobby was nice Ithopught, and theres a lot of places to eat near eat. I would stay there again if i wanted to stay on that side of NYC. 
19109 Our purpose in visiting NYC was to locate an apartment for our daughter. This was a perfect location to scout Manhattan from. The staff was helpful, the rooms clean and the outdoor patios provided a nice place to chat with visitors. 
19110 Amzing apartments,service better then hotel.staff really friendly 
19111 Lobster roll in The Standard Grill - and 30% of the fries. Lunch for a hangover. Comment - Drop the karaoke on Sunday night - it sucks ......or put it in the Biergarten. Otherwise its a great launch pad for working anyplace Downtown. 
19112 hotel moderno e accogliente ristrutturato nel 2009.il paramount si trova sulla 46th a soli 150 m da times square.comodo per viaggi di piacere con le maggiori attrazioni a poche centinaia di metri. 
19113 The hotel doesn't look old, but the carpets and the lobby look like chaos. The beds were clean and comfy, but the bathroom and especially the shower should have been cleaned much better. The we paid approx. $1000 for 4 nights, and it is most definitely not worth it. 
19114 Excellent location - 3 minutes from Times Square and the subway, Excellent staff - always friendly and very helpful Excellent decor in the rooms and the Lounge. We'll stay there again. 
19115 We stayed here for the Westminster Kennel Club dog show. The location was great, within walking distance of everything, and the staff were brilliant. Will definitely book for the 2012 dog show. 
19116 I sincerely enjoyed my stay the location was great the service was outstanding. I really felt comfortable here because the staff made me feel welcomed and I loved that I could walk every where. 
19117 The staff was excellant very helpful. The The rooms were clean and spacious ... best ones I have seen in awhile. Great location and VERY quiet!!! They also have a nice breakfast. Enjoyed my stay and WILL be back!!! 
19118 actually staying here right now.. we booked a room for 4 ppl, but really got a 1/2pers bedroom with 2 beds.. definitely not recommended unless you prefer to stay in sth the size of a tent.. if this doesnt change soon we're probably leaving 
19119 Small but well appointed rooms, great location for Mid town , Central Park area. Food OK , but expensive, especially breakfast...better of to walk to Starbucks or Le Pain Quotidien. Good price. 
19120 Less than 150$ per night for a 4 stars quality hotel in downtown Chicago. Clean decorated with taste and offering many services for business travellers. Close to Loop stations 
19121 Rooms are small, but space is sufficient for anyone just looking for a place to sleep and work. 
19122 Ottimo hotel,molto pulito,personale gentilissimo e disponibile,vicinanza al centro e alla metro.Unico neo camere(doppia)molto piccole ma ci si abitua alla svelta..molto adatto a giovani e coppie.prezzi buoni Noi(io e mio marito) siamo stati la settimana di natale2007...consigliamo vivamente! 
19123 un solo vantaggio si trova nella zona centrale di N.Y. 
19124 Great Location - GREAT LOCCATION Friendly Staff Definitely a great place for/with kids or family. Large two room accommodations. 
19125 This hotel was great! The beds are very comfortable and the location is perfect. The rooftop bar is extremely awesome! 
19126 QUESTO HOTEL SI TROVA IN POSIZIONE OTTIMA PER GIRARE LA CITTA' 
19127 LE PERSONE CHE CI LAVORANO SONO MOLTO DISPONIBILI. LE CAMERE SONO CONFORTEVOLI, IO ERO AL 17PIANO, DAL SILENZIO CHE C'ERA NON SEMBRAVA NEMMENO DI ESSERE A NEW YORK. 
19128 The hotel chandler is fantastically placed for your visit to New York. The hotel was clean and staff were really helpful. The only issue we had was a noisy air con unite which also did not work that we'll (at night room was over 80 degrees) 
19129 Eden Bernal at conceirge was very helpful and I really enjoyed my stay at the W in Chicago. The staff was very accomodating. 
19130 we had a great stay at this hotel. the room was modern and the kids loved it. great location at times square. 
19131 Unbelievable view of Manhattan to the north. No issues with noise (was on the 14th floor). Friendly helpful staff. Couple of issues with lamps handled quickly. Super convenient location to Soho and subways. Will defnintely stay there again. 
19132 10 out of 10 - The location is convenient, the rooms well appointed and the staff are very friendly. I would happily stay here again when next in NYC. 
19133 Otelin iyi olarak bahsedecegim tek seyi konumu. Ne kadar zorlarsam zorlayayim baska birsey bulamiyorum. Godugum aksakliklari yazmaya kalksam sayfalar tutar. Sadece sunu soyleyeyim tikali lavaboyu 4 gun boyunca actiramadim. 
19134 hotel perfetto ad un passo dall'empire state building,camere piccole ma ottimo come posizione e sopratutto come rapporto qualita' prezzo....internet gratis e receptionist che parla italiano!!!!in pieno centro a manhattan. 
19135 i love UWS, and this hotel got a prime location. nice and clean room. I stayed at on the ave several times this year. its always a pleasure staying there! 
19136 The hotel lacks elegance and style. The design and furnishings in hotel room are minimal and contemporary. The service is decent. The carpets in hallways are deplorable. Despite all of these negative aspects, the hotel is centrally located and the views from windows are hard to beat. 
19137 The bed was king and very comfy! The internet however was not working but that seems to be the problem in most nyc hotels, this is not the first hotel it has happened in. The service was decent but being nyc you can't expect too much kind and friendly service. 
19138 I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Westin. It was wonderful! Everyone at the hotel was very friendly and helpful. I have stayed at several area hotels and I can say I will stay at the Westin from now on. 
19139 Three of us stayed in Shelburne Murray Hill last week. Great hotel. Well located on Lexington Avenue with very helpful staff. Small comfortable suites which were good value. Would stay again. 
19140 Located in the garment district, well connected to the rest of the city thanks to the subway. a bit noisy due to its location (next to Madison Square Garden), but rather usual for a central location in a City nowadays. 
19141 the hotel is beautiful - we booked on Priceline and got a great rate. Our room was beautifully decorated and very comfortable. The location is good for a theatre weekend or exploring midtown - without the noise and hassles of staying in Times Square. Would definitely stay here again. 
19142 Great location for shopping and great Manhattan experience. 100 meters from Saks and close to many attractions. Short walk to Broadway shows. Hotel service excellent. Concierges were very helpful. Rooms clean and large. Will return nowhere else in NY. 
19143 Don't even consider this hotel. Yes it's well located, but it's worst than slepping on the street. It's durty. When someone above takes a shower it rains inside your room. I found a condom (used) when I arrived. This hotel must be a joke. 
19144 Stayed in room 2004 between 19/11 and 23/11. FANTASTIC view of times square! Priceless! Bar was way way over priced. Twice the price of the nearby celtic bar. Great central hotel. Mcdonalds just downstairs don't pay for the breakfast 
19145 Great rooms, great staff, great location!! Very clean and of course the very comfortable Hilton beds. Great breakfast service. Close to all the action in NYC. Macys, Tines Square, flower markets are within walking distance. I will be back to NYC and this will be my hotel of choice! 
19146 consiglio vivamente questo hotel, stanza doppia (2 letti a 1 piaz e 1/2) molto confortevole, posizione centrale, personale gentilissimo e disponibile 
19147 I hesitate to write a glowing review, because I want to keep this treasure to myself! This hotel is extremely clean, extremely comfortable, and very reasonably priced. The bathroom was large and had a nice soaking tub, perfect after walking NYC each day. 
19148 This is one of the best hotels that truly makes you feel welcome. The staff is great, warm and friendly. The food in the restaurant was very good. The rooms are nice with comfy beds. Definitely will stay again. 
19149 Great staff, but no amenities for the price. Liked the location, but the room was sub-par with paper thin windows that allowed for too much noise. Be prepared for less than you expected. 
19150 The location itself was great, the rooms were spacious but i must admit they smelled a little like mildew, not sure if that was just our room tho, so i will only minus one star for that, other than that the staff was super friendly and the location was great 
19151 Quite a wonderful experience. They never get tired for fulfilled our expectations. We will be back soon. 
19152 ottima posizione,centralissimo.ben curato e pulitissimo.stanze spazione.colazione continentale di buon livello,anche se con poca scelta.wi fi a pagamento in camera ma free nella living room. 
19153 Great location for a suite hotel. Easy walk to Michigan Avenue. Great for families over the holiday. A good alternative to a standard hotel room. The Hertz rental office is steps away at the Westin. 
19154 Good corporate rate. Clean rooms. Okay sized rooms. Free internet. Perfect for crashing at night - don't expect to spend much time in the building. Great midtown location. No soap or shampoo so stop by CVS. 
19155 In town for a wedding. Older hotel with very nice updates. The staff was friendly and helpful, check in was easy (hotel was accomodating for early check in since we were attending afternoon wedding) and the location was great - just off Michigan Avenue and the Miracle Mile. 
19156 The title pretty much sums everything up, we had a great time. 
19157 I had a great time here. VERY CLean and neat and safe. I really enjoyed staying there better than the Ramada New York that I stayed at last time. Loved the fridge and microwave in the room. Very quiet! Big room for NY. I will stay here again! 
19158 Just about the smallest room I've ever seen for a hotel. Apart from a decent location, was definitely not worth the 300$/night paid. You can find better, even in Manhattan... 
19159 All of the staff are very helpful and willing to serve, yet down-to-earth and not snooty. Chiran the Bellman from Nepal is the cream of the crop! If the third elevator was working (temporarily closed for renovation), I would give it 5 stars. 
19160 The Hotel was very nice, staff extremely helpful. Roof top pool was great drinks, snacks and service was on point!! I will be back soon!! 
19161 Outstanding and friendly service staff. They were attentive. Room was extermely comfortable. Meals at the resturant was delicious. 
19162 We spent a lovely week at the Manhattan Club; great location, comfortable, two bathrooms handy as a guest joined us. The complimentary afternoon tea upstairs was the perfect pick-me-upper for tired tourists! 
19163 I booked the Tower in NY Palace Hotel and it was the right choice.The best location,big room,nice breakfast in the lounge and excellent city view.A little bit old decor, but it is typical for all hotels in NY,but helpful staff and fresh flowers in lobby and you will enjoy. 
19164 A nice, clean Hilton Garden Inn in a great location across from Herald Square with very friendly staff. Rooms are nice, just be aware that if you are on a higher floor, you may wait a long time for one of the three small elevators. 
19165 My stay in Chicago was very enjoyable. The Intercontinental Hotel will be my first option anytime I return. The staff was very friendly and helpful making for an overall great experience! The location right on Michigan Avenue could not be more ideal for great food and shopping. 
19166 This is more like an upscale inn with really small rooms and narrow corridors and with the price you pay for the name Hilton, you would wanna pay a little more and upgrade to one of the many full service hotels nearby. 
19167 Room was really small, may be it is just NYC. It rained the day we were there, helpful staff provided us with umbrellas. Good location. 
19168 I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Room curtains were ripped and dirty. Cushion bed sheets had stains. Bathroom floor was dirty. The fitness center had outdated equipment. Hotel needs to be shut down and refurbished. The decoration is extremely dark. One positive, location is excellent, close to everything. 
19169 I highly recommend the InterContinental Barclay. Great Midtown location. Easy to get a cab and just 6 blocks from Grand Central. Outstanding service. Fantastic lobby restauant. Clean rooms. Gorgeous lobby. A very pleasant experience overall -- I look forward to future stays! 
19170 Staff was very helpful. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Internet was very slow. Allow plenty of time for valet to return your car, especially if you are picking it up at check out time. Great location on upper Eastside with everything you need. Subway station is about 10 blocks away. 
19171 Wonderful stay, evrthg perfect from check in to check out Outstanding staff, very very helpful, couldn't be better Soooo clean, comfortable and QUIET, yes incredible but true I could write a whole page abt it but to make it short I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL 
19172 Even though this is an older hotel its in a great location. The Hilton could use a remodel but everything is very clean and comfortable. It's very close to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Radio City Music, and even Times Square. 
19173 I stayed in this hotel 3 weeks and would return next time I'm in New York. It's a short walk from 5th avenue and had a nice sized room. The hotel restaurant does really good steaks and burgers. 
19174 fantastic hotel very easy to access everywhere right near subway very modern rooms small but lovely and clean very compact.would definately go back again no restaraunt but 2 right next door very friendly and prices good. 
19175 Ci sono recentemente tornata per la seconda volta. Le parti comuni sono molto belle,il personale tutto molto gentile e disponibile.La camera piccola,cosi' come il bagno,non molto accessoriato.Niente frigo bar,che stavolta avevo dimenticato di prenotare per tempo.Ottimo il rapporto qualita' prezzo grazie ad una fantastica offerta Expedia.La posizione davvero strategica! 
19176 Great location and staff looking out to help out at every step. A half block from Times Square, but noise was not a problem. The rooms are small but you are in New York and don't spend much time in the room. Walking distance ot all the major attractions. 
19177 Liked location, good staff. Fitness area small but clean. Rooms up high are nice, clean modern, and some with decent views. Room service also very good. Would go back if could get good price. Much better value than other hotels in the area. 
19178 Stayed here for a night on business. Good: location, room size. Bad: central air kept blasting heat all night, room was dingy and in need of a makeover, TV was from 1997. If priority is price and location, great. If you want a unique NY experience, I would probably pass. 
19179 Clean, quiet, centrally located, next to metro, food stores and restaurants right next to it, wall street a 20 mins walk from it, great free cookies and coffee downstairs, and very polite staff. Everything was nice, functioning, clean and comfortable in the room. Highly recommended. 
19180 Lovely place to stay whilst in New York if you want to stay in a luxury hotel. We stayed for a week and couldn't fault the place except for the service. Just make sure you check your bill... 
19181 Filthy bathroom, TV and air conditioning didn't work. Never saw a maid the entire 4 days we were there. Unfortunately we paid in advance and couldn't get a refund. 
19182 Stayed here a couple of months ago ,it is a very good hotel in a prime location ,lots of great bars and restaurants ..would highly recommend 
19183 Nice hotel....only thing to know about this hotel is that there is no complementary breakfast at all. Drive down the street and there is an Einstein's bagel place. 
19184 I've stayed at the London several time ove the past couple of years and this last time was really unpleasant. The heating in the room didn't work and it was an uncomfortable night. The billing department is very inefficient. These are two very basic, very bad things for a hotel. 
19185 I stayed here for two nights, and I enjoyed being there. The room was big and quiet, and very comfortable. The personnel in all areas was always very kind, and provided premium level service. Breakfasts are good and the facilities, superb. 
19186 The lobby looks good. full of people in long lines for check in or out. Freezing. Corridors and bedrooms are ancient, dark, smelly and kinda dirty. Pillows must be from1960s and covers too. For one night is just ok.. If more, run away fast 
19187 The hotel is a fine hotel to stay just remember the rooms are very small.The staff are helpfull and the hotel is clean,The tic toc dinner was fine.It is a attached to the hotel. 
19188 The hotel was great! Room, location, general quality, etc. Would return in a heartbeat!! 
19189 The entire experience was spectacular. I do not have a single complaint.... Other than the language barrier with the valet staff. We will definitely return! Felt so much like home... Except that we felt like royalty. 
19190 great hidden gem in NYC. close to rock plaza and times square. free breakfast is great while in the city! 
19191 We were treated fantastic from the beginning when we met Katelin (sp?) at the reception who was very professional, courteous, polite, friendly & respectful. Every morning at breakfast, we requested Daria who served us quickly, efficiently, kindly & with a smile. We look forward to returning!! 
19192 The rooms are small. Mine had dust all over the table. Hair on the bathroom floor. Rude restaurant staff downtairs. 
19193 Very friendly and attentive staff. Everyone from the front desk staff to the valet guys (Paul and Gynel) are always very friendly and helpful. It's tough to get around when you have a toddler but the staff knew how to anticipate our needs and was very helpful every time! 
19194 Nice , older hotel, great location, good buy. Clean rooms. Our King delux was quite spacious. The only complaint--we had to wait a very long time for the bell man to bring our luggage from storage. Otherwise, pleasant stay in a 4 star hotel. 
19195 loved everything about this hotel. for new york standards a great bargain.i think this hotel use to be an apartment building. nice size rooms.doorman was nice ,front desk clerk was nice. stayed at the murray hill east last month was disappointed in the service.east gate tower was great 
19196 Westin Hotel is a nice hotel with a great location. Easy walk to all theaters and area attractions. I would rate the room as average and far from luxurious but if you are looking for a simple room with a good location, this is definitely the way to go. 
19197 We stayed at the Belvedere for 5 days in Oct.'05. It was very clean and the staff was polite and helpful. The location is excellent. The rooms are average, however, the bathroom was small but very well decorated in all tile. We would stay at the Belvedere again. 
19198 Great location- near restaurants, museums, subway, parks, and shops! Older hotel with a lot of character---clean and comfortable. The bellman and the cleaning staff were very nice and helpful. No problems--Overall great stay! 
19199 The hotel is right on Michigan Ave. which is the main walking street in Chicago , very close walking distance to the Magnificent Mile 
19200 Walking distance from Union station and subway stations to Midawy Airport. Overall my stay was perfect. Highly recommended 
19201 Found the front desk staff to be extremely friendly, and helpful especially when referring me to area restaurants and attractions. The hotel is located in a busy part of town, and this information was great. Front Office Supervisor Aurelia was very helpful. 
19202 great location near columbus circle; small but cozy rooms with beautiful decor. beds are a little soft but not bad. 
19203 went on a trip to just get awayyy........ had not had a good week.. so i took a trip over to new york. And visited with my friend.; then she recomended this hotel. 
19204 This is the second time I have stayed in this location. The staff, service, location, and overall atmosphere was terrific! You cannot go wrong if you stay here! 
19205 Arriving 7 hours llate and missing a connection it did the job clean room but some what dated 
19206 I stayed at the Yotel for five nights and enjoyed it so much! The people were very friendly and my room was very clean! You must try out the Yobot. So funny! Perfect location, 5 min. walk from Times Sqaure. 
19207 Just a few blocks from Times Square, but very quiet. Very comfortable clean room. Room service was delivered quickly and the food was good. Very friendly staff. We will go back. 
19208 The hilton is OK. Don't expect any character or judgment on the part of the very rude staff. If you want to stay in a big, ugly impersonal modern hotel in NYC, for god;s sake stay at the Sheraton! 
19209 A nice hotel in a great location... One has to get used to the less than five star service in NewYork but this hotel functions pretty well. Rooms are nice ,but why charge for Internet access..we are in the 21st century for gods sake..... 
19210 I was in Lombardy from April 13 to April 22. In this time the hotel was perfect. All the staff is very friendly, helpful and I didnt have any trouble like the stay in September that I described here. 
19211 Marvellous location, you can walk everywere. Lots of restaurants around. The room is enormous (it is difficult to find this in NYC), the bathroom a luxury, very clean. The only negative rhing is that you need to pay for wifi in the room, but in the lobby is free. 
19212 Stayed there while visiting friends. Not pricy by NYC standards $239++ they have a super cute roof top deck. Restaurant was good as well. Rooms are small but well apointed. Overall I would stay there again. 
19213 My place was too small so opted to put them up for the half of week they came to visit. Well worth the choice that came from a friend in town. Bravo to everyone that made their stay awesome. I will send them there again when they visit 
19214 The hotel is a bit old, but the location was great (near plenty of shopping) and the service was excellent. I was able to get a low rate going right after New Year's so it was definitely a good value. I'd stay here again. 
19215 A small boutique hotel done right. Clean spacious and cookies and milk before bed a nice touch!!!located in downtown. And rooftop pool is a plus!!! A must if your going to houston!!check online for great specials. 
19216 Ideally located hotel near the theater district, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park, etc. Nicely appointed rooms. My only complaint is our room, while on the 18th floor, had absolutely no view. If you stay here, be sure to ask for an upper floor. 
19217 First class stay. All the staff was very helpful from resturant reservations to theater reservations. Oyr room was just perfect...no complaints at all. Can't wait for our next visit 
19218 Will stay here again next time I am in NYC. Very well located, one block from subway, many restaurants and other conveniences in neighborhood. Like modern decor, free wifi, business center. Only drawback is that the rooms are small, which is typical in NYC. Also reasonably quiet location. 
19219 the hotels was the in a great location only walking distance from the m&m store and in the heart of times square. but the rooms are so smal we slept in a one person bed. beware if you are claustrofobic. 
19220 One of my favorite hotels in NY City. Love it. Took my Wife there for her birthday and literally had a blast. So now through out the year she and I are looking for deals with this hotel so we can go back as much as possible. 
19221 a really nice and cosy place almost in the heart of the Manhattan 
19222 Kostas and jenny from Greece location is very good,2 blocks from the hotel is the subway and 15 minutes is empire building and times.the room was very comfortable nice and clean but little noisy at 4 floor.all the staff was very friendly special Mark at the front of desk staff 
19223 This place is all about the convenience of an excellent midtown location. Rooms are small but clean. My room seemed as if it had recently been update. I would consider this a 3 star hotel. 
19224 The hotel is very close to Times Square - so if you want to stay in that area and not spend too much it is OK. The place is old English style not recently renovated but clean. Rather anonymous (no surprise regarding the tourist crowds rolling through it) 
19225 Very clean. Great location, close to 2 subway stops! Right near the world trade center. A 5-10 minute walk to the Brooklyn Bridge. A 15 min subway to the major sights. Bed was very comfortable. 
19226 An all around solid hotel. Very friendly staff, perfect sized rooms, and prime location. Honestly, no complaints whatsoever. I would stay here again in a heartbeat if I was considering staying in the Times Square area. They were really great. 
19227 If you want to be waited on hand and foot for the entire time of your stay and have the staff make sure that everything is perfect than this is the hotel for you. Make a point of staying the extra night, you wont be disappointed. 
19228 An older hotel but very pleasant, rooms are nice size and the staff is very good. Located just a few blocks from Times Square with plenty of very good restaurants along the way and in the surrounding area. 
19229 Situering hotel is uitstekend, echter onpersoonlijke, gedateerde uitstraling. Het gaat hier, denk ik, allemaal erg gemakkelijk waardoor nonchalance of desinteresse in de service is geslopen. Interieur gedateerd, jaren 50, met alleen een likje verf. 
19230 I really love the Yotel for value, service, vibe, room and location. 
19231 Hello I stayed in the hotel in and I didnot like there the lady in the reception are rude the room in the tower is smelly there is no choices in the food in room services they have abood Michelin star hotel it was good The location is good 
19232 As a frequent traveler (every week), I found this hotel to be exceptional. The location is great. The staff was wonderful, great attention to details and made us feel special. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again! Thanks for a great birthday trip! 
19233 I stayed here back in November 2004. Service was great as I was greeted immediately by bellstaff from my taxi and the desk person greeted me with a great smile. I had a great room overfacing the Chicago River. Will stay here verytime I go to Chicago. 
19234 Very nice hotel. I have no complaints. I reserved my room through Priceline for $58 a night plus taxes of $16.29 for a total of $74.29. The parking garage was about $9 a night. For that price, I'll always stay at the Omni. 
19235 The rooms are small yet clean and comfortable with free wifi. fitness center is decent. Staff is friendly. Next to Starbucks and many restaurants. A short walk to Michigan avenue. CTA rail is around the corner. 
19236 The situation of the hotel is perfect for a visit to NY. The breakfast is one of the best we ever had in the US 
19237 we were very suprised at the quality of the room and services for the cost that we paid. it was a good central location for everything we did in houston. It had one of best free breakfast at any place we stayed. Service was very good also 
19238 Great location, concierge lounge is nice, linens are good. Rooms are WAY too small, it's a little tired. 
19239 Good location only a few blocks from Penn Station. Comfortable hotel with very helpful desk staff. Quiet, clean, nice room for NYC 
19240 This is a great hotel. The rooms are big, the service is exquisite. The breakfast is great (but not included). If you go in summertime make sure you always wear a jacket in the Lobby because the A/C is very cold! 
19241 Few blocks from Fulton subway station. Really clean, safe place. Nice hot breakfast. Staff was excellent. I read one review about the slow elevator and thought how bad could that be, but it really was slow! I definitely would stay there again. 
19242 This hotel is located in the Loop and perfect location for business travelers. The hotel is very modern and lively, one of the best city hotels I have stayed in around the world. It lives by the W brand. 
19243 The Hotel is perfectly located. Walking distance from Empire State Building. The Hotel is CLEAN and the Staff is friendly For the price I can't think of anything better than this deal in the city. Has free wi-fi !! 
19244 overall beautifull hotel getting back on their feet,and who dosent love a comeback! like any place there are ups and downs but the plaza has more up's than their downs. i reconmend it to any one who has wanted to see new york with a bit of style. 
19245 Tis hotel has an excellent location right behind Times Square and near many theaters, museums, bars and restaurants. Being in a very touristic district the type of all eateries and bars is less typical and more commercial.The rooms are surprisingly small! 
19246 Great Location. Excellent service. Wine and Cheese in the evenings was a very nice touch. Free breakfast was very nice quality with a good selection. Rooms a tad small, but honestly did not spend a lot of time in the room. 
19247 Stayed here on business end of January. Room are small, shower was cold. Room lay out was odd. Not a fan of the decor. It was clean and the staff were friendly. 
19248 The room was definitely not as advertised. When we asked to move to another room, we were advised that it would cost an additional $50.00 per night for a similar room. The staff was incredibly rude. 
19249 its a great experience, rates are fine, very class and neat rooms. good service. provided good information about city and tourist places, very comfortable beds. prime location and very near to shopping. excellent room service, very good breakfast and food. 
19250 The Hotel was centrally located. The accomodations were fine. Small room, but walking distance to all attractions... 
19251 This was my second visit to this hotel. Our stay was as great this time as it was the last. In the quieter Murray Hill area, the Affinia Shelburne offers lovely, comfortable, spacious rooms. Their staff could not be nicer, or more helpful. I will stay here again! 
19252 All round very good value for money. Quiet location but very central. Well furnished, clean rooms, Friendly and helpful staff. 
19253 The Edison is always a good dependable hotel offering clean rooms, service with a smile, good cafe, and a fantastic location in the heart of the theatre district. Always a winner! 
19254 we stayed at the penn it was okay you get what you pay for some of the reviews on here are a bit over the top.. central to manhattan on seventh ave no problems at all for us if you are going to the penn judge it for yourself... 
19255 2 blocks to Koreatown; adjacent to Starbucks on the ground floor; free Wi-Fi; long and thin building layout; no lobby; Philosophy toiletries; room views are largely blocked by neighboring high-rises; within walking distance to subway systems (especially 4, 6, B, D, F, & M trains). 
19256 From my hotel window, I see the buses of the Port Authority Bus Terminal on 9th Avenue. Times Square isn't close, but if I walk by five or six Adult DVD shops, two massage parlors, and a peep show booth, I think I'll get eventually get there. 
19257 nice room, very convenient to find from freeway, wonderful breakfast 
19258 Enjoyed our stay very much. Would definitely stay there again when we go through that area. 
19259 the hotel was a great stay... ideal location and ideal service. Enisa Radhci was a wonderful and helpful associate and it was a real joy dealing with her. would definitely come back 
19260 Da provare assolutamente! Non lo apprezzi sufficientemente quando ci soggiorni!!! Ma poi ti manca! 
19261 Great hotel. Good location and good price. I will be staying here again. The rooms are a good size the NYC. I didn't eat in the hotel, only used the concierge to book some theatre tickets and he was very helpful. 
19262 Hotel perfetto, a meta' strada fra Central Park e Times Square, tenuto molto bene, pulito e le camere sono abbastanza spaziose per lo standard di New York, Bagno in camera e noi avevamo anche forno a microonde e frigo che con una bimba piccola e' stato utilissimo. 
19263 Hotel has no parking & the breakfast servers are disrespectful. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone 
19264 Gediegenes Hotel in zentraler Lage 
19265 Excellent hotel, friendly staff, roomy, clean and on a top location close to subway and bus stops to all parts of Manhattan. Shops and places to eat and drink at walking distance. Very nice neighborhood for strolling around. Will definitely return. 
19266 Professional staff provided a quality business stay in Manhattan. Well located, very comfortable room, quality dining ... Fashion 26 is a hotel which I will definitely return. Affordably priced, it's worth a look. 
19267 The hotel is great - excellent location, very convenient. The rooms were clean and nicely decorated. The staff was excellent and very accomodating. I had a great time and can't wait to go back! 
19268 This is a memorial, outstanding hotel. Its lobby is beautiful. The hotel strikes a perfect balance mixing the current liveliness of New York City with historical elegance. 
19269 Great boutique style hotel. Rooms were nice size for NYC. Bathrooms large, marble, with awesome shower. Very clean. Very convenient walk to/from Penn Station. Stayed one night for Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Very good location. 
19270 I can't say enough about this hotel. The beds are amazing, the suites give plenty of space. But the best thing about this place is the staff. We asked for so many things and they always accommodated. Can't wait to go back to Houston. 
19271 El hotel esta en un lugar muy xulo, delante del Madison Square... y cerca de todo, es muy bonito, es un poco antiguo y nuestra habitacion estaba un poco echa polvo, pero si no soys muy maniaticos en ese sentido el tema de donde esta situado es excelente 
19272 Just returned from our second stay at the Affinia Manhattan. Was just as we remembered, or better! Great comfy beds and pillows, very useful kitchen, great staff, etc etc, could go on and on. Go stay there it's great! We are looking forward to our third stay. 
19273 Have been using the Comfort Inn Manhattan for Shopping Trips from the UK since 1995. What can I say Great Location, excellent Staff that make you very welcome. Feel very much at home at the Comfort Inn 
19274 Romantic, funky hotel. Lots to do in the neighborhood, or a 15 minute walk to the river or Greektown. Staff was helpful 
19275 A very good, small hotel far away from the insanity of Times Square...yet close enough via subway, if that's what floats your boat. Love Soho and the Village...so this is a great spot for us. Rooms are small (standard NYC) as are public spaces in the hotel. Recommended... 
19276 Een perfect hotel qua ligging. Direct om de hoek van Times square, midden in het theatre district. Prima uitvalsbasis om de stad te ontdekken. Het hotel is modern ingericht en de kamer was zeer comfortabel en schoon. Ook het personeel was erg vriendelijk. Kortom een echte aanrader. 
19277 The Chambers is a quiet, modern well-kept hotel in a great location. Their staff was eager to please and while the room was tight, it was more than adequate--stylish, really. For a pleasure trip to Nyc--close to MOMA, Central Park, and shopping --it's a find. 
19278 It is the best New-York-City-hotel we stayed so far. Large room, very good beds, stylish location, great service, beautifull rooftop-bar. We will come back. 
19279 Simpatia geral, organizacao e limpeza. ... 
19280 Todo bien , me gusto mucho el Hotel 
19281 Lo unico malo es que pague por una habitacion con vista al Central Park , y me dieron una habitacion con vista contraria 
19282 No es lo que me ofrecieron , ni es lo que yo pague 
19283 Ascensores MUY LENTOS 
19284 The hotel was clean, well staffed and friendly. The check-in was quick and painless and Lorenzo went above and beyond for us. The beds were comfortable and the showers were fantastic. I highly recommend the Paramount to anyone staying in the Times Square area. 
19285 Everything was perfect The only downside is we had 4 drinks at the bar and it was 96 plus tip. There were no prices on the specialty drinks but we never expected it to be so outrageous. That aside we would definitely stay again! 
19286 Absolutely great hotel, and very friendly and attentive staff. Good sized rooms, and the bath tub really does fill in 60 seconds lol. The table for room service thing was great, and all the bottles of water we asked for came in a tray with a flower. 
19287 paid upfront in february for 2 rooms (too many kids for one room) in july. 2 hours to check in, to be given 2 rooms 5 floors apart. 30 min wait to access safe deposit box in reception. cheap but not cheerful 
19288 Today I am wrapping up an amazing NY new year experience. One week after spending Christmas Day in Manhattan, its amazing to return and get the same great service at Hilton Garden Inn while being able to cross the street and do business, shopping and dining. 
19289 People were very friendly and helpful, good location, cant wait to go back !! 
19290 We got a very good deal, comparing to others hotels in the same standarts. The location was very convenient, they have complimentary wine happy hour every day and coffee and tea in the morning. For us was perfect. Clean and good space in the room, nice bed and shower. 
19291 +Nice room +Helpful employees (except one sullen male) +Good location (close to SOHO-restaurants and Broadway-shopping) +Free internet with printer in lobby -Loud air conditioning going on and off(impossible to turn of completely) -Poor breakfast served on paper tellers 
19292 Perfect Location. Very close to the time squares and the business area. And it's very easy to get to the public transportation. Price is fair, much lower than other hotels in this area. But the room is very small and old. 
19293 I had the oportunity to stay four very confortable days with you. I want to come back with my wife as soon as posible. Really thanks 
19294 We had a another great get away with Hilton which has been my choice for many years. This place was very nice and enjoyed the room upgrade and as always the good treatment from the staff. 
19295 Great service, everyone was extremely friendly!! The room was perfect for two people. It was very clean and it served its purpose (bed and bathroom) The location was great. It was in a quiet corner and close to everything! 
19296 Localisation ideale dans un endroit calme pour une ville comme NY mais a la fois proche des boutiques de Soho et des petits resto de Greenwich. Chambres agreables, propres d une taille bien suffisante pour un sejour loisir. 
19297 The room was incredibly comfortable. There was a lot of room so it felt more like a studio apartment than a hotel room. The staff was very helpful. They gave an excellent dinner recomendation and were just overall so nice and friendly. 
19298 Nice Motel, clean and friendly staff. Not in the best area, but not bad either. The first night we stayed there was some guests in an up stairs room who were loud and roudy. As far as I know the hotel staff took care of it. 
19299 la chambre comporte un coin cuisine avec frigo,les chambres sont grandes soit en rc, au 1 er ou 2 etage,av ascenseur,mais il n y a pas d animation ds les environs. 
19300 een heel leuk en goed hotel met heel vriendelijk personeel. Ook zeer behulpzaam. Mooie en schone kamers, met computer. heerlijk om voor een city trip naar New York te slapen. Alles is op loop afstand en de metro is vlakbij. 
19301 Our stay at the Affinia was excellent! the check in was great and easy. The room was a huge room for the two of us. Staff was very accommodating and the location was great. We booked through Travelzoo for Valentine's Day and only paid $169. 
19302 Our family recently visited this Hotel only to be Very disapointed, it was dirty, the room we had was Filthy & hotel staff very rude 
19303 We stayed here for 1 night and enjoyed everything about the hotel. The staff were very friendly and helpful, room was perfect - modern decor. Location was within walking distance to SOHO, Greenwich Village, NYU. Great restaurants and bars. Short cab ride uptown. 
19304 Nice hotel located on the magnificent mile, downtown Chicago. we stayed there for 2 days and our stay was pretty good. Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are clean and well kept. Location is just perfect! I recommend this hotel to travelers. 
19305 We were very pleased with our stay here. We stayed for 5 nights and found the staff very helpful. The noise wasn't a problem as the double glazing worked (room 706) We even got a good deal on a taxi to Newark Airport,way cheaper than the yello cabs. 
19306 Hotel was in a great location, and was the most reasonable price for a nice, clean, mid-level hotel we could find. Room was very clean, staff was friendly. The West End Grill at 8th and 49th is a great nearby cozy restaurant. 
19307 We had a room on an upper floor. The hotel and room was clean and quiet. Great location if you want to be close to Times Square. Subway steps away. Good value. Would stay here again. 
19308 Everything you would hope for. Very relaxing. Street noise is only drawback, so ask for an upper floor. 
19309 Tirando que minha reserva foi feita no quinto andar que se destina a fumantes tudo muito bom, principalmente a equipe e o manobrista de nome Dwayne que e uma figura excepcional !!! 
19310 Great location for us - just off the Times Square bustle and with in a 30 minute walk of the Met/Central Park. Minutes to David Letterman and the Rockefller Center, etc 
19311 Great hotel for business. Good location. Great lobby and lounge. Ordinary sized room, small as all in the city. Room service was wonderful. Great choice. 
19312 I stay at this hotel from time to time and find everyone genuinely wishes one to have a great stay. I must give Scott Calderon, Reservations Manager, a special thank you for making my stay truly wonderful each and every time. Kudos! 
19313 Great rooms b/c they were so quiet. HVAC hardly notices but effective in temperature control. Desk clerk gave me free breakfast passes b/c I had to wait to check in (about 2 min). 
19314 Great location, wounderfull service and nice and clean rooms. 
19315 We were upgraded to a spacious, corner room with sweeping views of Times Square. The hotel's staff was excellent, and the hotel exceed our expectations. 
19316 Nothing is very special about the hotel. Well worth its four stars. Room on 25th floor was absolutely quiet and very spacious. We needed a separate bed and the staff provided it free of charge. 
19317 We loved the hotel, the localization is fantastic, you can walk to everywhere, there's a subway station very near. The room is nice and clean. it's not so big, but have enough space for a couple and his luggage. I would definitely return on our next NY visit. 
19318 Stayed here for a long weekend. Chose the hotel for its location and on the back of reviews from other users. It lived up to expectations and I would be very happy to stay here again in the future. 
19319 Don't let the public spaces fool you; the rooms are a joke. Even an upgraded room was way too small for comfort and lacking in amenities. The poorly designed bathroom was all about looks over function--it failed on both counts. Do yourself a favor and stay elsewhere. 
19320 The hotel is clean, has smaller rooms, small fitness center, and kind workers answer any question. 5 minute or less walk to the subway. 
19321 Ne merite aucun commentaire! J y suis pour une semaine mais j ai reellement envie de changer d hotel je n ose meme pas dormir et manque de pot si j annule je perd tout! Hotel a eviter sincerement 
19322 Off the beaten track in midtown, but well worth the money. Room is modern with all needed conveniences. Very professional and helpful staff Outstanding effort to please by hotel manager 
19323 Siamo stato dal 14 marzo al 19 marzo 2012 con tutta la famiglia,camera al 16 piano carina e pulita. Personale gentilissimo e cortese,colazione abbondante e molto varia.cosa chiedere di piu'............ve lo consigliamo. Posizione vicino alla metropolitana la mia prossima tappa a new york sara' in questo albergo. 
19324 Everything was great. Will definitely stay here again. 
19325 buenas habitaciones, amplias, desayuno para salir del paso y luego desayunar en condiciones 
19326 Outdated can be cozy, but dirt and filth are unacceptable. Don't waste your money here there are hotels in the area around the same rate that are far more accommodating, and most certainly clean. 
19327 Stayed here with my 18 year old daughter and was delighted with the location of this hotel. Clean rooms with helpful staff and provided a good breakfast to start the day. Would definitely use this hotel again. 
19328 Contemporary and nice. For NYC - big rooms - easy access to Times Square and excellent "cheaper" places to eat nearby. I would recommend. 
19329 Great hotel, very comfortable bed, clean, great customer service. Hotel is easy walking distance to restaurants, Times Square, theaters, hop on/hop off tour bus. Would definitely stay here again. 
19330 Hotel is voor Manhattan fantastisch, goed bereikbaar en centraal gelegen. de 5.7 beoordeling vind ik veel te laag. Wij gaan graag voor een waardering van 7.5 deze beoordeling geldt tevens voor boeking 16694534624....25/05-28/05. 
19331 Excellent hotel, friendly staff, large rooms, clean, modern, perfect location. We'll stay there again next year, you get so much hotel for the price you pay. 
19332 I arrived yesterday May 1st and leaving tomorrow may 3rd. This morning I try to explain to the receptionist at the front desk about the problem and she told me: "nothing that we can do, we are full". I did not expect this problem at the hotel 
19333 one of the better hotels in New York City. Convenient, comfortable, wonderful staff, very helpful. I have stayed in many Manhattan Hotels, I would recommend The Fitzpatrick to anyone, new visitors to Manhattan or return travelers 
19334 from the moment the cab stopped at the front door I felt like a valued guest. I stayed at the Warwick in 1992 and it was every bit as good this time round. Comfortable, spacious, charming, good location, friendly staff and great amenities. 
19335 Fabulous location, nice room, comfortable beds, very clean, friendly and helpful staff. 
19336 Clean room, good location, great kitchen area with refrigerator no noise problem. Felt we had a great value in safe area close to everything. Nice staff. No complaints 
19337 Check-in was fast, friendly and early. Room was comfy and clean. Folks in the front were very helpful. Cool water and apples in lobby were delightful. I'll be back. 
19338 I had a great experience at this hotel. The service was great and if I travel to New York again I would book this hotel. Great location, and real good coffee shop on the side. I went there every morning. 
19339 this is by far the BEST hotel I have ben too..a lot of famous peoplego here too..everything about it says *******!!! 
19340 Wellington was een geweldig hotel om te verblijven tijdens onze trip naar New York. Schone mooie kamer, ligging ideaal , lekkere bedden , prima douche. Vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. Kan het iedereen aan bevelen! 
19341 Loved the location of this hotel to Times Square, 5th Ave, and Central Park. Hotel rooms are showing signs of wear but we liked the dining options within the hotel and the value of the Junior Suite vs. other hotels in the city for a room the same size. 
19342 Un hotel sucio y con un servicio pesimo Ademas me cargaron la tarjeta de credito 3 veces por el valor total y no he logrado que me devuelvan mi dinero..............que horror No pense que me estafaran en un hotel en NYC 
19343 Terrific people at check in & out. Bigger than average rooms, very well done. Great bed, lots of pillows. Free drink at roof top bar. Very good restaurant. All in all my first choice in NYC. I'll be back! 
19344 This is a great location and very clean for the price. 
19345 Not a typical JW Marriott. Lacks the JW great amenities and service. Great location - across the street from Galleria Mall. 
19346 Microscopic room with even more microscopic bathroom, you need to shower sideways. Overpriced and overrated, this is not a 4 star hotel. It needs maintenance in elevators, carpets and walls. However, service is extraordinary from doorman to front desk. Location is unbeatable, just a few steps from Times Square. 
19347 We stayed here at the end of September, the hotel is in a good location and seemingly clean although we both got a lot of bed bug bites! 
19348 We absolutely loved the room, the lounge and the service. 24 hour snacks , wine in the afternoon and a decent breakfast pleased us all. 
19349 Loved everything about it. Perfect midtown location with lots of conveniences just outside the hotel. However, never wanted to leave between the Gravity gym, room service, and cozy room. Spa set-up could benefit from upgrade/expansion and pool area is rather plain, otherwise the hotel has everything one could want. 
19350 El hotel esta superubicado, a cuadras de time square, a unos pasos de la 5ta ave. y siguiendo por esta se puede caminar unos 15 minutos para llegar a central park. La habitacion que usamos estaba super diminuta, pero creo que asi es todo Manhatan 
19351 it's not a bad hotel and it's also cheap for newyork and chelsea area. it is located near chelsea pear and the room had a great view of the park. staff was very help full and i won't mine going their again. for their price it wasn't bad at all. 
19352 Stayed from 7/29/07-7/31/07.....the staff was friendly......and rooms where good size....great location walking distance to Times Square and Madison Avenue....and Rockefeller Center......Found great cheap Soveneir shop on 32nd and 5th...you have to check out..... 
19353 My husband and I first discovered Hotel 17 a few years ago. Since then we have stayed here several times--excellent location, clean rooms and bath, very helpful staff. Staying there makes us feel like part of the neighborhood when we return. 
19354 Yvonne, the Asst. General Mgr., set a high bar for professionalism and her entire staff lived up to it. From front desk to drivers to bartenders and housekeeping, they all smiled and actively served guests. 
19355 Claudio da Roma. Ragazzi e' perfetto centralissimo datato ma comodissimo approfittate della colazione abbondante e varia a soli 4$ se possibile scegliete i piani alti perche' la 57th e' un po' rumorosa come il condizionatore in camera ma e' davvero poca cosa in confronto a tutto il resto.buona vacanza. 
19356 Very noisy hotel from traffic, and hundred machines, air ac, vents, pumps, etc from hotel and others buildings nearby. No properly maintained. Cheaply updated. Not clean. The front desk is another galaxy experience. For the same price you have many better hotels in NY 
19357 This was our third year at the Waldorf=Astoria on the occasion of our niece's birthday.Although the hotel is over the top pricey...you get what you pay for. The staff in the hotel continues to be both professional and helpful and are always there to serve their guests. 
19358 Better than what I'm used to. Came over from Glasgow after a lot of walking. Arrived 13th July 2005. Thought the standards were pretty high - better then my midden back home! Had a wee machine in the room for pressing your crimpoline. Would recomend it to all my brothers. 
19359 Subways are nearby Walking distance to fifth ave n central park 
19360 Close to a lot of attractions, comfy room, would stay again. Employees were helpful. The price was the cheapest compared to other hotels in that area. Hotel is old, but remodeled. Beds were very comfortable Would recommend to a friend 
19361 This was a very impressive hotel. As a SPG Gold member, I was afforded very luxurious accommodations and treated like a queen from the time that I arrived at the front entrance until I left the hotel. 
19362 Culture, art and history all in one place! Largest room I had in NY, great service, close to Seaport, SOHO, TRIBECA, East Village and Greenwich Village, i walked everywhere. I recommed it highly. 
19363 The location of the hotel is amazing. It is right in Times Square. The room could have been a little bigger, but the king-size bed was outstanding. 
19364 posizione favorevolisssssima! buon trattamento e personale italiano ( non che sia un problema) 
19365 Very close to the Loop. Furniture is a bit dated, but comfortable. Great free wireless internet in rooms. Very nice Thai restaurant in the house, or a cheapy fast food place with friendly staff. 
19366 There's not much to be said about this place - which is probably why I haven't reviewed it until now, even having stayed there multiple times. It's your standard business/tourist hotel in midtown Manhattan - comfy rooms, very crowded lobby, not much character. 
19367 You get what you pay for. On arrival we were given a grim room on 6th floor. We asked for a change and were then offered a refurbished room on 2nd floor, much nicer. If you need extras, just ask. Night staff not most obliging, day staff much friendlier 
19368 Customer service is very good and coffee shop in house is very convenient. Location is excellent, close to grand central and walking distance from times square and other attractions. Rooms feel old but with relatively new furniture. 
19369 Stayed for 5 nights and The Hotel is located in one of the best places in manhattan, all you need is close, subways, stores, restaurants, night clubs. Great value for a NYC hotel. The Atention was great. It's an old building with confortable small rooms The 
19370 Wonderful hotel, nicely located, well-apportioned rooms and easy check-in, etc. Absolutely would stay here again. The only negative is the onsite restaurant isn't very good, but that's not a major problem when there are so many places to eat within easy walking distance 
19371 An old-fashion hotel, in a good location the room wasn't good cleaned; the sheets were dirty when we arrived and we have to ask to change them A little bit noisy very early in the morning ( we were close to the door of the cooridor) 
19372 Beautiful hotel. Great location to Times Square and to everything else with a subway just around the corner. 
19373 I went with my sisters and nieces and had a great time here...breakfast is pricey and not really worth it...but the rest of it was excellent 
19374 had a wonderful stay! the employees were very friendly and helpful. our room was clean and comfortable! also, our room was more spacious than expected considering the rate that we paid. will definately stay here again! 
19375 I would like to thank Shana and angela. They where very helpful and friendly. That helps make for a pleasant hotel experience. Thanks 
19376 The hotel is very near Times Square, what make it noisy on the week end. The staff was very good and could help me in every request that we had. I definitely recommend this hotel and we will definitely going back soon. 
19377 Lovely staff especially the concierge guys- very helpful. Room was nice and quiet and in super location- no frills but good value for money. Breakfast in morning was added bonus.Would stay again however would call in advance to check room as ours had tiny window only. 
19378 Super clean. Super comfortable. Super location. Super staff. Always predictable. Free wifi. What else could you want in any hotel? 
19379 - posizione strategica; - hotel nuovo; - personale molto cortese. Unici nei; 1) il centro massaggi (molto caro e con personale poco preparato) 2) il ristorante (camerieri poco cortesi) Tutto sommato, il prezzo vale un soggiorno. 
19380 It was a small but nice and clean room. The only thing I didn't like was our room looked right into some offices and never got any sun light because of the surrounding buildings. The location was great though, really close to all the attractions. Also great staff! 
19381 vast hotel in real need of modernisation. Meeting rooms were bizarre and dinner was disappointing 
19382 The hotel is in a very nice location and we found the staff very helpful and friendly. The rooms are very small but clean and well equipped. 
19383 I've stayed at many hotels doing what i do, but the crowne plaza was hands down the best service, most luxurious, most comfortable, and the best sleep i have gotten in a long time!!! Thank you Crowne plaza for a very very memorable stay!!! Till next time Ben Chaisson 
19384 This brand new hotel in the Meatpacking District is stylish and trendy. Madonna was there the night before I stayed there, and they have wonderful roomy sofa's. 
19385 I love the W. To all the reviewers who say the bamboo blinds let too much sun in check behind them. There are sun shades that completly block out the sun. The hotel is clean and the beds are the best. 
19386 Great - small rooms - love this location. Overall quality is fantastic! 
19387 We had a fantastic stay at the New York Palace Hotel. The staff was very friendly, competent and helpfull. The hotel room was very clean and with good appliances. The location is very central and the whole up-town New York is in walking distance. 
19388 This is the best kept secret in New York City: terrific location, exceptional staff, nicely appointed rooms, good restaurant and excellent value. I will certainly return here and would recommend it highly to those looking for quality at a great value. 
19389 Beautiful Lobby, location is wonderful. Rooms were dirty, beds were horrible, I kept waiting for the springs to poke through the padding. Paint was peeling off the walls. Room next door, under the bathtub the floor was squishy 
19390 I love this hotel very nice and the all of the staff are very friendly, very quiet area, there are some nice place to dine, its also very close to Trump world bar in NYC and 2nd ave, nice gym to work out 
19391 Super bien ubicado, sobre la 7th avenue con una entrada al subway justo al lado, las habitaciones muy limpias y la cama bastante comoda y el staff del hotel siempre ha sido amable todas las veces que nos hemos quedado (3) 
19392 Negatives: Uncomfortable bed Very noisy air con No breakfast Slow internet connection Positives: Great location New and modern Cheapest around Roof terrace has amazing views Free wi-fi Nice staff We enjoyed our stay. For three nights, good enough I would say. Bunk beds are cool, though matress is terrible. 
19393 Trendy and clean rooms all renovated, great bathroom. Lot's of details. For instance they give you Kiehl's shampoo. The location is superb: Across Columbus circle, right across Central Park y the upper west. We found a great deal by booking using Quickbook. Great value! 
19394 Camera spaziosa e pulita, servizio gentile e preciso, posizione comodissima. Costo ottimo per New York. Hotel un po' vecchiotto ma per queste cifre non si puo' pretendere un albergo alla moda! Base di partenza ideale per visitare tutte le principali attrazioni, visto anche la vicinanza alla metro. 
19395 stayed here from the 20th to 27th nov 2004, couldnt fault it, huge bedroom with kitchen, everything clean, great view of 7th ave from bedroom window , central position for empire state building, times square & madison square garden. didnt want to leave....enjoy your holiday as much as we did... 
19396 Consider the rate together with it's location, it is value for money. It's clean and modern. And it has a nice and comfortable lobby area, in which I had couple sync-up meetings with business associates. Breakfast area is big and clean as well, it started my days pretty well. 
19397 We loved this hotel. Great location just off of Times Square. The staff was very friendly. The room was a perfect size. The bathroom was bigger than most NYC hotels. Great restaurants on the same street. We'll come back. 
19398 Stayed at this hotel for a week in march there is not much around but it is only a short walk from Times square and 34th street.Rooms where nice,clean and comfortable Tony the door man was really nice and helpful would stay here again if on a budget. 
19399 Great value compact room with all mod cons & super clean. Great for solo traveler and location is ideal between midtown and hells kitchen. Only fault was getting some washing done. $150! For 8 items!!!! 
19400 I've stayed here repeatedly and everything is always clean and in order. Very convenient to the airport and staff is helpful. 
19401 My sister and I stayed here last month because of the positive reviews. We weren't disappointed. Great location, room was large, clean and quet., had a fridge and microwave. Also had 2 large closets! Would definitely stay here again. 
19402 big enough room (For nyc standards), comfortable bed, friendly staff, good location if you like the downtown area- right near the subway which is a plus. Clean! 
19403 The location is great. The rod are very plain. The space is nice but the furnishings feel cheap and very uninspired. I'd stay here again on business but would advise against any special occasion stays. 
19404 Only stayed one night but got upgraded to a suite. Really nice hotel, central and has all the amenities one requires. Pity the bathroom only had a bath/shower....hate that but otherwise I would stay here agin no problem. 
19405 Rooms are huge for NYC. Rooftop bar is spacious with amazing views. Be sure to meet Nandi at the front desk. She is pleasant, engaging, and patient! The staff, in general, is great but Nandi definitely goes above and beyond! 
19406 Very clean hotel and good location in Murray Hill. Nearest subway two blocks away. Rooms quite small. Friendly staff. We had shared bathroom which were however almost always free. Ask for upper floor room to qet more spacious views. 
19407 Everything very good. Not luxury, but comfortable and help fine. We adore the location. Enjoy 
19408 The manager David( not sure of surname) was very unhelpful, obnoxoius and unpleasant to his staff. The rooms were very small for 4 people but were clean, rest of the staff were very nice, especially Ralph, Alan & Vanessa 
19409 Pros: hotel is in a great location for downtown, friendly staff, soft sheets Cons: Old tube Televisions are clunky and outdated, water faucet in bathroom was about to fall off. place is very dusty 
19410 centraal gelegen, vriendelijke en behulpzame staf, kleinere maar degelijke en propere kamers 
19411 Servicen var kanske inte den mest engagerade jag stott pa, men for priset var det helt ok. Ligger lite vid sidan om, inget kul rakt utanfor dorren, men om du ar beredd pa det och far ett rum med utsikt ar det har hotellet vart pengarna. 
19412 Courteous helpful staff. Robert Brooks, the concierge, was invaluable in answering all kinds of questions. He is a rock star! 
19413 Great and friendly stuff. Clean rooms and clean public areas. Li Tang was very helpfull and very friendly. Great location for sightseeing!! Close to everything! We def. will be back 
19414 Beautiful rooms with the most comfortable mattress I've slept on in forever! Luxurious bathroom, exellent staff. I highly recommend this hotel and would most certainly stay there again! 
19415 Hotel sulla 7th avenue, davanti il madison square garden, a due passi dalla 5 th avenue, empire state building. Il personale gentile, la pulizia della camere avveniva giornalmente, il bagno era spazioso e pulito. La fermata della metro era a 5 metri dall'albergo. Comodo per chiunque :) 
19416 Had room on smoking floor- No bed bugs. Room was clean. Accommodations were very cramped, but sufficient. Cafe on premises not run by Holiday Inn, but excellent prices, good service, clean. Front desk and lobby personnel very friendly and helpful. Within walking distance of Penn Station and 34th Street shops. 
19417 An excellent hotel....have stayed here many times....great location, excellent service.....very comfortable rooms...concierge level service excellent...Shula's restaurant very good (expensive)......received late check-out which was very helpfu....will return again! 
19418 Booked this last minute for a concert at the Nokia and got GREAT rates. Nothing fancy but clean, convenient to subway and Midtown and all our stuff was safe. Free internet stores and stands close by, no complaints. 
19419 This property is new and immaculate. Very much enjoyed the stay and would recommend for individuals, families, business or pleasure. Great location - great amenities - overal - GREAT! 
19420 It is an old hotel, but kept clean and safe. It is in the heart of Times Square and at a very reasonable rate. 
19421 Repeat customer. Always a good experience. Excellent cocktails at the bar. Good food. Private access to Grammercy Park 
19422 This is a great hotel in a great location for NYC visitors - family friendly and so helpful. Walking distance from the heart of the city and all the sights. It was worth staying there just to meet Matthew - the hardest working concierge in town. A great hotel! 
19423 loved this place - super location, super service and really cool! We just stayed for two nights and got an amazing deal! 
19424 This hotel is in a great spot.Near sights + theatres. Reception staff are excellent. restaurant is a pain. Expensive + pushy staff. Breakfast is awful. Go to nearby 9th ave for great breakfasts + evening meals. 
19425 Normally I'm not too fond of very modern style, but hotel very good looking, sparing Zen-ish design, good attention to all features. Good shower and tub, wifi works fine, location is great. I'll be staying there again, will be a regular for lower Manhattan trips. 
19426 Fairly large room (we had a suite with separate bedroom). Beds were comfortable -- although we had to switch room because of a broken sofa bed. This was handled very swiftly by the manager. The hotel could use some renovation, but location is perfect and price reasonable (through hotels.com). 
19427 Get dropped off at the corner of 7 th and watts and walk the half block....great location three blocks to soho and five min walk to the village! 
19428 Good location in the theater district, nice room, good breakfast. if they are have a better carpet that would "look" cleaner. 
19429 Service was great, the view was amazing and the concierge was the best I have encountered. This hotel is everything it is cracked up to be. There could be no better way to experience the theatre district in all it's grandeur. 
19430 This is a great property for a short IAH layover. A short walk or tram ride from the terminals. Rooms are clean and quiet. 
19431 estuvimos en abril de 2012, el hotel super practico por su ubicacion, muy cuidado, la habitacion limpia y renovada. Nunca nos falto nada. 
19432 Surprise on upper east side. Very small lobby but very large rooms and great comfort. Junior suite had full kitchen and enough space for a family. Would definitely stay there again, especially for an extended stay 
19433 Very nice, comfortable room. Nice view. Staff is nice. For the best Mexican and margarita head down the street to el parador. 
19434 We were pleasantly surprised by the prime location and spaciousness of this hotel. Beds were super comfortable and front desk extremely attentive. Would stay here again, great hotel near Central Park and two subway stops. 
19435 Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel e siamo rimasti soddisfatti. Nonostante i bagni in comune non abbiamo mai trovato file ed erano sempre pulitissimi Situato in zona verde e sicura vicino a pub e ristoranti 
19436 Fermata della metro vicina. famiglia con adolescente 
19437 palmed off with a single room masquerading as a double. Management didn't want to know. Give this place a wide berth. 
19438 Overall a great place to stay, away from the crowd especially at Times Square. Highly recommended for families traveling with children. The only thing lacking is a self service laundry facility. 
19439 I stayed at the W Hotel over the Thanksgiving weekend. The service was excellent. The staff was very knowledgeable about Chicago. The rooms were exquisite. The staff did everything to make my family's stay exceptional. 
19440 We liked this place however there is a bar/night club on the ground level which was directly under our room. I wouldn't stay here if you intend to get a good sleep, especially if you have kids or ask to be on the top floor 
19441 Based on price I wasn't expecting much but overall I was pleased with our 1 bed suite and balcony. Yes the sitcom is noisy and you gave street noise but that's nothing ear plugs can't fix!!! This is traditional, friendly and good value. 
19442 Modernist minimalist masterpiece of a hotel off of Times Square. Perfect crash pad for exploring NYC. Free muffins in the morning to get your day started off right and a beautiful rooftop bar/restaurant that's not outrageously overpriced. Aesthetically chic. Would stay here again anytime. 
19443 Met 5 gezinsleden New York bezocht en bijna alle bezienswaardigheden gezien. Gaan zeker nog een keer terug. Indrukwekkende stad, maar wel erg vermoeiend om in een kort tijdsbestek alles proberen te zien. 
19444 I have become a huge advocate of the Affinia Hotels. Either the Dumont or the Shelburne! The Dumont has a great feel, is perfectly located for my purposes, has a very friendly/helpful staff and offers a great healthclub/fitness center. 
19445 great loaction for time square, maceys etc. The staff are helpful and we enjoyed our stay had a room on the fifth floor looking into the square nothing to look at but no noise from the road, wifi in the room worked well. 
19446 Absolutely loved this place. Will definately stay there again. Service was excellent. Linen, towels, bath rob....flat screen TV just like at home. Staff are very friendly and very cooperative. Had a blast 
19447 stanze comode e ben arredate, bagno ampio e pulito.....centralissimo di facile accesso a tutti i monumenti del centro....unico neo la vista dalla camera,la nostra dava su un vicolo ceco bruttino. Comunque nel complesso lo consigliamo. 
19448 colazione appena sufficiente, condizionatore rumorosissimo, odore stantio in camera, forse moquette da sostituire, bagno e biancheria pulitissimi.Personale della reception un po' poco ricettivo delle esigenze degli ospiti non abilissimi nella lingua straniera. 
19449 After a attempted break-in of our room, management totally dropped the ball, failing to call the police and follow up with us once we returned home. I would not trust them again. 
19450 In TripA, this hotel is voted the 77th best hotel in NYC. I think that's generous. Typical, not charming. American corporate chain hotel. The location is not great, the rooms very basic for the price, the room service slooow. Go somewhere else, 
19451 The hotel was lovely, our room was very comfortable and attractive. The beds were quite comfy and the staff was very helpful. We arrived before 3, check-in was easy, and they held our bags so we could begin sight-seeing. We were very pleased with our stay at the Barclay. 
19452 Stayed on 28th floor.Room quite nice.Concierge very helpful for booking theatre and tour tickets.What a view from the room.All staff most polite and helpfull. 
19453 I stayed at ink 48 last weekend and had a great stay. The stay was excellent--especially through the courtesy of the staff. I have to give special credit to Jeffrey Behrens and Pablo from security! I will certainly revisit Ink 48 
19454 This fine hotel feels historic and elegant. Wonderful location in midtown Manhatttan. Quality staff, stately rooms, good bar and restaurant. The Warwick makes for a fine visit to New York. A bit on the expensive side, but isn't everything in NYC? 
19455 Prima hotel, centraal gelegen en Subway staion naast hotel. Daardoor vanuit JFK gemakkelijk via Air Train en metro binnen uur voor $7 bereikbaar. Kamers voldoende ruimte en basic comfortabel. Personeel vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Prima hotel voor families. 
19456 Staff very attentive and polite, hotel constant maintenance to the welfare of guests, without bringing disorder, localzado in Times Square near all major concerts and underground station within walking distance. Recommend. 
19457 Hilton Times Square hotel is number one in Times Square...best city view,structure,foods,servis...and fastly internet...i like this hotel...everywhere is near the hotel..example: Times Square,Broadway Theatres,Madame Tussauds,5th Avenue,Central park.....Thanks Hilton Times Square....from Baku,Azerbaijan. 
19458 We spent two nights here in February. The location, just steps away from Times Square, provided a perfect home base for our weekend in NYC. We had tickets to a Broadway show, and enjoyed many of the city's attractions, most within hearty walking distance from the hotel. 
19459 Near Times Square, clean, kind people to help you, but need some improvement in room care. 
19460 Very up to date design - clean, simple, minimalistic. Definitely a great location, especially for tourists. The rooms were small, but clean. Generally a great stay! 
19461 alles prima - kleine aber gut gemachte Zimmer gerne wieder 
19462 Un dia olvisarob limpiar mi room hasta que pedi que alguien viniera!!! Las colchas estan a Asperas y no confortables! El buffet de dessyuno no tiene mucha variedad solo pan omelettes y cereal 
19463 We enjoyed very much the hotel, is a good price for the Excellent service, good breakfast buffet, large roons, very good location 
19464 Stayed here while my spouse was having surgery at NYU. The room was larger than expected, and the staff was very nice. I had no problem getting extra towels, and the concierge was very attentive. 
19465 The Belleclaire is a very OK budget hotel with an excellent location and helpful staff. Stayed in the family suite. No luxeries but it worked well for two adults and two teenagers. I would avoid it during the summermonths becuase I saw no airconditioning 
19466 The OTA is a terrific value, great location, beautiful decor, staff was charming and helpful. 
19467 This great old hotel is located right off Michigan Avenue. It's clean, comfortable and quiet. Rooms are modern with all the amenities. The staff are great and the bar downstairs is awesome. Ask for a room with a view if one is available. You may get lucky like I did. 
19468 Very nice hotel. Great staff. Room service was awesome. Rooms were very nice and clean. Overall great hotel and service. Will definetily go back! 
19469 It is a perfect location and the subway is outside the door a few steps away. The room was a decent size with two double beds. The room was clean and not at all noisy. I highly recommend this location and hotel! 
19470 We stay there every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas and I wouldn't stay anywhere else. The staff are VERY helpful and accommodating. Hotel room are large and clean. The hotel is in the heart of Times Square and very convenient to everything. 
19471 and it's like a home away from home. Best hotel if you're on a budget in NYC. 
19472 Great location for seeing shows--nice two room suite accommodations. Bedroom on the small side-but had separate room for couch, refrig, microware, another tv-. No special percs for Diamond members. Breakfast options/environment lacking. 
19473 The rooms are a horendous! There was a hole in the wall, the room is smaller than an average closet! This place has no charm, no taste and certainly no designer!! It was a dreadful stay. 
19474 At first they messed up our room, but they quickly dealt with it ....... our room was fantastic, and it had a great view of NYC... the food and service was great as well 
19475 Stayed here end of August start September 2012. Location is fantastic 5 minutes from Times Sqare, Central Park, Broadway 5th Ave etc. Friendly helpful staff. Hotel rooms clean spacious but dated. Wifi expensive @ $12.95 per day, but Starbucks across the road has free wifi. Fantastic value a real bargain! 
19476 I stayed in the Premier Tower and the room was quite large and nicely decorated. The staff was friendly and attentive. Was only there for one night, so I didn't have a chance to check out the hotel restaurant, but it looked like it was nice and busy! 
19477 The Hilton Garden was more than we could have expected from a downtown property. The room was sufficiently large and the staff larger than expected. It is close to theaters and time square. We were pleased! 
19478 Excellent location...friendly & helpful staff, rooms clean & comfortable...what more can one ask. We will return!!! 
19479 The staff at this hotel will amaze you. I have never experienced such professionalism and great attitudes as I did here. Not just from one person but everyone I dealt with. Hotel is clean, updated and is great shape. I will stay here again. 
19480 Had a one night visit to NYC and was very pleased with the clean, soothing atmoshpere at Shoreham. Would recommend to anyone! 
19481 We stay at this hotel when clients are in town because of its location on the east side. It fast to all airports via Midtown Tunnel. I have always been upgraded and this has made me come back time and time again. Great part of the city 
19482 Stayed 5 days.The room was nice and clean in general. A renovated bathroom was cool but toiletries were not enough. Great price in upper west Manhattan and it is very close to Subway - Red Line 1. 
19483 This hotel is great. Room is clean and staff is very friendly. Has honor system in the lounge area where you can get food and snacks. 
19484 Employees were great, rooms a bit small, but you're in NYC and you're not staying at the Plaza! Would stay here again! 
19485 Love this boutique hotel on the Upper West side. Quiet neighborhood. Next to Museum of Natural History and Central Park. Walking distance to Shake Shack, Levain Bakery, and Zabars. They have a small number of rooms, so you need to book months in advance. 
19486 Really enjoyed great service here from the bellmen, staff and concierge. Rooms were smallish, but nice and clean. Would stay here again. 
19487 The location of this hotel is perfect. The staff is excellent (everyone, including Daniel). The rooms are nice. But the cost is way too high given room rate and extra charges for internet. 
19488 Nice hotel 1/2 block off Time Square. Very clean, Extremely pleasant staff, and the consiere service is top notch. One block from the subway hub makes traveling cheap and easy. Highly recomend this hotel. 
19489 Hotel is nothing like the intranet site inside, small, damp, noisy pipes. Yes for 1 night I remembered Spain in 1968! Extreamly overpriced and watch for the immediate credit card debit 2 mins after you arrive for entire stay! 
19490 my 2nd time to stay at this hotel. very good location & it has an easy access to the 610 highway. the galleria is 3 minutes distance. big clean rooms & the most important thing is the free wireless internet. 
19491 I've stayed here before and found it nice. I would even recommend it normally but CALL for a CONSTRUCTION UPDATE. Unless you love jack hammers, reverse beeping alarms from trucks and awful noise, stay somewhere else. 
19492 This hotel is stylish, clean and very service oriented. One evening we had difficulty with our door keycard and Patrick went out of his way to assist us. The hotel is quiet and the rooms are large and roomy. 
19493 The hotel staff were very helpful. The rooms were clean. Most of all, it was very quiet. If you're on a tight budget and are in need of a room/kitchenette, I suggest Crossland. Its easy access off 290 and 610. 
19494 Great locations,with nice rooms,nice gym,good resturant and great service from plecant people.good tips for tourists from the concierge,who showed us places to shop, good resturants and places to see. 
19495 Will be back again and again. Staff could not have been more respectful or attentive. 
19496 If it was just on the hotel, I'd say 3/5, but the location and value takes it up. Room was decent; roomy, clean, with TV and air con etc. Nothing outstanding, but nothing bad at all either. 
19497 Reasonable price and rooms looked nice. Stayed one night and unfortunately sustained numerous itchy bites which could possibly be from bed bugs. Recommend caution. 
19498 I have been visiting NYC for the last 38 years, and this is the best hotel I know in this city 
19499 Hotel is in nice location close to all major attractions, and is reasonable priced. WE were able to walk to Time Square, Rockefeller Center, Toys R us, Grand Central 
19500 There are nice restaurants in the arae as well. 
19501 Had a great time a couple of weeks ago at the W in Times Square. Excellent room on the 55 floor,comfortable,clean,great view of the city. Breakfast at blue fin it's just perfect and they have a very cool lounge bar. Friendly and professional staff. A++++++ 
19502 uitstekende ruime en comfortabele kamer,met mooi uitzicht,vriendelijk personeel, en zeer centraal gelegen in buurt met ruime keus aan leuke restaurants.hele goede prijs/kwalitiet verhouding.een vriendelijk en enigszins statig hotel.we gaan zeker terug bij volgend bezoek aan new york. 
19503 We were upgraded to a family room that was huge by NYC standards. Gorgeous glass enclosed shower with rainwater showe rhead AND two sinks Great customer service by Engel, that gave us dinner recommendations. 
19504 I have stayed here twice in the past two months (for the first time in many years). On both occasions my stay for excellent. The rooms were very comfortable, well furnished and a good value. Room service was excellent. Service throughout the hotel was very attentive. 
19505 It's definitely what I consider a luxury hotel...- the rooms are large, all amenities are there, comfortable beds and the view is magnificent! The gym is on the 42nd floor and well equipped. The hotel is a short walk from Michigan avenue. 
19506 Staying at the W Lakeshore was a great experience. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. The views from the room were incredible and the decor was trendy. I would definitely stay at the hotel again and recommend it to friends! 
19507 The view was nice the hotel food was a little over priced my only complaint is that they did not have the hotel room cooled off at all it was 89 in the room and that the toilet was plugegd otherwise very ncie stay 
19508 You are 1/2 blocks from Times Square. Rooms are good enough for sleeping and watching flat screen TV. Good workout room. The cost per night compared to other hotels in the area was much lower. Location,Location. 
19509 Totally recommend this place. Got a great night's sleep! Towels could have been softer but overall it is a great value! 
19510 The service received and the room met and surpassed our expectations. The location was exceptional with respect to all the activities and attractions we had hoped to see and do. We have recommended the hotel to friends that are planning a trip to New York within the next few months 
19511 Check in was quick and room was available. The Westin Times Square is my first choice because it is centrally located to theaters, shopping and restaurants. Having Shula's Restaurant in the building is an added bonus. Great food! The staff at both the Westin and Shula's were great. 
19512 what a DUMP! sure enough, if you sleep here you'll get biten by bed bugs. this place is disgusting. be forewarned. this is barely a .5 star 
19513 Hotel molto ben tenuto, belle bamere pulite e relativamente spaziose. Bel bar con terrazza all'ultimo piano. Alla reception c'e' la sera Dyanne, un angelo custode sorridente che non manchera' di darvi piacevoli ed utili info. La colazione decisamente scarsa e sottotono. 
19514 The hotel is just across the street from Lincoln Center. It's not luxurious, but it's been renovated in the past decade, and the rooms, while very small, are completely serviceable. 
19515 Its true, being midblock on 40th St. next to Port Authority is seedy, I don't think my wife would stay here alone, but if you're traveling on business you can't beat the rate, with huge free breakfast, comfortable bed and great staff. 
19516 Didn't expect yellow stained white bed sheets with hairs all over. Need to change sheets ourselves at 1am. Didn't expect yellow stained white bed sheets with hairs all over. Need to change sheets ourselves at 1am. 
19517 You want to be in the middle of it all? Stay here. Located right on 42nd Street. Walk to all your Broadway Shows. Rooms were clean and neat. Coffee in Room is always a plus. Towels were soft and fluffy. 
19518 I found the Club Quarters to be clean, with friendly staff and good sized rooms. The locations was excellent. The only downsides were an unnattractive view and thin walls (an arguing couple kept us up one night!) 
19519 Great location! Friendly staff! Would stay here again! Parking a little expensive: valet 55$ for 24hrs. While walking around later in the evening,we found a sign that said valet parking 24hrs for 33$. Would highly recommend staying here during your stay in Chicago! 
19520 The lobby - bar is very nice. Don't try the breakfast, it will be a huge disappointment! The bathroom was ok, but really too small. So, I wouldn't recommend this hotel. 
19521 We recently spent a weekend here. Rooms were well maintained. Staff was friendly and helpful. An above average value for the money 
19522 My partner and i stayed here for 11 nights and it felt like home. The staff were nice and friendly and very helpful. Would recommend this to anyone. Great location (midtown) close to pretty much everything, rooms pretty clean and comfortable. Can't wait to return! 
19523 Good value for money - very helpful front desk staff (helped get tickets to Broadway shows that were sold out) - leaking wheelchair accessible shower (not great drainage) but otherwise good room - no bedbugs! 
19524 great find ,excellent value for money. would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a great deal in new york 
19525 Great room overlooking Empire State Building. All staff really friendly. Perfect location - for ESB, Grand Central Terminal, Rockefeller Building, Times Square. Complimentary breakfast was excellent. 
19526 Alles ok, einfach und preiswert, nah am Central Park, gute U-Bahn-Anbindung 
19527 Stayed here one Saturday night in December before Christmast. Close to the Met and Central Park! Very quiet room with no bath, but it was cheap. 
19528 I seem to always check in on a Tuesday night and the front desk people are awesome. Twice now they given me a room with a balcony on a high floor facing the highway which is just what I like. They are so friendly and super helpful. Great job. 
19529 This was my first stay at IC Times Square and certainly not my last. The staff were all very attentive, welcoming and informative. The beds were unbelievably comfortable and the views were gorgeous. Todd English's Ca Va restaurant on property was delicious. I look forward to staying again... 
19530 Great staff and great service!! Was there when hurricane sandy hit and for 4 days after. All staff were very helpful and caring. They provided a light lunch or snack buffet every afternoon at no charge to the guest and they did not even charge for the breakfast! 
19531 HOTEL TRES BIEN SITUE A 100 M DE CENTRAL PARK ET TOUT PRES DE DEUX BOUCHES DE METRO 
19532 TIME SQUARE A PIEDS RIEN A DIRE. AVONS EU UNE SUITE TRES GRANDE POUR UN PRIX INCROYABLE CUISINE AVEC EVIER FOUR ET FRIGO + CAFETIERE 
19533 Well located, very big and comfortable beds, well equipped and big rooms, good window view. 
19534 Stayed through a bundled flight & hotel thru Expedia. Great accommodation. Easy transportation downtown and all sights. Parking was included! 
19535 I stayed at this hotel in July with a couple of friends based on a recommendation that I received. From what my friend told me, I expected great service, free coffee and a nice room: my expectations were met. Definitely will be staying here again. 
19536 I stayed here for two nights during my business trip. Room was fantastic, staff were superb and ever so helpful and professional. Couldn't ask for more from a hotel. 
19537 This is a nice, small midtown hotel with good sized rooms for the price. Beds are new, bathroom had nice towels and toiletries. Cleaning staff were thorough and friendly. The breakfast buffet was basic, with convenient hours. Friendly front desk staff. Very short walk to subway or bus lines. 
19538 We stayed from 02/10/12 to 09/10/12. The Affinia shelburne was the perfect location for our honeymoon. Close to the chrysler building and Grand Central station. Housekeeping was superb and the concierge very very helpful with directions to attractions that we requested. Would stay again, very clean and friendly. Thank you. 
19539 This hotel was nothing but spectacular. Not only was the room very clean and comfortable, but we ate at the restaurant and the food and service was great. I will be staying here every time I come to NYC! 
19540 Stayed with my two girls, the room was a good size, beds were very comfy, location in the theater district was perfect to walk everywhere. Had a bathtub which is great after a long day of walking. 
19541 This place should be dropped by Hilton because it is dirty and has no service. The staff does not care either so it wont improve. The only thing going for it is the location but it is worth staying somewhere clean and taking a taxi. 
19542 Straight out of the 70's. Nothing fancy, nothing extra. It was clean and we didn't see any bugs or prostitues. For the location and price, it can't be beat. :) 
19543 See the picture of the bar? Well, they don't have a liquor license so don't expect to have a drink. Rooms are very small. Fitness center is in the basement. Staff was decent. It was, though, VERY clean. 
19544 I stayed here just one night on business. I found the staff were helpful. My room was small but very clean. Would definitely recommend if someone asked about it. 
19545 Stayed overnight at this Marriott for a girls weekend in NYC. Was very clean and in quiet area of NYC. The subway was located around the corner. Restaurant in the hotel was very good. Staff was friendly. 
19546 We had a very pleasant stay. I was speaking to Sakina regarding restaurants and the recommendations were very helpful. Thank you for taking care of us and we will be back next year! Enjoyed our breakfast in the couryard. Just perfect size room for 2 of us 
19547 Clean, well priced, friendly and helpful staff. The whole family enjoyed our stay. We would recommend to friends and definitely stay here again. 
19548 Just as the reviews say 
19549 Five minutes away from Times Square , evrything you need on the doorstep 
19550 Excellent and friendly staff , especially Charles on the door 
19551 Can't wait to go back 
19552 Everything you would except in a first class city hotel. Great location. Breakfast was outstanding. The room was quite comfortable and well appointed. The business and convention facilities were convenient and comfortable. 
19553 The room is huge in New York. The location is very good because lots of shops and restaurants are near by. They need to improve their room services. They do not deliver the right drink for me in the morning and delayed for one hour. 
19554 Huge hotel (maybe not good?). Great location. Rooms as you'd expect. Lots of things to see in hotel. 
19555 Used our points at this hotel. Front desk staff was super friendly and informative (needed help shopping). Everyday I went downstairs, they recognized me and said hello. Rooms are NY size small but clean and modern. Right in between the subway lines= awesome location! 
19556 Just disgusting like the people at the reception desk! They cannot speak English, and they are very rude. You feel like you are talking to Ms. Swan in "Mad TV"!!!!!! Don't go there! 
19557 Adequate Confort/cost relation, very well localized, hotel staff very friendly and open to address your request. Only negative, breakfast end on saturday by 10AM and no service can be get from the Cafeteria after that. Nick 
19558 The hotel is placed in a perfect location. Just next to the subway and in walking distance from all the "action". The rooms are very small, but everything you might need during your stay is available. I would stay there again any time!!! Thanx 
19559 My daughter and I stayed at the Holiday Inn - Soho in January. Great location. Loved Canal Street! The staff was very helpful. Subway just down the block. Room was clean - nice bathroom - concierge gave us great restaurant suggestions. Will be staying here again! 
19560 Large comfortable rooms. Excellent service. Best of all, taxis always waiting outside. 
19561 Was under renovation so needs to be assessed with that in mind. Rooms clean and offered exactly what I expected. Was part of a package holiday which I very much enjoyed 
19562 Clearly upbeat New York place, out door deck and disco was hoppin 
19563 Everyone was very helpful. The desk person was good in giving me directions to anywhere I wanted to go. I enjoyed the excercise room. It was very clean with top of the line equiptment. A water dispenser and towels were provided which was nice. 
19564 Very clean and the price-value excellent after buying from hotwire. The hotel is old but like I said it before clean and in good condition. Also, the check-in process was very very quick and efficient. 
19565 Spent last weekend at the Iroquois Hotel, location was close to everything, rooms were attractive, common spaces welcoming, but the biggest selling point was the staff. Everyone I encountered went out of their way to ensure everything was perfect. This hotel will be my choice in the city going forward. 
19566 The staff was friendly, rooms clean and of decent size. The location was pretty amazing - especially for the price. I would definitely stay at this hotel again. 
19567 Das Hotel ist aeusserst herunter gekommen. Eine Unverschaemtheit dafuer so ein horentes Geld zu verlangen! Nicht mal einen Schrank gab es im Zimmer, keine Nachttischlampe, Etagenbad wurde nicht zwischendurch geputzt. Keinen Aufenthaltsraum oder Foyer. Ganz, ganz furchtbar! 
19568 r.tomisin,ohio...very nice stay. The staff is warm,welcoming,very eager to help. Central location,close to subway, we felt safe, secure in the area. No problems. The hotel is clean,well kept. The rooms are small,but clean and well appointed. We would stay again and recommend it to family and friends. 
19569 We have always found the hotel to be a welcoming and pleasant visit. We will stay at the Westin whenever given the opportunity. 
19570 I enjoyed my stay here. Rooms were not too small for new York and the position was easy walk to times square. Cabs were easy to hail down out the front. Loved the restaurant 
19571 Na al meerdere hotels in New York te hebben bezocht was dit een verademing qua kamer! Grote kamer, een eigen magnetron,( als je daar gebruik van wilt maken) koelkast en koffieautomaatje. Dagelijkse schoonmaak. Schoon, geen muffe lucht, gewoonweg prima en daarnaast nog eens ideaal gelegen! 
19572 The Magnolia Hotel was the perfect place to stay for our short trip to Houston. The stay was very helpful and friendly. The location was excellent. The room was excellent. We highly recommend the property. 
19573 Great staff. We held a meeting here with 32 attendees, and everything was great. Food was excellent, service was beyond expectations. Would definitely use this hotel again. 
19574 Great hotel in the center of all the action.Clean and quiet with great beds just what was needed after 2 weeks in europe on hard mattresses. 
19575 The London was everything we heard it was, it far exceeded our expectations. Great location, friendly staff, very clean and spacious rooms. The Gordon Ramsey restraurant wasn't worth the money, imo. 
19576 I think location is key with all big city hotels and this one exceeds that standard. Great location for walking and easy access to transportation. There must be a hundred restaurants within easy walking distance as well as endless shops. You can walk to Broadway, Central Park, the UN, etc. 
19577 The room was small but very clean. The staff was incredible and was so helpful and kind. I would surely stay here again. 
19578 Awesome location. Steps from time square:) Great staff and very modern decor. Felt like modern NYC and near EVERYTHING! The bar is beautiful in black and white hues with old stars featured in pics. Across from the theatre district. Great value;) 
19579 From a native New Yorker, I would recommend this hotel anytime. The location is easy to reach and the rooms were clean and plenty of space to move around. Great service when needed and quick respone from all. 
19580 We spent two nights at the Flatotel, spacious room and very clean. Continental breakfast every morning was included. The concierge/reception staff were excellent. The location for sight seeing and shopping was great, Times Square just a short walk... would stay there again. 
19581 this small neat hotel is just good value close to everything ,good selection at breakfast the staff were so helpfull ,very clean comfy beds we had 2 double beds 3 in the room plenty of space would recomend to all my friends 
19582 CJ Bournemouth 
19583 This hotel is very close to Times Square. Only issue we had is that the bathroom has no curtains on the windows. Breakfast was a bit limited so got a bit boring after 6 days. Otherwise hotel was good and worth going. 
19584 Stayed here for Conference- Great history in walking around hotel. Rooms are typical NYC - small but adequate. 
19585 Looking from the Hilton @ 42nd street, I am glad I paid the extra $100 a night for my stay. With the lites burnt out at night it says Carter HTE which I believe may stand for Carter Hell Tonight Everlasting. Good Luck. 
19586 My spouse and I were invited to an engagement party, so we stayed in On The Ave Hotel. It is such a cute boutique hotel, very charming and romantic. We felt welcome, a very friendly crew. Overall it has been a fantastic stay! 
19587 Great Place, very swish, Good location, staff great. Expensive to eat or drink in hotel but apart from that no problems. Large rooms, comfy beds, would stay again! 
19588 Todd and Kyle were so nice. The room was SO BIG you could have fit 3 queen size beds easy.It was so clean .flat screen tv.TRANSPORTATION IS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE HOTEL.I have already told all my friends.The PRICE CANT BE BEAT. STAY THERE TOM AND ZAK ERIE PA. 
19589 We stayed five nights here. It was clean, accommodating, with friendly, helpful, and courteous staff. HVAC was kind of loud but got used to it. It's a busy part of town so you can hear street noise. Husband liked the free breakfast. 
19590 Great location; clean, updated & spacious rooms; but the best part was the staff - SO friendly, helpful and always going the extra mile. Next time we come back to Chicago, we are staying here again for sure! 
19591 I stayed at this motel for quite a while and was always impressed with the service of the manager and staff. They went out of their way repeatedly to accommodate my schedule and needs. Great bunch of people, focused on the needs of the client. 
19592 Good luck finding a better priced room in Manhattan. Clean rooms, friendly staff who were accommodating to my late check in and held my bags until the afternoon when I checked out. Will definitely be staying here if I return back to NYC. 
19593 Lively bar and restaurant atmosphere with spacious, quiet and clean rooms. Perfect for a weekend getaway or a workweek home base. 
19594 Stayed for one night while out on the town in Houston. Room was very clean and tidy. Staff were friendly and helpful. Shuttle was good too. 
19595 Good location, close to soho & lower east side. Definitely aimed at younger crowd. Room was good, floor to ceiling windows with great wires of lower east side. 
19596 compact and clean with view of the empire state building from the 15th floor. What else could you ask for in NYC? 
19597 I had three issues...the construction noise, mildew, and electricity went out. However, the service won me over...the manager to security all had a calm presence that they appreciated the consumer...I was compensated one night without a hassle and given a new room. 
19598 Good a good rate on this hotel. The location is excellent and the staff were good. Rooms were nice but nothing speical. Overall this was a nice hotel and a very positive experience. 
19599 leuk hotel maar zeker niet rustig. De kamers zijn een beetje geantidateerd. maar voor de rest is de verzorging en bediening zonder meer vriendelijk en attent. gelegen in het centrum op 5 minuten lopen van Times square Ontbijt is betaalbaar maar wel op plastic borden. 
19600 the hotel is in a great position,15 min walk to times square,5 to central park.Subway close & buses pass the door.I could even glimpse times square from the room. I fled ahead of the hurricane & the Ellen was more than helpfull in change flights & booking me out. 
19601 The lobby was beautiful and extravagent but the rooms were fairly small and ordinary. We arrived 30 minutes early and were not allowed to check in early. Also, there is no coffee in the rooms. If you want a great location though this is the place to stay. 
19602 Great hotel: great location, awesome, friendly staff, clean rooms, great, yummy complimentary breakfast and great design. No complaints, no suggestions. Loved it! Great value for $$$$. 
19603 Hotel is ok , good position, traditional and old fashioned , bathrooms are slightly dated 
19604 Perfect location, fantastic view of Central Park and the bed / room was very comfortable. Good burgers at the Burger Joint Restaurant. 
19605 This is a beautiful hotel! We had a great experience and plan on returning next time we are in NYC. 
19606 We stayed here for 4 nights, the whole time the staff were all very friendly and helpful, was happy to see a free breakfast included. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. And the location was so convientent for times square. 
19607 Although rather pricey, This hotel is an excellent place to stay, especially if you are interested in the Theater. 
19608 I am staying at this brand new hotel and am very pleased. The staff are extremely friendly and showed quite a bit of concern when I had to wait about 15 minutes for my room to become available upon check in. Location is extremely convenient. I will definitely be back. 
19609 Veramente bello ,personale cortese ,camere perfette,insomma tutto ok!!! 
19610 Great hotel in a great location (very close to subway, restaurants and entertainment). Great concierge service. Clean, comfortable rooms. 
19611 Beautiful hotel, we had a lovely junior suite - very spacious and luxurious. Great position, close to Times Square and the Theatre District. Good value for money. Great service too. 
19612 L'albergo e' situato in una zona tranquilla e ben servita. A pochi minuti si raggiunge Central Park e la metro. In zona sono presenti numerosi ristoranti,fast food e negozi. La stanza e il bagno sempre puliti e in ordine. Personale cordiale e disponibile. Sono soddisfatta.Rifarei la scelta. 
19613 Everything is old, the road outside could be heard clearly, carpet in Lobby dirty, checked out after 2 nights. Rather go to time square for slightly more, and 100% better. 
19614 Good location. Good choice hotel. Nice room. space and accomodations. A Very great place to stay! just near Macy's, broadway, 6th avenue and Times square. Very good service and welcome. 3 elevators. 
19615 This was our first stay at the Four Points by Sheraton. We were very pleased with the quality of the room, the service, the location, and the staff were some of the friendliest we've dealt with in several years of visiting NYC. Would not hesitate to stay there again. 
19616 Stayed here Sept 28-Oct 2, friendly staff, luxurious room, awesome bars up top, views are great, lovely decor, clean, great location by times square/42nd port authority(subway line) the continental breakfast is amazing! STARBUCKS COFFEE! :D 
19617 Great room, very large, wonderful staff! Walk to Broadway shows and other attractions. 
19618 The staff is professional, very attentive, and kind. It is confusing as you are made to feel so comfortable, you make think that you are at home. Hotel and rooms are luxurious just like posted photos. Relaxed spa-like atmosphere. 
19619 We enjoyed our stay at this hotel..It was really nice ,the staff was awesome !! This wasent our first trip but there are still times when you need help getting around and they were more then happy to assist us !! They even helped us find theatre tickets 
19620 Stayed using points, definitely not a category 7 hotel for 35,000 points a night. Clean room, friendly staff and a great location but the hotel was just average. 
19621 nice place, room, staff. good experience. I got our rooms at about half off, which helped my pov I'm sure. 
19622 The rooms where roomy and the facility was well kept. I did use the workout room and wish the machines were a bit older. I stayed here for a business trip, so I was only in the room to sleep. 
19623 I stayed here because most of my other choices were full. It's in a great location. Close to good restaurants and only 15 minutes from Hobby. The bed was comfortable and it was quiet. I'd stay here again. 
19624 Really nice hotel with surprisingly large room for being New York. Trendy rooftop bar and pool. 
19625 Stayed at the hotel during Easter. Good location and good hotel facilities. Had a 2 bedroom suite for 6 persons. Perfect stay for us! Clean, nice and friendly staff :-) 
19626 Service is the best. Rooms are spacious and clean. Bed is comfortable. Great location. This is your spot!! 
19627 I like the habitual efficiency of LPM, its location and good food. When possible, I make it a point to stay here. 
19628 the room is very comfortable,and the front desk help me a lot.It is a very nice place. 
19629 BOM HOTEL, BEM LOCALIZADO, PESSOAL GENTIL PARA ATENDER, OTIMO CAFE DA MANHA. PRECO JUSTO COMPARADO AOS OUTROS HOTEIS. PRETENDO VOLTAR EM OUTUBRO PARA NEW YORK, TENTAREI CONSEGUIR VAGA NESSE HOTEL. RECOMENDO. 
19630 Great location to most of the shows. Place was clean, staff friendly & beds were very comfy. There is an awesome view of Times Square in the lounge. Highly recommend going there for drinks. 
19631 The staff need to learn about people skills and making sure the paying guest is happy. The staff were rude, when i asked them for a room change they simply refused and told me to live with it. i know i won't stay there again, 
19632 First time staying at Ink48 and will definitely be back. The concierge staff and especially Amanda Torres were all extremely helpful during our stay as well as before we arrived in helping to plan our trip and transportation issues. 
19633 My husband and I stayed here during a business trip. Beautiful hotel with a fantastic location...walking distance to grand central station, time square, rockefellar center. 
19634 I Stayed here Thanksgiving day and the hotel itself is beautiful. Great location, nice big rooms, great views. Overall it's a very nice place but some of the staff had attitudes and Some where great! You can't go wrong here... 
19635 We stayed at the hyatt for three nights the staff were very helpful the room clean and the bed was very very comfortable 
19636 It is right next to Grand Central and a great place to use as a base for shopping and sight seeing at a reasonable price. 
19637 arrived by train to penn station - hotel is walking distance. very convenient! friendly staff, too. 
19638 Compare to the other same-class hotel I've stayed, this is an OK hotel I think. Not really impress with hotel interior & facilities, except that everything is big as typical American hotel :). Outside & inside looks tired & old. The staff was great though. 
19639 What a disaster! They woke us up at 1:30 in the morning to check if we had paid our bill!! More like a youth hostel than an hotel. NOT to be recommended!!!! 
19640 Great location, friendly staff and the hotel itself was really, really nice. Nothing but good things to say about my trip here and the city itself - I would go back in a heartbeat. 
19641 Big room and bath by NYC standards. Close to food and drink, friendly staff, very clean and free breakfast. Pricing was great for a weekend and no up charge from going from 2 to 4 guests. 
19642 Great location, friendly staff, nice dining and lounge. clean and well appointed rooms. 
19643 Great location, walk to lots of attractions. Service pretty good, rooms small but comfortable. Good restaurant. 
19644 The hotel was quiet and nice on the inside, the rooms were small but that is just NYC. There is a desk, full TV setup and WiFi for anyone trying to do business 
19645 The location of this hotel was perfect. The rooms were large for a NYC hotel, and very clean. The hotel staff were helpful and friendly. 
19646 We've been coming here for a few years but this time seemed like everyone was bothered by us. We were locked out, bothered by the cleaners endlessly and the valet was unreachable. The food and drink is still good. 
19647 Great, Quiet...unbelievable staff, they treat you like family. I would recomend this motel to be amoung the best of the Super 8 chain, 
19648 El servicio es excelente, muy buenos desayunos continentales, cerca de mucho restaurante, estacionamiento gratis, bastante bien por el precio!! 
19649 stayed here for 4 nights, great location, easy to get to places, room fine stayed on 3rd floor food at brendan`s vice night recommended it. 
19650 Staff is outstanding especially Raquel Dietz. Location is central to everything. Rooms are well appointed, clean and larger than expected. Will reccomend to anyone going to New York City. 
19651 Of course the rooms are small compared to other cities, this is New York after all! The room was clean and comfortable, and a good value for a place in Manhattan. Really appreciated the very helpful Bellmen. Easy access to subway. 
19652 I'm a fan of Kimpton hotels (especially those in Boston). And the Muse does not disappoint. The staff and vibe are friendly, and the rooms elegant. It's still somewhat cramped - lobby and rooms alike - but a great location. Definitely a hotel to consider for a NY weekend. 
19653 Camere ampie con vista mozzafiato su Times Square. Bagno spazioso e confortevole. Nonostante sia nel cuore di New York le camere sono silenzose (la nostra era al 22esimo piano) e l'aria condizionata era gradevole e regolabile. Personale efficente e discreto. Ci tornerei sicuramente. 
19654 Absolutely brilliant. Great service, superbly clean rooms, most comfortable beds ever and beautiful linen. 
19655 Rooms good size small washroom decor jaded.This is an old hotel which has its best feature in its central location it is right next door to the Hilton. Easy walk to town ,millennium park Williis tower and much more. 
19656 This small boutique hotel is located close to all major attractions including Time Square, the theater district and Macy's. It designed for the economy minded traveler. Clean and comfortable Cozy room, The employees were always friendly and helpful. Great location, can't beat it for the price. 
19657 Stayed here the night before an early morning flight. I went by the reviews but I ws still nervous. It was great!! Hard to believe it was a Super 8. Clean, comfortable rooms. Decent, basic breakfast. 
19658 this is a GREAT hotel and the staff is exceptional, especially Ash who was helpful before we even arrived by helping us arrange transport from the airport. the suites are very big. the location couldn't be better for a trip to NYC. it was all perfect! 
19659 AMAZING !! Was on the 52 floor and the views were incredible.Excellent service! Wonderful staff! 
19660 My husband and I stayed during our visit to the beautiful so called Windy City Chicago. The room was comfortable and clean. The staff was very helpful - The experience here was wonderful! It is conveniently located. I highly recommend It 
19661 We defiantly will be back! 
19662 I will never stay at this place again. They ripped us off. Hotwire rated it as a 4-star, but this is certainly not at that level. I will never stay at White Hall again, and I will never use Hotwire again. Terrible mistake. 
19663 This is a nice property that is VERY well located. It is historic, so don't expect a new hotel feeling, but it is well kept. the rooftop is very nice too! 
19664 Just wanted to mention the wonderful service we received at the front desk. Joy assisted us at the front desk for our check in. She was extremely pleasant and helpful. She made us feel very welcome! Linda B 
19665 Very good location and a very nice hotel. At first site its tucked away downa narrow street but the hotel is niceley decorated and staff especially concierge were very helpfull. 
19666 Beautiful lobby w/amazing purple chandeliers, Friendly & helpful staff, great location, and the most comfortable beds ever!! Definitely reccommend!! 
19667 Enjoyed my stay here, my experience at this hotel was almost faultless. Pro's - location, spacious room for New York. Comfortable beds. The cookies at reception! Cons - Tiny bathroom. No closet for storing clothes, there is a small space for a few items. I would defiantly stay here again. 
19668 Slightly pricy, but great value. The neighbourhood is cool, the architecture and view breathtaking and the service is good. Be sure to book a room with a view on the Hudson river. 
19669 Wonderful stay, very clean, friendly staff, great location. Id stay here again in a heartbeat! 
19670 I was SHOCKED..this place is nice- especially for the money !! Great little bar area, the breakfast was wonderful ! Very comfortable. We had a HUGE room !! If we ever return to this area of Houston/Spring we will for sure stay here again !! 
19671 Check in is fast. Elevator only accessible with a room key. The room is large, free internet, HBO, hair dryers, shampoo, conditioner and lotion. Clean and comfortable. Get for $80 through priceline. Room was very quiet. Located right off of FM 1960. 
19672 Excellent location, there was construction going on. That should be over soon. The staff was excellent 
19673 The rooms are small but very cool. If you are looking for a great local and place to base your trip from, this is a great option. 
19674 Good and clean hotel near Times Square. The room was very comfortable and very clean and so was the bathroom. I would recommend this hotel. 
19675 I've stayed in plenty of large hotels and this one is great. Excellent rooms. Perfect location and a rapid, smooth checkin process. I think the front desk agent's name is Jet - very nice and helpful. Great place to stay. 
19676 consigliato da amici - ottima posizione - ampie camere con soggiorno e cucina separata 
19677 Can't go wrong, great service, comfortable room...in great location. Rooftop bar is great for cocktails any time of year! 
19678 Midden in Chicago op de magnificent mile, vind je dit mooie hotel. Frontdesk is op de tweede verdieping, waar vriendelijk personeel je te woord staat. Kamers zijn mooi, met een heerlijk bed, die voor lange mensen wel wat aan de korte kant zou kunnen zijn. 
19679 Cute botique hotel. First time visitor. Would not come back. Rooms are much too small. Do not get balcony room on 15th floor, All covered with scafolding for construction on building behind. 
19680 On the phone reservation they gave us one quote but when we were about to check out, they charged us more!! They raised the price and we didn't have our confirmation to prove them wrong since they never sent one.. 
19681 Nice hotel, modern structure trendy rooms, would recommend to ask for a room at the tops floors; as the lounge bar is full at night and a bit noisy if you stay in a room on the first 4 floor. 
19682 is the touristier property ever,but if you are looking for a big size room ,king bed with amazing times square view this is your hotel.when going to new york with kids is our property of choice i believe that for a romantic getaway are better options 
19683 I think I may be in love with this amazing hotel. From the beautifully appointed lobby to the professionalism of the concierge and the front-desk staff, this place is amazing. Our room was a bit of paradise and the service was perfect. I want to go back every fall! 
19684 For the price, the Swissotel might be my favorite hotel in Chicago. The views are gorgeous from the upper rooms. The penthouse pool and gym is very worth the extra charge. Also there is a Palm's restaurant in the lobby, get the lobster. 
19685 Love this hotel....staff were so helpful and friendly, couldnt have asked for more! Great location and rooms are lovely and spacious and very clean..the beds and pillows in this place are lush!! Guys at the door are soooo nice and helpful! Def coming back here soon!! 
19686 Have stayed at the W a couple of times and have always enjoyed our stay. Staff has always been helpful and courteous. The room are very nice, well appointed and by New York standards comfortably sized. Would highly recommend staying there. Great location. 
19687 Great location to the Energy belt west of Houston. Super clean hotel, good food in the resturant and the happy hour that seems to extend beyond the normal 2 hours is great. The bartender does a great job and really hustles. Very clean and well equipped work facility as well. 
19688 We were there for a quick 3 day weekend and had a wonderful time....It is in a great location, the rooms were wonderful as was the staff and to top it all off it has great rates!!!! would visit there again anytime!!! 
19689 The hotel was in a brilliant location about 30 minutes from times square. Our room was cleaned every day. The bar is loud at night but where we stayed on the 8th floor we could not hear a thing. I would stay here again. 
19690 Large rooms with beautiful views; outstanding customer service; very good restaurant for all meals; good location close to West River and 15 minute walk to the theater district. 
19691 L'Hotel si trova in una posizione strategicamente ottimale! Peccato che lo stato delle camere e della struttura in generale sia in uno stato pietoso! Camere che cadono a pezzi e strutture sanitarie inadeguate. Materassi inutilizzabili e sporchi. Manutenzione inesistente, armadi posizionati davanti alle finestre....insomma INGUARDABILI! 
19692 Hotel is in great location within walking distance of shopping, attractions and great restaurants. Room was small but very clean, bed and linens were comcortable. Fittness area had good variety of workout equipment, pool was on smaller side. Service was good. Would definitely stay in this hotel again. 
19693 Right in theater district. Waling distance to all theaters. Request a room in back so as to avoid the noise on 8th Ave. If you are a Hilton Honors Gold, you will get free breakfast vouchers for restaurant next door. Good. Staff VERY helpful. 
19694 I stayed in a nice, small and very clean room. the people are nice and the lodge is near to metrostations (3-5 min. walk). an excellent choice! 
19695 Very nice hotel. Friendly staff. Great breakfast and coffee in the morning. I would stay again in the future. Was kind of noisy on the street since I was on the 3rd floor so I would suggest you stay on a higher floor if you do stay here. 
19696 Everything you'd want a great hotel to be. Great service. Near some really great places to dine, too! 
19697 My sister & I LOVED this hotel... it was superbly located... quiet for the central location & has such unique friendly included options such as the daily complementary wine & cheese!! you feel at home!! I will definitely stay here again on my next trip!!! 
19698 In most aspects the hostel was really good, the staff is really nice and friendly. My only problem was that sometimes the heating was not on during the night and it would get pretty cold. Other than that I had a wonderful time. 
19699 Nice, modern room; wonderful amenities, polite and friendly staff. A winner. 
19700 Loved the touch of ear plugs if needed due to construction. Didn't need them. Didn't hear a thing. 
19701 horrible, smelly, noisy, dirty, unfriendly. shared bathroom was grim dreaded going back here at the end of the day spent a few more bucks to go 3 star 
19702 I've been to Le Parker Merdiain in NYC twice the in past three months and have always loved my stay. It's not complete without a nightcap at Nave and breakfast at Norma's. Next time I'll try te Burger oin which everyone says is out of this world, too! 
19703 This was a super place and close to my function and great restaurant in hotel.. Easy to get to and super nice room and great service in all areas. 
19704 Hotel is gunstig gelegen (vlakbij CEntral Pakr/begin 5th Avenue). Kamer is comfortabel. Kleine badkamer. Zwembad op hoogste etage, uitgebreide fitnessvoorzieningen in de basement. Plezierig personeel. Uitstekend ontbijt. Goed (Frans) restaurant naast hotel (via lobby te bereiken). 
19705 I loved this hotel. My room was huge. The staff was courteous and helpful. I travel for business a lot. I have had plenty of nice hotels in downtown Chicago and this one ranked near the top....probably the best for what the room cost. Location, location, location. 
19706 I was staying here during my first visit to NYC. And it was great location for the first time. Quite small room was very nice but i had no city view at all, only another wall so the room remained very dark even in sunny days. 
19707 The hotel was centrally located.Lots of great restaurants nearby. The hotel staff was very helpful and the continental breakfast was excellent. 
19708 Excelente eleccion de hotel para ir solo a New York, muy bien ubicado, tiene servicios gratuitos de caminatas para conocer lugares buenisimos como el Meatpacking. Habitaciones limpisimas y con internet gratis en todo el hotel incluido las habitaciones. Servicio y atencion optimos. 
19709 We were very happy with the accommodations and the service in this new, clean, and conveniently located hotel in the city. Staff was friendly and helpful, and the room and bath were exceptional for the city in this price range. 
19710 I attended a business meeting there for 2 days. The meeting arrangements, rooms, facilities and food were excellent, and the staff was extremely helpful and cordial. I would definitely return. 
19711 Amazing home base for our NYC travels. the rooms were incredibility high tech and confortable. Definite Recommendation to anyone who's staying in NYC. Very Hip and cool feel. 
19712 The title says it all. From start to finish, both my boyfriend and I were treated like royalty. The staff were amazing, the rooms were lush and I strongly recommend that people go to this hotel if staying in New York! 
19713 The location couldn't be better. The deli Speedy in front of it is a nice place to have breakfast or a quick meal. The room was very clean but a little small. I'd definitly stay there again, but ask for a bigger room. 
19714 One night in this place and everyone was covered in bed bug bites! Management was very matter of fact about this disgusting problem. Left early after one night...three night had been reserved. Never stay here! Beware of this place! 
19715 Great Location, Big, clean rooms. Lifts are very slow and staff not that helpful, better to ask the man on the street for reccomendations 
19716 Free internet access, everything clean, eveything new, coffee room every level with free coffee, tea, etc. free breakfast (coffee and muffin). very well located in Manhattan next to times square. I recomend to stay there, it will be a good investment. 
19717 Best location ever. Great hospitality. Clean, simple accommodations. We'll stay here again! 
19718 Our stay was wonderful! The staff was great, room service breakfast was delicious, location was ideal! Overall a great place to stay!! 
19719 Badly in need of a total redo. The rooms are very shabby with many amenities missing or not in working order. The staff is mostly uncooperative and not well trained. If you have a choice stay else where. 
19720 This hotel is nothing short of incredible. Amongst a lot of snobby hotels surrounded by tourist traffic, this hotel is the best location for people who enjoy luxury without the hubbub. An overly friendly staff, and an emphasis on service will make your stay a wonderful experience. 
19721 We have been twice with my husband, in this hotel. We choose it because of it' s convenient location. No breakfast included.Rates may vary from high to low season. Prepaid rates are convenient. Most double rooms are double bedded. I would suggest to improve room service. Overall, good equation quality/price. 
19722 Great service at check in (Henry was at the front desk). Free internet and free parking. There are plenty of places to eat at. Movie theaters nearby. The room was clean and comfortable. Only drawback is the tube tv instead of a flatscreen. 
19723 Very nice hotel. Extremely polite, attentive staff. Awesome location on the Southwest corner of Central Park, only about 10 blocks from Times Square. 
19724 The service is great, the best. The standard room was small and felt like sleeping in old castle. The superior room was much nicer, though the bathroom is rather small. No WIFI in the room But still, a classic hotel 
19725 This was every bit a professional and impressive as expected. (But they do charge you for it!) Took my mother as a treat for her 60th last November and didn't regret paying the extra - great location and staff fantastic. If I win the lottery I'll definitely return! 
19726 Excellent Location!!! Looks like new. No problems at all. 
19727 staff was excellent, concierge very helpful, great location for business in the loop. a little too loud bar scene but overall a great experience 
19728 Terrific hotel in the heart of NYC. Staff was friendly and helpful, room was spacious and very nice, well decorated, great view, can't say enough good things about our stay. We will definitely go back. 
19729 What a disappointment! The rooms were small and in bad condition. There was a big stain on the wall. Mirror was broken. The chic was all cheap. There was almost no service. The lobby/lounge on the seventh floor was just plain obnoxious. I feel so ripped off. 
19730 I stayed here on a business trip in November 2011. My room was in 8th floor. It was ok, nothing special. Oldish, not very clean. The elevators are very busy during a big group checkin. The location is nice though. 
19731 I have stayed prior visits at this hotel and it is one of my favorites.. Great location, Great staff,Great rooms... Will countinue to book here.... 
19732 Great staff, location and room. Very clean. The staff made sure we had a room with a great view 
19733 Hotel location is unbeatable, but the rooms are very small, not to families. Rooms are beautiful. 
19734 There isn't a pool on the property. Nice decor for business trips, very bland. Love the shuttle service and free tickets to the aquarium. Nice getaway for grownups only. Not a bad place to stay, just isn't somewhere I will bring my family again. 
19735 From start to finish Night Hotel delivered in every aspect. Great staff, ambiance, and overall service. I stay at hotels frequently for work and I must say anytime I'm in NYC, Night Hotel will be my first choice! Night Hotel delivers modern standards of what a hotel should be. 
19736 From check in to check out, everything was excellent. The food was superb, good atmosphere too. Nice room, internet was free as long as I joined (do watch out for the internet fee PER device though). Great, friendly service, nothing was too much trouble. 
19737 this place is a great place to stay during the holidays cause you can see the tree around there and the city is great during that time. 
19738 I held a conference at the Millenium UN Plaza Hotel. Many of the rooms have wonderful views. It was pretty cool to have all the UN folks there too. Convenient and really great value 
19739 We were only staying one night in Houston, and didn't want to pay a fortune! This place was PERFECT! Very clean & location was convenient. We would definitely stay here again! 
19740 The man at the front desk was so patient and helpful! He was a great ambassador for the hotel! The room was clean and spacious. The bed was very comfortable. There was no airport noise at all! Great room for the price! 
19741 Loved the location, very comfortable, great amenties, good for business or vacation, near theatres and restaurants, nice pool, sauna, steam... 
19742 Except for getting a smoking room despite a clear request for non-smoking at time of reservation, I was quite satisfied with the stay. Renovated rooms are cool! Stayed at this hotel 6 years ago and the change is amazing. Would stay again. 
19743 I had a great trip and stay with Crown Plaza hotel in SW Houston, The staff was very professional and the settings was very modern. 
19744 Everything about the hotel is fantastic - the location, the staff, the rooms and the service! 
19745 I stayed here from a groupon getaway. Excellent deal. Would definitely stay again. Vana was a very helpful person. 
19746 Clean, modern interior. Frendly, helpful staff. Great location - walking distance from time square. Also - its right about a subway station so easy to get around the city. Would stay there again. 
19747 Stayed in Jr suite room somewhat small. Bathrooms only have tub/shower together. For a suite and price I felt should have been alittle more classier for a Hilton. Bar closed early also. Waited 1 hour for luggage had to call down to get it. 
19748 Stayed at the hotel for my anniversary. I asked the front desk to arrange a flower delivery. They went above and beyond! Service overall was fantastic, and they made our weekend very special. 
19749 Worst hotel I ever stayed in NYC. Tiny rooms. Broken air conditioner. Bad service. 
19750 Rooms were decent and clean. Bathrooms were a tad small, and green tiles adds to the 60s looks they are trying to portray. Good location, close to Penn Station, walkable distance to Empire State Building and other restaurants. Price was a bit expensive IMO. 
19751 Great hotel in a perfect location. Rooms were spacious for a NY hotel, well appointed. Staff were extremely helpful. Housekeeping was amazing. Anything we asked for was sent right up to our room within minutes. 
19752 Dit is mijn 5e x in dit hotel en ben super tevreden. De ligging, de inrichting, de service, het ontbijt, klein hotel dus niet zo massaal, gratis internet, sportschooltje, dockstation voor je Ipod, zwembad maar het beste zijn toch echt de bedden! 
19753 Cool location and nice hotel. Service a little slow and not overly friendly but otherwise a great place. Breakfast is excellent. Nice rooms and the pool is lots of fun. I would stay there again. 
19754 I stayed in this Hotel last Dec for 2 nights it took my breath away but the rooms are nothing special lovely big and all mod cons but just not what I was expecting!!! Rest of hotel was a dream!!! 
19755 Brillant hotel,easy to check in and out.Room was clean and spacious.Only downside was the air conditioning unit was a bit loud and pets were allowed in the hotel.Would definitely recommend the hotel and consider staying again 
19756 Beautiful property and a great location with a tremendously profesional staff. Perfect for business or relaxing vacation. Good restaurant and lounge with indoor and outdoor seating perfect for people watching. Nice pool and gym/spa as well. Expect Beverly Hills prices. 
19757 Comfort, convenience and warm hospitality on the fashionable upper east side of Manhattan. 
19758 What more could one ask? We enjoyed a perfect stay at the Roger Smith Hotel. 
19759 Great neighborhood with lots of restaurants and activity nearby. Rooms and especially the bathroom are very small and bothersome street noise. Internet costs $15 a day and they block out using any sources available other than theirs. 
19760 je recommande cet hotel car niveau emplacement y a pas mieux pas loin de time square broadway c est l hotel ideal si vous etes venus faire du shopping .il est vrai que les chambres sont petites mais cependant tres propres!! 
19761 Nothing to complain about here... lovely hotel, lovely staff, very comfortable! 
19762 Very good experience overall. The staff was friendly and helpful. The room was nice--no complaints. The location is great. Check-out was very easy, didn't even have to stop by the front desk. I'd recommend it to anyone. Easy, no-hassle trip! 
19763 Hotel nuovissimo in zona strategica. Personale cordiale e disponibile. Camere piccole ma accoglienti e con tutti i confort necessari. Spesso vengono organizzate feste con musica con dj nella sala interna o in terrezza. 
19764 Great place to stay, totally enjoyed being there. very very good. 
19765 Came to New York to celebrate our Anniversary and go to the Good Morning America show. We had a lovely 28th anniversary and enjoyed a play. All in all it was a wonderful weekend. 
19766 It is a very small hotel...but has a fantastic location...a hop skip and a jump from Times Sq.... FREE wi fi.... rooms where small but super clean..and comfy and modern Staff where very nice and helpful... FANTASTIC shower.....would head back there without hesitation. 
19767 My daughter and I stayed at this hotel. Great service, clean rooms, fantastic location. Although the rooms are small, everything is very clean and new. Would definitely stay there again! 
19768 A short walk along the sky bridge from the MD Anderson Cancer Center. 
19769 Wellrun hotel with good desk service. Comfy room and good ensuite facilities. Easy access to Metro and Central Park. Service to keep bags after check-out for those late flights gives another bag free walk about day. 
19770 I made a ridiculously low bid on Priceline for a hotel in the Times Square area and was lucky enough to get the Hotel Mela. Very stylish rooms and lobby. I loved this little boutique hotel. Would happily return and pay full price. 
19771 Location is not too close to where the "action" is but close enough to walk almost everywhere but still have a nice, quiet, peaceful night sleep. Beautiful and spacious (for NY standards) room and very comfortable bed. 
19772 I stayed in a queen chambre which had a nice size for one person. The staff was very helpful and location perfect! 
19773 The hotel has a great location. It is one block of the empire state building and in waking distance of Broadway. The rooms were very nice and clean. When I looked at the prices of other Hotels this was the best choice. 
19774 We booked this hotel based on the Trip Advisor ratings. We found it to be every bit as good as we hoped. We would highly recommend it to anybody. 
19775 This is an old hotel! But reinvented! Clean, efficient, fabulous location, wonderful staff throughout. I can understand why Cary Gramt made this hotel is home for so many years. Wonderful place to stay.... Quiet and calm in the heart of New York.... And great beds!!!! Thanks...will see you next time! 
19776 i can honestly say this mite be one of the best hotels ive stayed at in a long time i have no complaints. i would defiantly stay here again and recommend this hotel to others. we also bought the new york pass in advance...very easy to use. 
19777 The hotel is very friendly. Has a terrace with a church view, and very good cuisine. Computers with internet, free water at the corridors, and a great staff. I only miss a frigobar. Great location, in front the Rockefeller Center and near Times Square. I will be back. 
19778 Stayed at the Willowbrook Wingate recently and was pretty impressed with the place Clean, friendly service and reasonable rates. Loved the breakfast! 
19779 Consigliato sopprattutto per la strategiaca posizione, a 2 minuti a piedi da TIME SQUARE, ma vicinissimo a anche al Rockefeller Center ed al New York Public Library. Personale sempre disponobile sia per qualche consiglio che per ogni richiesta. 
19780 Always courteous, professional and helpful in getting me in and out of the property. Hands down the best in the City! It's individuals like this that keep me coming back to your hotel. 
19781 We booked 10 rooms for a girls soccer team - 11 year olds! Group total was 42 individuals. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Breakfast staff was helpful and opened early to accommodate our schedule. Great value for a large group. 
19782 I spent two night there and found the room exceptionally clean. The housekeeping made up the room quickly. It two block away from time square. It has the advantage of Ca Va restaurant in it. Little bit expensive 
19783 Modern lobby and amenities. Free coffee and tea from espresso machine downstairs. Rooms are decent size and even the bathroom in my case was ok. Be careful about the AC machines noize in some rooms though - I had to change my room upon arrival. 
19784 The hotel is clear, and confortable. It's near the lot of atraction, the metro, the theaters, the time square, etc. All of my question are answered very good for they friendly staff, speciality for Elizabeth. She help us in our stay at New York. 
19785 Just returned from a weekend stay at the Millennium Broadway in one of their "Superior Rooms". The room was bigger than expected and clean. The location of the hotel was fabulous. I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to New York. 
19786 My wife and I went to see a play and stayed overnight. Great location good service we would stay again next time we see a play in NYC. Times square was hopping all night long.The rooms were clean and spacious. 
19787 We have stayed here before and location is the Best if you want plays. The rooms are old hotel but they are redoing the rooms and much better. The staff was great and for the price you can't do better 
19788 Its location is amazing: 100 meters from Times Square, near Broadway, the 5th Avenue and the main theatres. Our room, on the 24th floor, was cosy, clean (room and bathroom cleaned up every day) and warm, not so noisy, even beeing above the 42th street. The staff was very kind. 
19789 I would definitely stay here again. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The only complaint was how inadequate the bar was and they didn't have a restaurant. Not too far from the subway, bus stop or Michigan Ave. 
19790 Very cheap and right by the airport. The entire hotel smells like mothballs. Clean enough just for sleep before an early morning flight. Can't imagine my wife staying there. 
19791 Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Great staff, great location - we will stay here again. 
19792 The Barclay Hotel was perfect for our stay: a grand lobby, comfortable room, excellent staff, and convenient location. I would love to stay here again! 
19793 We spent a week there and really enjoyed it the only issue was the breakfast which they claim they do not advertise however it does detract from the stay as the croissants are always hard and stale. 
19794 I have stayed in this hotel on a couple of occasions for work. On the plus side, the rooms are spacious and clean and the staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. But on the downside, the views are appalling, the room service is variable and the location isn't the best. 
19795 One of the best hotels the wife and I have ever stayed at. The location was perfect. We arrived early and was given a room early, right around noon. Very friendly staff. Will stay there again. 
19796 Perfect location, perfect view (park view), perfect comfort (matress and pillows), perfect quietness,perfect rooftop pool (with a view!), perfect... trip! Foremost, perfect... price!!! Incredible stay at Le Parker! 
19797 What a fbulous hotel, what a find, Im told JFK once stayed her and so did Bettie Davis,,,,the rooms are the best weve stayed in, so comfortable and spacious,,,the staff are just so obliging from the bell boys to the conciege,.,surely the BEST HOTEL IN NEW YORK CITY 
19798 The hotel and our room were beautiful. We had a few requests and the service from the staff was great. We both strongly recommend ZaZa. 
19799 Just stayed at the Westin New York at Times Square. I have recommended this hotel to my colleagues visiting the city. I had a great experience from check-in to dining. 
19800 Excellent RC experience as expected. Great price on the weekend. Good location for lower Manhattan, esp. if you can navigate the subway. Very convenient if you want to take Staten Island Ferry to NYC. Would absolutely stay there again. 
19801 We came to new york city for the holidays, and we stayed at The Marmara Manhattan and it was great. thank you for your hospitality. Special thanks to Mr.Mete ,Mr.Mehmet and all the other staff. We recommend everybody who would come to New York. 
19802 This hotel may be a bit old but it's clean and the staff is nice. The best part is location. It's located in the heart of the city near many popular theaters. Also, there is a piano in the lobby for public use. Enjoy. 
19803 Rooms spacious, comfortable, clean well serviced. Nice view of empire state building from room. Walking distance to many attractions. James at front desk helpful and friendly. Good continental breakfast. 
19804 This is not a Hotel: rather a hostel. Never seen such small rooms: there was barely space for a bed. It's in the centre, ok, but not worth the price. No breakfast at all. Service non existing. In my room there was a leak from the ceiling... 
19805 really small rooms, over-hyped. although clever use of color themes within each room. 
19806 We stayed here with our two adult children for one night. The room was clean and the check-in and out was easy. Valet parking was very convenient. Location was great for the places we wanted to visit. I would stay here again. 
19807 The room was excellent, the staff was very professional and helpful! Every minute I was there was a pleasure! 
19808 Accomodations for the price were great. My family came in from California for a graduation. The staff was friendly and helpful. They were ever present. A+!!! 
19809 I think it is a great hotel, the service is good and it is quite. Other hotels in NY have smaller rooms than this. It is comfortable, the beds and pillows are nice and the staff is friendlier than other NY hotels. 
19810 I stayed here for three nights and was not disappointed. The rooms were nice, well appointed and all of the things I expect at a Hilton Garden Inn. There are many restaurants nearby and they offer a very good breakfast. 
19811 Large rooms (by ny standards) and great views of ground zero make this hotel a good choice for those staying downtown. 
19812 Me encanto la ubicacion condo imps ny de pies a cabeza, transporte super facil y Ademas today's las tiendas para shopping pequeno pero suficiente para tanto que hacer en NY, con Gina's de regresar este ano una vex mas 
19813 Ultra groovy hotel. Fab pool and excellent staff. Myself and 3 friends had a ball! Would definitely stay there again. Vivien Quinn UK 
19814 Very good location near Central Park. They have begun some renovations......and it needs it. Nothing bad, but it just feels well worn. The AC/Heater unit in my room sounded like a jumbo jet. A general face lift will help. 
19815 This hotel is close to the Galleria area where we wanted to be. For the area the pricing was very good. Also, we were able to fit the whole family (two adults, four children) into one suite very comfortably! That was one criteria for selection of accommodation. 
19816 I've stayed at the Sherry several times the past year. They have a BOX of chocolates in your room with a personal note. The rooms and suites are immaculate. They sent a Christmas card. I need not say any more! Oh, yes, the service is top notch...always. 
19817 Nice hotel in a great location. Walking distance from Penn Station. Service is excellent as well as restaurant. Rooms and bathrooms are VERY small as well as hallways and lobby...but it is NYC after all! I will definitely stay at this hotel again. 
19818 A good hotel with a great location,convenient to restaurants, the theater and the subway. Rooms are clean and well-kept. And all of the staff is kind and helpful. The breakfast area is small but food is good and plentiful. I have my third stay there coming up soon. 
19819 Stayed for 9 days in room 4510, thoroughly recommend the hotel. Concierge staff are amazing, bed was one of the most comfortable I have slept in and all in all one of the best stays I have had in NYC. Will definitely be a returning customer 
19820 Grreat location for first NYC visit. Close to everything on the 'must see' list. Penn Station across the road so transport is not a problem. Room was big and having a small kitchen was an added bonus. 
19821 Great boutique hotel, comfy beds, clean rooms. Greatest assest is its staff, helpful, approachable, and genuinely friendly. 
19822 Everything was wonderful from check-in to check-out. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Room was a bit small but that is consistent with boutique hotels in NY. Afternoon wine was a welcomed bonus as we had been traveling for several hours. Will definitely come back. 
19823 Clean rooms clean bathroom free coffee GREAT position..what more could you ask for such a cheap price??? Me and my boyfriend were so pleased by this hotel we must spread the word!! 
19824 Spotless, spacious and quiet rooms. Staff was responsive and professional. The location is ideal and within walking distance to MOMA, Times Square, Central Park, the theatre district and shopping. I wouldn't stay anywhere else. 
19825 The hotel was older and noisy, but for the price we couldn't complain. The location was great, close to everything we wanted. Went to Wicked, which was a 20 minute walk. 
19826 We had a nice-looking apartment with everything we needed in the room. The breakfast was not completely as explained, and these days we expected for free. 
19827 We recently stayed in the Affinia Dumont. The rooms are excellent. The staff is exceptionally friendly and helpful. The location is fine. It lives up to the reviews in Trip Advisor. 
19828 Great hotel, great location, fantastic staff, good food and service very polite, small rooms and old tv and worst of all no wifi in rooms and air macs cannot by plugged to wire to get internet. 
19829 Fantastic location in Times Square, comfortable beds and nice bathrooms. But the staff let it down, didnt get much service with a smile. Innovative interiors, would stay again, ignore the staff! 
19830 Great property in Chicago. From check in to check out the staff was very friendly and accomadating. The location can't be beat being right off Michigan. The room was very nice and the bed was exceptionally comfortable. The breakfast included was delicious with many items to choose from. A + 
19831 Deluxe King room. Good design. Good furniture and practical facilities. Quality of the work in the bathroom can be questionable but not top importance. Excellent Aveda product, a real plus. Very quiet except the air conditional system. Hotel. Perfect location. Average Continental breakfast. Professional and friendly staff. 
19832 We used Hilton Honors Points to stay at this very nice hotel. It's 3 blocks from N Michigan Ave, so very convenient. Nice rooms. Great service. Also close walk to Navy pier. Recommended to other higher priced hotels in the area. 
19833 Great location. Tired looking rooms, has seen better days, but only for sleeping. Location is fantastic. Stayed two nights and walked every where , no need for taxi. Restaurants at your door, trains to NEWARK DIRECT. 
19834 This hotel was ok. The air conditioner ran all night and was quite loud. Also the neighborhood at night was very dark and I didn't feel safe walking through it with my family. The staff was friendly though and it was in an convenient location to local attractions. 
19835 We stayed here for 2 nights...great neighbourhood, close to broadway, the shops...good service, nice room...and even bumped into Michelle Williams ...We didn't have dinner at the restaurant, just drinks, which were very nice, nice and helpful staff as well. 
19836 The hotel has a great location for shopping in the Galleria, it has very good service, good beds and is always clean. 
19837 Posizione centralissima: Macy's - Empire State Building - Madison Square Garden praticamente fuori dalla porta dell'hotel. Metroplitana comodissima per qualsiasi altro spostamento. Hotel pulito e confortevole- 
19838 Spacious, modern rooms (especially for NYC) with a BEAUTIFUL view of central park to the north. The Burger Joint behind the big red curtain doesn't hurt, either :) 
19839 I stay at this hotel every time I'm in town for one reason, the staff is amazing. I always request a room on a higher floor so I can look out over the city. The restaurant has everything you can ask for and the bar is small and intimate. 
19840 If you want excellent air conditioning and temperature control, this is a great choice. Location is great. We always ask for the highest floor so we can sleep with out hearing so much traffic noise. A lot of times they have a room for early check ins. 
19841 Excelente ubicacion, la mejor vista que pudieras tener, ademas muy cerca de las mejores tiendas para hacer shpping 
19842 Stayed here only for 3 nights, should have stayed longer, great position, walking distance to all the shows and restaraunts and shopping. 
19843 I stayed here for a month on business: Pros- modern relaxed feel/Good bar and restaurant Cons- the service is quite awful for the prices charged. The unknowledgable staff think they are so cool they come across as just unhelpful/bordering rude. Tiny Gym. Check your Room bill/Amex bill carefully. 
19844 Last time my apartment had the flu I stayed at Trump for a week. I always get the one bedroom with kitchen. It's a corner park view and it is fantastic. No restaurant but, nice indoor pool. Plenty of places to eat there. Time Warner across street. 
19845 Great service, rooms with a view, clean Rooms on the small side though 
19846 The location couldn't be better. Rooms were great. The only downside is that the wifi is so expensive. I think it was $13 per day. At the price of the room I think this is unacceptable. The beds are really comfortable. 
19847 I was very pleased with my stay here. The lobby is not a showplace, but the room MORE than makes up for it. I stayed in a deluxe one bedroom, and was not disappointed. The furnishings were lovely, and the bed and linens were super comfortable. 
19848 Het hotel is weliswaar een ouder gebouw, maar goed onderhouden. De kamers zijn goed ingericht en badkamer is zelfs uitnemend. Trappenhuis en receptie is wat aan de smalle kant. Voortreffelijke buurt met veel gelegenheid voor ontbijt, lunch of diner, mooi straten en parken. Voor Manhattan zelfs rusttig 
19849 Excellent location. Small kitchenette area with fridge, microwave and sink are a real plus. Will stay here again. Excellent value for money. 
19850 Lovely hotel. The rooms are big and very comfortable, free wifi and excellent bathroom. Great value for money! 
19851 The hotel is excellent, as well as the service, rooms, cleanliness and friendship of the people who work there. I will definitively go back there if I have the chance. It's highly-recommended!! 
19852 Stayed here while visiting family. Fair price for NYC ; nice and modern. Highlight for me was the staff. Very friendly and helpful throughout my stay. I'll be back! 
19853 I paid for my son and his spouse to spend 4 nights at your hotel. One day they received no room service and another day there was only 1/2 order of towels. It was a disappointment. They also found one person at the front desk to be less than accommodating. 
19854 I visit Chicago about 2-4 times a year, but had never stayed at the Chicago Hilton. My wife and I truly enjoyed our stay The staff was excellent. The room was great. I will stay there again. 
19855 This is a great place to stay. Great atmosphere for families. Very close to times square. I really enjoyed the hotel. the staff was so kind and helpful. Many shops along the way. Taxi cabs can easily be called 
19856 Close to Penn Station, which is very important for me. And feeling safe on Manhattan, even though I always travel alone. And I'll be back as soon as I can:)) I've found my place to stay in New York. And I never change something that's good enough. 
19857 hotel was clean and comfortable, room was clean but bathroom extractor fan did not work and air conditioning was very noisy, hotel was just far enough away from the noise of the city but within walking distance from broadway and central park. The staff were nice and friendly 
19858 We had the pleasure of visiting friends in Houston this winter and stayed at Modern B & B. This B & B that is great for urban dwellers and art lovers. It is close to Houston's best museums and Rice University. 
19859 This hotel was a well-located, clean, reasonably priced and roomy option for our visit to NYC to see colleges. Close to transportation and in an area accessible to restaurants, etc., the Larchmont was as we expected. The shared toilet and shower facilities were clean, but very tight. 
19860 This hotel is great! I am picky, especially about cleanliness. Rooms were spotless and large, wifi was great, and AC worked well. Breakfast was more than I expected as well. I will be staying here the next time I visit NYC. 
19861 great service super nice people great hotel Ny , super confortable beds , great breakfast , very friendly staff 
19862 Nice and clean. Room small, but comfy and bed was great Just a small sundry shop on site on the honor system.. 2 computers to use in the lobby.. Only 1 misunderstanding at the front desk, which was quickly remedie.. Staff accomodating and very pleasant. 
19863 The staff welcomed us into a very cute little lobby, and upgraded us into a very nice corner room. The style is post modern with exposed ceiling and concrete flooring but the room was very comfortable. 
19864 I wasn't going to write - because it all continues to be wonderful. It would be negligent of me not to recommend such a lovely place. The staff and rooms are equally lovely. The service has always been gracious and proactive. I'll go back again and again. 
19865 weve stayed in new york five times and so far this has been the best hotel yet. Staff are very friendly and curtious. Room service very good, clean and tidy and nice spacious rooms. would definately go back again 
19866 I am always impressed by the quality of the staff, service and facility at CQHT. They never fail to provide top quality service, even when my stay is just for the night. The location and quality of the stay is the best value in Houston. 
19867 Simple hotel, a lot complain about the location, but myself and my wife had no troubles with it, enjoyable 4 night stay there before jetting off to SF. Penn station just a 5-10 min walk away made this more than adequate location wise. Room was clean, staff helpful. Recommended. 
19868 This is a horrible hotel. The front desk clerk, Laine was very rude. I would not recommend. The only good thing about the hotel was the manager, Matt was very accomodating. 
19869 Excellent location, service etc, booked through 3rd party booking.com and the price was $600 more expensive than advertised 
19870 Chose to stay here on two trips to Chicago! Great location...great view of the Willis Tower from the roof top pool! The staff are so friendly & welcoming. Clean, affordable hotel! Great for the kids. My daughter LOVED the outdoor pool on the roof! Definitely will be staying here again 
19871 Nice atmosphere and great staff. Size of room exellent and very bright. 
19872 The hotel cannot be faulted, great location, reasonable charges per night and spotlesly clean. Have stayed in several hotels in NY but the Yotel is the best. The rooms are small but compact and have everything u need. Staff are very nice and helpful 
19873 Nice hotel in a good location, right across from the Port Authority bus station and two blocks from Times Square. 
19874 hotel vieillot mais entretenu 
19875 Situation centrale exceptionelle 
19876 chambres un peu tristes ( tres peu beneficient de la lumiere naturelle ) mais propres, menage fait regulierement , linge parfait 
19877 calme 
19878 accueil correct Je le conseille en famille. J'y retournerai volontiers 
19879 It had been awhile since I stayed here and was pleasantly surprised to see that the lobby area had been remodeled. Overall, this is a good hotel; nothing fancy, rooms aren't all that big, but great customer service, and very convenient to JSC. 
19880 Very clean & modern hotel. Staff were very friendly & helpful. No problem getting refund when we had to evacuate for Irene. 
19881 My stay at the hotel was less than average. The quality of the food is really poor. The gym is not too well equiped. I didn't feel safe around the area. 
19882 Nice rooms, clean and ok size. Friendly staff and an ok restaurant. Didn't have the breakfast but dinner was ok, nothing special though. Very noisy a/c. In fact the a/c gave us trouble sleeping. Location is great though. 
19883 I can not stress how impressed we were with the Omni, the staff and the location! The service was impeccable! If you are going to NY for the first time STAY AT THE OMNI!!!! 
19884 Great location, spacious suites, modern feel, great bathroom and amenities. I loved this hotel and hope to go back again. 
19885 Excellent location near to Grand Central station. The staff were very helpful and welcoming. We stayed for two nights and would willingly stay here again. Great patio area in Wheeltappers Bar. 
19886 Very clean and comfortable. I would gladly stay here again. The location is a bit out of the way and tough to find a taxi bit the service was great and he room was a great size. 
19887 Das Hotel liegt sehr zentral wenn man zu den musicals oder zum shoppen will. Das Hotel selbst ist etwas spartanisch 
19888 Die Zimmer sehr klein. Der Service angemessen. Das im Hotel gelegene ital. Restaurant sehr gut. Preise auf NewYorker Level. 
19889 great location, heavenly bed with fabulous bathroom, dont forget to visit the bar on the roof in a summer night, have a cup of Manhattan in the center of Manhattan but it is a bit pricey 
19890 We stayed at this property in March 2012. Everything was great. Would definitely come back. 
19891 Rooms were clean ans staff was helpful and friendly. Good value for Manhattan. 
19892 Location is perfect. Helpful staff makes it the gem of midtown 
19893 Exactly as you would expect. Nice room. Small. Had all the amenities. Bar was incredibly expensive. Room was quiet. Good location. Lots of good eating spots Nearby. 
19894 There are better hotels in NY for the money spent in this hotel, the front desk was not courteous. The request given on the booking was not paid attention to i would atleast expect to respond to the request. I will not recommend this hotel 
19895 If you go for the vibe, the art, the worn down marble stair treads, the history, the view up the open stairwell, and the pretty great location, the Chelsea Hotel will not disappoint. 
19896 Zeer goed hotel: netjes onderhouden, aardig en behulpzaam personeel, schoon en van alle gemakken voorzien. Zeker gezien de prijs. In enkele Nederlandstalige reisgidsen staat dit hotel bij de beste in de prijsklasse in NY en niet zonder reden! 
19897 I've stayed here 7 or 8 times previously and very little has changed, which is both good and bad. The staff are the reason for the relatively high mark, the rooms all need a refresh. However, the beds are as comfortable as ever. 
19898 Stayed in the Cosmo last fall. Good clean small room in a vibrant neighborhood with good local restaurants. Convenient location. Such a good value with a nice vibe it was the first place I looked to book for our latest trip to NYC. 
19899 Stayed for one night prior to a cruise and it was excellent. Staff very helpful, rooms up to standard and well situated. A free breakfast too! Stayed at a different hotel when we returned for four days and it wasn't a patch on this. 
19900 I stay here often on business. The hotel is always very clean and well kept. The manager always recognizes me and is very accommodating to my requests. Overall, a great place to stay. 
19901 My wife and I always stay here when we visit NY. The executive lounge is great, you get breakfast, snacks, and drinks when staying on the executive level. We love it. The rooms are big and clean. The service has always been great. 
19902 got a great deal on a summer weekend cheaper that all other hotels i researched rooms were spacious and clean-no bed bugs in our room 
19903 Super modern hotel, perfect location on Manhattan, quality and awesome food! Marble Lane is the best place to eat! 
19904 An oasis smack dab in the middle of it all. Not sure how, but there is almost no outside noise when you're in the hotel. For us (family of 5), it couldn't have been better. Perfect location. 
19905 I would rate this place as good one- nice, clean room, smiley service but very disappointing breakfast with plastic knives and forks( not even funny!) But they have free parking and wi-fi, and price is reasonable Will I be back? I'm not sure 
19906 I loved the private penthouse deck /bar for in house guests only. Wonderful place to relax in the summer. Overall excellent ,hotel that has improved greatly since reopening. Shan the GM is terrific. She gets it 
19907 This hotel was fabulous! Very modern, contemporary, trendy with great views. I would definitely stay there again. 
19908 This AKA is very conveniently located for me. Very near Grand Central for subway access. Even though they have no restaurant or room service, the area has many good restaurants, diners, and groceries with prepared foods. The staff is very nice and the rooms are great. 
19909 The level of customer service at this Hotel was awesome. Every employee I came into contact with showed the utmost concern for my comfort and well-being. The room and bed were top notch. I will definitely stay here every time I come to Houston on business. Very convenient. 
19910 It is a great place to stay. The staff is excellent and the rooms are nice. You dont hear any of the highway at night. I will return for sure. 
19911 this hotel is well placed,the staff is very welcoming and helpfull,the only bad point of this hotel is the fitness center,it is too small and lacking of some equipment,otherwise it's a good choice 
19912 Amazing hotel!Excellent services and the dinner at the cafe Boulud was very very good!Through Surrey's windows lies the soul of the city across Madison and down 5th Avenue...and the central park!I highly recommend the Surrey! 
19913 Definitely a recommendation, huge rooms (according to the NY standards), friendly staff and within walking distance from almost everything. Only minus point is that housekeeping does not do a very good job, apparently vacuuming is not part of their weekly rountine. But overall a hospital place in NY. 
19914 Hubby and I flew into town for a BEARS GAME and stayed for 3 nights. This hotel is in the middle of everything and we felt so comfortable and safe. 
19915 Great Hotel and staff ! right in the heart of midtown. If I was going to NYC again then this is where I would stay again, clean rooms, good service, great street views..... good. 
19916 Being 50 metres from Times Square made this hotel much enjoyable. Big credits to the hotel for what they did on 9/11!!!! The gym was top notch! 
19917 We found a great online only rate for a Standard Queen ($199/night). The hotel is an architectural marvel (essentially built on concrete stilts). The new High Line Park travels underneath and the neighborhood is filled with boutiques, art galleries, and restaurants. 
19918 Beautiful hotel in a great location. The rooms were clean and comfortable. Walking in I was truly pleased with the hotels wow factor. The staff was very accommodating and quite pleasant. We will definitely have another get away. 
19919 Great location, near everything. Cleaning staff weren't great. Sheets were clean, rug was very dirty, water was warm but not hot, family in the next room had the same problem. Would probably stay some place else next time. 
19920 The location is excellent midtown close to Broadway shows and restaurants e.g. We stayed four people (me and my wife and our two teenagers) in a two room suite. Old fashioned rooms, but clean and ok for our purpose. 
19921 The beds are extremely firm and uncomfortable.... Location for MD Anderson is good, but beds make it a deal breaker... Probably wont stay here again. 
19922 this is basic but modern hotel with great location in NYC. 
19923 This place is just stunning, in my opinion the best in NYC (Including Plaza, Peninsula eg) 
19924 Stayed here for 4 nights, I do not have one negative thing to say about the hotel. Clean. Quiet. Excellent use of space in hotel room! Would definitely stay there again! It is very sleek. Hotel staff at entrance very friendly, each and every day! 
19925 + : good location, design hotel, not expensive - : found hair in the bathroom, small rooms, no minibar in the room !! 
19926 was in NY week of july 11, 2020. Hotel location ideal; hotel renovated hence all is new in rooms; good service from desk and concierge; good breakfast in morning; merits its 3 stars; would recommend at anytime; moreover prices are much affordable. 
19927 Stayed for 3 nights in June for a business trip. Conveniently located, hotel staff was friendly and accommodating. Hotel decor is fun and eclectic, clean rooms, comfortable bed and pillows. Would stay here again! 
19928 The hotel was wonderful, the rooms, clean and when ever we needed anything the hotel was thrilled to provide us with anything we needed immediately. Staff friendly and go out of their way to help. Would run not walk back to the Hilton. 
19929 This hotel is in one of the most exciting parts of the city. It is trendy and quirky; the rooms are a bit small but functional. But who hangs out in a room in NYC?!?!? The location more than makes up for any shortcomings. I will return. 
19930 The hotel was clean, the service was good 
19931 It would have been nice if we could have had overnight parking for less than $35.00 per night. But overall this was a very enjoyable experience. The Travelodge was great and I would return the next time I am in Chicago. 
19932 Got a great deal here shortly after they opened. Service was great and we got a room upgrade so we had a sitting area and, best of all, 2 bathrooms! Nice bar in the lobby too! Had sangria and a tasty cheese plate. 
19933 Abbiamo soggiornato in questo hotel a gennaio 2011. L'hotel ha un'ottima posizione.La stanza era grande,pulita con una vista mozzafiato su Times Square. La colazione non era compresa nel prezzo. Abbiamo scelto di farla in albergo comunque perche', dopo la prima mattina, abbiamo visto che ne valeva la pena. Consigliato. 
19934 too noising!!! bad location, in corea way, a street full of korean restaurant, really noising during the night! nice and big rooms, good servive 
19935 The hotel is fresh and chic. The room was large, clean and comfortable. The staff was very friendly and accommadating, There are hotels closer to the business I was visting but the St Giles is worth the extra walk. 
19936 We stayed at this hotel for two nights and really enjoyed the comfortable beds and style of the hotel, it was clean and central for getting around New York, the staff were friendly and the breakfast was excellent, i .would def recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York. 
19937 This hotel is very well located (between 2 subway lines). Grocery store and restaurant near. Very large rooms. The bit a little to hard for my taste. Everything else, perfect and a very reasonnable price. 
19938 Good location. Decent rooms - comfortable but small beds. Warm cookie appreciated on arrival. Open lobby was strange. Very good deli next door. Very reasonable room for NYC. 
19939 Our family traveled to New York for a graduation and Natalie made sure we had adjoining rooms for all 10 members and made our visit memorable. She helped us with dining advice where we could all be together. 
19940 Felt like a dorm room, cleaning staff would come in even with the sign on the door saying Do Not Enter, people steal your food in the community kitchens and the bathrooms (because of the shared aspect) can get a little gross. Great location, just sub par. Won't be back. 
19941 The large and comfortable rooms (especially the mini-suites) and the warm and accommodating staff make us feel as if we have a second home. We highly recommend this hotel. 
19942 El hotel esta muy bien ubicado nosotros conseguimos un buen precio pero es un poco caro el servicio no es bueno su personal no es muy amigable pero estar ubicado a lado del central park frente al museo de historial natural es lo mejor del hotel 
19943 I have stayed in many NYC hotels and this is now a firm favourite. Fantastic size rooms. We were on the 9th floor and it was whisper quiet which is super important. Love the decor, love the staff. Will definitely return! 
19944 The location is what you pay for. in general its clean. Our room was right above a steak place, so it smelled like meat and bbq all afternoon until late at night. 
19945 I had an outstanding experience while recently staying at the W Hotel on Lexington Ave in NYC. The hotel as great atmosphere and the staff is very helpful. I'd like to commend Cindy Cabrera (front desk) for her courtesy and general helpfulness during my visit. 
19946 Hotel was noisy, room was not clean and was way overpriced. Specifically, dirty sheets, blankets left on pull out couch, cockroach seen in bathroom. Requested a blanket by front desk, none delivered. Would never again stay @ this hotel. 
19947 Great location and service. Plus they have NYC's friendliest doorman, Brian! 
19948 Todo genial,pero lo mejor.....sus maravillosas vistas. 
19949 My fiance and I spent 2 nights here. The hotel is beautiful! We loved our room and the friendly staff. The location was fantastic, we easily walked everywhere we wanted to go. It was really close to Oak Street Beach, which was great! 
19950 If you wasnt the best location, the best service and the best rooms there is no other choice in New York and I've used them all. 
19951 goed hotel met standaard kamers, goede bedden, maar zonder het eigenlijk altijd aanwezige koffiezetapparaat. heel vriendelijk personeel! om de hoek van broadway. eigenlijk is alles zelfs wel op loopafstand (moet je wel goede wandelschoenen aan doen). 
19952 Stayed here based on TA reviews. Had two adjoining rooms which worked out perfectly for us. Stayed in a higher room; had no problems with noise. Housekeeping was excellent. Doorman was extremely helpful with getting cabs and car for airport. Would definitely stay here again! 
19953 Great hotel, great service, very clean and nice, fairly convenient (I was in town for a UN meeting, so for that it was perfect). Only complaint was the elevator - expect a 10-minute wait each way!!! 
19954 Somente na sala de cafe da manha que o wifii nao funcionava. A unica observacao. 
19955 I was not pleased at all. Valet services was poor. We had to wait 30 minutes each time for the CAR. There was no one there to help us with pour luggage. No hot water. Dirty bathroom 
19956 Good value, clean, very helpfull staff, good location, good restaurant, stayed for our anniversary and would stay again. 
19957 small but serviceable room, glad I was on my own. very close to everything so didn't have to travel too far. it was clean, they were doing up the foyer so that was messy but other wise a great place to stay 
19958 Comfortable, soothing, quiet, friendly & conveniently a minute's walk from Times Square. 
19959 The hotel is situated right in Times Square...and because of this you can't have both quiet and the view! Otherwise everything was just fine 
19960 Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Our room had 2 queen beds a seating area and a coffee maker. It was very clean and comfortable. I would definately stay here next time I travel to NYC 
19961 The hotel has a great location, but the hotel was Ok! The hotel is too big and the rooms are too small, but overall it was very good. The rug was dusty and I had allergies the first night I stayed there. 
19962 it was very good i licked it a lot i thought it could be nicer 
19963 Location is just steps from Time Square, everything you possibly would need close by. Room was recently renovated and extremely clean! The bathrooom door was odd, loosely hanging on a slider, not much privacy. Couldnt beat the price either. Would definately stay there again! 
19964 Clean, well kept, centrally located. Friendly staff, great little restaurant (Nice Matin) next to lobby. All our needs were met with a smile. Close to Museum of Natural History and Zabar's. Would definitely return for another visit. 
19965 Great location, attentive staff, comfortable room. But noisy all night long - out in the street, which the hotel can't control - and inside the hotel, which they can. If you're here for business, you won't get much sleep. If you're here to party, this is the place. 
19966 We stayed on the 40th floor. Nice clean room. The breakfest was very good, something for everyone. The hotel is very well situated and kid friendly. We would definitely stay there again. The only con is the price for parking...51$ a day. 
19967 I've been there end of August. The hotel and the rooms are big and very well maintained, the old style of the hotel is nice, the rooms are quiet, the staff really nice and helpful. The rate of the WiFi is abusive (that's the trademark of Hilton hotels). 
19968 We had a nice clean room. The front desk staff was very pleasant. It has a nice pool area...just wish we could have used it. The location was good for us and easy to find. 
19969 Lobby and bar area are nice. Location is great. Rooms are tired and not very clean. Restaurant is small and just average food. With all the great choices in downtown Chicago, it's hard to see why I would pay $300/night to stay here again. 
19970 Great Hotel! The room was great nice view comfortable bed. Good Service too. It was quite due to the location. Love the Kimpton free wine hour. Can't wait to stay there again. 
19971 This place has its act together. Really well located, affordable rooms that are a good size and great staff. Probably might not suit young families but urban travellers and medium stay business why go any where else? 
19972 Grerat Central location, good value for money and very comfortable rooms, though rather small. 
19973 near to everything! nice staff! very quite! excellent bed and bathroom! newspaper and wifi free! as a tourists traveler this was our best choise we could ever made. if you are tired from walking or tourism, it is easy to come back. bus, metro, walk. 
19974 It's next to the Medical Center. Easy to get to downtown. (You can get the line 14 and take the train to downtown). The nearest supermarkets are Fiesta and Super Target You get a 20% descont to eat at Fajitas restaurant and try some Fijian food. 
19975 Loved the smell and chill feeling while entering the hotel. I liked the room and and the roof balcony. 
19976 Voor een relatief lage kamerprijs zit je op een goede locatie in New York. Het is geen designhotel, maar dat verwacht je dan ook niet. De bedden worden iedere dag opgemaakt en de kamer opgeruimd. Het ontbijt buffet is prima, zeker voor de 6 dollar per persoon. 
19977 Thank you TK for the tip on Riccardo Trattoria! They had great food and wine and the waiters great too! Next time we travel to Chicago we will stay at the W Hotel and hope to see you again TK. Thank you, Greg & Susan Chase 
19978 Love this hotel. Very Very clean. All of the staff was friendly and very helpful. Will stay again. Rooms are not as small as I thought, everything you want to do is in walking distance. Loved it!!!! 
19979 Stayed one night. Very clean and pet friendly. The downside..too many 18 wheelers in the parking lot which made it hard to park our car. Had a strange man ask to "buy a smoke" while walking to the lobby. Otherwise, clean, easy to I-45, and nice breaskfast. 
19980 My friend and I decided to have a girls weekend in the Big Apple. The hotel was conveniently located, just minutes from the Empire State Building. Great location, easy access to the train. Staff was very nice and helpful. The room was very clean with Philosophy toiletries! Would highly recommend. 
19981 I stayed at this Holiday Inn last week and I'll be here through the end of this week. Jill has provided outstanding service. She is helpful, pleasant, and friendly - everything one could expect. Her pleasant demeanor has made my stay here very enjoyable. Thank you, Garland Smith 
19982 Would recommend the Barclay anytime you are staying in the city... first class service, accommodations and treatment by the staff and management.. Close to the madison ave business district and nearby the theater district... 
19983 Great location to downtown Chicago and area attractions. It is only a block off Michigan Ave. Hotel was clean and the staff was very helpful. Rooms were very clean and nice sized. We stayed there with our family and it was very good for that. 
19984 Highly recommend this hotel and its staff! We arrived early morning on a redeye flight from L.A. and manager was super accommodating and granted us early checkin when we arrived from JFK. Rooms were very clean and the location is perfect for walking anywhere in the mid town area. 
19985 Centralissimo. Pulito. Personale gentile e cordiale. Ad un passo dalla metro e da Penn Station. A 10 minuti da Time Square. L'unico difetto sono le stanze un po' piccole, ma tanto uno deve solo dormirci e farci la doccia. Lo consiglio vivamente. 
19986 Just returned from 5 nights at Affinia, with six close friends & it was fabulous! Helpful staff, gorgeous modern rooms with stylish decor. Small bathroom but power shower & clean fluffy towels made up for it! Great location..highly recommend. 
19987 The staff made us feel incredibly welcome and was very friendly but the best thing about the hotel was the amazing location just off the centre of times square about a two minute walk! The rooms was kept lovely and had a fantastic view! I would love to return here! 
19988 Das Preisleistungsverhaeltnis stimmt. Dafuer, dass es so nah an der Interstate 10 liegt, absolut ruhig. Mehrere Restaurants in der Naehe, ebenso gute Einkaufszentren. Ausserdem ein Spezialitaeten Markt mit deutschem Bier. Alles nur mit dem Auto erreichbar. Das Fruestueck faellt allerdings einfach aus, keine warmen Speisen. 
19989 Great location and very comfortable, near to everything. Staff unfriendly and not very helpful, room servicing inadequate. 
19990 I have stayed at this hotel several times. Until this trip my attitude was "Well, it's a place to sleep." This time my stay was great. The front desk people were helpful and knowledgeable about the area. Also, catering was top-notch. 
19991 the staff and facilities were excellent-room got hot during the night but I didn't try to adjust so probably was preventable. very close to great sightseeing! highly recommend and would stay here again. 
19992 I was apprehensive of staying in New York alone but this Hotel is central to shops, trains and all sights. Its clean and safe with very friendly and helpful staff. 
19993 I really don't know where to start. Checking in was a breeze! Stayed on the sixth floor. Our room was spectacular. The size was great in comparison to other rooms in New York. The staff were great. No complaints at all. We can't wait to return. 
19994 Lovelly place to stay, really friendly staff and so close to everything that you need in New York!! It is not a 5* hotel, but it is clean and tidy and very comfortable, would stay here if I go to New York again!! 
19995 This cheap hotel I can recommend for it's location near the Central Park, the hotel is situated in very beautiful and silent street with nice buildings... Hotel room is simple, the restroom is on the floor, but no problem, very clean, and not so much people for one restroom... 
19996 Found a moldy smoothie in the fridge ... Dirty room, not enough towels... Rude front desk staff, average food in restaurant & small tv. Only good things were comfy bed, nice decor, & close to ballpark! Also $25 for parking on top of pricey stay! 
19997 Room was immaculate. Great location. Very quiet and very clean hotel. Staff was warm & personal. They learned my name and used it frequently. Would stay here again, and highly recommend it. Very important to note...the bathroom IS private. 
19998 Stayed at the new yorker perfect base for new york couldn't fault hotel or staff in any way. We loved every minute of our stay and would certainly come back. Up the celt's 
19999 This hotel is perfect for guests using the room for sleeping quarters only. It is perfect for needing a place to crash after a show at MSG. I wouldn't have chosen another hotel for my concert experience. 
20000 Nice hotel, clean,in a nice complex with other hotels and restaurants.Friendly staff , nice indoor pool and spa. Room service provided by TGI Friday's on property. Shuttle to airport in 5 min..pick up orange line train to downtown. 
20001 Un hotel especial. Lleno de recuerdos. Es glamoroso. 
20002 great view, great service, with clean, modern rooms. location is crowded, but that's times square. despite the outside hustle and bustle, the rooms were really quiet. would definitely stay again. on e of the best unobstructed views of the either skyline you can get. 
20003 Just back from a fantastic stay. The hotel inside is just pure class. The staff are very friendly and helpful. Well worth the money and would go back there again in the morning. The Bull and Bear restaurant have great steaks and good wine list to suit all pockets. 
20004 Das hotel the manhattan liegt absolut zentral.viele sightseeing highlights sind zu fusd erreichbar.die hotelangestellte sind super hilfsbeteit.die zimmer sind einbisschen veraltet,aber das bett war super angenehm!in allem ein toller und gelungener aufenthalt. 
20005 We checked in at noon and expected just to hand over our luggage. The front desk was most helpful and was able to put us in our room right away. Both Andy and Sunny (the bellmen) were extremely helpful. 
20006 In the middle of everything, this very old hotel provide little service. Just TSquare and nothing more. Rooms are very tired, toooo looooud from the elevator and other rooms!!! Avoid it for long stay! 
20007 A well placed hotel in a quiet oasis but close enough to the hussel and bussel of central Mannhatten.Ideally suited for Central Park, which is just three blocks away. Even the standard rooms are spacious and elegant and the service was exceptional, with the staff being polite,helpful and friendly. 
20008 Checked in on a Sunday for one night. Great location, but more than that, we received excellent service from their Guest Relations Manager, KCL. He is a fantastic representative of Doubletree. We will most certainly be back. 
20009 This hotel was situated in a good central location but the staff were not helpful at all, the food was terrible and the whole hotel had a run down appearance. 
20010 Really enjoyed our stay. Location was perfect and especially loved the free breakfast! We used reward points which was a great value for this location. 
20011 I love all the W hotels and this one is no different. The only thing I would say is the location is a little far from all ths shopping areas but good for business. The hotel has a great vibe at the bars too which always is a added bonus. 
20012 This is my second stay the Standard East Village. It is in a perfect location, very chic, but in a classy not cheesy way. With the weather warming up, the lounge downstairs and restaurant will be perfect options for any traveler. I'll be back in the next few weeks. 
20013 Good location, would be a better review if this were considered a 3 star hotel, but elevators need updating, at least one was out of service our entire stay, and when they did show up were always full. Room was nice, but definitely on the small side. 
20014 Great hotel not far from Central Park. Beautiful city. Was a pleasant place to stay. I recommend to anyone. Thank you TripAdvisor for the tip. 
20015 Close to the airport, reception and front desk, restaurant, and housekeeping all are excellent and try hard to comply with your requests. A great hotel to stay while connecting at Midway airport. 
20016 Two bedroom Towers suite with wraparound river views was peak NY experience and relatively reasonably priced. Concierge service was excellent. Scene in lobby was touristy - not as upscale or hip as other NY hotels, but a great iconic choice. 
20017 Outdated, phones didn't work elevator couldn't get down when we had to leave. Good location but not as luxurious as the pics. Would not stay here again. 
20018 carnt fault this hotel one bit! great room and got a good price on it, right bang in the centre at times square aswell great location and wasnt noisy at all 
20019 You may stay a minimum of a month only. Warning: do NOT book for less than that. 
20020 Good size rooms, especially for NYC. The amenities where very nice and staff was very friendly. Location was very convenient to central Manhattan and of course it was easy to get around on the subway. 
20021 Nice Hotel in good situ. Clean & very comfortable rooms, though a bit small. Bed SOOOO lovely. Breakfasts good, plenty of choice At busy times lift can take ages. Really enjoyed City, tons to do & see. Empire, Rockafella, Statue Liberty & Time Square to mention only a few. ENJOY!!!! 
20022 I was working at Rockefeller Center for the week, so the location was very convenient. The noise wasn't that bad, however the worst part was having only 2 elevators to the entire hotel. 
20023 I truly enjoyed my stay at the Soho Grand. My room was spacious and lovely. I will stay there again and again. 
20024 The room was dusty and run-down, definitely not how it was pitched on the Affinia website. For far less money you're better of staying at a Homewood Suites. At least you'd get a large, clean room. The staff was very nice though. 
20025 Stayed at the Red Roof for 6 nights in February. The location was excellent , the hotel itself was very good. The rooms were sufficiently big and clean. Continental breakfast was very good also, although the breakfast room got crowded at times. I would highly recommend this hotel. 
20026 Rooms are very small for the price, but location is great. We had a one double bed and private bathroom but overall felt like you were in a closet. There was also no view from the window but it's very clean hotel. 
20027 Very nice and clean hotel. Room size was great. Lenny our doorman was awesome!! Thanks for all your help. 
20028 Clean and pretty. Yes, bathrooms are small, but it's Manhattan! Charming decor, very courteous staff, Aveda toiletries (which I love), really NOTHING to complain about. Location is absolutely great. Definitely my place to stay when in NYC. 
20029 We had a great experience at Hotel Blake. The staff members were very nice and helpful. The location was perfect -- easy access to the El, bus and Union Station. 
20030 I would highly recommend this hotel for any non Japanese traveller visiting New York as they will find how Japanese hospitality in service industry make the people comfortable and cozy. Excellent Japanese restaurant in the basement and traditional Japanese foods are served as bit higher yet reasonable price. 
20031 in the heart of meatpacking district, close to the most beautiful places and amenities of south Manhattan. Crowdy, trendy, nice views, spacious rooms, a great experience in the city that never sleeps. 
20032 I'm fromage Paris and this is m'y second travel at new york.We were a couple with two children. We were delighted. staff always nice, smiling and available. very good restaurant in the hotel and a buffet breakfast extraordinaire.we will return without problem. 
20033 The hotel is old but clean. We went in January and heating in the room was very room. Some reception staff are helpful and others are careless. The hotel location is excellent. 
20034 Hotel moderne, propre et acceuillant. Proche des transport , quartier colore d'Harlem. Seul reproche, le bruit de la climatisation, un peu sonore. Personnel prevoyant, belles prestation. A recommander. 
20035 Stayed overnight one night on a stopover, saw a play. Great spots to eat nearby in Chinatown area. Hotel is in Chinatown area, seemed safe. Staff very helpful. Small rooms but a good value in New York. 
20036 Great view of Discount Tire and freeway noise is a substitute for alarm clock. 
20037 Hotel stupendo, pulito e molto comodo. Una vista mozzafiato sul ponte di Brooklin e su WTC. Assolutamente un posto piacevole ed elegante. 
20038 The hotel is located at chinatown. Horrible Street. There is no safe or minibar at the rooms, the breakfast is bellow the average. Definitely not a Sheraton. 
20039 Nice history hotel at exellent position un town, one hundert meter from North Muchigan Av. Hotl is nic, but emploise at recepcion are not the best. 
20040 an excellent place to stay if u want to be in the middle of everything 
20041 Very hip, modern European style hotel in a dramatically revitalized Harlem. The hotel bar, wxyz, has a great selection of liquor and beer, with a line of HD TVs for sports programming. Highly recommended for business and family travelers. 
20042 Everything you would expect from a hotel of this caliber, except for the service - it was nothing less than amazing. The "shuttle" was a limo, and they were so incredibly accommodating, I felt as if I had a personal driver. Excellent experience!! 
20043 Great location for everything in NYC!!! Great price. 
20044 good value, easy access to Theatre district. Nice modern room design. Hassle free automobile access from Lincoln tunnel. 
20045 it had a very good breakfast the rooms clean and comfortable the location was GREAT...the only thing that was bad was some employes...they were very mean 
20046 Excellent standard of hotel. Staff always helpful, amenities good, rooms spacious and well appointed. Recent refurb to high standard. Watch the wifi prices - very expensive. Brasserie lovely food and reasonable prices for city hotel. Excellent position right on Times Square at the top of Broadway. 
20047 Noe trange rom, men beligenheten veier godt opp for det hvis man skal oppleve byen. 
20048 decoracion perfecta, clima europeo, ubicacion perfecta ,cerca de las galerias de arte y los principales museos, habitaciones comodas y espaciosas, lindisimo bar y con buena animacion a partir de las 6 pm. 
20049 I stay at this property every year for Whiskey Fest. I am always impressed that the are always properly staffed at every turn. Valet, check-in, concierge, bell men, the bars and restaurants....NO WAITS! I love it! 'Cuz I can get right to the whiskey! 
20050 Dejlig hotel, med utrolig god service. Morgenmad er inkluderet i prisen og hvis man staar og mangler noget, henvender man sig bare i receptionen og de fremskaffer det. Super beliggenhed meget taet paa times square, empire state building osv. 
20051 Not for the charm, but in every other way, this hotel is a home run. Rooms are big enough, well-furnished, including a good easy chair and good light, very clean, quiet, well-ventilated with adjustable temp, fast elevators, great location, competent friendly staff-etc. 
20052 Apparently they just recently renovated the hotel and it shows. Staff was friendly and courteous. 
20053 Bathroom was generally grubby and included second hand skid marks in the loo from previous occupant(s), plus the pillow case appeared to have blood flecks on it which made me wonder 1) did the bed have bed bugs? 2) when was the pillow case last washed? Enough said. 
20054 stayed there for my 22nd anniversary the reception especially the agent Vanessa did everything to make our stay memorable. I am a Gold member and I LOVE to stay with the Crowne Plaza they are always a home away from home for me. 
20055 An excellent hotel, friendly staff and very comfy rooms! We enjoyed our stay at the Westin Hotel and had a sneeky peek of Times Square from our room. Ideally located, within walking distance central New York and easy access to the subway for WTC and ferry transfers. 
20056 Would recommend to any traveller. Very obliging. Location is excellent with restaurants close by. Times Square and shopping areas nearby. 
20057 Good location. Squishy beds. Concierge M.I.A. Weird Vibe. Always met family in town at their hotel, not at this hotel. No WiFi in lobby. People at the front desk were fine. I got the feeling that this hotel was a place to bring your lover, but not family or friends. 
20058 Very poor food service, rooms are somewhat adequate for a Marriott but are not up to par based on our experiences in other JW's. Marriott at IAH is better. 
20059 Booked in for my daughter's 18th birthday. First time in NYC and not disappointed ! Everything you want just on the doorstep. Great location for central park and time square, decent quality room, friendly staff. VFM !! 
20060 Great location. Parking garage, Loved the Towers Club (extra $) for quick coffee, breakfast, snacks, etc., and open into the PM. Very friendly and cheerful personnel. 
20061 well situated, reasonable, clean, friendly service, recently renovated, & comfortable beds. is there anything else to look for in a hotel? 
20062 Nice rooms, very good breakfast and the best... the staff I will come back for sure!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
20063 The hotel acomodations are very good and the personal attentive and responsive. Price was very reasonable for the qualkity. I reccomend without reservations 
20064 This is a jewel of a property. Great location and the staff are fantastic. Henry Strait and Nichole Holcomb have gone out of their way to help and provide a home away from home on many occassions while working in Houston. 
20065 Het hotel was 1 seconde lopen van time square en was een top lokatie. Elke dag werden de handdoeken verwisseld en het bed opgemaakt. Het was een ruime kamer en ookal was het niet modern ingericht, het voldeed aan alle gemakken. 
20066 First time here, but definitely not the last. Easy walk to theatre and opera. It's a bit of old NY. Large suite instead of a small tiny room. Only drawback is slow elevator service. But they toss in free continental breakfast. What a find! 
20067 Location was great and the hotel was clean and modern. The bed was the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in. No complaints. 
20068 We love the Magnolia. The staff is very friendly and we've never had a bad experience with anything. The restored historic buildings are lovely and there are many restaurants nearby from which to choose. 
20069 The Chelsea Hilton Garden Inn was a great hotel, very clean, people were very courteous, friendly and professional. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Great location. We will definately stay there again. 
20070 I stayed here for a work trip. Good breakfast and clean rooms. Slow elevator but very friendly staff. Very close to restaurants and shopping. Very pretty courtyard, peaceful. I would stay there again. 
20071 This hotel is in a perfect place if you want to attend the annual Ballunar Festival at NASA. It is just across the highway and easy to access NASA from the hotel. Lots of food near, too. Great breakfast! Waffle maker is devine! 
20072 I was there for work and it was in a great locatoin to catch the subway. You get a yummy cookie when you check in. Rooms were kind of small, but it was clean. 
20073 We loved the location and when the hotel is complete with their rooftop bar it will be terrific. We visited between Christmas and New Years and everything was bustling! The rooms are small, but very clean and well appointed. We enjoyed the latest with fixtures and decor, very sedate. 
20074 Love love love Le Parker Meridien on 56th in NYC. Great service, lovely new rooms, European feel, great location - all wonderful. Can't wait to go back. 
20075 Stayed for 6 nights at the HGI and loved it. Bed was so comfortable, bathroom was a good size and location was brillant, will being staying here on my next trip. 
20076 They couldn't have been nicer. Hotel was recently reopened, and they were as thrilled to have us as we were to be there. Parlor suite with great views and great plasma TV. My husband was in heaven. Super location! 
20077 Fantastic old Hotel with tremendous old world decor. The location in downtown Chicago is fantastic. Rooms are small and not very well updared. Room was not made by housekeeping which was very disappointing! Bar closed at midnight which really upset my Clients. Had to leave the Hotel for entertainment. 
20078 Hotel was quaint, clean, and convenient for everything we wanted to do/see! Also from what I understand of hotel rooms in NYC, this room was very nicely sized. Would definitely stay again. 
20079 I highly recommend a stay at this Best Western. The rooms were very clean and the staff went out of their way to take care of my group of business associates. 
20080 Budget Hotel , Excellent location , rooms are fine , clean, large bed , full bathroom , TV, and lots of hanging space 
20081 But the Location really sets this place it is just 2min walk to times sq etc really good deli next door to hotel for breakfast coffees etc 
20082 Exactly what you need and expect from a new york hotel. Room was small but clean, location was great, perfectly central. No hotel restaurant but lovely place for breakfast across the road opposite madison square garden. 
20083 Posizione ottimale per girare la citta',vicino alla metro e vicino a central park, camere un po' piccole e bagno leggermente retro'...tutto sommato.. Ci si puo' tornare!! Qualita' prezzo ideale, personale gentile e discreto, sola la linea Wi fii.. Free solo nella hall 
20084 the hotel itself is not anything to write"home" about, but the location is perfect for any type of N. Y. vacation you want 
20085 We did plays and museums and ate at nice resturants all within walking distance. It is 5 star location with inexpensive rates 
20086 I was in town for a girls weekend with my friends. It's a nice place. Rooms are a little small but when you're only there to sleep, it's not a big deal. There's a cute little restaurant/bar right next to it, Starbucks & Eatily just up the street. Good location. 
20087 Modern and practical hotel in a good location near grand central station at a reasonable price. Small rooms, but that is expected in NYC. Room was clean and quiet with a big comfortable bed. Breakfast was ok, but no hot meals. Staff were nice and helpful. 
20088 Tiny postage stamp sized rooms. Broken heater in first room, noisy inadequate heater in second room. Not what I have come to expect from W Hotels (also stayed W Times Sq, San Fran, Los Angeles Westwood, New Orleans French Quarter, Seattle and Montreal) 
20089 Would never had stayed if we were informed about the strike. Crossing picket lines is not my idea of a warm reception. Pay the people what they deserve. We paid a lot of money to stay there, they can afford to pay their staff. 
20090 Close to a lot of things, okay breakfast (Fruit and serial). Close by to shopping and restaurants. Huge parking garage, togehter with shopping center. Big room and comfortable bed. Due to jetlag, i wake up early every morning. It was then good to have the fitness romm (small, but okay) 
20091 struttura elegante, centrale, e con molto personale il quale e' spesso "frozen" e poco disponibile ma abbastanza professionale, male i doorman, pessimo lo starbucks interno, ottimo room service buono lo staff ai piani 
20092 Stayed on first floor. Service excellent. Nicely decorated for Xmas. Looks brand new everywhere. Room very clean and modern. Excellent value for $55. Fabulous breakfast. Complete with Texas shaped waffles! Kids loved it! 
20093 Big room. Great Bed. OK style. Kinda slow at the registration counter. Lots of food choices outside hotel...Starbucks, McDondalds 100 ft. away. Times Square is a traffic problem but think of it more as 8th and 43rd and you can get around really easily via subways and busses. 
20094 Eigentlich ein ganz prima Hotel, gut gelegen,Zimmer ok. Leider fehlte die Freundlichkeit an der Rezeption! Schade. 
20095 No check-in problems. Clean room overlooking St. Patrick's, nice new mattresses and fluffy towels. Common areas and room were dust and mold free and spotlessly clean. HVAC worked well and was silent. Room was quiet and had blackout curtains that worked well. Wifi worked. 
20096 This hotel is very nice. I bid for a 3 1/2 * and got it for $40----$53 and change total on Priceline. I can't think of anything negative, except parking was tight. Employees were very friendly. Rooms nice. 
20097 we went the day before Thanksgiving and left the following sunday. It was clean, hospitable, and a good stay. Only complaint was the elevators which were being renovated, thus a bit of a pain as we had to wait so long. We will return! 
20098 Try not to star gawk! Celebritiea everywhere we wanted to respect their privacy, but Brahman Kelleher is such a talented musician, artist, producer, songwriter, shall I go on. I just love "missing you" from the penthouse suite at the ritz and allni can say is Magic! This place is magic! 
20099 We stayed at the Blakely with a toddler and an infant in a two room suite, and it was perfect. The staff was very friendly, the room was very clean, the crib was new, and the service was excellent. You can't find a better room in Midtown for the price! 
20100 The service is wonderful. Their in house restaurant bistro 59 has the most amazing food. The front desk staff are very friendly. The only downside is their parking. It is quite inconvenceing especially when the joel osteen church has a service 
20101 The room is great, modern design, quiet, very comfortable bed. The must is the pool in the lobby with its adjacent bar. The best way to relax after a day of shopping! 
20102 We stayed at the Kitano for two nights in January. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are spacious. Very nice quiet midtown location away from Times Square. Quick cab ride to either uptown or downtown. 
20103 Bij een volgend bezoek aan NY is de kans heel groot dat we opnieuw voor Hotel Metro kiezen. We hadden schitterend weer in maart en konden genieten van het fantastische dakterras. Uitmuntende ligging, kortom een echte aanrader!! 
20104 Tutto come ci aspettavamo. Ottima location, stanza sufficientemente grande (avevamo una stanza con due double beds - 2 adulti e 2 bambini piccoli). Bagno abbastanza nuovo, pulito. Unico difetto, faceva caldo e l'aria condizionata fa TANTO rumore, meglio solo il ventilatore. 
20105 Great views, modern decor, clean and comfy. One of my favorite hotels in Lower Manhattan! I've stayed here many time and I've never been disappointed. My reservation has always been accurate and check-in is hassle free. Great location with easy access to the subway! 
20106 We had a great experience while visiting the Congress Plaza Hotel. Advantage: Near the subway station "Lasalle", very near the Millennium park, Navy Pier, Adler Planetorium, Shredd Aquarium and Soldier Field. 
20107 A very good location.Staff very nice. Nice lobby and resturant Rooms adaquate and clean 
20108 This is a very nice , clean hotel with a very nice little bar for drink after a long day of meetings. 
20109 Hotel scomodo per visitare la prima volta new york, troppo fuori mano, le pulizie lasciano a desiderare e il personale (a parte i fattorini molto affidabili e carini) i concergie sono poco affidabili! Unico vantaggio la cucina, comoda per la prima colazione e se si vuole mangiare in camera. 
20110 hotel nuovissimo, spazioso, molto pulito e dotato di tutti i comfort! ottima posizione, personale professionale!!! 
20111 Check in was easy, the room was clean, pillows were not flat. This hotel has the easiest on and off access to Katy Fwy that I know of. I am more than satisfied with what we paid and what we got. Plus, they accept pets. 
20112 Good location...horrible service. Had bikes stolen from property; hotel could have cared less. Room was nicely decorated but soundproofing must be poor...could hear everything in the hallway. Really not worth the money. 
20113 With a very short walk, guests may reach dozens of Broadway shows. Subway is about 100 yds away. Room was nice, mine had a view of Times Square. Nice bar and cafe, friendly reception. Will stay again! 
20114 The hotel was in a great location and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The hotel was very clean. We are excited to stay at the Alex again in the future and tell all our friends about it. 
20115 Clean, safe, comfortable, GREAT BEDS!, friendly staff, competitively priced, great location Have recommended it to many friends & family who travel to NYC 
20116 Catching the subway just outside helps u make the most of your stay. Fresh, renovated room and now the hotel lobby is in the process of being renovated. Elevators take you straight to your floor, plenty of restaurants/cafes and a few bars nearby. 
20117 This hotel very is well located in the center of everthing. The staff is extraordinary and I have to do a little mentioned to Matt, he's friendly and helpful. The room is compact but enough for us and very silent. Go there and check for yourself. 
20118 From 24 to 29th of April my mother and I stayed at the Washington Square Hotel to discover NY. What a great cosy hotel in the friendly Village. Coffee and Tea in the room, healthy breakfast and very friendly staff. I'm going to recommend it to my friends! 
20119 Ho soggiornato dal 24 agosto al 02 settembre posizione centralissima difficile trovare di meglio al prezzo da loro proposto Staff gentile e disponibile al centro di rockfeller plaza vicino ad ogni cosa sia a piedi che con i mezzi pubblici 
20120 Nice hotel close to Timesquare and Central Park. Get a room away from the street. The view is bad but there is no noise at all. Lots of coffee shops for breakfast in the area. 
20121 This is an excellent hotel. The staff are very helpful and the rooms are just lovely. It is very close to the George Brown Conference Centre and walking distance to some great restaurants. Room service was great. The breakfast included in the room rate was excellent. 
20122 We stayed for one night and this is an average Hilton. Room was clean, bedding good, bathroom was OK. We got the room for $125 on Priceline, a bargain basement buy for NYC. All in all a good stay. 
20123 The premises are due for renovation in February, and rightly so. A little worn around the edges, nothing major. Again, the service was great. Great food, too. I look forward to visiting again in August (projected) when the fix-up is complete. 
20124 Very courteous staff - Connie and Andrew are the best! Food was great at Ginger's! Very secure location! Clean Hotel with all the extras! 
20125 Wonderful staff. Friendly, great location. Rooms are huge. So convient to the Galleria for shopping. We stay here every year for Christmas shopping. Wonderful resturants near by. Perfect getaway. Great value for the money. 
20126 It was our first trip to New York and the hotel and staff were top notch. Little things like turning the a/c down when they finish servicing the room so that is was cool when we came back in from the HOT New York summer days. 
20127 Staff, restaurants, location all outstanding! A couple of blocks from the Gold Coast trail. The Pump Room restaurant is perfect for breakfast and/or dinner. Nice wine list too. 
20128 My coworkers and I stayed 2 weeks at the hotel and the staff met our every need,from the restaurant to the rooms the doorman our stay was great .The security staff was also helpful especially Frampton Wilson who gave warm greetings and tips and advice on getting around 
20129 The Wolcott is such a great location, steps fom 5th avenue. Rooms are very clean, comfortable and warm. 
20130 Stayed here for a week on business. Spacious rooms, great personalized treatments. My favorite thing was the complimentary coffee / tea counter set up in the morning at the parlor complete with to-go cups! 
20131 Consigliamo questo hotel a coppie di giovani che passano poco tempo in camera. Ottima posizione a 2 passi da Empire state Building, camera spartana, bagno piccolo, il tutto cmq pulito. Camera al 5 piano rumorosissima. 
20132 Stayed 1 night at this hotel on business trip. Location is good, lobby looks OK, but room is small and desperately needs upgrade. For $200 per night in New York downtown, I didn't expect any sort of luxury but room feels like a motel. 
20133 We stayed there for three days and we loved the entire staff. They were very responsive to all of our requests. We did the breakfast package and I would highly recommend this package. The food from the National was outstanding. 
20134 I stayed at this hotel for a weekend while a family member was hospitalized nearby. The hotel provides a free shuttle to the Medical Center which was really nice since parking at the MedCtr is a premium. Be sure to ask the reception about "hospital rates." 
20135 I stayed here for 3 nights and it was great. Service was really good. The roof top bar is incredible but so so dear!!! Free wifi in hotel which is a bonus. The continental breakfast was lovely but it had the option to pay for the full breakfast. 
20136 Excellent hotel overall....nice and quiet, perfect location, friendly helpful staff and very good value for money Would definitely recommend this hotel 
20137 The staff was wonderful and very helpful. I enjoyed my stay.The breakfast selection was good as well.... 
20138 The location is wonderful and you we loved swimming at the 42nd floor looking back to the fifth avenue..... 
20139 The hotel has a great location and good staff also. 
20140 Great hotel. We arrived early and they had a room for us. They also allowed a late checkout and bag storage at no charge. The room was clean and comfortable and hotel was in a central location and really quiet. Staff were super friendly and really helpful. 
20141 Wij zijn zeer tevreden over dit hotel. Ligging is uitstekend. Direct bij de metro, dus zeer snel in downtown Manhattan! Kamers zijn niet groot, maar wel zeer schoon. Iedere dag schone handdoeken! Vriendelijk personeel! Er liggen zat restaurants in de omgeving. 
20142 Spent 4 nights there recently. Very clean, friendly athmosphere. All day coffee in nice lounge with books to borrow and to leave your read books. Good location too. Took the bus down Broadway, free sightseeing tour. Good breakfast, often "had" to share a table and met nice people and tips. 
20143 But the worst thing was the lighting in the bathroom. I could hardly see my face in the mirror. Nothing to report home about. 
20144 My husband and I had a fabulous time. Everything about the Sex in the City package was true and the staff could not have been nicer. We would come back again and again. The location was great especially if you want to tour, shop or hang-out in Soho and beyond. 
20145 If you are looking to stay in Time square, this hotel is great. The hotel is unique with a gothic or dark design. The rooms are really small but well equipped with all modern amenities. You are not disturbed by any loud noise. Maybe more suitable with travellers w/0 children. 
20146 Beautiful spotless hotel. Excellent location, amazing food and well priced drinks. Miliha at guest services is extremely kind, knowledgeable, elegant and eloquent. Steps away from the best shopping, theatre and restaurants. We will be back! Dr. Bruce 
20147 I stayed at Sofitel in July. The experience was wonderful especially the staff in the hotel - they know how to deliver an excellent service the their guests. This hotel will be my #1 choice in NYC. 
20148 master bedroom is fine - the rest is not as advertised: the sofa bed mattress is torture, the 'free' wifi and access to gym is not free and the staff was not very helpful with any requests/ questions. Location is good but other than that I would pass. 
20149 Great nice, clean hotel. Large rooms. Alot of rooms even have a sofa bed. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Located at 52nd Street and 3rd Avenue - - Walked to Rockefeller Center and Times Square area and touristy areas. Near subway stop. Nice area. 
20150 The staff at the hotel was very helpful and friendly. Easy access to public transportation to get to downtown and museum campus. The rooms were clean and the free parking was a bonus. It is expensive to park your car at a hotel in Chicago. 
20151 Check out The Blue Bar for classic cocktails and first class service. Ask for Christian behind the bar--he is amazing. 
20152 Hotel met goede prijs-kwaliteitsverhouding en gunstig gelegen op loopafstand van Times Square en metrostations. Kamer voorzien van airco, koelkast, koffiezetapparaat en magnetron. Lekkere bedden die niet doorzakken (maar wel een beetje kort voor lange mensen). Ontbijt volop verkrijgbaar bij Deli in de buurt. 
20153 Great location with very good service. They upgraded us to the Penthouse at checkin which was nice as it had a balcony...in NYC. The room was small but comparable to most rooms in NY...and you are never in the room in NY anyway. 
20154 The hotel is in the heart of Times Square, but is away from all the noise of Times Square. The rooms are quite small but are very clean, was able to check in straight away upon arrival. 
20155 Just perfect, a few blocks from Time Square, really comfortable. The employees were friendly and helpfull. The hotel is really clean and well decorated. Situated in the hart of the city and close to central park. Wanna book a nice hotel, go to Wellington... 
20156 We were able to check in early, received a discount at the little terrace restaurant next door and we just steps away from Central Park, Times Square, Rockefeller Center. I'd stay again! 
20157 Great location--a couple of blocks off Michigan Ave. Great staff. Great cookies. Recommend the restaurant. Very comfortable. 
20158 Perfect location, close to Times Square and number of metro stations. Many attractions nearby reachable by foot. Good breakfast buffet with full range of cold and hot buffet. 
20159 The customer service was wonderful. You could not ask for better. I felt as if I was the only person staying at the property. They handled us with first class service throughout the stay. We were given dinner suggestion and given event information that was happening in the Galleria. 
20160 The hotel was clean and it was in a good location. Close to shopping and to the empire state building. The service was very good. The staff were all friendly and courteous. 
20161 It's pathetic that a hotel charges more for a pet fee than the actual room expense itself. Then management's explanation is that "there is a sign on the counter that specifies this policy". GREAT customer service people, really. Obviously this Hilton chain does NOT want repeat customers. 
20162 i had so much fun the hotel was ready on time and already had drinks for us 
20163 it is a great hotel, clean, great bathroom and great TV... 
20164 Attentive bell staff and front desk. Nice room, a good stay. 
20165 The Mayfair was very convenient to Times Square, the staff was friendly and the rooms were clean. Even though the rooms were a bit on the small side, in NY we only use the room for sleeping and the beds were very comfortable. 
20166 Quiet little boutique hotel just off Times Square by all the big theatres. Good restaurant, very well appointed rooms and you can usually get a great deal on the price. Good haven from the hussle and bussle if you need to be in Times Square. 
20167 Nice, clean, new hotel. Easy check in. Staff was very helpful. We had a room at the end of the hall and it was pretty quiet. Room and elevators were a little on the small side, buts its NYC. Great location. Would definitely stay there again. 
20168 Het hotel ligt zeer gunstig ten opzichte van de theaters. Een net hotel, maar de eenpersoonskamers zijn wel erg klein. Geen tafel of stoel, alleen een klein bed en een kleine kast. De wireless internet verbinding slecht. Er is wel een kabel te krijgen. 
20169 Stayed there for business and returned for leisure. An amzing decor and reasonably priced when booking with the right site. Located in the heart of downtown, it is a beautiful place to stay. 
20170 Location is convenient. Hotel staff is courteous and cordial. Plenty of food for breakfast. Grounds are maintained. Room was clean, AC worked well and bed was bery comfortable. Flat screen TV, few movie channels, free wi-fi. Would stay again 
20171 Todo perfecto. El trato del servicio fue excelente muy amables. Lo unico a destacar es que el aparthotel esta un poco lejos del centro unos 20 o 25 min andando. Pero todo lo demas muy bien. La limpieza bastante bien. 
20172 Perfect location with endless amounts entertainment in Time Square. The hotel was well staffed and always concerned about assisting us. Room were very clean and rather large for NYC standards. Would suggest requesting the 10-15 th floor 
20173 Only regret not being able to stay longer. 
20174 Room was quite Spacious.. for NYC Standards, Clean & very Comfortable! Loved the Location.. walking distance to some of my favorite Boutiques in Soho! 
20175 Had a spacious well decorated room for a couple nights in February. Room service was pretty good, bellman coming to get bags was a little slow. Overall this is an amazing hotel and I was very satisfied. 
20176 Ik heb met mijn zoon een prima verblijf gehad. Kamer is sober maar voldoet prima en is schoon. Helaas geen wifi in de kamers maar alleen in de lobby. Personeel is vriendelijk. De ligging was voor ons uitstekend, alles is makkelijk te bereiken vanuit hier. 
20177 Quite rusty place, but the room was ok sized with an extra (third) bed for one of the kids. Good location close to subway, Chinatown and Little Italy. Very small bathroom, but it was clean. Friendly and service minded staff. 
20178 the wife and l stayed here 20 jan 2012 5 nights staff were great hotel and rooms very clean and warm great location for timesquare and shoping 
20179 Rented a suite here, but must warn that view was a disappointment (compared to website 'guarantees') as was breakfast and price. You can do better in Times Square. This place is a true tourist trap. 
20180 I really loved this hotel. It was a good location if you are in town on business or pleasure. The rooms were fabulous, it was big city style without the attitude. 
20181 The staff was very gracious and hospitable. I think we ordered room service like 6 times while we stayed there and each time the service was impeccable and the food was great! I spent a day around the pool and they treated you like royalty. 
20182 We were very pleased in all aspects of staying at the hotel, cleanliness, helpfulness and personalization with guests. Also the convenience, because there was a shuttle that took us to and from MD Anderson. 
20183 Everything was perfect -- the room was available at 10 am when we checked in and we got a free upgrade to a king-sized bed in the room. At 11am, we got a complimentary glass of champagne in the lobby ... A perfect start to a girl's weekend. 
20184 Hotel che a prima vista sembra minimale, ma che nasconde in se ottime soluzioni. In particolare ottima posizione, pulito, confortevole, spazioso. Anche la colazione a 6.99 dollari e' ottima e soddisfacente. Forse unica pecca la disponibilita' di Internet solo a pagamento (mi sembra circa 10 USD/giorno) Sicuramente consiglio questo hotel 
20185 All its good also the resraurant is very good if you don't want to eat rhe all fried food in USA. The only unconvenuent it's that it is too faraway from the city. By train 3/4 or one hour. Taxi frim the downtown $33 
20186 Heerlijk bed met prima ontbijtbuffet (als je de kamer inclusief ontbijt boekt). Schoon hotel met goede, gratis, service op het gebied van Internet. Minpuntje: pas na 2 keer vragen werd de bedbank van de kinderen opgemaakt en 1 keer zijn ze vergeten schone handdoeken te geven. 
20187 This is a cozy but lively hotel in NYC. We enjoyed the energy and decor, food and entertainment. Our room was amazingly quiet - no street noise though lots of traffic, and no neighbor noise. Good location for walking about. 
20188 Very nice location, staff was very helpful, rooms were very clean. Has a pool which is a big plus. Would definately stay again. 
20189 ottima posizione metro accanto all hotel pub interessanti x il dopocena 
20190 Nice hotel in a great location. We were allowed to check our bags & check in early, which let us make the most of our short weekend in NYC. We will be back! 
20191 Every aspect of our stay here was more than adequate. Friendly, helpful staff, convenient location, pristine room, high quality breakfast and all-day drinks facilities. Cookies at reception and a flower market on the path outside every day. 
20192 I had never been offered 1 tiny hole of a room with see-through bathroom facility and very loud air con for 2 girlfriends (not a couple) before!!! What were they thinking? No need to say we didn't actually stay. 
20193 This hotel is one of the best in New York. Very friendly staff, from the doormen to the concierge!! Beautiful comfortable beds. Close to everything! 
20194 Hotel directly on a Broadway. A kind it something shaking. From windows it is visible present new-york. Not so big beds, but good number. A parity the quality price - quite good. I recommend 
20195 Muy buen hotel por el precio, exelente servicio y atencion, pero esta muy retirado del aereopuerto y no cuenta con transportacion gratuita, por lo tanto si esa era tu idea, no es la mejor opcion. Por todo lo demas es 100% recomendable. 
20196 the service in this hotels was excellent and i like the idea of feeding the fish all the time 
20197 This hotel was very nice. Great location few blocks from times square, central park, today show, David Letterman etc.. 
20198 Sinceramente el hotel es normal tirando a flojo, pero lo mejor sin duda es una ubicacion excepcional, al lado del empire y cruzando la calle el madison square garden. si no eres demasiado exigente para dormir, creo que es suficiente para unos dias. 
20199 It's okay for a couple of nights. Places to eat close by. There's a sort of shop (locked) that sells stuff - never went in to look Easy parking Not too difficult to find. Handy for escaping west. Easy for the beltway and routs to airport. 
20200 Enjoyed the cool room, the friendly staff and the great location. The bed was comfortable and the room had everything you would need ... 
20201 I cannot say enough about this hotel! Perfect location, very nice staff, clean rooms, quiet neighborhood. Will definitely be back. 
20202 tres bien place et pas cher mais a quel prix !!! des cafards dans une chambre insaluble eviter cote rue ;-) 
20203 Not only does the Radisson Martinique on Broadway have the perfect location, the customer service and the staff are great! I have stayed at the hotel twice and each time I have received stlellar service. I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends and family. 
20204 It was ok, not the best, but a decent location if nothing else. 
20205 Room was very clean and a great value at $100 on a Sunday night. Public areas well done and modern. I had a double that would be a bit crowded for two but fine for one. Bathroom is tiny, especially access to shower. Staff was accommodating and friendly. 
20206 Cool wintergarden-restaurant, room was rather small but comfortable. We enjoyed it very much there. Staff is friendly and helpful! 
20207 This hotel is the worst I have ever stayed in.. The art inside the rooms is beyond infantile and is almost offensive.. The staff are supercilious and the food is terrible.. And the prices are bizarre.. 
20208 Great Hotel but,brunch needs a tune up sevice is slow, waiters look lost at times.The rooms are the best for 250sqft .The guest are very fun group so we had a great time.The area is the best in New York. 
20209 Four foriegn exchange students and two teachers stayed four nights in three rooms. Loved the location, staff was great, free breakfast, and wonderful warm cookies late afternoon. Outstanding! 
20210 Just as billed. Friendly staff, attentive service, value. Room was clean and just what I wanted. In the location I had a meeting so first time here. Will come back in the future. Breakfast was good and service perfect 
20211 Stayed for one night, last minute. They quoted us one price on the phone and something different once inside. Gorgeous property & gorgeous rooms but staff was unwilling to give us a late check out, or accommodate our needs. Disappointing considering the price of a room. 
20212 We spent short but a great time in Chicago.It was really a " windy city "..Museums, pizzas, streets, skyscrapers all were fantastic.I miss there and wish to see the ciyt soon... 
20213 I waited for over an hour on the phone with the front desk and tech support to get an internet connection. As a result, I was unable to conduct some very important and urgent business. 
20214 The rooms were disappointing, they looked dated and the bathroom was small and very dated. People at reception and concierge were extremely friendly and helpful. We were on level 26 and the view was very nice. Facilities were lacking i.e no USB ports or charges available. 
20215 this was a nice hotel, fantastic loctaion!!!!! clean towels everyday, bed was changed once in the 4 nights we stayed staff were very helpfull room was basic but served the purpose...and when your in newyork your not in your room much anyway haha 
20216 not far away from the times square, good hotel overall. one incident where i forgot 240 $ in the drawer and the housekeeper took it away! i informed the hotel manager who knew the lady but didnt do anything. wounderful conceirge, front desk 
20217 Great location and nice rooms. It is close to most everything Time Square Rockefeller plaza. There are lots of great places to eat and plenty to see. 
20218 This hotel is cool if you don't plan on staying in your room during your stay. Its a place to ----, shower and shave. The beds were clean theres a little food store and the bottom and Puffy shoot em up club is right next door! 
20219 I am not that fussy. Dirty, NO INTERNET, and a constant knock in the wall forced me to wear ear plugs to get to sleep. Do not stay here. 
20220 Great hotel. It is very modern but comfortable. Everyone is friendly. Beds are very comfy and the rooms quiet. Great for being in the heart of the city. 
20221 Clean, comfortable, good service, great price and EXCELLENT location. Free breakfast. Will stay here again - for sure! 
20222 Comfortable and plush without being stuffy. A lovely spacious room that was a pleasure to come back to in the evening. Very nice, helpful staff. A N.Y Times waiting for us outside our room every morning. And perhaps the best location on Manhattan for exploring both uptown and downtown. 
20223 Great location 2 minutes walking to Time Square, Great staff and very friendly. Room was very clean, towels were change everyday and bed was done everynight. Will stay here again and will recommend to anyone who ask me. Great place to stay when visiting New York. 
20224 Hotel met een goede prijs/kwaliteitverhouding. Gunstig gelegen t.o.v. Broadway en andere hoogtepunten. Kamer was net gerenoveerd en van alle gemakken voorzien. Personeel was zeer behulpzaam en professioneel. 
20225 Had a week at this hotel. It was excellent, good staff, good room, good bar - Brandon the bar tender was excellent. Good breakfast, good location, in fact it was all good, even the price. Would definitely stay there again and again. Thank you. 
20226 Very Nice 4 star hotel, the bar, gym, spa are 5 star but comes at a price. We had Sunday brunch at Normas...Great Burger just off the Lobby... really cool bar.... breath taking view of the city from the roof top pool. We will be back. 
20227 Top hotel !!! I liked it very much there , would like to return someday !!! 
20228 Camera ampia,pulizie piu' volte al giorno,assenza completa dei rumori del traffico e delle stanze vicine sono le cose positive;meno positive la vista sul cortile interno con rumore dei motori per il condizionamento,una hall abbastanza piccola e personale cortese ma solo se sollecitato 
20229 Very well located, close to Metro Stations, restaurants, stores... Good reception desk. Room was very small, unconfortable. Bed was terrible, too small, no sleep quality. Very noisy. Lobby was allways full, many air companies people around. 
20230 My wife and I have just returned from a trip to NYC, we stayed at the Ritz-Carlton Central Park for five nights. Everything was perfect inculding the rooms, food concierge and service. Only small let down was the lack of gym/pool facilities. 
20231 This hotel is wonderful decorated, has an excellent service and very modern bathroom/bedrooms.Of course, your have to pay for everything quite a lot, there was nothing complimentary. Breakfast and bar expensive. Great location at the central park and near broadway, times square, busses and subways. Really to recommend. 
20232 This hotel is very basic but good and has a great location and that all that matters when you travel to NY (unless you're on your honeymoon...) I would definitely go back to it on my next trip. 
20233 Hotel in buona posizione ma con servizio decisamente scarso. Pessimo Rapporto qualita' - prezzo Le camere piccole, sporche e antiquate. Lo staff non attento ai bisogni degli ospiti. Internet solo a pagamento con tariffe esagerate senza la possibilita' di stampare nessun documento. 
20234 Great Location, Friendly Staff, room itself was larger then expected for NYC hotels. Only down-side needed new carpet yesterday. Besides that, enjoyed the stay at the lucerne. Room service and NiceMatin their restaurant were above average. Would stay their again and would recommend to all. 
20235 Nice rooms that are very clean. Direct TV in the rooms which is nice if you have a long stay. The only bad thing is the location if you don't have a car. Not much to do within walking distance. I definitely recommend for a short stay. 
20236 nice hotel,but as soon as you walk out the door you are mobbed with people.i would not stay there again be cause of its location,unless you are a party animal.try the waldorff,its way better and same price! 
20237 Had a terrific stay at this well located hotel! Fantastic room, amenities, and service. Will definitely be back! 
20238 We stayed at the Comfort Inn Lower East Side in August 2012. Service is excellent and the staff is very helpfull and friendly, beds are too small, location is nice and animated (specially on friday and saturday nights). 
20239 You can not beat the price for this hotel. It looked like a five star hotel for the price of a two star hotel. Rooms are spacious and very clean. The bed was very comfortable. 
20240 I stayed here for an overnight visit to MD Anderson. The location is terrific, and the hotel is clean, well-lit and well-appointed, with a Starbucks downstairs. 
20241 Hope to stay at the Palace again very soon. Can't give this hotel enough praise! 
20242 Maravilloso y moderno hotel en Times Square 
20243 Very impressed with hotel - great central location and views of Times Square. King suite perfect space for family of four (closing doors between bedrooms) lovely. Restaurant reasonable price and quality. 
20244 We hosted an event at this hotel and it was fabulous. Service and staff were excellent; food and beverage superb and the location unmatched. Definite value for the money. Our attendees loved the location, the rooms and the staff. Highly recommend this location! 
20245 max 2 adults per room, there is hardly enough room with luggage, otherwise good location for a short break. bar and restaurant poor 
20246 I've been staying at this hotel for years and it just gets better and better. The rooms are large, comfortable and quiet, the staff is friendly and helpful and it is centrally located to everywhere I need to be when in Manhattan on business. 
20247 Als je enkel een uitvalsbasis zoekt om te slapen en je er verder geen voorstelling van hebt dan is het een prima hotel. De ligging van het hotel is super. Het hotel is oud en de service is niet best. Maar ach heb je dat in New York nodig? 
20248 This is a funky, cool hotel. Nice gym, great room service, great staff. Be careful of parking though. It's a whopping 41 bucks a night to park your vehicle. Still a great hotel. 
20249 Un excelente hotel con habitaciones super confortables! Y una ubicacion inmejorable para mi primera vez en esta ciudad maravillosa!!! Q me nos cautivo a la regresaremos muyyy pronto!!! 
20250 just visited august 19 and all I can say is wow , thanks to all front desk staff was so excited to be in 42 floor awesome view also hotel room was very clean and bed were extra soft and location was great 
20251 The hotel has a central location if you are in New York as tourist. Nice restaurants in the neighbourhood. But there is no elevator in the hotel. 
20252 Nice large room with plenty of storage space. Noisy air conditioning a problem and the shared shower/wc a bit irritating. Superb position in Greenwich village. Management very helpful at all times. 
20253 I stayed last january, and I only can say positive things about this hotel. It's been a long time I don't sleep so comfortable in a hotel room, so great bed and pillows! Excellent location, grat staff. 
20254 Good service, great locations, good drinks. Hotel is very helpful and clean. Restaurant is expensive but very good. Staff wants to please. Good restaurants close by nice car services available. Helped with flights. 
20255 Booked this hotel around July 4th, excellent location. Upgraded at checking to higher floor lake view, great view of the lake and city. Worth the price. 
20256 What a fantastic weekend and huge thanks go to Regina at the front desk! Wow! She got me in my room before noon on my check-in day and helped with directions and local attractions. She went out of her way to make my stay fantastic!!! This is an outstanding hotel!!! 
20257 NYC is notorious for really small rooms but the Affinia is spacious and comfortable. As a business traveller it was more than what I needed but when I bring my wife to NYC I am definitely bringing her to Affinia. 
20258 Perfect location in midtown Manhattan , walking distance from Central Park over looking Times Square. Impeccable friendly service. Extremely clean very spacious rooms. Very reasonable rates. THE BEST HOTEL IN THE CITY!!! 
20259 Pros: Friendly and helpful staff Location OK size room for New York Cons: Inadequate toilet plumbing Dodgy WIFI Poor condition of towelling TV on last legs Lack of light and ventilation in room Noisy air conditioning Pathetic breakfast offering 
20260 We stayed in the hotel for 6 nights in a superior room Everything was perfect for us The room and the bathroon were big for NY The neighbourhood is quite and not in touristic area but the subway is close and you can go anywhere without problems 
20261 The Surrey is a great mix of size, luxury and service, The rooms are very nice, NIce style and comfort. the beds are fantastic. The location is great, right in the middle of the upper east side.The roof top terrace bar is special and the regular bar is great. 
20262 Rooms very comfortable, spacious, clean, excellent location, two blocks from Michigan Avenue, excellent breakfast. Negative: charged internet connection U$S 15.00 per day. Too expensive!!!!! 
20263 O.K. hotel , Excellent location very helpful and friendly staff 
20264 Thin walls , good beds very average 2.5-3 star at best. We paid $109.00 per night ,I would not have wanted to spend more on this hotel. 
20265 My sister and I took our Mother to see the Christmas decorations. We loved the Affinia. It had 2 bathrooms and a small kitchen. It was perfect for us. 
20266 Second time at the Chandler Hotel and will definitely come back. The room was super clean, we even had a King bed (it was supposed to be a queen one). The only things missing were the beautiful paintings in the Lobby due to some renovations. 
20267 Reasonably priced rooms and convenient location. We were very pleased with our Park Central experience! 
20268 This is simply one of the top hotels in NYC. The service is phenomenal, the property striking, and the service fabulous. There aren't too many better locations to be in midtown, close to shopping, dining, and across the street from central park. 
20269 Quiet location with access to everything to everything Manhattan has to offer. 
20270 Fantastic location, just 3 blocks from Times Square. Supermarket, ATM and a great Diner (great for breakfast) just around the corner. The rooms are clean and have everything you need. Well made use of the space. We'd definitely stay here again! 
20271 I've stayed at a lot of NY hotels over the years. But I always ask for the Parker. When they say "Up town, Not Uptight." , that's me. 
20272 Posizione nel cuore di Manhattan. Metropolitana a 2 passi, a chi piace camminare Central Park e Soho raggiungibili a piedi in 30 min. Taxi ovunque, come sempre. Hotel nuovo e pulito. Personale gentilissimo. Per la colazione consiglio The Blue Dog, sulla 25th vicino alla 6a avenue. 
20273 Hotel bruyant, insalubre, salle d'eau inaccessible, fuite douche, WC. Escalier dangereux. Bon accueil. Hotel a bannir. 
20274 This hotel is beautiful. The staff is very accommodating. The rooms have kitchen facilities hidden behind beautiful wall units. Great to have your own bottle of Champagne. Great views of the East River and Chrysler Building. 
20275 This hotel must have great managers to have such a smooth operation. Quick check in, clean rooms, full breakfast (with pancakes!), no noise and a great direction givers! Will definitely stay here on my next visit to the texas medical center! 
20276 This was quite the hopping place for NYE! Good bar atmosphere - although it got kinda crazy late at night. Great room with a beautiful view of the Chicago skyline. They even gave us a gift bag with water, a disposable camera and some goodies when we checked in! 
20277 I went last year for the Macy's parade and was surprise that it was RIGHT there. The place was small and the rooms were tiny but it was comfortable and clean. The price was right and it was within great distance from lots of NYC places. Overall good time~ 
20278 This is grand, old hotel that is convenient to CYA, restaurants (that are open past 6:00 PM, and downtown offices. Hilton-quality service and common areas. Rooms are old, sometimes small but perfectly fine. I try to stay here whenever in town in business. 
20279 Room is old. With the price I paid, should have stayed somewhere better. 
20280 I loved this hotel, great service and boutique rooms - best breakfast we had while in the states and an iPad in each room with free internet who could ask for more. 
20281 great hotel excellent service! i was fully satisficed i loveee the ubication ;) congrats! 
20282 the hotel's location is fantastic! walking around is more than a pleasure! the design is fabulous and the staff very friendly! the food was also great! The rooms are nice with a wonderful view, a bit small, but is New York! I enjoyed very much my stay! 
20283 I stayed at this hotel from December 9 through 11. It was clean, gorgeous room, stylish, clean and wonderful bathroom, bath products were great, excellent internet service, excellent service from the staff, bed was so comfortable, pillows great, cannot complain one bit. Thank you for a great trip! 
20284 Once again a great stay in NYC at Westin Times Square. Service,hospitality,clean and great views. I love this hotel. Looking forward to staying there again..Bar 10 was terrific as well. 
20285 The great stay in my life. rooms are great, large, good locations, all the bars , restaurants, theaters, broadway , market, cvs,coffe are walking distance, all very good. nice amenities and real pleasure in the bar area i will return to this amazing hotel 
20286 An outstanding small boutique hotel in the theater district. Comfortable rooms, friendly staff. Three cheers for Alex, Pinto and Jasmine. Just steps away from many theaters and Sardi's. Excellent quality food. 
20287 Was there for a seminar, and these following employees should be commended on their politeness, accomidating, and expectional attitudes. Lorenzo Davis, Nancy O'Connell, Michael Chorosti, and Elwin Kelly, thankyou. 
20288 best location right on Times sq' relatively large rooms, wierless in rooms free access to wiered computer at the lobby. Clean, very helpfull reception, Best value for money. Breakfeast can be improved. Highly recomended. 
20289 Needed a last minute hotel in midtown for a business trip. The City Club was a terrific experience. Helpful Staff, Free in room wi-fi, good sized clean room with plenty of light. ...and the cookie before bed was a welcoming touch. 
20290 All very superficial> Looks good from the outside, public areas ok but rooms old and tired. Dont bother Chicago is well served with far better 4 star hotels than this. 
20291 everyone was great they make you feel like family especially neringa the lead mixologist she has a great personality very friendly ,I will definetly be staying there again.I would recommend this hotel to everyone. 
20292 The concierge was fantastic and cleanliness outstanding. 
20293 they suck they are the worst hotel i have ever stayed at!! 
20294 We decided that our "girls weekend" needed to be done right so we picked Za-Za after checking out the website. The hotel is beautiful and the staff was attentive and incredibly friendly. They worked really hard to make sure that not only was our stay wonderful but our entire visit! 
20295 The Michelango was beautiful and the staff top-notch. I intend to stay there next time I'm in NYC. We were upgraded to a junior suite for $50 more and it was a lovely room. Great decor and nice touches. 
20296 Stayed here because I found this to be the best price in the Marriott chain. Close to all transportation and close to time square. Good staff, neat room! 
20297 This was a lovely hotel and a pretty good price (for New York!). The staff were very helpful and the rooms were kept clean. It's freshly renovated so looked quite nice inside. 
20298 The hotel is well located (half block from Times Square), the room is good and the beds are really comfortable, the reception was excelent. I recommend this hotel for all these reasons, and when we return to New York, we certainly will stay at this hotel. 
20299 Exstreme friendly staff all over. From the time you arrive you know they're there to provide excellent services. Stayed at Martinique for 4 nights late september 2011. Brillant location - midtown Manhatten - but ALL Manhatten at a reach. 
20300 chic and modern. Beautiful hotel with fantastic amenities. 
20301 Very nice room, confortble bed, clean and new bathroom, excelent location. Just 5 minutes walking to times square. Nice staff. Ice and coffe machines and lots of candys on the lobby. Free wireless in room. Goog price. 
20302 I cannot fault this hotel. The rooms are big, and very clean. The reception staff are very helpful and pleasant. The location is IMMENSE. would go back!! 
20303 The hotel room was clean. The bed was comfortable, I had everything I needed. The restaurant wasn't great and it has very awkward floor plan - not exactly inviting. However you are so close to so many other restaurants that I just went elsewhere. Overall I would stay again. 
20304 Over all good hotel. But if you need to get to your airport transportation you may want to look some where else 
20305 I waited for pick up for an hour..then late getting to the airport. ThinK taxi instead.. 
20306 We stayed at the Casablanca hotel for one night only. The room was very nice and the staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in Rick's cafe was just right. We would stay here again definitely. 
20307 The views were amazing, the amenities were terrific, the bed was incredibly comfortable. And the staff was friendly, helpful and unassuming. We were very impressed. 
20308 My husband and I spend an evening at the W Hotel in New York City and we where extremely pleased with the accomodations and customer service we received. We look forward to another stay soon. We highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking for a comfortable stay when in NY. 
20309 This is a great property in one of the most idea locations in Chicago. The rooms are a great size and it is very clean for an older property. Service is solid. 
20310 i have stayed at several different hotels in NYC but i would have to say this is my favorite. Close to everything,the staff was amazing. i would ask for a room away from the street. 
20311 As a Starwoods member, I was upgraded with a view of the Park. It was such a treat at such an affordable rate. I would go back in a minute. 
20312 Spent 3 nights at this Hotel during Thanksgiving Novemember 2004. Shared a triple room with my daughter, so plenty of space, although noisy would recommend to anyone. Staff very helpful and felt safe. Also well positioned for the main sights. U.K. visitors. 
20313 location & view are perfect, staff very friendly & very helpful, double rooms small, therefore suite advisable for 2. in short: quite simple, but absolutely sufficient 
20314 The hotel is old and needs a serious makeover, I even felt dirty taking a shower there! But worst of all, my friend who was staying there HAD BUG BITES on his body after sleeping there. 
20315 New, modern, but small rooms....surprisingly so. Easy to use check-in kiosk for airport in hotel check-in lobby...Lavazza coffee next door...convenient to MM..... Not great deal, but fair for location....can be spotted from Hancock T! 
20316 We were steps away from the finest dining and shopping at this location. The parking was close and convenient. Best of all, the bed and pillows were so comfortable, I wish I could bring the bed home with me!! Fantastic! 
20317 Only stayed one night but the rooms are nice and comfy. Plane noise is minimal. Pools looked nice but I didn't use them. Not a big fan of the restaurant either but I will stay there when I'm back in may. 
20318 Whenever I have stayed here, I leave convinced it's the best hotel in New York, the service is amazing, the turn of the century details excellent, the furnighings are great and the maid and butler service are outstanding. I 
20319 This hotel offers a great location close to shopping and sight seeing. You have Navy Pier .7 miles away and In the other direction you have shopping, the Hancock building, and House of blues is .65 miles in the other direction. you can walk to everything. 
20320 This is a great spot just out of the madness!!! Cozy rooms and average prices. 
20321 This hotel was really lovely. The rooms are excellent and the beds and pillows were to die for, so luxurious. The staff were all incredible and went out of their way on numerous occasions. The only downfall was the restuarant, the food was awful, but still great service. 
20322 Very nice hotel with Pool , 5 minuteswalking distance to Pier 83 or TimesSquare. Deli in hotel or Theatre Row Diner 3 minutes walking along 42nd street. Supermarket FOOD EMPORIUM in direction to TimesSquare 
20323 Stayed for a pre wedding/Christmas break for 3 nights in December. Great hotel, fast efficient service, nice rooms (we had a standard double) and decent shower/bathroom. Location is perfect for most places if you don't mind a ten minute walk. Plus the tour bus stops nearby and there's always taxi's. 
20324 We usually stay in a king room but upgraded to a large king room. The extra $40 for the larger room and bath was well worth the money. 
20325 HOTEL TRES BIEN SITUE A QQ PAS DE BROADWAY AV QUARTIER DES BOUTIQUES METRO PROCHE; CHAMBRE NEUVE, PROPRE, BELLE DECO JUSTE UN REPROCHE LES CHAMBRES DOUBLES SONT PETITES POUR 4 idem POUR LES LITS (120cm). 
20326 A great price for a spacious, clean room in Manhattan. And the $10 parking helps, too. Outside looks dumpy, but the rooms are nice. Desk service was fine. We'll definitely stay there again. 
20327 The hotel has a young, cool vibe. Human and automated staff made everything run very smoothly and efficiently. Cool bar / restaurant with surprisingly good eats. The cleanliness of the bathroom area wasn't great. Overall, it was good value. 
20328 the hotel was fab and the staff where friendly the room was clean had any problems when we need room serves they can striaght away good hotel 
20329 Nice hotel just where I needed it! Heading out of Bush airport this hotel was perfect. Good value, great placement, shuttle to the airport. 
20330 Just stayed there for 4 days, great hotel, clean, nice rooms, great and friendly staff. Great location, walking distance to Central Park, Columbus cirlce, Time Square and Rockefeller Center. Will stay there again!! 
20331 I was somewhat nervous about this selection for lodging after Hotwire ( $ 103./night) handed it to me because I was not familar with this hotel. Guess what? VERY GOOD, AND BETTER YET, FOR THIS PRICE IT IS A STEAL. A great view, no hassle checkin/out. Excellent housekeeping. 
20332 ottimo,discreto comodissimo a tutto,silenzioso,vorresti viverci per sempre. 
20333 We stayed a this hotel only for one night, but it was great. The rooms were big and the bed confortables. Also the decoration was great, completly Baseball them, but without being tacky. Location is great also. 
20334 nice motel room clean and bathroom too but the AC really too noisy!!! 
20335 ...but beware the $14 cup of coffee through room service! Hop over the street to the Irish pub for brilliant pancakes and waffles for breakfast for only 10 bucks or so - lovely! A great location and with large and beautiful rooms; would definitely stay again. 
20336 Crew is the best, very clean, modern. Free WIFI !! definitely will stay again! 
20337 me encanto el hotel,el desayuno formidable,me encantaba estar alli,fue un acierto,simplemente perfecto,sin dudas lo recomiendo y si vuelvo volveria a este hotel sin dudarlo 
20338 Squallido, pessimo sporco meglio dormire in strada, ha di buono solo la posizione. Le immagini recensite sul sito sono false. 
20339 Stayed here for 4 nights and have zero complaints! The hotel is beautiful and spotless! Our room was perfect and the staff were so helpful and kind. 
20340 We really loved the clean, spacious suite. 2 BR, 2 BA, full kitchen for a great price! Other than that, the hotel has nothing to recommend it. No lobby, no amenities, very expensive wi-fi, etc. More of a way-station than a hotel. 
20341 Nothing special, small rooms, lousy breakfast. I can not recommend 
20342 We checked around and the Mela seemed like the best value for location and price in the area. 
20343 I just returned from a week end in New York and stayed at the Hotel Mela, June 29-July 1. Though rooms are small, it was just perfect for me. Clean and well appointed, the rooms have hypo-allergenic bedding. The staff was friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. 
20344 Very nice. Like staying in a one bedroom apt. Plenty of room. Only complaint was it's not WIFI you have to plug in. Location is great. 
20345 This stay just about completes my 5+ star hotel stays in New York and I had the best, comfortable sleep and butler service beyond any other hotel in the city. They truly check on your needs. I love the soothing luxurious decor. Truly a sanctuary if luxury , 
20346 Great location. Desk helpful Rooms neat ciomfortable and clean. Had separate elevator for pets. 
20347 I travel to Chicago frequently and after this stay I'm making the Westin River North my official hotel. The common areas and rooms are great, but the really great thing about this hotel is the staff. Everyone was outstanding - especially Sam in the workout facility. I'm definitely going back. 
20348 robert solis , indi and jonathan were very helpful 
20349 free coffee , breakfast and cookies in the cold chicago 
20350 truly value for money 
20351 VERY CLOSE TO THE BIG MACY 
20352 Everything you want and expect in a first-class hotel. They want me to add more characters to my review, but I really have nothing more to say. If you can afford to stay in this lovely hotel you will not be disappointed. Is this 200 characters yet? 
20353 The front desk staff is very wonderful and helpful.. they renovation on the hotel and i still enjoy and had a relaxing time... LILY in the front desk gave a great room considering the renovation... She is always smiling when i stay there ... 
20354 Thank you so much, I was very happy when I stay at your hotel.It was very best location, and lots of attractions around you I will be back again 
20355 en face de l'empire state bldg, a 2 pas de times quare, tous les subways : the foot ! 
20356 Low key atmosphere, 3 restaurants right next to it, including an interesting Sushi bar under the hotel...small, quiet rooms with nice wood accents and decent amenities. Easy access to all the same things as Gansevoort and Standard but 15% cheaper and minus the attitude. 
20357 No elevator, in June 08 it was under renovation, with rain comming into the staircase at the 5th floor... Room small with a very small window, bathroom basic. Not recommended for a couple. Okay for single. 
20358 This was a great find at a reasonable price on Priceline, convenient location and walking distance to 5th Ave, Times Square, Madison Square Garden, etc. Rooms were clean and ok size for the city and the service was friendly and helpful. 
20359 Many thanks to John Packard, Director of Front Office, for being accommodating. His professional and customer-oriented demeanor ensured that my colleagues and I will return for future business travel. I recommend this hotel without reservation. 
20360 Stayed with You all on 12/17/2011 to pick up my son from the airport, Lucy was so helpful and polite, I couldn't believe I was in Houston, thought I was in Louisiana....Lucy we'll be back soon... Breakfast needs some sprucing up..... 
20361 Spent one night there and had no problems. Loved the small amenities, such as mouthwash, makeup remover, shower cap, and other items. My room was clean. I was happy with my stay. Lobby staff here polite and helpful. 
20362 While I was surprised to see how small 2 double beds look in a room (been a while since I haven't been able to get my room of choice with a King), but there was plenty of space, all I needed for business travel. Service was good throughout the hotel. 
20363 Good location.Near to subway to go everywhere.Narrow space, noisy, full of odor in the room and we guessed that was the spray to repel cockroach. 
20364 We stayed at the W Hotel in Times Square for three nights as we caught several plays and dinner. It's an excellent hotel, great staff, perfect location. We enjoyed drinks and music/dancing in the lounge bar each night after our shows. 
20365 Stayed at the Carlyle for a long weekend w/ my wife and it was fantastic. The hotel is truly one of the best I have ever been to--comparable to the George V in Paris in its understated elegance. Expensive, even by NYC standards, but worth the extra money. 
20366 We visited this hotel with 10 people, everybody was very pleased with the quality and service. Only one remark about an unfriendly (night) operator ! 
20367 We stayed at the hotel for two days during our hmoon trip and felt that was the best experience ever. We got a free upgrade with amazing city view. Also got a free champagne and brownies. Great rooftop bar not to be missed. Will reconmend this to all my friends. 
20368 Close to everywhere by public transportation, staff very friendly, breakfast included, the room was clean, large and pretty. We already have plans to come back to Chicago and we will stay in the same hotel :) 
20369 The reception gave us a small room, but thanks to Josue Stime he gave us a bigger room. Thank you very much Josue you helped us a lot and we appreciate it a lot. 
20370 i actually found this hotel immaculately clean, well proportioned and generally top notch...yes rooms arent very big but it is new york and we didnt find it a problem 
20371 Stayed overnight and expected the worst when the front desk clerk stated what the rate was. The lobby and parking lot was clean and inviting but the cleanliness of the rooms was the schocker with the rate recieved. 
20372 Big rooms for New York standards (got the King room), professional and friendly staff, cool decor and crowd, excellent location and - to top it off - an excellent price to quality ratio... what else can you ask for? 
20373 I had heard some quite negative reviews about the hotel but our experience was entirely positive. The restaurants were however quite expensive as was the mini bar. Centrally situated for all the main things to see. 
20374 Terrific location in the city made even better with garage parking directly below the building. Easy in - easy out. Professional staff, terrific room decore,and an excellent dinner delivered to the room. Will definitely stay here again. Thank you to all for making it a great experience! 
20375 Ok first of all, location location location!:) 50tmtrs to Times square!! Really awesome. The room was really comfy, the staff was really helpful and always in a happy mood:) +++++ for that! So I would definetely stay at STAY again:) /Daniel 
20376 Elegance and service at its best. This luxurious hotel is a great escape in the center of Houston. This is an excellent weekend retreat. Take advantage of thr Trellis Spa and beautiful grounds. State of the art fitness center and jogging trails are a great way to relax and energize. 
20377 Very nice hotel. Rooms small, but then again, I think all rooms in NYC are small. Good location near Times Square, good restaurants, and bus station. 
20378 It was really nice to be right there in Times Square. Lion King was right next door. I was concerned about the noise and light from the street while we were sleeping. We heard nothing and the black out curtains blocked most of the light. My kids loved the hotel. 
20379 Que tal, el hotel tiene buena fama, pero es viejo, la calidad de su personal es pesima, el WiFi tiene muy poca velocidad dentro de la habitacion y en el lobby... Las habitaciones tienen solo cortinas delgadas en las habitaciones, asi que desde temprano la luz te da a todo... 
20380 posizione eccezionale praticamente esci dall hotel e ti puoi muovere dappertutto a piedi o con la metropolitana.consiglio questo hotel soppratutto per i servizi e la gentilezza dello staf.ottimo per chi va per la prima volta a new york. 
20381 Great location..Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable..Claudia at the front desk has the worst attitude i have ever encounter in a hotel......when ask to speak to a manager i was question why i needed to talk to manager.. 
20382 Had a wonderful time staying at Fashion 26. Modern decor, friendly staff, centrally located. 
20383 One of the best hotel's we've ever stayed at. Great service, superior housekeeping. Can't wait to come back. 
20384 pretty dissapointed...... the room was dirty, hallways small - great location. 
20385 Clean, modern hotel on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. We did an upgrade and found it wasn't necessary since little time was spent in the room. Nice restaurant steps from the hotel entrance, and easy access to many of NYC's attractions. 
20386 Semi-small room, clean, walls are THIN. Clean, sparsely appointed, and very spartan in every respect. All business. Need better sound insulation. 
20387 Tres bonne situation centrale, personnel tres pro (reception,resto, concierge,..), chambres confortables, communs et chambres tres clean. Bref, que du bonheur. 
20388 Great location, friendly staff, good overall value. Rooms aren't the most spacious, but I guess it's to be expected when staying Midtown. I'd recommend it to friends with kids. 
20389 Well laid out plenty of space in a clean and tidy room a great base to explore New York just around the corner from Ground Zero and a short walk to the Battery. They have no resturant but plenty of eating places of all price ranges within walking distance. 
20390 Great location, very shabby hotel. The rooms are shabby and tired, and the breakfast is probably the worst I've ever had. Avoid unless you're on a back backing budget. The only good aspect of the hotel is the proximity to Central Park and Times Square. 
20391 the hotel is beautiful, location is great, very close to all the main streets and minutes away from time square. The only drawback is that the rooms are very small, and the bathroom is too small. otherwise very trendy beautiful hotel. 
20392 The view from the rooms is terrific; the front desk handled checkin, messages and check out quickly and flawlessly. The hotel reflects New York's glitz and edginess while the rooms are serene and comfortable. If only the elevators came more quickly. 
20393 The service at this hotel was beyond expectations. The front desk, bellman, concierge, and housekeeping went above and beyond. I recommend this hotel to everyone. It is in an excellent location for Broadway and Times Square. 
20394 This hotel is a very nice place to spend the night. The staff is courteous and knowledgeable. Although one is in an enormous city, there are many entertaining things to do in the area. Taxis are readily available. 
20395 Small room but very good for solo traveller. Everything worked (hot shower with good pressure, HD Cable with HBO, adequate elevators, subways & deli nearby). Downside - noisy but effective A/C (usual Holiday Inn wall unit with in-room thermostat), noisy street early a.m. out front. 
20396 We have enjoyed the Barclay for years beside their excellent location thye have kept the rooms upgraded. The most important quality to the hotel is the friendly staff. One we must name Leslie Pagan has always been a great help and assisstence. 
20397 Fantasic little hotel, great roof top bar - french martini - amazing. Good service, really nice and comfortable room, really central for the NY sites. Hotel was spotless!! 
20398 Located strategicaly at the centre of New York City the hotel has a good balance of comfort and estetical quality. Very efficient and personable personnel always ready to, discreetely bur efficiently, help your needs. Good bar and good breakfast. A little too expensive. 
20399 THe staff is very attentive and professional. The hotel is perfect. It's officially our go-to NYC hotel. 
20400 Expensive no doubt, but rooms are good, albeit, a bit worn. Breakfast was superb! Great stay for 3 nights! 
20401 I had stayed here previously without incident. My last stay will definitely be my last stay. I was awoken every half-hour or so by sirens. Needless to say, I did not get much sleep. Other than that small problem, the hotel and room itself was nice. 
20402 I stayed here for another night prior to a business trip. Room was great, love the flat panel TV! Room Service was awesome, pool was good, gym was a little small. Overall it is a great hotel, in a good location for downtown NYC. 
20403 Really nice hotel, great location half way between midtown & lower manhattan. Can walk every where or the subway is only 2 mins away. Staff were very friendly & helpful. Our room was excellent & the price was reasonable. Can't fault the place at all. 
20404 Everything was made possible by Daniel in the front desk. If it wasnt for him, we would have had to wait 4 hours before we could check in because of a mix-up with our reservation. He went above and beyond to ensure quality service and I am thankful for that. 
20405 Staff is so friendly. Breakfast was convenient, happy hour snacks were great. Spent 56 days here after my house rented out...on my way overseas- near everything we needed. Would highly recommend for extended stay. 
20406 Stayed here 5/25-28/2012 on vacation. The hotel was conveniently located near Central Park and had a subway station nearby for traveling to Times Square, etc. Room was large, quiet and very clean. Several Duane Reade grocery.pharmacy stores were within walking distance of hotel. Would definitely stay here again. 
20407 Echt het meest fantastische hotel waar ik ben geweest. Alle details kloppen. Fantastisch bed en badkamer! Kijk op de site voor sfeer impressie. Ga je naar New York?? niet twijfelen, dit is het hotel!! 
20408 Hotel in ottima posizione ..a 2 metri da central park,molto gentili anche se abbiamo avuto qualche problema al Check out dove ci avevano addebitato servizi che mai ho avuto modo di usufruire ..nn ci tornerei detto sinceramente 
20409 I had a beautiful vacancy in NY in the January 2007, this also thanks to the very comfortable Hotel 41 and the hotel staff courtesy. Some room is some bit small but they are exceptionally clean and comfortable: in my opinion a very good service to price ratio. CM 
20410 Without a doubt, the worst experience I've ever had. Filthy, discourteous, unconcerned 
20411 do you get my drift? Avoid this place or your trip to the most magnificent city in the world will be ruined! 
20412 This is a good hotel, in a good location with good amenities. Breakfasts were great as were the beds. Staff were very friendly. Enjoyed this hotel. 
20413 the hotel was in a great location, different to where we have stayed before, room was clean staff were nice overall in was a good hotel. i would stay there again and i would recomend it to others as well. 
20414 I had a surprise I was updated to a pent house st. It was very clean and large. Front desk leafy was very helpful, and welcoming. Location 1 min walk to timesq Will go there again Very funky decore 
20415 Amazing. That's all that needs to be said. The hotel is gorgeous. The rooms are gorgeous. The beds are to melt in. The food is delicious. Ever since going in August I have been craving the morning breakfast I had at oscars. Wonderful experience 
20416 Stayed here for 3 nights for a business trip. Excellent business hotel, close to times square and walking distance to fashion district as well as Javitz centre. Checkout Smiths across the hotel, relaxing live music and reasonable hotel. 
20417 No frills but good for exploring the city- far from top of the line but affordable and clean. 
20418 Rooms were small, but ok per NYC standards. Staff was friendly. Our TV didnt work, they had someone up to fix it quick. Location is nice. Walk to Brooklyn bridge a few blocks from the subway. Not much to do around the hotel, but it is the financial district 
20419 Magnificent views inside the building, charming and classy, yet still has a current feeling. Not the outdated type some other old establishments give. Rates are good, staff is friendly, and location is the north bookend of Michigan Avenue-perfect. 
20420 Ottimo hotel situato all'inizio della famosa via Michigan Avenue, ed accanto al famoso john hancock center, pulito e confortevole, ottimo punto di partenza per visitare Chicago. 
20421 Tutto sommato questo Hotel si trova in una posizione centrale, vicino alla stazione centrale e a poca distanza da central park. Le stanze hanno l'aria condizionata, la TV, il Frigobar ilbagno in camera, e tutti i giorni viene cambiata la biancheria e pulita la mochette. 
20422 Front desk staff are second to none and always accomodate my room requests. 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111 
20423 Stayed at the Crowne Plaze Times Square for the first time after many trips to NYC! Sorry we didn't find this hotel sooner. Very spacious, clean rooms with excellent service and staff. Location couldn't be better for theatre, shopping and dining. Highly recommend this hotel!! 
20424 Stayed here one night. The room was fine - nothing too special. The hotel supplies free water (with recyclable water bottles) and coffee and tea, which is really nice. It's not super close to the subway. There are a couple of bars/restaurants around - but nothing too special. 
20425 Have stayed at the Palace Hotel many times and it never disappoints. Just stayed the past week and will go back next month. Why go out for dinner when you have one of the finest restaurants in the city in the hotel(Gilt). 
20426 Stayed for two nights at the end of a touring holiday. Reception staff were extremely polite and helpful nothing was too much trouble. The room was very clean and gave us a great view of the Empire State Building. I would deffinatly recommend this hotel. 
20427 We stayed here in june, the hotel was very clean, excellent location, but the service(concierge) was very poor to the point of being unhelpful, which, as tourists trying to get info from "locals" on what to do, see, eat, was most annoying. 
20428 In a great location, the Hotel Felix is a stylish boutique hotel with a great restaurant, comfortable bar and friendly staff. The rooms are small but well laid out and stylishly appointed. 
20429 Lo unico bueno del hotel es su ubicacion porque es un hotel antiguo, habitaciones sin internet, televisor viejo, mantenimiento general de la habitacion deplorable, mal olor de pasadizos y cuarto. El trato del personal poco cortez. Precio demasiado alto para el tipo de hotel. NO lo recomiendo. 
20430 Love the location, the hotel and the staff! Very convenient to all the great sites. From those at the front desk to Bob in the fitness center (so nice and funny!), the staff is great! Highly recommended! 
20431 We where a bit dissapointed with the room. Very dark, not enough natural light comming trough the window. We looked at exhaust pipes of ventilation or kitchen. The view wasn't that important to us but the sound of these pipes during the night was a bit anoying. 
20432 excelente hotel, muy cerca de galleria mall y con muy buena ubicacion y en una zona muy segura, cerca de todo. las camas son comodas, las habitaciones bastante confortables, el parqueadero con espacio suficiente para los carros. definitivamente volveria a utilizarlo 
20433 great first visit at the palace in the city. even though the blizzard (in feb 06) kept us there more days, it was fine, fine, fine.... freat location -- lots of shopping! 
20434 Lovely hotel, excellent location. Stayed in a suite with 3 family members-very spacious and had all we could need. Food in the Rare bar/restaurant also very good and room service menu is very broad and reasonably priced. Highly recommended. 
20435 The perfect location, reasonable price for NYC, over-the-top staff! The staff made the expensively, simple, small room worth it!! Very clean room. The thin windows give you the perfect sound of the busiest city in the northeast!! 
20436 Great location but needs more attentive maid service and new carpet. Bad smells in some hallways. Responsive staff, pleasant lobby (though new carpet would help that area, too). 
20437 It was very awesome to stay at Hotel Chelsea. If you are going looking for updated, super clean, great food...keep on looking! The Chelsea is artsy, old and has so much character. The history in this place is amazing! 
20438 Hotel is zeer centraal gelegen in rustige buurt. Nabijheid van metrostation en diverse resataurants Hotel is niet voorzien van enige extra's. Kleine lobby, klein restaurant (uitbater behoort niet tot hotel). Kamers zijn goed en schoon. Goede badkamer met goede douche. Voor stedentrip perfecte lokatie 
20439 The W Times Square has a downtown feel with the convenience of being near the theater, shopping and many tourist destinations. It is consistent "W" fare, which means cool decor, swank lobby bar and great service. I recommend as your home base for a fun NYC trip. 
20440 This hotel has a great location, right in the middle of downtown Houston. It's connected to the tunnels in houston, so in the Heat of the summer you never have to go outside. Great for business travel. Also they rooms are recently remodeled, and the bathroom is spectacular. 
20441 was a great hotel and i loved the view. would stay there again on my next visit. 
20442 gorgeous hotel great location staff very pleasant. Would love to go back. 
20443 this is a very nice little hotel and a great value. It is not fancy but the rooms are in good shape and the service is good. I recommend this hotel. 
20444 Beautiful hotel. We stayed on the 44 th floor, beautiful view of the city. Staff was very nice. Awesome location, close to everything. 
20445 For the price per night the hotel is great. Good size rooms , luxurious bathrooms , decent amount of natural light , decent location ....all in all very good. Service and professionalism is record to none 
20446 The staff was friendly and accommodating, the food at the wedding reception was delicious and the room at the end of the night was very comfortable. 
20447 Other than a lengthy wait for check-in and and check-out, the hotel was tremendous. Security was tight, the staff knowledgable, available, and friendy, the pool was extravagant, and the rooms lovely. I would be delighted to stay here again. 
20448 Clean room contained all the necessities. Great location. Friendly, helpful staff. No bedbugs. Will be staying there in NYC from now on. 
20449 The staff at The Benjamin were unhelpful, even snooty in some cases, the location is good, but The Kimberly which is almost next door is much better. 
20450 Service, service, service. And a desire to see that our pleasures are fulfilled. These folks are great! 
20451 Lovely hotel, very central for Time Square, 5th Avenue and all other major attractions. Room was clean and quiet. Cant think of anything negative what so ever about this hotel! 
20452 Very clean, good location, no complaints except the elevators..there are only 2 for the almost 40 floors. Ice machines only on every ~ 9 floors. Beds great. 
20453 Do not stay here!!!! I suffered from severe cigarette smoke inhalation in my room AND had a cockroach in my salad! Disgusting!!! 
20454 Booked the hotel on Hotwire, great rate. The hotel is only a ten minute walk to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave. Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance. The room itself was very nice with many amenities. 
20455 Love this hotel, have stayed in it 3 times now and it never disappoints! Ideally located on Mag Mile. Front desk staff are very accommodating. 
20456 Great experience, the room was spacious, and he hotel staff was exceptional. Probably the best hotel I have stayed in new York. The breakfast was a must. 
20457 Fab location! Was upgraded free to a junior suite! Rooms are bug and lush and clean! The bar upstairs on rooftop is stunning at night! 10min walk to Empire state building and not far to bloomingdales. Brill hotel away from the busy central! Great location 
20458 You can enjoy the history of the Roosevelt and imagen being in the French Connection and where royalty to stars and members of goverment have stayed. I loved it all with even the modern covinces of today. The Roosevelt truely lives up to it's name and is truely New York. 
20459 We spent 3 nights at this Hotel (Sept 22-25) and were pleasantly surprised. Our room was small but clean and comfortable. The location of this Hotel is GREAT!! We were within walking distance of Times Square and Rockefeller Plaza. We would definitely use this Hotel again. 
20460 My Hubby was taking pictures of this hotel as soon as we stepped in the room. We partied so hard that we missed the great "Free Breakfeast" but we hope to come back in the summer for a fabulous roof top party. Great Venue! 
20461 From Check-In to Check-Out, the service I received was great! If you are lucky enough to get Miss Jacqueline or Regina providing service at the front desk, you will be happy! 
20462 Excellent location. Lovely, safe neighborhood. Friendly and helpful staff 
20463 great central hotel, good price, very close to macy's, empire state, madison square gardens, situated on lots of bus/subway routes which is a must when going shopping with lots of bags to carry. would stay here again............ 
20464 Lovely little hotel right next to Grand Central. Rooms very comfortable, Guiness in the bar and great friendly service. Highly recommend if you want something a big different to the normal NY hotel scene. 
20465 First class views of St Patrick's Cathedral. Fabulous breakfasts. 
20466 stayed here a couple days this month.. staff was awsome and the hotel was very nice..and clean. :) 
20467 This hotel is in the perfect location. It's close to shops, restaurants, bars, famous sites and is right in front of the Chicago River. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful, VERY nice rooms and the rates are amazing for the area. I'd recommend this hotel to anyone. 
20468 We have stayed here before and it is a nice hotel, they were very busy with weddings this weekend and the housekeeping was a bit on the skinny side. 
20469 Elegance, smooth ambience, professional and warm hospitality. Central and so well connected to the main sites. The rooms are cozy and warm , everything excellent. Two steps away from Columbus Center and Fifth Avenue. The Hall is fantastic and unique. 
20470 Excellent Hotel choice. Clean, comfortable and fairly helpful staff. 
20471 Hotel was close to times square and public transport. Small room, but expected in NYC. Cleaners were not great. Must've had dirty hands when they put the soap etc in our room. We stayed for a week too so it's not like it was a one off mistake 
20472 The hotel epitomized young-sexy new york... You can't beat the location (the high line, restaurants, bars, stores)... Big bucks but worth it.. The decor of the hotel was modern and clean.. The staff was 100% nice and 100% helpful... The service was great.. 
20473 The room was quiet, spacious clean and nicely decorated. The staff was very helpful. The location is VERY convenient for Broadway shows, eating and shopping. We would definitely return. 
20474 I stayed for 9 days in your hotel and the room was suprisingly quiet. The staff has been very helpful and always gentle. I could recommend it for anybody that wants to feel the pulse of NYC without the noise and for a very affordable price. 
20475 This hotel is conveniently located on 50th and 3rd which is near everything. The rooms are spacious.and the service is outstanding.They are so friendly and helpful. I will only stay here when i visit Manhattan. 
20476 I really love the aesthetic and active feel of this place. The staff was always super attentive, the restaurant makes incredible steaks, the rooms were clean and super well appointed. I plan to stay here often. 
20477 i payed 1400 dollars for NOTHING!! bedbugs!!!- my dad got bit the 3rd night! HOTEL WAS OLD. MUSTY, DISGUSTING!!!!!! 
20478 Lobby and public space design, location, staff all top marks. Room was unbearably small. Bathroom, including shower, was my armspan in length, and 2/3rds my armspan in depth. Was put off by a cockroach climbing the lobby walls, but not shocking to see in NYC. Still where there's one... 
20479 I would give this a 4>5 if I could. Clean, modern and close to the action 
20480 The Carlton Hotel was truly a wonderful experience. The stunning lobby and the spacious rooms were unexpected. The staff is warm and welcoming. Love the beds too. 
20481 The rooms, location and the foods was amazing. Especially bacons were amazing. 
20482 Didn't leave hotel for the weekend, and no need to: meals, pools, spa. Complete relaxation and great service. Breakfast and dinner were excellent. Perfect location. Therapeutic weekend recharge. Pool staff friendly and accommodating. 
20483 I would tell anyone to stay here. It is so nice and so quite for a New York hotel. The staff is great. The food is great. We loved our stay here. This type of hotel should be the standard not the exception. 
20484 Rooms were nice, clean and updated. The workout facility was small but very nice. Convenient location. We will definitely stay there the next time we are in Houston. 
20485 This hotel was a pleasant surprise. I chose it because of the size and we are a family of 4. Tons of room, clean, nice staff, and great location. I usually stay in the theater district, but for the size this is the better choice. 
20486 I was hesitant staying here because of the previous reviews. But, I was pleasantly surprised. The staff were very nice, helpful and accommodating. The breakfast was nothing special but I wasn't staying there for breakfast. The rooms were clean and comfortable. I would gladly return. 
20487 It was good but is very expensive. Housekeeping is not cleaning the room daily, bathroom was some dirty... location was very bad not directly view to Time square. Reception workers were not friendly. Lobby was very bleak 
20488 It did it for me. No complaints. I will be back. Yes lets face it NYC is expensive, this place is nit cheap, you get what you pay for most of the time. This is hip, trendy, cozy, romantic and more. 
20489 This hotel is located out of the noise, but within easy walk distance of Grand Central Station. It is an older hotel, but it has been well kept up. The staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again and would highly recommend it. 
20490 Stayed in a Spectacular room facing the lake, comofortable beds, great food, super close to the Navy pier. Would definitely stay again. 
20491 Perfect location in the Meatpacking District: many bars, restaurants and pubs. Fantastic views. Perfect hotel to go with friends or partner. it could be noisy, it depends on room. There is a rooftop amazing. 
20492 Saw the hotel from the highway as we were traveling on I-10. Have stayed at Studio 6 before in San Antonio. We came back around and were presently surprised. Nice clean room. friedly staff. We stayed 2 nights and will continue to stay with Studio 6 in our travels 
20493 terrible hotel for services, rooms and cleanliness. We had reservation for a triple room but they took us a double room explaning us that "in New York everything in small". So we had to sleep in three in a king size bed. 
20494 Centrally located..the rooms were not great shakes, extremely functional, very limited food choices , extremely crowded reception, long waiitng time 
20495 Excellent location and very nice views. Swimming pool and fitness centre is an additional attitude - with excellent views too. Rooms can be a little damaged and dirty due to very often exploitation. However service at the front desk is very nice and can change the room if you want. 
20496 The hotel is very well ocated. It is comfortable, the room was very clean. The breakfast buffet has many choices. It is easy to wlak through Broadway or the 5th Avenue. It remains expensive but that's New York! 
20497 Good Hotel, great staff, Front Desk people were very very nice, thank-you so much. 
20498 Im a loyal Loews New York patron however I have recently discovered your wonderful property. The staff was so friendly an they attended to my needs in an urgent manner. I would definitely stay at this W again 
20499 The price to stay at the hotel was great. The room was bigger than we thought it was going to be. It was also clean. We would stay there again. No activities for kids. Houston hobby airport is less than 5 min away. 
20500 Clean comfortable rooms. Good bar with a fabulous view. On the river and convenient to walking to attractions. Also convenient to the subway. Good suggestions for places to eat within walking distance. Staff is friendly and helpful. 
20501 Have stayed here two times and planning a third tri in two months. Location is great, rooms are modern and very comfortable, and service (front desk, conceierge, and housekeeping) are great! Feels like a home away from home for me. 
20502 I found a rat in my room! Should I speak more? This hotel should be demolided. 
20503 We had a super time throughout our duration. The hotel is 30 seconds from the heart of Time Square - who could ask for anything more?! The rooms were clean and the staff were extremly helpful. We will definetly stay here on our next visit. 
20504 good size rooms, very confortable beds (our neighbours certainly thought so). Good modern clean bathroom. Friendly reception staff. Good value for money. Avoid getting room next to people who dont use beds for sleep. Great location near magnificient mile, chicago loop brown and red line trains. 
20505 serivce is incredible, the localization every time i confirm that is the best you can have in nyc the staff is very warm you cant ask for better in this town 
20506 i always stay at the hotel for business but this time took my family along for the ride. the adjoining room made life easy and the hotel management were their usual classy selves. 
20507 Rooms are small but what do you expect for NYC - great location, walking distance to Times square and all great restaurants yet sits in a lovely neighborhood setting. Rooms were VERY clean and staff was most professional and helpful! 
20508 Great room, clean and ok looking. Very close to Blue line subway, 5 min walk. Comfortable bed Easy check-in. I arrived at 10 AM and had no problem checking in at that time. Breakfast should be included at that price. 
20509 It was a good stay! Nothing else to say. Only way to be better is to have lower rates. I did not partake in the breakfast. 
20510 Location is great, but the rooms are small and without windows. Also there are no elevators. It`s a very good option if you want to stay in Manhatan, but cannot or does not want to spend more than USD 150. 
20511 Stayed at the Sanctuary hotel last June and really, it was amazing! The staff was great, very helpful and knowlegeable ! My room was small, yes, but nothing is missing and everything is so well designed! Bravo!!!!! 
20512 Great staff, small room, high prices, BUT this is NYC and this IS a "boutique hotel." for what it is, it's great. If you can afford it, it's in line to what you are accustomed to. 
20513 this place scks - nothing works - phone connection bad an spotty wireless on blackberries dont work half the time wireless internet is bad staff very rude and unfriendly would never recommend for business ever 
20514 Rooms are large and well appointed. Rooms are well insulated and quiet. Bathrooms are large and modern with marble finishes. Service is excellent 
20515 The bar is always active and perfect for a drink before dinner. Breakfast buffet is fabulous 
20516 I stayed here on business for a few days recently. Amazing location in downtown Chicago. Price is high but expected for the area. Rooms are simple with bathrooms on the small side. Lots of close by restaurants with transportation options very convenient 
20517 Hotel haben wir wegen der Lage noch einmal gebucht, Zimmer sind OK. Personal nicht freundlich, einfach nur da. 
20518 Fabulous design, wonderful location, great chef and attentive service. 
20519 The staff were very efficient and friendly. This stay was second time in New York and this hotel made me want to go back to this city :-) 
20520 1 nacht in dit hotel geslapen tijdens een 2 daags New York avontuur. Kamer was niet super groot, maar er stonden 2 grote bedden die heerlijk lagen, genoeg kast ruimte, groot bureau. Koffiezetapparaat met koffiepads. Heerlijke inloop-douche met regendouche. 
20521 Was looking for a large room for 3 with 2 queen beds. Hard to find in NYC but found this to be perfect. Great location near 50th and Lexington. Friendly, accommodating staff. Only down side was the very small bathroom. Would definitely stay there again. 
20522 catherine was very friendly and all the staff. rooms very confortable, location of the hotel very close to Time Square in the city. 
20523 What you lack in amenities, you make up for in customer service, location and cleanliness. Rooms are decent size for nyc, it's always clean and friendly, awesome location. 
20524 The manager doesn't fix anything. Broken umbrellas, torn off key entries. Severely cracked pool deck. Non functioning spa. No liners in trash bags. But good breakfast, housekeeping and very nice staff. 
20525 I must agree with the majority of reviews I have read here. It's not cheap, but nowhere is New York is. For the price, you get a good, central location, breakfast included (my son was delighted with the doughnuts), wifi, and friendly, helpful staff. We would stay here again. 
20526 I travel to NYC a few times each year and have made the Warwick my base when visiting NYC from Australia. You can't beat the Warwick for it's location, history and style. 
20527 The Hotel is way too big. The service is slow Elevators take forever.some rooms are dark and depressing If you get a very good rate is ok other ways is not worth it Other much better hotels to stay in Chicago 
20528 A folding futon with a motor is what these beds are, and the price per square inch for the room is more than any other hotel that I've ever stayed at anywhere in the world. There are MUCH MUCH better options in NY than this place. 
20529 Breakfast room is too small Easy to find and reach the hotel Close to Galleria center No problem with parking places 
20530 My husband and I stayed here and could not believe how gorgeous this hotel was. The rooms were spacious compared to other hotels we have stayed in in NYC and the views were amazing. The rooms were clean and the service was great! We would definitely recommend this hotel. 
20531 Well located in midtown Manhattan. Nice Bussiness Center. Pitty they charge for internet access. Hotels aren't charging for in room pc use nowadays. Overall good service. Concierge ok. You can print for free your boarding passes at the Bussiness Center. 
20532 Hotel centraal gelegen t.o.v. het metrostation. Nette ruime kamers voor een redelijke prijs. Enige minpuntje was de redelijk nonchalante houding van de receptiemedewerkers verder niets op aan te merken. 
20533 Don't forget your bathingsuit! The enclosed rooftop pool and its views are a treat! 
20534 Cumple perfectamente con las espectativas, muy bien ubicado con una entrada al subte en la misma entrada del hotel, ojo con las habitaciones mas economicas, son muy chicas. El resto nada que objetar. 
20535 We stayed in1347.Great room!beautiful hotel,stuff!Victoria from housekeeping is the best!Thanks for amenities!We'll be back! 
20536 I've stayed here several times and have always been pleased. We love the beds. I also love their thermostat and, this last time, the Bath and Bodyworks Orange and Ginger products. Good room service and very good breakfast buffet. 
20537 The atmosphere is lovely, although there was less music than sometimes. The scones and sandwiches are good - but the desserts are ridiculously tiny and actuallyl, except for the fruit one, not that good. At the price ($37.50 plus tax and tip) it seems they could do better. 
20538 Good hotel in a strategic position. You can easily go to Penn station, Times square, Macy's, the Empire State building.Small rooms. 
20539 They pretend like the exact person who made the reservation must check in. Then they pretend like someone else must buy a new room in order that the original intended guest will stay there. 
20540 Nice hotel with a fabulous Central Park location close to everything you want to walk to. Only minus is that the high-tech touch screen phone didn't control the lights like it was supposed to which made things a little confusing, but not a huge deal. 
20541 Great place to stay in the DT area. Its connected to the underground system and close to everything you might want/need. Staff is great. Friendly and accommodating. Can't beat the cookie either. While I was there, there was a photo gallery on display near the conference center. Must see. 
20542 The rooms are small - but they are comfortable, quiet and a great location. If you are only in new york for a short stay then they are fine 
20543 The location of this hotel is only about 5 "NY" blocks from Times Square which is just a quick walk. The service was excellent and while the rooms were not large they were still very comfortable and very modern. 
20544 Would highly recommend this place. Management is very friendly. Breakfast is adequate. There is shuttle available to Medical Center. Room was clean. 
20545 Room was very small but clean and neat. Ok for the price = $110. Was told suite is much bigger. Worth the upcharge. 
20546 The hotel staff at the InterContinental Barclay went above and beyond what I have come to expect during an event. Professional and personal service has secured this venue as one of my favorites to work with. Will certiainly be back to host more events in the future! 
20547 Tremendously helpful staff - both informed and pleasant. Rooms were beautifully presented and very clean. Would recommend Grace Room Mate to anyone. 
20548 Tiny room and not so clean... granted, it was one of the rooms that had not been "remodeled". However, the staff seemed friendly for New York standards. 
20549 I really like this Hotel, 2nd visit good location with lots of bars and street cafes around. Good cocktails in the bar in the Hotel and good service. STAY HERE 
20550 Rooms are clean. Nice TV. Decent Internet. Employees are qualify and friendly. The food from the bar and restaurant is very good, but prices kind of funny like $4.50 for a single coke. Basic New York attractions are kind of close. In overall I'm very pleased with everything. 
20551 Greatest staff in Houston. Fresh breakfast is a plus too. You cannot find a better suites hotel to stay. Oh yeah, great staff. 
20552 Nel cuore di midtown, a due passi da Gran Central, a tre dalla fifth e a quattro da Central Park... Una struttura molto accogliente e riservata. positivo, molto positivo. 
20553 My stay was short and sweet but I recieved excellent service while I was there, everything was clean and the staff were very helpful. 
20554 Perfect location if you want to be in the heart of Times Square.Right across from TKTS which made getting tickets easy. I had a corner room, lots of space, comfortable bed-fun lounge-great bar staff. W has so many little hidden treasures that make your stay more enjoyable. 
20555 Very clean, very courteous staff. Pleasantly surprised at the price, especially for New York. In a wonderful location, close to everything, but away from the noise. Would absolutely stay here again, and have recommended the Hotel to our company's Travel Agency. 
20556 very clean excellent location rooms small but not a problem very friendly and helpful staff would stay again 
20557 I had a great time here. Clean, great location, good price, good friendly service. Elevators are a SLIGHT problem during peak hours, but not bad compared to other places in the city. 
20558 Hotel is in a great location , within walking distance to everything. Restaurants in hotel a little pricey. Very nice customer service. Stay positive and you will have an amazing stay at the hotel. Only criticism is the batroom being small. I would stay here again ! 
20559 We didn't spend much time there in the hotel to use the facilities or the amenities that much, but it seemed very nice. Great location for eating out, good customer service. The only thing was the wait time for the elevators 
20560 I've been staying at the Park Central Hotel for several years, several times a year. The property's OK, but the service is usually outstanding. Carolyn, Saleem and Ellen, who work at the Front Desk, are always incredibely friendly and helpful, always leaving me with a feeling that they actually care. 
20561 Good prices, staff was very helpful, we had to change rooms as the first one had a very bad odor, but the second room was much better. Elevators are very slow here. Good sized rooms considering your in New York. I would stay here again. 
20562 Newly refurbished, small rooms - typical NYC!, staff helpful. Would stay again and recommend if you need a room in the financial district. single woman, felt safe walking in area late at night! Starbucks on corner! check out restaurants on Stone Street! 
20563 159 usd + taxes for a dark tiny room (no windows), lot of defective items !!. No bulbs over the miror in the bathroom 
20564 We moved out the next day to find a much, much better place on 47th street at a cheaper rate !! 
20565 My husband and I enjoyed our stay at the Warwick. The king bed room was a good size--recently refurbished. The Staff was friendly and helpful--someone even found my missing watch! We,also, got a good room rate. 
20566 Totally took care of us.. Jose was helpful, friendly and always had a smile for us. We love staying at The Pierre when in New York. 
20567 We spent one night here an were pleasantly surprised. Service was very friendly, rooms were clean and well appointed (which is nice for NYC especially) and it was an excellent location. Highly recommend it. 
20568 Fantastic midtown location for this boutique hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Transition at check-in time seemed abit hectic. Could use a bit more room for clothes/belongings - armoire? 
20569 Large hotel in a great location. Cheap compared to others, easy walk to Times Square. But... a realy bad feel in the hotel corridors and rooms. The rooms felt dirty and unclean and OLD. If you just want location with absolutely no frills, then go ahead. 
20570 Very good quality/price relation. Clean, spacious room and very good location 
20571 I love this hotel, so modern and hip. Great staff and very close to Houston Museum district. 
20572 A very comfortable room with two baths, large TV, computer terminal, etc. Terrific swimming pool, great location, close to Art Institute. Only negative was a rather pricey parking garage ($43 a day) and no free Internet (but Starbucks next door has free wireless). 
20573 The hotel has great location. Rooms are very clean and satisfying. Hallways need renovation, if you care the hallways:). I would recomend for anyone who doesnt want to spend fortune for hotel in Time Square, Manhattan. 
20574 We were pleased with the property. The hotel lobby and entrance were always kept clean with friendly people to assist you. The hotel offers valet parking, which is a big plus for us. The room was cleaned every day and the staff was very friendly 
20575 Great location, close to Koreatown, the subway and the Empire State Building. Great price too. Everything was very clean, even the shared bathrooms. 
20576 Great location and very nice hotel! Could walked to Central Park, Times Square, 5th Ave, Rockafeller Center. Very nice staff. We stayed on a lower floor and didn't have a problem with the street noise. Blackout curtains helped tremendously keep out the light. Will stay here again! 
20577 I have stayed at this location on many occasions over the last year. Great staff, always helpful and freindly. Good location for getting around the city. Rooms are clean and a great rate. 
20578 Perfecte locatie, om de hoek bij Empire state Building. Zowel voor wandelingen uptown als downtown, maar ook voor High Line Park wandeling (9 av / 20 st) is hotel centraal uitgangspunt. Kamers smaakvol, luxueus, voorzien van alle comfort. Weliswaar klein, maar zeer efficient ingericht. Kwaliteit/prijs verhouding inclusief service bovengemiddeld. 
20579 Otimo lugar,hotel perfeito,maravilhoso,lugar tranquilo! 
20580 Love every part of it. Great service, very clean, quiet room, and a beautiful lobby. Great location, in the center of everything.; we walked to Fifth Avenue Shopping, Central Park, and the Theater District. 
20581 We had an excellent stay at the New Yorker. The location is great and the room was nice. The beds were a wee bit short in length and the rooms are definitely more "boutique" than modern, but overall it was a good experience and a good deal. 
20582 I stayed in the Radisson during a business trip. The location is very good, Starbucks integrated. The rooms are high standard and I experienced very friendly staff. I will certainly be back 
20583 Stayed here for a few days and it was a great deal. The rooms were clean and well kept. The front desk staff was very helpful. Would definitely stay here again. 
20584 In the InterContinental New York you will find the best Concierge in New York, excellent breakfast, good place for shopping. 
20585 amazing hotel. only fault was the room wasnt ready on time and the blind was broke it was all fixed within an hour with a free cocktail flung in. 
20586 Excellent 1-bedroom suite which was perfect for my 6-week stay in Houston. Good varied breakfast and a light meal 3 evenings per week. The hotel is clean and well maintained and the staff are friendly. Very satisfied. 
20587 Good location,nice crews,clean and comfortable rooms 
20588 Great hotel and location. Yes, it is austere but just what you need while staying in the big apple. Staff is quite friendly and elevator (which still need an operator) is charming. Would definitely come back to the best cost-friendly hotel in NY. 
20589 Love everything about this hotel, my only gripe was in the morning time tring for an elevator....can be a long wait. 
20590 Excellent hotel. Loved location, staff friendly and rooms amazing. Welcome water, chocolate dipped strawberries, room upgrade and Evan's welcome letters all very much appreciated. Look forward to my next visit at this hotel. 
20591 Drop dead view from 33rd floor over central park. Rooms are a little threadbare, but that view makes up for a lot. Food is great but a little expensive. Cafe pulls a good espresso. 
20592 Camere piccole e non curatissime. Tuttavia bagno pulito e letto confortevole. Niente ascensore e telefono, ma TV con accesso internet (a pagamento). Servizio accurato. Ottima connessione metropolitana 1. 
20593 Too pricy for a small and bland room. Buy drinking water before you enter your room , there is none provided by hotel. If you are a business traveller, well beware of traffic noises till midnight. 
20594 Great location, efficient staff. Room was adequate. 
20595 For a Coutyard, this was impressive. Almost felt full service. Staff extremely friendly & helpful. Rooms clean & updated. Restaurant / Bar great along with Starbucks. Great location. 
20596 Fabulous hotel, well worth all the great reviews. Rooms are an excellent size with everything you need for a very comfortable stay. Excellent location, we walked everywhere and loved every minute. 
20597 Hotel bien place si vous etes en stand by pour qq heures ou 1/2 jours. Navette ok, excellente connection internet. Chambre spacieuses et propres. Personnel d'acceuil efficace. Petite salle de gym, mais elle existe.Petite piscine, propre. Loin de down town (20-30 min), mais comme tous les hotels autour. 
20598 Ligt in de gezellige, levendige Upper West aan Broadway. Goede uitvalsbasis met de metro (86th street) om de hoek. Eten en winkelen op kruipafstand. Kleine kamer, na bijbetalen met eigen badkamer. Netjes en dagelijks verschoond. 
20599 Ho pernottato sei notti al Cosmopolitan di Tribeca...veramente carino con la metro a due passi e starbucks per colazione! La stanza quadrupla un po' piccola ma pulita e confortevole wifi free personale cordiale insomma lo consiglio! 
20600 Hotel is clean, staff is very friendly and good location to everything you need in NYC. The morning breakfast was hot and enjoyable everyday. Had a quiet room away from the main street and could not hear any of the noise from Times Square. 
20601 Great hotel in one of the best locations near times square. Went on a 4 day shopping trip with a group of 5. Would highly recommend this hotel and would def stay here again 
20602 returned fro the skyline in december , I thought the hotel was very good value for money , you pay for what you get!! Clean , friendly staff , two good sized double beds in each room and very centrally located. I have booked again for next dec!! 
20603 Stayed at this hotel in November last year for family reception. Very friendly staff memebers at this hotel. Always received a hello while in the hallways, restaurant, any where we went. Food was very good! Would definately recomend to any one traveling to Houston. 
20604 This is a nice, neat property. The common areas are sleek and modern and the rooms are clean and decorated nicely. The staff is polite. Overall, they seem to run a pretty tight ship here. I would certainly stay here again. 
20605 Excellent rooms, location and service, couldn't of asked for a better hotel, mini bar expensive but that's self fault, bar and restraunt very expensive. Overall very good and well done 
20606 Very clean and comfortable. Nice rooms with new beds and bedding. Nice plasma tv with cable. Free wi-fi. Great location - within walking distance to many things. 
20607 Comfortable stay but I expected more such as a fridge, ice maker machine and some amenities. I would stay here again tho if I'm on a budget. Small but clean rooms its good for a good nights sleep then you get up and Go! 
20608 Great hotel - price was reasonable and people were friendly. Room was still sort of small - but this is NY (and compared to some NY hotels, this was on the larger side). 
20609 Toooo loud. I'm staying here currently and am listening to freeway sounds, loud people and my neighbor's TV. Only 1 towel in the room. Only had 1 more to offer. Won't stay here again!! 
20610 Millenium Broadway has a good location for Business Travel & Tourism. Great Restaurants within walking distance,Many Broadway shows & good food are the plus points. 
20611 This is a rundown hotel. The bed sheets in our room smelled like chemicals and had crumbs on them when we checked in. The sink in the bathroom was also cracked. Overall, very disappointing for a hotel that cost $165 per night. 
20612 Spent 4 nights here in October 07; had a studio suite. Was very nice, very roomy, very clean. All the comforts of home. Bed extremely comfortable. Great buffet breakfast including hot items (eggs,etc.). would definitely return. 
20613 nuestra estadia fue fantastica, un hotel comodo , con una ubicacion excelente y con un personal ampliamente dispuesto a resolver cualquier problema o dudas!!!!.....la proxima estadia en new york este volvera a ser mi hotel 
20614 I've stayed in some pits in my time but this place really takes the biscuit. Disgusting. i don't mind shabbyness but this place was just plane dirty. And the staff have a bad attitude to boot. 
20615 This hotel is a great value - -clean, very friendly staff. Amazing free breakfast - super location. Quiet and very nice room. 
20616 one cup of coffee is not getting it for me,why not a 4 cup brewer like your sister hotel"Park Inn"? All desk clerks are vy good at what they do....House maids very friendly and helpfull. 
20617 After a horrible experience at another hotel in the CIty, I booked a room last minute at "stay". Guest services representative, Sally Garcia, was beyond accommodating. She was pleasant, and quick to checking me in. I will definitely be returning to "stay" on future trips to NYC. 
20618 Discovered 4 Points Chelsea on Booking.com and was not disappointed. Room was quiet, clean and larger than many higher priced places in the city. The bed was so comfortable! We will stay again. 
20619 I stayed 2 nights here October 2011 and had great experience. It was about 6 of us and we had 3 rooms. The staff was friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the food was good. Alittle far out from downtown, but it was worth the stay. 
20620 Wonderful hotel - full of character and cozy - friendly, competent staff, quiet. The only negative thing I found was that breakfast was served on disposable plate and "silverware" was plastic. 
20621 Location is perfect, close to Columbus Circle. Trendy design with tiny, almost perfect rooms. Very noisy, like a dive hotel next to a bus station.Bring your ear plugs. Front desk and concierge staff range from excellent and professional, to too cool to give a *"hoot"*, but trending to the latter. 
20622 We stayed here in April People were fantastic and helpful. We had a corner room and had a good view of time square and the naked cowboy...We had no trouble getting around. The hotel has a bar area that has a great view of time square as well. 
20623 My husband and I stayed at Hotel 17 from July 13 - 16 and had a great experience. The staff was helpful, the rooms clean, and the bed was very comfortable. The bathrooms were kept immaculate and were always available. 
20624 The staff is fantastic, the room was nice and clean and we were close to everything we wanted to see. Would absolutely stay here again and would recommend to any family and friends coming to Houston. Thank you for making our trip a great one! 
20625 From the outside it would appear that this is a very nice hotel, even the large reception area gives you the feeling of a quality hotel. That's until you enter the rooms. Dirty and smelly. The bathrooms are very dirty - obviously havent been decorated in some time. 
20626 We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights this month, and had to change rooms twice! There were cochroaches in one room, mold in the next and the staff were not friendly, only one person named George. We would never recommend this hotel and won't be returning. 
20627 Clean, modern rooms. Helpful staff. Attached restaurant and bar are also of a high quality. I've stayed at Felix multiple times and will continue to stay here in the future. 
20628 While this is a 'cool' hotel and in a great location, there are bed bugs! We are now dealing with the repercussions including a very expensive extermination of our home. AVOID. 
20629 Horrible! Avoid this disgustingly filthy hotel at all costs. 
20630 I stayed at the Hudson Hotel for five nights with my friends. We all enjoyed our stay. From the moment we arrived until we left. it was always a pleasure to be there. The lobby and bar are amazing!. The rooms are small but nice and modern! 
20631 Across the street from MSG and Penn Station. Short walk to Times Square or Rockefella Center. Rooms were just updated and very nice. 4 stars for location alone. 
20632 If you like something grand from the last Century, this is a must-stay hotel in Chicago. I would not stay more than 2-3 nights and without Club access, where my parents munched most of their breakfasts for free, costs can mount quickly. 
20633 A less expensive room for the city, in a nice location, great staff, thats where it end. Needs some serious soap and updating. The paint was peeling off the doors in sheets, bugs in the bathtub., enough said. 
20634 Place was fine for a quick stop. Hotel common areas are nice and inviting. Rooms were ok, nothing special. Good location. Staff was very accommodating. I wouldn't seek out the D-tree, but in a pinch it served it's purpose. 
20635 The location is good, right to the "lights,camera,action" place Time Square! Walk to 8th Ave between 42nd and 43rd , I like the fast food place "Shake Shack" the hamburger is so good!!! and the room, awesome! got everything you can think of, sweet! 
20636 Great boutique hotel! It's modern and clean. The rooms have nice hard wood floors, clean bathrooms, decor, etc. My room was one of the smallest, but because I was travelling alone, it was ok. The service is great and I was very impressed considering this is a 3-star hotel! 
20637 Overall, my daughter and I had a good experience at the Doubletree Metropolitan. The location is perfect for shopping, theatre and subway access to anywhere in the city. The bed was confortable and service was adequate. There is a charge to store your luggage. I would return to this hotel. 
20638 Stayed here with my two daughters. The room was adequate, clean tidy and in truth somewhere to rest your head at night. In New York all you use the hotel for is sleeping so the Bedford is fine. Good location, clean, friendly staff. Would use again. 
20639 SImply a beautiful run hotel with an extremely attentive and friendly staff. New fresh interior. Superb location in downtown Chicago. 
20640 A bit pricey fot a weekday, but great location and clean rooms, 2ed floor cafe is great. in the heart of Time square, loved it. will come back 
20641 This is one of the most spectacular hotels! The view, the service, the room!! overall a 5 star hotel 
20642 Non ci sono tante parole per giudicare questo hotel... Semplicemente fantastico. Personale cordiale e attento ad ogni tua richiesta. Un hotel ottimo. Posizione favolosa, direttamente su Times Square. Ci torneremo di sicuro. Camere spaziose e sempre pulite. Silenzioso nonostante la posizione. Semplicemente perfetto. Ottimo per la visita della grande mela. 
20643 The hotel is located at one of the best locations i.e. at the times square. But they do not have any family activities or a swimming pool to relax. The location is worth it but its too expensive for a family stay. 
20644 Stay at this location at least once a year service is ++++++ the common areas have been beautifully redone love the "Market area" with quick things to grab for a snack - Everything very clean, Great service would recommend to anyone 
20645 Stayed for 2 nights - great location near times square, and right by the metro from JFK. Nice staff, comfy clean rooms and had everything we needed. Wifi was expensive - should be free somewhere like this. For a first visiit to NY, it's recommended as close to everything! 
20646 My husband and I stayed at the Belvedere Jan. of 2002. It was clean and the people were pleasant. It was centrally located. We would stay there again. We stayed there 2 nights. 
20647 desde el check inn (sin filas) hasta el check out por telefono!! el trato muy bueno y la mayoria de los empleados son bilingues o intentan hacer el maximo,al hacer el check out nos permitieron guardar nuestro equipaje para seguir recoriendo times square hasta que salia nuestro avion,sin duda regresamos. 
20648 Room is clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. Subway is in a short walking distance. Breakfast is boring but it is okay. Will be back there if China town is still in my choice list (maybe not. I'll move to mid town for different experience). 
20649 Realmente en mi estadia en nov2011 me encontre con un lugar muy bien atendido donde me trataron muy bien, y atento a mis nesecidades todo sus empleados,precio y servicios bien adecuados, lo recomiendo un lugar sencillo para lo que busca un viajero en NYC.Mi agradecimiento a Ustedes. 
20650 Really good location, nice lobby and that is just about it. Four star hotel ? No! Three maybe.. Service is not noticeable, and staff hardly smiles. I'm really disappointed and will not return for our trip in Oct or Dec. 
20651 Our room was nice with a good view of ground zero. Being a family of four it was great having the use of the club lounge. Our first time to New York and we enjoyed every minute. A big thank you to the club lounge staff who were excellent. 
20652 Don't be tempted by the cheaper rates. This place is horrible. Dirty beds. Ants. Noxious smells. Not worth the cost at half the price. I complained to the manager and she just told me what kind of ants they were. I complained to corporate and they never responded. Run away! 
20653 Beautiful hotel. Impeccably clean. Fabulous rooms and service. And look at booking this hotel directly on their site as I got a much better rate. 
20654 I would recommend this hotel to anyone, even if you only have one night! The staff is great and if you are from out of town they will help you to get around Houston. 
20655 We had a wonderful stay at the Garden Inn. Close to everything, including the subway, it has a pretty ideal location. Hotel staff were very professional, capable and the rooms (although clearly aging) were clean and neat. 
20656 The location is good as it is right down the street from time square but the rooms need remodeling. Air does not circulate well and the tub had holes in it. Cleanliness was good but again for cost would expect fluffier towels and beds. 
20657 Stayed at the Fitzpatrick for two nites, great hotel, as a lone traveller I felt really safe staying here and the bed was so comfortable, have stayed in a few NY hotels will def be back to the Fitzpatrick! 
20658 We stayed here for 6 days last spring. The room was attractive but small with a lovely view of a brick wall! That aside, the price was right and the feel of the hotel and staff was very european. The location was quite good, the staff polite. 
20659 Knap hotel, vriendelijke staf en ideale ligging om de stad te verkennen. 
20660 Great hotel, grea service! Excellent room service!!! Even has Matza Bowl soup!!! Super clean! Excellent decor!!!! 
20661 I loved this hotel. It was very clean, I even had a balcony off of my room so pretty. I would recommend this hotel very highly. Try Big Nicks for breakfast not too far away good food good prices. 
20662 Stayed here for a couple days for vacation in Dec. '08. Main purpose of our trip was general sight-seeing so this was a great location. No problems, very clean and a good rate for NYC. I would stay here again. 
20663 The hotel was not a nice hotel. Dingy feeling, small and cramped. Was a fiasco. DONT STAY HERE unless you absolutely have to. 
20664 Central. Clean. Courtious. What more could you ask for Very good we will return ... Gill & Tony Cure England 
20665 This hotel is a cheap accommodation for visiting manhattan. Do not expect luxury and spacious rooms, but if you go there only to sleep at night, this accomodation is OK. The problem was the air conditioning very very noisy, you can not sleep at night if not with earplugs! 
20666 a very good hotel with all parts operating properly. the breakfasts were great , opened on time with excellent service staff very friendly. the location is ideal for michigan avenue and is surrounded by quite a few nice restaurants and bars 
20667 Lovely hotel with amazing panoramic views of river. Meeting hotel was the Hyatt which is cramped and outdated. The Westin had large rooms, comfortable beds, and good amenities. Only negative was expensive Wifi. 
20668 Great staff, close to Times Square, overpriced even with beakfast included. 
20669 Bad neighborhood, rude staff, uncomfortable rooms. I'm really not hard to please at all and I realize we didn't pay for the Ritz, but this place is awful. If you have a few extra bucks a night, find something else. Terrible experience, will never return. 
20670 Great location! We had a really good stay at this hotel we were happy with everything. The room was quite and clean and the lifts were easy to use and no waiting. Recommended to anyone who wants to see the city and have a comfortable stay. NYC ON YOUR DOORSTEP 
20671 Great location for this small cheerful hotel. Not large but very comfortable and appointed rooms as well as clean and surprisingly quiet Very efficient and pleasant staff. Not much of a lobby but plenty of eating and drinking places nearby. 
20672 In process of being refurbished, but no inconvenience to those who stay. The rooms are spacious, clean and well equipped. The reception staff were incredibly helpful and thoughtful. The hotel is very well located and is great value for the centre of NYC! 
20673 hotel in excellent position for going to various places in new york, hotel was basic just about 3 star rating, breakfast was very plastic ie plates knives forks and spoons, personnel veery helpful. 
20674 Great place to start off my time in New York, great location, felt very safe and great value. 
20675 this hotel is located in 7th ave & 56st, convenient for central manhattan, theatres etc, although the lobby is refurbished, the rooms are quite old looking and small, if you get one facing inside they can be pretty dark. 
20676 Had a great stay! The staff was pleasant and the room was clean and comfortable. There is a fitness center and a wine bar/ restaurant on site. I was expecting the surroundings to be loud but was pleasantly suprised that I got a very decent night sleep 
20677 I have visited the paramount hotel from July 4 to July 6.The rooms are good and clean.The help desk service person (catherine) was very help full.I will visit this hotel for my future new york trips. 
20678 I've stayed here several times. It's a very nice hotel with amazing central park views & access. I would definitely stay here again. Negatives: not close to the downtown action (if you like it), touristy, hard to find casual bars/restaurants 
20679 We had a wonderful view of Times Square, Room 3319, the room was adequate with 2 double beds and small couch. The price certainly didn't match the amenities but you pay for the location. 
20680 Very small rooms. Had to change first room because of heavy smoke odor. Had to be there because of work in our apartment, felt like we were being punished. 
20681 We were very pleased with Hotel Metro. Clean rooms, very quiet. Very comfortable beds. Great shower with hot water and great water flow. Breakfast was good and all appeared clean. I'd recommend this hotel for your next trip to New York City and we plan to return next year. 
20682 If you don't mind walking to get to the Magnificent Mile, this is a great place to stay. The view from the rooms is awesome, the staff was helpful and polite, and the rooms were very comfortable and clean. I booked it on Priceline for $50 a night :) 
20683 Suites are well designed and comfortable. The breakfast is much better than typical. Enjoyed it very much. 
20684 Fantastic rooms, amenities, location and service. Enough said. Didn't try the restaurant but hope to do so next time. 
20685 This is a very nice hotel located perfectly away from the craziness of time square. Great neighborhood feel close to subway, excellent restaurants, and Central Park. This was our fourth stay at the hotel and will return again. 
20686 I was here for a business trip. This is one of the best hilton properties in New York. Room size if good considering the avg new york hotel room size. Very nice views, i was on 52nd floor. Very convenient to Financial District / Brooklyn. 
20687 cannot expect a better location to be in when visiting Chicago. The rooms are OK. nothing to rave about - but good enough. easily accessible to the CTA and the buses. Can just walk all over the place (even to the Navy Pier) 
20688 The hotel is in a great location for Broadway shows. The value was great. The breakfast was included as well as a cheese reception from 5-8 p.m. The staff was warm and friendly. The rooms are small but very comfortable. 
20689 The location of this hotel is great. Easy access to anything. The hotel is average. The rooms are OK, but probably need an update. The service was good, however and the hotel is clean. 
20690 Small rooms but very clean and practice, and perfect ubication. Very good. 
20691 I came into town at the last minute and at this hotel. It was a very pleasant stay and the front desk clerk was extremely nice and professional. If I had to stay in that area again,I would definitely stay again 
20692 Very clean, newly renovated, no bugs :) Got the disability-room on the first floor, bigger than the usual rooms, very nice. Could hear every word spoken in the hallway, so don't expect to sleep too long in the morning. Except this, very pleased with the hotel. 
20693 I had a quick business trip to Houston and stayed here. Thanks to Ericka at reception, who was outstanding, I got a very nice room. It was easy to get to downtown restaurants. Breakfast at the Brazos restaurant was good too. 
20694 Top notch; will be back. Everything about this hotel is quality; service, food, rooms. Wonderful. What more can be said? My wife highly recommends the salon 
20695 Stayed half downtown and half uptown and this property was recommended by agent as virtuoso property. Great value and staff extremely friendly. Almost a serviced apartment and a true new york experience. Even met GM when having breakfast and he shewed me a model of new ground floor restaurant. 
20696 Good location, room was clean, not huge but had a nice bathroom. Just used hotel for sleeping, didn't use any other facilities so can't comment. Recommend Pershing Square opposite Grand Central Station for breakfast, magnificent! 
20697 Fantastic location. Walking distance for major tourist attractions, shopping and restaurants. Price very accesible and warmer attention. 
20698 Everything was perfect, breakfast in bed, grand margarita, perfectly clean; employees are intelligent and helpful. What else can you say? 
20699 The staff in the was really nice and helpful, the hotel was very clean and the rooms were really nice too! The only thing that was disturbing was that the heater was making loud noises sometimes but everything else was great! 
20700 My wife and I stayed at the Hilton right before Thanksgiving in 2004. Average hotel but we weren't at the hotel very much at all. Good location and Weber Grill Restaurant in lobby is very good. Our rate was $139, 
20701 This was my first stay at the Hilton Southwest 
20702 I found the staff to be very friendly and made me feel like a VIP upon my arrival. I was very happy and would stay again! 
20703 I can't imagine staying anywhere else in NYC. The location of this hotel is worth every extra penny. We were able to walk to nearly every tourist destination, b-way show, and being smack dab across the street from the TKTS booth saved us both time and money. 
20704 Train station are pretty far, but this hotel is totally worth the stay for the price. It has a living room, with a dining table, and a room, much like a small bedroom apartment and the bathroom is beautiful. Customer service is great.! 
20705 In the seventies I lived in NY and selected your hotel primarily for its location. The view from my room to the time square brought back memories ! However, my stay at your hotel was perfect and I will be back. 
20706 LIndo hotel, con historia y muy bien ubicado en la gran manzana. 
20707 Most comfortable beds, very restful sleep. Very nice flatscreen tv. Very convinient free shuttle service to MD Anderson. Have stayed at this LQ several times in the past year and it keeps getting better. thank you 
20708 We were disappointed with the rooms in the hotel - very pokey and fairly dated. Needs an overhaul. 
20709 Pros: - location, all the trendiest restaurants and shops are located within 5 min reach - modern design, ergonomic room - smart and good-looking stuff - a selection of restaurants and bars within hotel Cons: - quite expensive for a tiny room - loud - elevators work strangely, long waiting 
20710 After many bad experiences with hotel on Manhattan, Hilton Fashion District was a great exception. The hotel is very stylish and the location is great for seeing the city. Rooms are small (typical for NY hotels), but very comfortable and clean. I would definately stay here again. 
20711 The room was ridiculously small, but it IS NYC. It was a great location, and the people were nice and knowledgeable of the area. I'll try another GEM hotel before I go back to this one. 
20712 hotel tres bien situe juste a cote de central station et a quelques minutes de times square,de plus il est tres calme le soir et cela est tres agreable apres une journee dans new york.personnel tres agreable et serviable.zen et tres correcte pour les prix hors saison. 
20713 First stay at the Waldorf, very pleased. Bed comfortable, staff friendly, great location in the city, walking distance to many attractions and subway. First class stay!!! Lot's of history in the Waldorf. Would return, highly recommended. 
20714 Jason at the front desk was helpful and gave us priceliners a room with a nice view of the lake. The beds didn't seem like they were queen sized, but still a great stay nonetheless. The location was nice, too. 
20715 There are wifi signals intermittently available in the room, including one called "guest internet," which will take your money but are not part of the hotel and are not stable internet signals. The hotel has hard-wired internet for $12.95 per day, or free wifi in the lobby. 
20716 Nice hotel near central park. Near blue ribbon my favorite restourant. Good full breakfast 
20717 Friendly people. Rooms it's noise because air-condition system it's not perfect but average it's really good. 
20718 Stayed overnight between flights. Was impressed with the welcome and quality of the hotel. The room was really comfortable with excellent furnishings. The breakfast in the restaurant was excellent. The concierge was very helpful with shopping information and arrangements. 
20719 A terrible place. The service is so bad. The hotel staff is very rude. I left some of my stuff in the room but lost them when I came back at night. Very bad experience. Do not stay in this hotel. 
20720 Stayed here last year, beautiful hotel, staff very welcoming and fantastic facilities! Think i tried every pillow on the pillow menu and each one was amazing! Will definitely come back here if i return to New York :) 
20721 Sunny at the front desk always takes care of me. She is the best. The hotel is located just steps from Time Square and Saks Fifth Avenue. 
20722 Nice concept of a hotel. Everything is new and staff are friendly and helpful. I loved how easy it is to check in. The distance to Times Square is quite good. I wish I could have stayed longer. 
20723 Had a wonderful stay. Staff couldn't be more attentive. A wonderful location, close to everything we wanted. Would definitely stay again. 
20724 Good, clean hotel in a great location. The guys on the front desk were always very helpful. I'll be back again next time..... 
20725 Location was great, staff was wonderful and very helpful. Rooms are small but very well maintained. Breakfast was also very good. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
20726 Could not get a room at Hyatt, so booked at this hotel instead. I was plesantly surprised at how great this hotel was. Very responsive staff, absolutely meticulous housekeeping, and great attention to detail. I highly recommend. 
20727 We had a very nice clean room in mid-town Manhattan. Yes the view from the room was not great but I didn't visit Manhattan to view the New York Skycrapers from my room. I would highly recommend it to others. Great experience. 
20728 I spent the weekend at the hotel and the service was perfect. The room was great and the staff was awesome as always. This is my favorite hotel in New York. 
20729 The rooms are great and check in went smooth. The restraunt in the hotel isn't cheap, but conveiyent. The fries were very good! All in all a good stay. A great location for an early morning flight. 
20730 The hotel staff were great and the rooms were just great. We were a group of 22 people. The hotel is within walking distance of 5th avenue. The rooms has snacks as well :) The closet is small however. 
20731 I am 90% happy with this hotel. Extremely friendly staff. Everything we asked for was given a positive response. The hotel rooms are not well sound insulated. Except for that I do not have a negative remark 
20732 Stayed here multiple times, but during the Christams Holiday season is special. Well located, exceptional service, clean and well appointed rooms. Family friendly. 
20733 TRES BONNE SITUATION MAIS HOTEL MOYEN LE PERSONNEL NE PARLE PAS DU TOUT FRANCAIS LES PRIX DU BAR OU DU PETIT DEJEUNER TRES CHERS !PAS DE CHAINE FRANCAISE A LA TV ! (italien-allemand-espagnol !)LE DEPOT DES BAGAGES EST PAYANT 3$75 LE BAGAGE ! 
20734 The hotel had nice rooms... lobby seems a bit generic, pool could use hot tub and water heated a little more. Restaurant needs to be geared more towards dinner and less of a sports bar. 
20735 Pour un sejour de 6 jours, super bien situe (a cote de Grand Central Station et de la biblioteque), bus + metro a cote. Hotel sympa, discret, cosy. Grande chambre avec bcp de place. Moyennement calme quand on donne sur la rue malgre le double vitrage, mais acceptable pour NYC. 
20736 First time in New York with my student daughter and the Hilton Hotel Times Square was the Perfect location. First class service excellent spotless clean rooms. Fantastic breakfast I found the hotel faultless and staff very helpful and friendly. Would not consider any other hotel on my next visit 
20737 Stayed at the hotel for the first time. Received a good value, nice staff Great deal for my business trip. Its in a great location 
20738 Needed a few thing staff was helpful and the rooms were very clean bed very nice. I recommend this hotel and will return. 
20739 Great location but for the cost was just average. I was there for a conference so understand being booked but... A room right next to the elevator as a "member" really you would think rate just a little 
20740 Excellent location near Times Square and Port authority bus terminal, modern furniture, clean and essential rooms, mini breakfast with muffins and coffee free. Modern technology for check-in/ check-out and for the luggage's deposit. Very kind staff. 
20741 Tres bien situe pres de l'ONU, tres peu bruyant, grands studios et appartements avec une vraie cuisine. Personnel charmant, aux petits soins, tres bon service, particulierement souriant. Superbe terrasse avec vue a 360o. Excellente connexion wi-fi 
20742 Very nice hotel and very close to Kemah. I did not know Kemah existed but it is a very nice night spot 
20743 Room was small, but very quiet, clean, comfortable, and stylish. Staff was professional - no problems encountered. Not having free wi-fi really bugs me at this price, but I guess it's not unusual. Great location. Would recommend/stay again. 
20744 Overall, great location, good sized room, would stay here again. 
20745 Loved the location. Lifts were slow at times and it has a very small lobby. We stayed in a one room suite with kitchenette. We found the staff unfriendly and unapproachable. 
20746 Great price considering the very convenient location to Times Square. The continental breakfast selection was exceptional. The room was clean and had all necessities including WiFi. Certainly would return. 
20747 really enjoyed my visit here. great views of downtown, cool energy in the lobby and bars, garden bar was a party on sunday afternoon, favorite hotel in ny now. in the middle of great shopping and restaurants. Concierge was real helpful too. 
20748 the rooms are tiny and the corner of the beds leave black and blue marks on the shins if you get too close, but other than that(and the lack of espn 2 according to my husband) this hotel is clean, hip and convenient to everything including the us open. 
20749 We made our first trip to NYC and were forunate to find this hotel close to Central park , theater district, subway, food etc. The rooms were well cared for and the staff / service was terrific! 
20750 I have stayed at the Cosmopolitan at least 6 times. It's very clean and has a friendly staff. The location is the attraction for me. There is so much to do in the Soho, Tribeca, Noho area, without the commerial feel of Midtown. 
20751 Great location, art - deco styling was very nice, Mohammed at the front desk was awsome. Upgraded our room free of charge to an Empire State building view. 
20752 Well located, good facilities, very cosy 
20753 Stayed in this hotel last week. Fantastic location. Next to Carnegie Hall. 3 streets from Central Park. Would highly reccommend to other travellers. You can easily walk to Times Square. 
20754 Rooms are small but super cute and comfortable. Staff is very professional and easy going, helping every way they can for your stay at the hotel and what to do in the city. The terrace bar is out of this world. Location is really good. HD TV. 
20755 This is a great hotel that is walking distance to many good things to see & do. The restaurant has great customer service. Ask for Winston. He is fantastic! 
20756 A great hotel just blocks away from Times Square. Staff was very accomodating. Beautiful hotel right next to St Patricks Cathedral. 
20757 I booked a suite. Excellent value for New York. $440 per night, large bathroom, excellent accomodations and view directly to the Empre State building. Perfect! Would recommend and personally repeat anytime. 
20758 Perfect location, great staff. You can't find a better value on Michigan Ave. 
20759 Diana & the Cleaning staff helped me find my iPad that I misplaced. They were quick & courteous! All the staff were very pleasant! Great Hotel! 
20760 The hotel is a modern victorian classic. It's so chic and the perfect distance to all the fabulous goings on in downtown Chicago. Service was excellent. Workers are attentive and incredibly helpful. Loved the atmosphere and will go back! 
20761 La location est tres bien et je recommanderais donc cet hotel pour sa situation mais pas pour tout le reste: Nous avons eu la chambre la plus petite (du a la promo expedia?), WIFI payant, pas de petit dej... proprete limite (serviettes pas tres clean) 
20762 Being a frequent traveler to NYC, I have stayed a various hotels (all 4 to 5 stars) and enjoyed my stay @ Fashion26 the best. The rooms were modern and clean, great roof top bar, terrific customer service (everyone called me by name....) and prices were reasonable. 
20763 The hotel was in a great location. The rooms were very small but updated. The workers were very kind and willing to help. 
20764 Spent 2 wonderful nights in NYC at Hotel Mela to celebrate my birthday with my husband. Wonderful staff,friendly.. very contemporary clean rooms. Convenient to theater district and mass transit. No problems, would defintely recommend to others 
20765 Very good situation indeed. Lots of character. Near to a very good 24 hour deli. Comfortable but not glamorous. Theatre District right on the doorstep. Very secure. Staff always able to answer questions. 
20766 Qutie a nice hotel, the room was a good size but it could have been a bit cleaner. Really good location. The service was ok. 
20767 Great place to stay, right near the Blue line Subway station so it's easy to get to any place from the hotel. Out standing service the bellmen were most helpfull 
20768 Room very small. Water temperature in shower very hard to regulate. Small lobby. Not impressed. 
20769 Wij (een stel van 31 en 36) hebben hier 7 nachten doorgebracht. Onze eerste keer in NYC. Dit hotel heeft al onze verwachtingen overtroffen! Mooi pand, best ruime kamer, heel vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. De locatie was geweldig! Een absolute aanrader voor iedereen die NYC gaat bezoeken. 
20770 Fuer einen Kurzaufenthalt durchaus geeignet. Die Zimmer sind jedoch SEHR hellhoerig. Man hoert die Toilettenspuelung bzw. Dusche des Nachbarn, was ziemlich laut und unangenehm ist. Gutes Fruehstuecksbuffet. 
20771 - Very nice restaurants: both Norma's for upscale breakfast / brunch, and the beautiful "corridor" for breakfast - Nice and clean rooms 
20772 Had a lovey trip here that was business and pleasure. A very small, but cute and clean room with an excellent bed. Nice location with easy access to subway. 
20773 Our 5 nights at the Gansevoort were a fabulous experience,Tim, the manager, made everything easy and answered all needs. The staff is amazingly consistent in providing responsive, competent service. The beds are the BEST! We will always stay at Gansevoort when in NYC. MSS 
20774 Outstanding service and above average rooms. Perfect hotel to enjoy the spirit of New York. Ask for a room on the 56th Street side, as high as possible. 
20775 Without any doubts this is the best hotel in New York City. The service is outstanding, from the porters to the personal butler that will accomodate to every request. The rooms are luxurious, the location fantastic. Highly recommended. 
20776 Very small room, small bathroom, it was quiet, very old building, quiet and for the location very reasonable. 
20777 Good for travelers on a budget, wanting no frills. Easy access to Grant/millenium Parks. Walking distance to Michigan Ave. 
20778 Stayed here for two nights in mid February. I was incredibly impressed by the size of the room (especially considering that it is in the heart of Manhattan) and the special touches (Bang and Olufsen electronics etc). Def would stay here again! 
20779 Great location, comfortable rooms...within walking distance to Broadway shows, attractions in Times Square. But tons of people blocking the front entrance and lots of traffic in the area. 
20780 Dit hotel is super gelegen, midden op Times Square. De service was prima. Fitness ruimte erg klein, Voor de liefhebbers zijn er zwembadparty's 'savonds. Qua comfort was de kamer erg klein maar als je er toch alleen maar slaapt is dat geen obstakel. Zeker aan te raden! 
20781 Kamers zijn zeer groot en netjes onderhouden!! Bedden lagen heerlijk. Keuken met koelkast en een ruime badkamer. Verder is de service zeer goed. We hadden problemen met het toilet en 5 minuten later stond er al iemand voor de deur. 
20782 Great rooms, great service, great restaurant!!! 
20783 The rooms are small, the breakfast is descent, the location is ideal , the staff is courteous and helpful - My score, 9 Alcapurrias out a 10 !!!! 
20784 Lobby and lounge is very trendy and good, however rooms look old and small. Internet is extra and costs 10 $ per day. Hotel is very close to Central Park and Time Warner building. There is no complimentary breakfast. Service is below average. 
20785 This hotel was recently renovated and is beautifully done. It is located on the Upper West Side and is across the street from the Fairway market which is one the greatest grocery stores. The hotel rooms come with complete kitchen. We really enjoyed our stay here. 
20786 If you plan to arrive to your hotel just to sleep, this is a great option in NYC, steps from the Empire State Building & Macys. Not far from Times square 10min walk, and great Korean food options in the same block. Good price but everything in NYC is expensive. 
20787 The rooms are large and comfortable. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. Bathroom was a bit small but everything was there that we needed. Great location for the theater and pre-theater restaurants 
20788 The staff, service, and chic of this hotel make it an exceptional find in SoHo. Everyone is super attentive. The rooms are excellent/functional, and the beds are really comfortable. As someone who travels over 300 nights a year, this is outstanding. 
20789 Superb Service Excellent Location close to main attractions... Service is number one! Highly recommend it! Its not the building, its not the location, but yes the attitude of the staff that makes this Four Seasons Hotel one the finest in the World... 
20790 had a good stay at this location. it is central to most of New York. they did mess up one night on cleaning the room...wasnt done all but they soon rectified it and thereafter service very good. would stay there again. No swimming pool. Concierge were good. 
20791 After reading reviews, I had low expectations for this hotel - it far exceeded those expectations. Tired, yes. In need of maintenance, yes. But immaculately clean, a modern and open lobby, pleasant service and reasonably priced. 
20792 I Wont talk much and wont annoy you into details but this hotel has one single positive point which is facing Madison Square Garden.....whatever you can imagine else is a disaster....dirt, bathroom , furniture, lobby.....everything stinks....will repeat how NYC allow this hotel to continue....shameful 
20793 While on business I stayed at this hotel. While the room was pretty small (but they all are in NYC) I was very comfortable. The hotel is in a great location close to several subway stations and a short walk to Times Square. 
20794 The rooms & common areas were clean and well appointed. The staff helped every time we requested help. No failures. 
20795 A really nice place to stay in the Upper West Side. Love the 16th floor balcony and the fitness room. Very friendly and competent staff, I will be back. 
20796 HOTEL IN POSIZIONE VERAMENTE STRATEGICA E PERSONALE MOLTO CORTESE E DISPONIBILE. QUALITA' DELLA CAMERA BUONA ANCHE SE DECISAMENTE PICCOLA. LA PULIZIA ERA ABBASTANZA BUONA MA LA MOQUETTE SAREBBE DECISAMENTE DA ELIMINARE O ALMENO SOSTITUIRE. 
20797 Just two blocks from Times Square, our room had a great view of Empire State Building! i work for Marriott so my standards are high, but Tito did a great job checking us in! 
20798 The hotel is very close to the subway. Our luggage was securely kept. The only dissatisfaction came from the moist floor and the restroom, which required maintenance. 
20799 This hotel was in a perfect location for exploring the Upper West side and other parts of Manhattan. There are two subway stops that are very close. Great eating places and grocery stores nearby. The room was comfortable and clean. We loved it! 
20800 Location, location, location. On the heart of NYC great quality and excellent service! 
20801 The cheapest hotel I could afford in NY and was excellent value for money. The hotel had a slight hostel feel but is great for young people looking for somewhere decent to stay, The room was basic but you get what you pay for 
20802 We had a wonderful weekend celebrating our anniversary and as always enjoyed the excellent service from the Westin-Michigan Ave. I look forward to visiting this hotel again soon! 
20803 This hotel is perfect for business as its right downtown and connected to the convention center. Also the hotel itself has great decor and is not the typical "convention center" hotel. I had a great stay. There is a shuttle that will take you several locations in the area 
20804 servizio cordiale e attento, splendidi a dir poco gli spazi comuni, la posizione, la frequentazione. assolutamente non adatto ai bambini per le dimensioni delle camere standard. da vedere assolutamente se soggiornate con bagalio leggero e per poche notti! 
20805 Non eccellente, ho soggiornato in camera superior al 48 piano. Pulizia discreta, camera non enorme ma sufficiente, bagno nella norma. Reception cortese e rapida. 
20806 Very convenient location, superior service and comfort. A relatively small lobby area, due to the constraints of the location. Right on Central Park. Hansom cabs within view, the Waldorf is right down the block. 
20807 Gehorige kamers, lawaaiige bouwwerkzaamheden tegenover het hotel, kamerdeur stond twee maal open toen wij 's avonds terugkeerden, badkamer en kamer worden niet goed schoongemaakt, weinig kastruimte, haperende douche. 
20808 we enjoyed the rooms and the staff, but the best part was the pool and the price! 
20809 I spent a weekend at this property, and enjoyed the stay. The property is very well kept, has great ambiance, you will enjoy the modern design around the common areas as well as in the guest rooms. Very helpful courteous staff, great location, within walking distance to Soho! 
20810 This is a decent hotel, we only spent one night in a room with two double beds, really comfy. Location is fantastic, close to the Empire Estate, lots of 24h shops around. Breakfast was OK, toast and pastries, cereal and several hot drinks. Front desk were very nice. 
20811 Enjoyed a wonderful stay at this location June 2012. Staff was very helpful and pleasant. Breakfast service met my expectations for the wonderful Embassy Suites standard. Location was perfect. Easy access to many restaurants and good shopping. I would definitely recommend to others. 
20812 Two blocks from Grand Central, this was a great find on the east side. Reasonable rate for mid-town, efficient professional staff, and nice rooms make it a place to consider for business travel. 
20813 My husband and I had one of our most memorable hotel experiences at the Suisse due to the service. Every person was polite, attentive, and helpful. We will stay there everytime we go to Chicago. Highly suggest staying there. 
20814 I stayed with my family for couple days, the hotel was very clean and nice. Everyone there was nice, especially George who made sure that we had everything we needed and gave us some great tips bout navigating the city for my parents who visited ny for the fist time. 
20815 I had read the reviews and wasn't disappointed. Great location, very near evrything including subway. New hotel, helpful staff in reception. Excellent breakfast though in little dining-room. Great rooftop bar with fantastic views of Empire State. Excellent bed! 
20816 Great value for the view and spectacular location in the heart of Times Square! Rooms are big, clean and beds are comfortable. Definitely worth the price. Although I didn't have much time to spend in the hotel, the facilities seemed to be very nice. 
20817 One of the best hotel i have ever been. Nice hospitality...great view from rooms. The staff is so friendly & helpful to assist you whenever you want. Without giving a second thought you could book this hotel & enjoy your stay. 
20818 The front desk staff was horrible...especially in the afternoon. The man (george) was extremely rude and unhelpful. If something happens to go missing in that hotel...good luck in getting anyone to help you find it. Totally ruined my trip. I would not reccommend this hotel to anyone. 
20819 stayed for 5 nights,great hotel very central,staff very friendly. 
20820 Nice hotel with friendly staff, rooms are small but good, comfortable beds, nice bathrooms with great shower, liked the Aveda products. Handy mid-town location. Booked on hotel website and got reasonable, discounted price (180 US$ for kingsize room, no breakfast). Free wifi. Free tea/coffee 24/7. 
20821 Spent a week there in late March and was pleasantly surprised. I've stayed at multiple places in Manhattan due to business and I foudn the rooms a little larger and the people a little nicer than most. I will say here the next time. 
20822 Miniscule rooms but good service and location and food options. Nice fitness center. Bellmen were fabulous hooking me up with car service, cabs, directions, advice. Will stay here again for midtown business. 
20823 As a travel agent I have traveled alot and have stayed in many hotels. This is about the worst you can get. I had read the reviews thinking, it can't be that bad. IT IS. 
20824 What a nice hotel. We always book a suite and the service is real attentive. We have stayed here over 7 different times and never a complaint 
20825 Bueno, Bonito y Barato(visto lo visto). No os perdais el rooftop (y llevaros cervecitas). 
20826 We hebben hier 3 overnachtingen gehad. Hotel zowel van buiten als binnen mooi en zeer netjes. Alles uitermate schoon, kamer ruim, luxe en verzorgd. Rustige straat en geen geluidsoverlast van buiten. Locatie is prima en goed bereikbaar. 
20827 Nice stay at this hotel. Management was very accommodating with large group attending a family reunion. Very convenient location with easy access to freeways and shopping. 
20828 First time at this hotel but we will be back. the staff was very friendly and helpful. The room was clean and comfortable. location is excellent. wine and cheese at night is a very nice touch. 
20829 Hotel was in a good location, just outside of all the hustle and bustle....Rooms were great, kitchenette was very convenient. Staff was very friendly. We would definately stay here again. 
20830 The rooms can be a little small, but this is a clean hotel and you can walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Plaza, Penn Station, etc. as well as the subway. 
20831 Looks good from the outside,dated inside, lives in the past. Breakfast service could be better. Not a bad stay. Enjoyed the Peninsular more. 
20832 This was our second stay at the hotel and for the price it can't be beat. I frequently travel to Chicago for work and this will be my hotel of choice going forward. 
20833 I booked the room for 7 nights using Hotels.com and spent over $3200. However westin refused to give me points towards my Starwoods because I made my reservations using Hotels.com and not directly through Westin. This is speacilly unpleasant because I paid the commison to Hotels.Com and not the Westin. 
20834 this hotel has very kindly staff and very good skyline view but it's a little bit out of the center. it's next to hudson river and 10 mins to times squire by walking. it has an awesome roof bar with a great view. you'll love it. 
20835 Excellent location, a truly memorable experience, from the time we checked in to the time when we had to reluctantly leave. Rooms excellent, staff friendly and attentive, will definitively return to stay at the Waldorf Astoria NY. 
20836 hotel posizionato in ottima posizione x metro, accessibile facilmente a tutte le zone, pulito, ideale x una vacanza senza troppi lussi.....prezzo conveniente. disponibili. lo consiglio. 
20837 There are much better hotels in NYC than the Hudson. The place is a complete fire trap and terribly dark and black. Get out of there and get a decent hotel. 
20838 Worst hotel i've ever been! Everything was dirty and old. Bed bugs, stains everywhere. You don't want to sleep here! When we came in there were used tissues everywhere around the room. Toothbrushes and empty bottles under the bed. They haven't cleaned here for weeks/months/years. 
20839 Lovely suites, very spacious, very quiet considering it's near busy Time Square. Rooms were very clean, staff nice and friendly. Would definitelly recommend to stay there. 
20840 Had to call to have the heat turned on 2 of the 3 nights we were there. Missed our wake up call. Had everything we needed though and quiet. Overall good. 
20841 really good rooms, and fabulous service. I especially liked the fact that they had a complimentary 24 hour tea and coffee area. Great location too, just around the corner from 5th avenue! 
20842 Stayed here on a layover at George Bush Intercontinental. The location is excelent, you can walk to the Hotel from the Airport or take the tram. The hotel is getting a little bit worn but the staff is friendly and helpful. I would stay there again. 
20843 Had a great 5 night stay, service and cleanliness were excellent. Staff were helpful and the breakfast buffet was great. Would have no hesitation in recommending to all. 
20844 The Waldorf is an outstanding hotel. The rooms are clean and comforatble and the service is terrific. Jackie at the Diamond Desk goes to extraordinary lengths to make guests welcome and comfortable. The waldorf is my favorite hotel in NYC, my home away from home! 
20845 good inexpensive place if you want to be close to the theatre district. Clean, helpful staff and located on a quiet street. 
20846 Just got back from a few days in New York. Good location and very friendly, helpful staff. The breakfast was much better than anticipated so a nice surprise. Got a great rate through AAA too! Would definitely stay here again and recommmend it highly. 
20847 Ecceller place to STAy. Last month Ii came to ny only with my daughter 8year old?She chose from web yotel hotel and we loved that choice very much! So now we invite all THE people to nave out beautiful experience. Be' sure choose yotel hotel!!!!! 
20848 Staying here you are literally a stones throw from times square and a 10 minute walk upto Central Park. Room was a good size and we had a fantastic view from our room on 29th floor. Very clean. Everything you could need. 
20849 Wife and I went there for a weekend retreat...the hotel was wonderful. The hotel exceeded are expectations, the staff, room, location were all excellent. I would definetly recommend this hotel. 
20850 Stayed here over St Patricks weekend - the Hotel completely lived up to all the reviews - wil definitely stay again ! 
20851 One of the best hotels in the area. I enjoyed my stay very much and i definetely recommend this beautiful hotel. 
20852 I have had a good experience here. Sonya and Rapy were very helpful. All of the people working here has been very friendly and helpful during my stay. Also, the rates are reasonable and I would stay here again. 
20853 Beautiful hotel, helpful staff, clean and spacious rooms, great location - two blocks from Magnificent Mile, Museum of Contemporary Art, John Hancock Observatory, Broadway Playhouse, Macy's, great restaurants. 
20854 Location great, short walking distance to main attractions. Quiet area and comfortable rooms. Super breakfast buffet and nice bar. Service at concierge not 100%... 
20855 The hotel incl. the rooms definitely look bigger on the pictures than in real life, so don't be surprised... Pretty good location without being located in the most touristic areas. The Subway is three minutes walk away, so you can quickly get to the tourist attractions. 
20856 I have stayed at this property many times and have been impressed not only with the quality of the accomodations and staff but also the convenience of their location. Great place to stay when in NYC. 
20857 Excellent location, could see the Empire State Building from our window. Clean and staff helpful. Breakfast was very basic but set you up for the day. Free tea and Coffee at the entrance, just help yourself. Very busy at the lift's in the morning. 
20858 prima hotel,waar we zomaar een suite kregen en deze ook nog aan de 'stille' kant lag. Het ontbijt was grappig en on hollands. Donut's,koffiebroodjes met jelly te beleggen koffie en dit alles geserveerd op plastic weggooi bordjes.Lekker was het wel en heel goedkoop. 
20859 Great Location, Clean, Nice Design, Friendly, Free Internet, For NY real Great Value for Mmoney. Without hesitation would visit again. 
20860 Quiet but central location, big, spotlessly clean rooms and great service. If you can get a good deal online I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
20861 Our 1st time at Hotel Metro, got a free upgrade to a suite. Room was great, wish we had more time to enjoy it. Staff was very friendly too. Good location, will stay there again! 
20862 This hotel is in an excellent position and is close to Times Square being in Midtown Manhattan. Extremely busy (like a railway station actually) but plenty of very friendly helpful staff to assist. Rooms are large, clean and well appointed. Wi-Fi is free in foyer. Would definitely stay there again. 
20863 The attention to detail is that you don't see anymore in hotels. Leather door handles, suede lined walls, leather wrapped furniture, top hats.....its classic oasis in Midtown. 
20864 Absolutely brilliant hotel, clean and tidy and very contemporary. Beautifully decorated rooms. Friendly staff and sooooooo close to times square but far enough from the hustle and bustle!!! Complimentary wine between 5 & 6 pm is a must too!!!! Couldn't recommend higher!! 
20865 Always a pleasure to return to the Peninsula NY. I've tried many other NYC hotels but none can compete. Location, rooms, spa, fitness... everything is perfect. 
20866 The Hotel is located right next to Times Square. The rooms are spacious and clean. Great service at front desk, concierge and everyone we ran into - very relaxing after a hectic day in NYC. 
20867 Excellent all around service, from the time we arrived, to transportation, restaurants and simply making us feel special. Wonderful service and exceptional concierge. 
20868 E' il classico albergone americano per turisti e 'uomini/donne d'affari'. E' posizionato in una zona strategica accanto alla Grand Central Station e collegato ad essa. A pochi passi da Time Square, dall'Empire State Building e da Cental Park. Le camere sono di media grandezza. I bagni piccolissimi. 
20869 very good value for money hotel was clean rooms where big staff was friendly makes you feel at home i would reccomand to visit this hotel for stay. 
20870 The hotel was great, the rooms were clean and very nice. The breakfast was fantastic and the coffee is some of the best I have ever had. Parking was also good. 
20871 At this hotel I got the smallest rooms I ever had! Also the deco is old and need refurbishments. Staff is friendly and meals are good. Location, close to Grand Central, is good. But please give me bigger rooms!!! 
20872 Everything about the Gramercy Park Hotel is classy and tasteful. You can't do better at a high-end NYC hotel and the location is also superb, central to everything in the city. Very highly recommended. 
20873 We stayed for 1 night in August , is a very simple hotel , in an excellent location , the bathrooms are updated and the rooms are spacious and clean, the reception staff are very helpful and friendly 
20874 We spent the weekend at this property and were very pleased. It is in a very good location and the executive lounge was very nice. Rooms were spacious enough as was bathroom. Lobby areas were grand. 
20875 My girlfriend and I traveled from Seattle to New York to do some christmas shopping. We stayed at the Westin because I stay there for business and its always a realiable experience. This was no exception - exactly what you would expect from a Westin. 
20876 This was my second stay at Hotel Mela. The staff was fantastic as usual. An automatic free upgrade to an Executive Room - Very nice and large enough to do YOGA!! Good ize room for NYC. I will definitely stay here again. 
20877 Siamo ritornati con figli,nipoti. Ci siamo trovati veramente bene.Accoglienza di massima signorilita' di alberghi a New York ne abbiamo frequentati molti,ma questo ne vale la pena per i servizi eccellenti ,tutti i confort sono eccezionali,la prossima volta ci ritorneremo. Arrivederci Ans/Graziellla/Bruno/Maxi/Valentina/Vanessa/veronica/Cristina/Martina/Patrizia/Daniela. 
20878 The rooms are poorly laid out and worn, heat is either on or off, slow internet. Today the conceirge floor for hilton honors guests is closed and the staff is indifferent. Given the abundance of hotels in the City including other nicer Hiltons, there is no reason to stay here. 
20879 Good location and close to restaurants with a nice breakfast but the hotel needs updating. The rooms and kitchen are in need of repair and new appliances. 
20880 The room I had this time had been renovated. It was up to Sheraton standards but the bathroom was tiny. The staff at breakfast were definitely a cut above. 
20881 We enjoyed our stay. We were upgraded to a Junior Suite, which was very nice, but little things were off. No TV access from the sitting area, not dresser per se, etc. The Concierge, James, gave us great advice. Somehow otherwise the staff was not very in tune with service. 
20882 If you don't want to spend to much but don't want to stay in a dump - this is a very good option in Manhattan - especially if you prefer SPG hotels... then this is definetely your best option. FREE BOTTLED WATER! 
20883 Now stay here as my hotel of choice in NY on business. Clean, quiet even with bar area at night which is very nice with the fireplaces and fun spot. 
20884 The 2 bedroom suite was spacious and nice. Nice kitchen with a granite countertop. Well laid-out. Nicely furnished. Large breakfast buffet, but lots of guests. The hotel is located just off Michigan Avenue next to the Knickerbocker and just down the street from The Drake. 
20885 great hotel and good area opposite Madison square gardens only 5 mins walk to Macys and about8 - 10 mins walk to time square 
20886 High high end boutique hotel. Elegant in heart of City. Great value. 
20887 Had a great time shopping, hotel was beautiful, service was great!! 
20888 Loved this hotel. Great location, lovely staff, clean, very relaxing. Would definitely recommend and would stay there again. 
20889 Great location, wonderful Waldorf service clean quiet rooms. Great ambience and history. Wifi a bit spotty in some of the rooms though, but minor. 
20890 A clean great value 4 star Hotel at bargain price. Close to subway entrance and great restaurants.. Rooms in back away from 81 st are much quieter. Rooms are large by NYC standards.Very good Cuban restaurant opened inside Hotel between our last visits. 
20891 Wine in the evening, coffee in the morning, spotless modern facilities and very efficient service. Cafe / deli next door is worth a look. 
20892 Very clean with friendly staff. No noise problems. TV was old, but I didn't go to Chicago with friends to watch TV. Some minor problems - like hairdryer pulled out from wall, but no big deal. Good price for a nice clean hotel. Bed was VERY comfy. Would go back. 
20893 Hotel was average. Rooms were clean but rather old. Could use an upgrade. Major issue was the airco, which was noisy. Rooms and lobby were very cold. The airco system was old and it was not possible to turn it off in the room. Disappointing for a Marriot hotel. 
20894 Elegant style and atmosphere that you don't see much anymore. Right in the heart of downtown Chicago, close to shopping, resturants, transportation, and activities. Staff was extremely helpful, especially the concierge. Can't wait to visit again. 
20895 Enjoyed staying at the W Chicago on West Adams Street. The rooms are modern and funky and include nice ameneties. The staff was wonderful; welcoming friendly and helpful. Concierges Eden and TK found us the perfect restaurants. They really made our stay fantastic. 
20896 Small and well located hotel, rooms are quite small for USA, the zone is very nice and just some steps from Grand central. 
20897 The staff is friendly, professional and extremely accommodating; the hotel is clean and the rooms are much more spacious than more well-known properties (Hilton, Hyatt, UN Plaza). I travel to NYC on a monthly basis and don't plan to stay anywhere else; The Belvedere is a jewel! 
20898 Wonderful hotel and modestly priced compared to other hotels in this location. Very convenient to Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue. Will stay here again in June. 
20899 Muy bien ubicado para todos los recorridos mas importantes de manhattan. Habitaciones comodas y bastante buenas. Servicio atento y rapido. Despistes en servicio de limpieza que no dejaban las toallas suficientes. Tienen que mejorar algo mantenimiento y control calidad (una habitacion apestaba a tabaco) 
20900 Was lucky to get room 1401 which is a superior room with city view and an access to a large balcony. Amazing hotel room, could not be better. All staff was very friendly and helpfull. Great location. Highly recommended 
20901 stayed one night. assigned a room next to electrical room (some noise). Kind of small even for a standard room... For some reasons, the staff is not very friendly (always in a hurry to get rid of you). Will not stay in this hotel again. 
20902 Good for a trip to Wrigley, easy 5-6 block walk, plenty of bars and good places to eat. The place is old, but everything in that area is older. El was not a bother at all. I would stay here again, if I was going to Wrigley. 
20903 This hotel has to be one of the finest in the world. It imposes itself onto fifth avenue, the rooms are magnificent and the service is excellent. However it is certanily not cheap, but you get what you pay for in life, and the Pierre is worth every penny! 
20904 If you are looking for a clean place with good location to downtown, than this is the place. You can tell that this is an old hotel but the rooms( and bathrooms) were very clean and well kept. The staff were very helpful with directions and such. 
20905 Everything pretty much just right about this hotel. Friendly staff, clean rooms with good facilities, and all at a reasonable price. Location is good too, with views of the river. 
20906 The location is outstanding. Good value expecially because of the kitchen. Quiet. Friendly and helpful staff. 
20907 Great location. We did the "American Girl" package. Our daughter loved getting a bed for her doll. We loved the view from our room of the city skyline. Clean and neat. Staff very friendly. 
20908 Good spot, very central and but this hotel is not as you would expect an hotel from the Hyatt company to be: it is a medium category, not a 5 stars luxury hotel (to which the name Hyatt is often associated). 
20909 My husband and I loved this hotel. It has it all, especially the great, helpful staff! 
20910 Nice hotel, good location, good service, spacious room. Nothing great, but definitely above New York average and good value for money 
20911 This is definatly a great hotel,perfect location right next to everything,would definatly recommend it to everyone....we were there for new years eve and the price for the location was great. 
20912 An old hotel, so do not expect what you would find at a 5 star.My wife stayed here 2 years ago and had no problems. This time around, it was like night and day, no consistencey.. Their staff desparaly needs better customer reations skills. 
20913 We stayed for a week at Herald Square Hotel. The room was very confortable altough not too much spacious for 3 people. But who cares when you are in New York? The staff was incredbly nice and friendly especially Monica. I highly recommend this hotel. 
20914 decent value for money and nice rooms, large beds which is a bit surprising to find in most NY hotels. Other than that..busy hotel...takes time to check in...do not expect them to pamper you but who gets pampered anyway in Ny hotels.. 
20915 Het hotel is zeer goed gelegen. Alleen de service was niet goed: bagage stallen kost geld, dit moet een service zijn en bellen/nakijken waar kwijtgeraaktebagage is wordt ook niet voor je gedaan. Bij het in- en uitchecken absoluut geen vriendelijkheid. 
20916 You pay for the name and location, that's it. Rooms are old, technologically challenged, and even smell bad. Not worth it. 
20917 I went to NYC for a few nights to visit some friends, and decided to stay at the Off Soho Suites. It was perfect and I appreciate that it was well located and still has some of the feel of the village in the old days. 
20918 Prima hotel bij de Chicago Waterway. Wel moeilijk te vinden omdat de hotelnaam niet duidelijk op het hotel staat. Navigatiesystemen werken in Chicago niet altijd goed - wellicht door de hoge gebouwen?! Kamers ietwat krap, maar wel keurig netjes en fijne bedden. Gratis gefilterd water te krijgen. 
20919 tres bel hotel avec un acceuil plus que parfait et quelle vue epoustouflante demander la suite au 32 ieme etage vous verrez a droite east river et en face de vous l empire state building ainsi que l onu je recommande fortement cet hotel 
20920 Stayed for one night while in the city -- and are so glad we did. The room had a wonderful view (thank you for the complementary upgrade to the 21st floor). The white with blue accents theme is so restful, comfortable bed, spotless contemporary room. Thoroughly enjoyed and recommend! 
20921 Excellent hoitel-next to Grand Central(or nearly}. Porters, front of house staff very friendly andhelpful re directions. Rooms very clean-plenty toilertries and hot water. Lounge bar original 1920`s as is the lobby with plenty of atmosphere. Would highly recommend. 
20922 We stayed here last October and we loved it. Stylish, classy and chic. Ideal location in Mid-town New York. We'd definitely stay here again. 
20923 Would recommend this hotel. Good value and clean, especially for a quick stay. The hotel is easy to find right off I-45 and safe. 
20924 Great location big room with good faciltities friendly staff and were helpful during our stay at the hotel. Highly recommended hotel in Beverly Hills. Stayed at the hotel for 7 nights and had no complaints 
20925 We loved this place! Modern, beautiful rooms and a pool you want to lounge by. Nice staff too. My only complaint: WiFi is $15 per day. Really? Go outside the door to any nearby hotspot instead. 
20926 Nice hotel - excellent location but very dark! I know it is meant to be trendy - but it was really hard to see in the room! Good bar and breakfast though. 
20927 2 puntjes van kritiek: de ontbijtzaal bleek bij herhaling vol met wachttijden als gevolg (maar ontbijten "op straat" in new york heeft ook z'n charme)en de liften zijn vaak vol zodat ook hier soms enkele minuten moet worden gewacht; verder prima hotel op perfecte locatie 
20928 Great access to train station, navy pier, millennium park, and magnificent mile. Good stay. Very large hotel - a few towers. Room was nice and clean. Not the largest, but certainly not too small. Cafe On first floor was nice for snacks. Check Facebook for deals. 
20929 I Stayed At Hotel St James in December. The first and only night I stayed there was no heat or hot water. I think the heat finally kicked in in the middle of the night but I will never stay there again. 
20930 Rooms are showing wear. Found hairs in the bed upon arrival- but was addressed by housekeeping immediately. Great location. Fun bar. Not for older people or those with vision probs- many dark corners. Clubby at night. 
20931 I loved the modern decor. Rooms were super clean & bed was low to the ground, but comfy. Only negative was I could hear the traffic & car horns from outside. 
20932 My family and I stayed for three nights and had a wonderful time. Rooms were small (as expected) but very clean and the staff was so nice 
20933 We would stay again in a heartbeat! 
20934 The Hudson Hotel has beautiful common spaces-the lobby, the bars and restaurants, even escalator. The rooms were beautiful too. What was not beautiful was our broken air conditioner that we complained about for 2 days before we insisted on moving rooms, and the outrageous waits for the elevators. 
20935 My husband and I stayed at the W for a weekend getaway. What a great decision! The staff was very attentive and helpful. Our room was very comfortable and had a beautiful view of Lake Michigan. We loved it! 
20936 Very good value for money, 1 min walk to grand station on subway. breakfast included and dont forget to ask for room above 7th floor for good views. 
20937 Very friendly polite staff who are very helpful. A real asset to the hotel. The rooms are basic and furnishings reflect this. Fine for a one night stay. 
20938 When we pulled up at the curb in front of the hotel we were greeted immediately by the bellman. He whisked our luggage into the hotel, the car was taken care of and we were instantly relaxing, enjyoing NYC. 
20939 Manhattan and scorching 100 degree heat is not the ideal combination, but the Gansevoort remained "cool' ....as always. The service, food, and ambience was right on target. I've stayed here many times....and have never been disappointed. 
20940 Our trip was just perfect! The suite had a super view and the location is exceptionnal. All staff members were courteous and professionals. Any of our questions or needs were anwered in a timely manner. We just loved it!! 
20941 Excellent hotel. Good location. Located on Fifth Avenue east of Manhattan 
20942 Bathroom was very small, but clean. No coffee-maker in room. Sleep Number bed was very comfortable and plenty of pillows provided. Reading lights on both sides of bed. Good location for walking and easy access to subway. 
20943 Good ratio between price (about 100 dollars per night in the christmas time) and service!!!! Room and bathroom tiny but clean. The service was good and the breakfast was adequate. The check in girl was asleep but nice!!!! 
20944 We stayed there for new year's eve. Towels were frayed, the concierge told me "look it up in the Internet", they didn't take trash out. 
20945 Hotel Mela is very well located, just a couple of blocks from Times Square, with easy access to the subway. The rooms are rather small but cozy, it has excellent service, friendly staff. and an unbeatable price. 
20946 What a surprise. The W across the street was booked solid, so I booked this CQ and found it a terrific value and what a view when I went down for dinner. Looking right into the World Trade Center Museum site. Will go back again and again 
20947 The rooms were very nice but very small. Complimentary coffee in the lobby each morning and wine at happy hour...however the lobby gets very very crowded during happy hour and you may not find a place to sit. Staff was friendly. 
20948 This is just a quick update so that you can see the photographs I took back in April, 2004. P.S. - if anybody needs more information send me an e-mail. 
20949 Very good view to Times Square from the restaurant 
20950 We stayed at Sanctuary for the second time. The hotel with an excellent location, rooms and service now has a cocktail lunge and restaurant with a view. It is a rather expensive hotel, but worth the price 
20951 I stay at the Intercontinental quite often, and they have never been anything other then compliant and respectful to my needs. I would recomend this hotel to anyone that is doing business in the NYC area. The guest relations desk is especially accomidating. 
20952 Very comfortable stay. The hotel has been refurbished recently - good size rooms , friendly staff and great access to shopping mall. Pool good size could be prettier ! Gym disappointingly small and parking not eay at weekends. A lot better than the Westin galleria hotel! 
20953 The front desk staff was exceptionally rude. They even forgot to make an ordered wake-up call! The room was OK. 
20954 Had a nice pleasant stay at this hotel last month. Both the room and the bathroom were spacious and clean. Good location and friendly staff. Would def recommend to a friend. 
20955 AVOID-damp smelly bed bug infested overpriced rooms with poor view. Hilton deny everything!! 
20956 You can walk to everything from here. Theaters, shopping, restaurants, Central Park and more. We had the free Continental breakfast - lots of choice and really good service. 
20957 Stayed with a friend. Room was small, but extremely comfortable. Great music in bar. Lobby area is a lot of fun. Loved the "resident" cat. 
20958 Front Desk (ask for Blossom or Rachael), Concierge and Housekeeping are superior. The Hotel is the best place to stay in NYC. 
20959 Old and simple, but good service and excellent location. 3min walking to central park, 1min to train station. We really liked it! 
20960 nice place to stay.wing stop 2 doors away.We stayed at other holiday inn and suites on main st.This holiday inn express one is twice as nice and was alot cheaper.We were there for MD Anderson app.Also had free shuttle to hospital. 
20961 I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I stayed there for a 2 day business trip. The staff is helpful. The rooms and clean and spacious. The fact that each room has a kitchen is amazing. The location is perfect because it's close to shopping and restaurants. 
20962 Best Western was very good in overall facilities, rooms were very new and employers were kind. Hotel is near to Michigan Street for shopping and entertainment. Only missing thing may be mentioned was breakfast, which should be richer. 
20963 Only complaint is trying to get into the parking lot- a bit tricky for a car that rides low(big dip) and right on the service road which is VERY busy!. Lovely room- best Iv been in for a long time. Thanks 
20964 On a precruise vacation I needed a hotel for one night at a reasonable cost. Marriott worked perfectly. It was easy access from the interstate and a short drive to Galveston Island to the cruise port. I highly recommend this hotel 
20965 Very comfortable beds. Excellent heating/air-conditioning. Good TV screen. Very good cafe for breakfast. Not all the front desk staff capable of giving good directions to other places. 
20966 Stayed here in December, very central, rooms clean and staff helped when needed. Breakfast was good lots of choice. 
20967 Of my four 5-day trips to New York (staying in a different hotel each time), this hotel was the best by far. Friendly, available & helpful staff, free breakfast, coffee available 24/7, clean spacious rooms, & convenient to subway. I'd definitely make a return trip to this hotel. 
20968 i found this hotel offered one of the best values in new york.i had a great view of the east river.the neighborhood had many fine restaurents and a parking garage at a relatively inexpensive price. the staff was very helpfull and professional.all and all a great experience. 
20969 Lived there 22nd to 28th of dec-07. Good standard on our two rooms. Nice staff. Excellent location. Two minutes walk to subway. Deli within reasonable walkingdistance. We had a very nice stay would definitly stay her again 
20970 The location from the Medical area is very close. The lobby and restaurant were ok. The hotel itself is just average. However, the employees were friendly and very attentive. They made the experience feel like a first class stay. 
20971 I knew I booked a suite with a balcony but much to my surprise there were 2! Kudo's to Alena and my lovely housekeeper Miro(Hope that's the correct spelling) Thanks also for the hand written note and gift I recieved the night I arrived. I will be back!!! 
20972 Very clean, confortable, well priced, and you can walk to a lot of great spots from there! Will definitly stay there again! Well worth it. 
20973 Very clean, no bed bugs, and a very helpful staff!! 
20974 A due passi dall'Empire State Building, ha camere spaziose e molto accoglienti. Tanti servizi e personale che parla italiano. A piedi si raggiungono le principali mete del turismo newyorkese. Molto gradevole 
20975 Have just returned from 5 days at the Southgate towers .The hotel was excellent,and a great location opposite madison square gardens. The staff were excellent and nothing was to much trouble,have no hesitation in staying there again 
20976 Very nice hotel right on Time Square. Decent price by NYC city standards. They also a current deal where you can use their Acura to make a trip within a limited area of Manhattan for free. 
20977 posizione e servizio ottimi 
20978 Great location and great hotel. 24-7 workout room has amazing views of the lower West Side. Not to be missed. 
20979 I decided this would be a good hotel for 2 friends visiting NYC based on the TripAdvisor reviews - and wasn't disappointed! Fantastic location, professional, courteous staff, and all-around a good stay. I tend to stay away from non "chain" hotels but Hotel Chandler was an outstanding choice. 
20980 We stayed at this Embassy Suites on September 17th, 2012. The location was good and it was resonably priced. Our room was clean and the staff was courteous and helpful. Cocktails were good and breakfast was plentiful. Only complaint was the sky-lobby furniture seemed kind of dirty. 
20981 A wonderful hotel which actually has tours! If you stay there the entire experience is First class - excellent ;) ps the shampoo is heavenly! 
20982 Wir waren mit dem Hotel zufrieden. Die Lage ist perfekt, weil man von dort leicht zu allen Sehenswuerdigkeiten kommt. Service war ok wenn auch ein wenig arrogant. Die Zimmer haben eine gute Groesse und sind sauber.Preisleistung ist ok. 
20983 Brand new studio apartment with great size rooms, small kitchen, 5min walk to time square, helpful & friendly staff, great for a short or long stay. Really reasonably priced for a property so new & central. We are returning in August & we can't wait! 
20984 I stayed here at the end of November for 2 nights and it was lovely. The rooms, the staff, everything is great. I have stayed at 2 other hotels on this street, but not anymore! Thank you. 
20985 The price was right at this conveniently located midtown hotel. The staff was helpful and sweet,the rooms are small but beautifully equipped and extremely clean. Very comfortable bed with lovely linens, marble bathroom and shower and right in the heart of midtown, but quiet ! 
20986 Had a chance to stay at this hotel recently. The location is fantastic. And the service was great. The staff was very helpful. Rooms were clean. Will definitly stay there again. 
20987 its fine, good for a couple of nights.not really near anything, but bed is comfortable its good for a single or couple but too small for a family.they hold your bags for you which is great when your at a convention.Parking is 25.00.checkout noon is also nice. 
20988 Ben zeer regelmatig in NY. Dit hotel is ontzettend aangenaam en ben erg goed geholpen. Er zullen altijd betere hotels zijn, maar je zult het hier goed naar je zin hebben. Schone en relatief grote kamer, flatscreen tv en voor toeristen een top locatie. Veel plezier. 
20989 Modernes Hotel, kleine aber schoene Zimmer, saubere und schoene Dusche, gutes Bett mit guter Bettwaesche, zentral gelegen, nettes Personal, kleine Bar im Erdgeschoss, alles rund um den Times Square zu Fuss erreichbar. 
20990 This hotel is clean, nice, and free of bed bugs. I recommend it. 
20991 Fantastic customer service, spacious rooms, great complimentary breakfast, free airport shuttle, nearby restaurants, and much more. I chose this hotel based on the positive reviews, and it surpassed my expectations. 
20992 Great location, clean. Freindly staff. Would stay there again. 
20993 Raffaello Chicago is a mall hotel located one block from the la ke and two blocks from michigan Avenue. Clean and beautiful rooms. 
20994 The staff at the Muse are outstanding! They answer any questions and no request is small or too large. Beds are wonderfully comfortable and the room was spacious. This was my second stay at a Kimpton, and their service level is beyond compare!! Can't wait to stay again!! 
20995 We stayed here with our 2 teenage boys 2 weeks ago..amazing hotel.Well worth it, as you couldnt get a better position.Right in Times Square, yet no noise heard whithin your room.Spotlessly clean,Well run and absolutely buzzing!Our boys loved the slightly scary lifts too! 
20996 Fabulous place; very friendly doormen. Amazing cabin rooms with all the mod cons. The free 'continental breakfast' merely consisted of a muffin and tea but its better than nothing. 
20997 Simply a fantastic stay! Upgraded to a suite as it was a special occasion with champagne and strawberries! Staff could not be more helpful, everything was just so easy. The bar area is stunning - will be back! 
20998 I am so happy to have found a hotel in NYC which is a pleasure to stay in with a good location and affordable price. I plan to use this as my primary choice when I am in NYC. 
20999 What can you say? A great Hotel, Great Staff very attentive to your needs. Once the remodelling is done is will be the hotel to stay in. I travel to NYC every month and stay there eveytime and have never had a bad experience. 
21000 Loved this La Qunita Inn. For me, the location, room and breakfast, were all great! Location is right off Beltway, so I took care of the traffic noise by setting the thermostat fan to constantly run, and we slept fine. 
21001 Very close to everything. They offer a complimentary shuttle to the Galleria which was an added benfit. Rooms were nice service was great. I'll be back! 
21002 Paguei as diarias antecipadamente. Para surpresa minha quando cheguei ao hotel, cobraram-me de novo no meu cartao de credito. Solicitaram o estorno, mas mesmo apos chegar o Brasil, cobram em meu cartao pela terceira vez. 
21003 I stayed at the London several times in 2010. The staff are great, and the rooms lovely, with a sitting area and bedroom behind siding doors. Dinner in the restaurant is good - though tables are very close together. Good martinis.... 
21004 Best Hotel in NYC for Business or Personal Trip. Beautiful hotel, very clean, & trendy. Location is GREAT, in the heart of NYC. Anthony (Front Desk Manager) was very helpful during my last stay -- he was beyond helpful and nice!!! 
21005 For such a high priced hotel their cancellation policy borders on combative. I suggest to find a more friendly and customer oriented hotel. When I plan to stay in Chicago again this hotel will get no consideration. 
21006 Hotel staff is very nice. Hotel hallways were quiet and the room was very comfortable. Great water pressure in the shower, fluffy towels, nice heavy sheets. The windows are very well insulated so the street noise is not disturbing The hotel is within walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, etc. 
21007 best place I have stayed in New York. Great service. Definitely can recommend. 
21008 Perfect location.Being opposite Rockefeller centre and near NBC studios great especially during the elections. Very friendly and helpful staff. Rooms very small but manageable 
21009 Free bottled water was a nice touch and free wifi much appreciated. Would definitely stay again. 
21010 Stayed in the Sofitel for our Honeymoon - could not ask for a better hotel. Everything was just perfect. Service was excellent -friendly courteous and helpful (restaurant addresses) the hotel was an oasis of calm and chic. One of the best hotels we stayed in. 
21011 The hotel is new and clean but overpriced. For NYC the size of the room is OK. The advantage of the hotel is its location - 5 min walk to Penn station and 10 min to Empire State. I do not like Chelsea disrict so consider other options 
21012 The Hotel is Average with Nice courteous Staff.The pool was nice and clean however we didnt visited it 
21013 In less money u can enjoy complimentart breakfats and gym 
21014 In my view is a good hotel 
21015 Great hotel! The staff was very helpful and our room was comfortable for 3 adults. Good location. We will stay here next time we're in New York. 
21016 Delightful service, well equipped room, charming staff. Fab Ning Bar. Expensive but worth every penny for my husband's Christmas present! 
21017 Legendary hotel on classic spot. You will get more luxury a next door, but this is excellent value despite very slow service. 
21018 ottima posizione, metro, negozi, ristoranti e importanti siti sottomano. davvero uno sballo! sono capitata nell'unico piano che hanno ristrutturato...quindi sebbene l'hotel sia datato...si stanno organizzando per rinnovarlo. 
21019 Good location and relatively clean rooms but the corridors smell. Non-professional front desk staff. 
21020 The hotel and staff are top notch. I had a junior suite with a view of an alley. If you just want a place to crash out, this is fine. But if you want a terrific city view you may want to look elsewhere. 
21021 Great boutique hotel in NYC!! Fantastic stay at Andaz, loved the free water, snacks, location, beds etc. We ate at the restaurant 3 times during our stay and it was wonderful!! Small note..dont use the laundry service...$8 per item (each sock..not a pair..each item!!!) $500 later!!! lesson learnt. 
21022 staying with 2 adults and one 4-year old this hotel really provides all you need for a good price. Located near the magnificent mile, 5 walking minutes from the Wrigley building, across from Dominique's. 
21023 Close to everything in mid-town, so big that you can get OK deals, close to central park. Expect to pay for everything extra (wifi, fitness, breakfast, luggage storage) but then also that everything is available. 
21024 If you want to be near Times Square then this is the place. rooms were good size and clean and comfortable. Staff were all extremely helpful and friendly 
21025 This is a great hotel at a great price. It is very quiet, clean and comfortable place to stay on your next visit to NYC without paying a fortune. Beds are very comfortable. A definite must stay. Will definitely go back. 
21026 Had a great stay at the Hilton Suites. Wonderful large rooms. Had breakfast and dinner at the resturant which was excellent. The pool also looked nice, was filled with kids and families. 
21027 We booked our room through priceline (80.00). The room was clean, but very tiny. After leaving behind an electronic device, Hotel Felix really shined when the housekeeper turned my item in. I received my item the next morning via FedEx. Big ups to the service and housekeeping staff! 
21028 This hotel is really great at catering to their cusomters. They go over and beyond to make you fee like you never left home. With passionate employees like Laurelin and TK, I feel like I am the only guest in the hotel! Thanks! 
21029 Visited in September 2012 with the family. First time in Chicago, and was looking to stay downtown without spending an arm and a leg. Pretty basic hotel with basic rooms, but at this price, no complaints. Make sure to check out the rooftop terrace! 
21030 I've stayed at Hotel 17 several times, but this time, fleas ate me for dinner. I have bites all over my neck and arms. Maybe they're in the pillows. I hope they can fix the problem. Some of the rooms look OK, others are bad news. Choose carefully 
21031 This is a great hotel. Friendly staff and excellent service. Excellent location, very short walk from Times Square. Complimentary breakfast and wine went down a treat! HD TV in the room with a good selection of channels to watch. Very clean hotel - perfect location. 
21032 On the website it said that the hotel is within walking distance from most of the major attraction. That was pretty far from the truth. The only thing it was withing walking distance was the mccormick center and a bus stop. 
21033 A quick cab ride to the Javits makes it very convienent. Rooms nee a little TLC. Lots of great food on the block. Gym is available to hotel guests. Breakfast voucher for continental only was a little disappointing. 
21034 I stayed room that faces central park and that was great. Amenities and design of the rooms are classy and functional. 
21035 Great location and friendly staff. Enjoyed a great a weekend getaway....did not feel like you are in a "crazy" downtown hotel. 
21036 The hotel has a charm and elegance worth the price. The location is convenient to almost everything around central park. The bar invites intimates converasations in a lux environment. A great experience! 
21037 Stayed here 2 nights. Great location, easy subway access. Nice little street. Staff was very helpful & friendly. Rooms were clean. All the necessary amenities. Staff went out of their way to help you. Price is right! Will definitely be staying there again! 
21038 Clean trendy relaxing rooms. I enjoyed my stay, staff was very cool professional and friendly. No complaints here! 
21039 What can i say? Beautiful, hotel, fabulous people, and extremly helpful staff. Dream holiday!! Cant wait to go back. 
21040 Great location, friendly staff, but awful rooms. Bed was awful, plaster falling off walls, dreary rooms, smelt awful. One gets what they pay for. Over priced for quality of room. Only decent thing is the great location. TV was awful, dull hallways, bad experience. Will never stay again. 
21041 This is a very clean Hotel and the service was wonderful! Breakfast was very good. The staff was very nice and helpful. Location very good close to alot of places. I plan to stay here any time I'm in Houston. I won't go any where else but this Hotel. 
21042 Wonderful location,huge rooms.Staff very good,efficient and friendly. Rooms a little tired, but they are renovation. Location cannot be beat. 
21043 This was one of the best stays I had at a LaQuinta Inn. Will stay here again!! I enjoyed the breakfast and pool area, 
21044 The service at the hotel is null and huge disappointment compared to Jumeirah legacy and services in Dubai (Emirates Towers) and London (Carlton Tower). the service lacked efficiency and detail-orientation. Too bad for Jumeirah... 
21045 Great location, price, rooms and free breakfast & internet. Great spot- close to within walking distance of many points of interest. 
21046 Pro: Fantastic clean room with view over hudson/downtown manhattan. Comfortable beda. Bike rental was perfect (excellent bikes, 10$ a day). TV on room was high quality. Con: Free Internet wifi is very slow and some bedbugs identified. 
21047 Hotel con muy bien ubicado, a la mano de todo, especialmente para primera visita. La atencion excelente, la habitacion no huele a nada, limpieza total. Sin dudas vuelvo al Hilton en mi proxima visita a NY. 
21048 New Yorks best located Hotel! Staff is wonderfull! Breakfast is the best I ever had in New York, and the breakfast hostess makes it even better, she runs the breakfast like clockwork! The rooms and the beds.. wow 
21049 All my love to this hotell! I'll be back! 
21050 We enjoyed our stay at this Best Western. It was a typical 3 star inner city hotel, dated but clean. Excellent location for tourists, and felt safe. What made the hotel special was the staff, very helpful and would try to do whatever they could for you. 
21051 I was on business but quickly recognized that this hotel is the place to stay in NYC for any reason. Great service on the Club Level and in the lobby. Highly recommend. 
21052 Went to NYC with two teenagers to see Broadway shows. The Yotel was in a convenient location and the kids loved the room. The room was small, but very clean and modern. Can't wait to return! 
21053 Great central location, near to everything! Nice room, decent bathroom and a very professional staff. Very clean room and bath, nice amenities. Steps from Port Authority Terminal, subway, theatres and a lot of atractions and restaurantes. 
21054 Nice folks, large rooms, good location, very comfortable. Ditto on the coffee pots! but that is a minor point. There is a great grocery store and good wine shop across the street. Lots of fun restaurants in the area. Would stay there again. 
21055 My husband and I never stayed in NYC. The Yotel was great. Great food, Great workers that know the hotel, and the sevices all around was great. The location was 2 blocks from Time Square. We can't wait to go again in the Spring. 
21056 Stayed here for a last minute trip to NYC. Rooms were great and well serviced and the rates were very reasonable. Walking distance to loads of bars and restaurants but it was quiet around the hotel. Highly recommend staying here 
21057 i was really impressed with this hotel.......it was clean, spacious by new york standards, and the staff was wonderful. the best part was the location though. we were in walking distance to so many things! 
21058 At checked in and I asked for a room on a higher floor, was given the 44th. The room had a beautiful Hudson River view, was large, clean with a very nice bathroom.Westin has the most comfortable beds, that I have one in my home in NY and Florida. 
21059 Invitato nella scelta di questo hotel dalle recensioni degli altri utenti confermo tutto 5 minuti e sei al centro della grande mela metro a 200 metri unico piccolo neo bisogna azzecare l'ora della colazione xche affolata ma sempre ben rifornita si merita sicuramente il ritorno 
21060 When we go to NY we stay at this Hotel the room is always very nice and the Hotel has a great location. The food is good but the Quality Meats Restaurant is just a round the corner and Central Park across the street 
21061 One of the most relaxing and enjoyable settings we've experienced. 
21062 My husband and I just returned from a 4 night stay at The Barclay hotel.Where do I start? The main plus is the location it could not be much easier.We had some drinks at the bar best mojito I've ever had.Jose the bartender is awesome 
21063 I came here for work. The staff was very good, and the room very clean. Great location, very close to everything. 
21064 Inn At The Ballpark was charming, cozy, and classy. Decor is similar to a man's den: dark green, beige, and maroon, but it feels warm and inviting. Staff was helpful, breakfast buffet good, and the bar was relaxing. Great location!!! 
21065 Hotel is well located - air conditioner made a lot of noise and the ice make outside the room also contributed to the volume - almost impossible to sleep without ear plugs - made the nice looking room less attractive. 
21066 O hotel tem otima localizavao, preco razoavel porem necessita maior controle de qualidade no atendimento dos clientes principalmente na concierge e na recepcao de entrada. Fiz alguns pedidos e avisos que nao foram anotados e executados. 
21067 Good hotel just near Natural history museum. Clean and silent. 
21068 Located in the hub of Times Square the absolute best location! Our room was totally quiet with no street noise. Comfortable and roomy accomodations and the staff was so great! The cookies are the bomb! Not one negative to comment on. Thanks for a great stay. 
21069 We stayed at the Westin Galleria two weeks ago and it was wonderful. The rooms were clean and very big and the staff were extrememly friendly. The hotel has been renovated in the past few months and had a very modern decor. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
21070 Great location, great value and wonderful customer service! The hotel could use some updating, but as a frequent traveler to NYC, the amenities and location are great. Need help? Ask anyone and they are more than willing to help you - at their hotel or another location 
21071 Travelodge downtown Chicago was very accomodating, the front desk was great with directions and any of our many questions. There were two restraunts, both were good to eat at and the Chicago carryout was pretty reasonably priced as well. 
21072 wir hatten ein Zimmer mit Etagenbett, sehr klein, aber ausreichend, da man in New York sowieso die wenigste Zeit im Zimmer verbringt. Bad auf dem Flur war immer verfuegbar! Zimmerluft manchamal etwas muffig 
21073 No frills property good for a "cheap" night in NYC. Bathroom had a mildew smells, but other than that, it was a comfy bed in a very small room. Helpful staff. 
21074 Location is the only reason to stay here. Outdated rooms and lobby and the service is poor. They need to understand what hospitality is. Nobody cares in this place. 
21075 The location was excellent however, I found the staff to be unhelpful and unfriendly. The water pressure in the shower was so low....the entire wknd. Also, I had to pay 40 US for 36 hrs of parking! 
21076 The hotel was excellent for our family vacation in July 2010. Hotel was very neat and organized and was able to accomadate our required standards of a 4 star hotel. 
21077 I regularly stay at Park Central. The hotel is extremely comfortable, the staff is very accomodating and I would highly recommend it to others. It is centrally located and convenient for all locations. 
21078 Old fashoined hotel, clean but very old, perfectly situated for all the sights of New York, from our room we could see the Empire State , and easily walked to see all we wanted 
21079 Small but compact bathroom, but the shower was fantastic !!.Would stay again 
21080 La stanza (dormitorio con altre 3 persone) era un po' piccola e poco funzionale: armadi piccoli e manca lo spazio per posizionare le valigie, ma sbirciando le altre stanze non mi sembrano niente male! Lo consiglio soprattutto per la sua posizione. 
21081 attentive staff, comfortable room, great location.... we walked everywhere. Our room looked over a brick wall, so it remained dark even in daylight. Classic old hotel - very charming atmosphere. a mini fridge would be nice! 
21082 I found this hotel meeting all my requirements,big beds,five mins from times square, clean and tidy.even a flat screen tv.lovely bathroom shower etc.for the money it was faultless. 
21083 ciompared to many older embassy suites, this is a top notch hotel. Staff is very friendly, rooms quite impressive, and the breakfast is probably the best i have experienced at an embassy suite. 
21084 Just stayed here with my Wife and 2 dogs. We spent 3 nights and were treated well the whole time. Nice restaurant. Nice room. Nice staff. Great Location. My wife enjoyed the spa. 
21085 I stayed last november in my wedding anniversary and the attention was very special. the location is perfect is near of all interest points and is far from the crowd. The bedroom was beautiful. The guys and the front desk were very helpful. 
21086 Thursday-Sunday stay was fantastic. Great location for walking to major sites of interest, Excellent front desk and hotel staff ,Room was clean, comfortable and great view. Ryan Shafi is prime example of customer sevice of the highest quality.I will stay again on my next visit 
21087 I had a great experience at this hotel! There were beautiful granite countertops in the bathroom and beatiful furniture in the bedroom. The bed linens were extra comfy. The front desk was also really nice and understanding. I had a great time! 
21088 The club lounge is really nice, but what what makes it great is Alisha. She makes it fun and comfortable when u are on the road 
21089 This is a hotel great for location. However, i dont think the price is justifiable. The room is perpetually cold as the heater is not strong. Breakfast sucks so I dont even bother to eat in the hotel 
21090 Hotel is clean though. 
21091 Stayed here for a business meeting - it is a typical Hilton property and just what you would expect. They cheaped out on the free water - very small bottles - but the gym is excellent. 
21092 Do not buy a limited time (one year trial membership) in their timeshare program. When a family illness keep me from using all 7 days they refused to reinstate the remaining time or offer any compensation. Staff is cold and uncaring. 
21093 HOTEL SITUATO IN OTTIMA POSIZIONE, PIUTTOSTO PICCOLO RISPETTO AGLI STANDARD AMERICANI QUINDI COMODO PER LA VELOCITA' DI CHEK-IN CHEK-OUT, MOLTO PULITO E SERVIZIO ACCURATO, PERSONALE GENTILE E DISPONIBILE. 
21094 beautiful hotel very well located for visiting manhattan. everything was perfect. no bad point at all. I definitely recommend it. staff friendly and beautiful room and very clean. grocery opened 24/24 few steps away from the hotel. 
21095 Price is reasonable. Location is good. Walk few blocks, you get to the main shopping area and Central Park. So you can save some subway and Taxi fee there. Room is fairly clean. Will consider go back if I visit NYC again. 
21096 This hotel was in a great location, just a few blocks from everything. The beds were soooooooooo comfortable. The made to order omlets for breakfast were a huge hit with my teenage boys! 
21097 Gave our room away first night of reservation and billed us for it. Switched rooms from reservation. Dirty. So small you could not have your suitcase open if you wanted to walk around. Noisy. 
21098 Returned here in January and received excellent service from front desk. Thanks for responding to concerns. Always excellent location and breakfast server Sonia. 
21099 Had a great weekend at the Edison. Girls weekend. Hotel is in a great location, clean rooms, very friendly service. Val at the front desk was especially helpful in getting us two rooms next to each other. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
21100 Great location to 5th avenue, Lexington, Madison, Grand Central. Simple, no frills, nice decor and very cosy. Rooms aren't huge but it is Manhattan. Staff very friendly. 
21101 ein sehr schones butik hotel mit ausgezeichneter lage,freunliches personal,zimmer klein aber feines design. gute und sexy atmosfere im hotel.sauberkeit und schlechte izolation der zimmer konnten besser sein,tipisch amerikanisch. 
21102 Room smelled of smoke every day even though we had supposedly booked an non-smoking. Also asked for a fork but it never came. 
21103 Hotel molto bello, pulito e comodissimo per visitare Chicago. Unico difetto, l'aria condizionata estremamente bassa, da dover stare col maglione in camera in pieno agosto con 30 gradi fuori! Mediamente silenzioso di notte. Stanza molto ampia, letto king size molto spazioso. Niente frigobar, pochi prodotti da bagno forniti dall'albergo. 
21104 sebastion was awesome, along with the rest of the staff! great deal for the money. hot breakfast, clean rooms, walking distance to everything. we will return. 
21105 The staff were very helpful & friendly. the room was a twin bedded on e. Very clean, clean bedlinen..basic but clean!! only problem was somebody having an argument at 2am in morning.....otherwise o.k. Bathroom was 2 doors down and spotless!! Only stayed one night but was v. good value. 
21106 I stayed here for one night. This hotel was excellent value for money, the room was very comfortable and luxurious and the location very convenient to Penn Station. The Foyer is attractive, and the staff were extremely polite and helpful. I would definitely stay again. 
21107 This hotel is really conveniently located, great food, especially breakfast buffet! Great service. Very efficient employees, always attentive and helpful 
21108 Hotel is clean and new, everything you need in the room from a great bed, great desk chair, etc. I've stayed twice and will stay again. The hotel management and staff are incredibly helpful and a pleasure to deal with, folks appear to be happy coming to work. 
21109 WOW!!!! I am very impressed on the customer service!!!! Unbelievable...the employees/staff LOVE their job and was sincerely amazingly courteous/willing to assist us!!! Room was clean...still can't believe how they truly care!!! You don't find that in too many places 
21110 Had great service this week for a one night stay in Chicago. Great location and very nice lobby and lobby bar. 
21111 hotel staff always willing to assist.elizabeth was wonderful in attending to me at reception.location is perfect for anything in manhattan. this has been my 3rd stay in the hotel, and i shall certainly come back whenever i am in new york.....mansur ahmadu 
21112 We booked a family room, 2 huge bedrooms massive lounge 2 bathrooms beds were so comfy staff very friendly helpful & knowledgeable, yes it is slightly dated but ever so clean, can't recommend it enough, super location - we loved our stay 
21113 Beautiful place, Great Service, friendly staff! Elevator issues that others complained about must have been fixed. We had no trouble getting up and down from 14 
21114 en 5 palabras im- pre-sio-nan-te servicio, limpieza, atencion. ni una pega y mira que nosotros somos raros. 
21115 albergo spettacolare, dietro il central park, david letterman show e broadway. metro sotto l'albergo, times square a 3 minuti a piedi, staff ottimo, camere pulitissime, tutto fantastico!!! connessione internet economica, pieno di locali per la colazione nelle vicinanze, davvero una vacanza fantastica e l'albergo ha fatto la sua parte!! 
21116 great hotel, excellent surprisingly inexpensive burgers right in, off of hotel lobby. great rooftop pool and views but bring your own raxor a shaving kit is $10--!! 
21117 You haven't stayed at a 5 star...until you've stayed at a 5 star and 5 diamond hotel such as this one. The location is beautiful, the service and the property are beyond expectations. The gym and pool area are a true delight. The restaurants are exquisite. 
21118 Great hotel in heart of Manhattan. The rooms are cozy and modern and the hotel bar is wonderful. V. close to Grand Central. 
21119 Vacanza meravigliosa ed albergo comodo e... very cheap! L'unica pecca le stanze sono piccole ma la cortesia e la pulizia sono impeccabili. Situato nell'East Village a pochi passi da Soho e da Washington Square, alle porte del Greenwich Village. Nelle vicinanze 2 linee della metro e Starbucks per la colazione. 
21120 Nice clean hotel. Great crew. Ideal sleeping concept. Good location. (near the bus/train/metrostation and Times square) The bed is indeed a bit hard but for a week it's OK. 
21121 Great location, helpful staff would stay again and would recommend to friends. The living room was a fantastic place to meet for coffee and start our day. 
21122 + Location, 2 blocks from the Empire State building. + Nearby subway station. + Extremely helpful and friendly staff. + Large mini-suite. + Amazing view from our 37th floor room (see attached picture) + Comfortable bedding. - Noisy air-conditionning system +/- Outdated furniture 
21123 Great location for the price, handy to subway up and downtown, and walkable to many things, especially shopping. great restaurants near by on 2nd ave, Rooms are quite small but clean and new. Bathrooms very clean and new. 
21124 This hotel was very clean, great services and has a great location. It is surrounding by great restaurants and it is not to far from tines square. 
21125 Excellent business hotel in midtown Manhattan. Very well maintained. Reasonably priced by NYC standards. I previously stayed at the Peninsula but stopped when average room prices topped $1000 with taxes. The Omni Berkshire is slightly less luxurious (no flatscreen in the bathroom) but only slightly----and for much less. 
21126 Although a bit pricey, this hotel is worth it. Great location, efficient service, EXCELLENT beds, really clean. Although they don't have flat screen TVs and the carpet is starting to look a little faded, definitely consider staying here. The little kitchens are also very handy! 
21127 This hotel was very nice and quite close to everything. The rooms were spacious and the beds very comfortable. We would certainly return the next time we are in NYC. Bathroom was also large and clean. 
21128 Usual Holiday inn Express: small rooms, breakfast, wifi. Pros: central location, bonus for platinum members of Priorityclub in a form of 2500 points per stay, good prices. No obious cons. The room is not large, no upgrade is available, etc. I would definetely come there back again. 
21129 Great location, great room, comfy beds, clean spacious bathroom, fantastic view of Times Square, hairdryer, iron & board provided, clean towels daily ................... you wont be disappointed with this hotel if you want to be where the action is ! Have already recommended to friends and would definatley return 
21130 The frontdesk, concierge, and all the staff went out of their way to accommodate my wife and I. The location pretty much puts you in the heart of NYC. Very convenient to practically everything a visitor wants to do. 
21131 The primary reason I use this for business travel is the comfort of the rooms, great location and the fitness center. Sam provides the best fitness center service in all my travels...includes over 100 hotels. 
21132 Was there for conference. Outside of hotel fools you as the inside is very nice. Wonderful staff, well appointed room that is very quiet despite being right next to freeway. Bathroom was clean but needed updating. Workout room is small but met my needs. Good accommodation for the price. 
21133 We enjoyed our stay at the marriot Our room was large and clean The hotel was very nice for a marriot hotel and certainly a good value The location was terrific 
21134 This is a very accommodating hotel. Employees, Dan, Ana, Raquel, Maria make this a pleasurable experience. 
21135 Stayed with my adult daughter for 10 nights. The service was excellent, 24 hours very friendly and helplful. Central located, very good for the low price! Rooms are small but:...its Manhattan! I can recommend staying at 31 st Hotel. 
21136 Friendly staff, great location to times square, very expensive room rates, not worth the premium over comparable hotels. 
21137 If you are going to NYC for fun and you want to be at the heart of Manhattan in a cool hip place....this offers it all. Excellent Bluefin restaurant and hip bar in the 7th floor lobby....and GREAT location. We will stay there again for sure. 
21138 The rooms which have been newly renovated are very comfortable and clean. Staff is friendly and the hotel is situated in a very comfortable and safe area with access to restaurants. Easy walk to Times Square. 
21139 Our stay was fantastic! The attention to detail, courteous, timely, flawless, professional service from the moment our car arrived at the entrance until we actually pulled away from the curb! Our suite was magnificent! The epitome of comfort and service! Unmatched in any venue! 
21140 First time staying in NYC so I can't compare to other hotels, but I will say this one met our expectations. Great location, classic building, attentive staff, adequate size room. Solid stay all around. 199 on hotwire so I can't honestly say I would pay the hotel website rate. 
21141 would not return to this hotel ever again. The housekeeping did not leave enough towels, soaps and left dirty glasses behind. poor service. restaurants fair if best. 
21142 L'hotel si trova a 5 minuti a piedi dalla prima stazione di metro.attraversi la strada e sei dentro central park!stanze piccole e non pulitissime.alla reception non sono un granche'cortesi e disponibili.L'unica e vera nota positiva e'che e' molto economico!!!Lo potrei consigliare solo perche'e'economico!!! 
21143 No tengo ninguna queja de este hotel. Lo recomendaria a cualquiera 
21144 We stayed here for four nights with two parents and two teenagers. We stayed in a nice, spacious three bedded room. Very nice hotel for the price. 
21145 Good location, but hotel is dark and poky and not worth the money. Air conditioning in rooms too loud and becomes very annoying. More like a glorified youth hostel. 
21146 It is not sufficient to offer big rooms if these are not renovated and lacks minibar and other amenities. It is than awkward that in 2011 smokers rooms still exist. 
21147 I was very disappointed when I saw the room was beyond tiny but as time went on I realized that the location was brilliant! 
21148 I can not emphasize enough how helpful and friendly the staff is at this hotel. Central location and absolutely magnificent! 
21149 the best beds i have ever sleept in at a hotel. best location. 
21150 We had booked hotel in Feb 2010 for a 10 day stay in December 2010. Room presented as per photos and my main request was met...view of Empire State Building! Reception staff were polite and helpful...we were more than happy with The Bedford....would recommend. 
21151 excellent location; excellent value (included free hot breakfast, free internet) 
21152 BOM: Hotel mto bem localizado, andei a maior parte do tempo e nao precisei ficar pegando taxi ou metro td hr, apenas para ir aos extremos da ilha. Consegui otimo preco com a Hoteis.com. RUIM: Quarto mto pequeno para 4, o ideal sao 2 pessoas por quarto. 
21153 New hotel,exellent location,very friendly,very comfortable room.We had a superb time in New York thank for staying in that hotel.we were helped a lot by the concierge to book us few superb restaurants 
21154 We had a great experience at the Hilton Times Square. I was celebrating my 40th birthday with four of my friends. The staff was very accommodating, especially Bradhy Guerrero. Great location and rooms. 
21155 My daughter and I had a great few days staying at The Casablanca. The hotel is small but personal and the staff couldn't have been more helpful or courteous. I would certainly stay here again particularly as the location is so close to Times Square and therefore very central. 
21156 All of the staff was super friendly and the hotel was very clean and the breakfast was great and very plentiful. Fruit, muffins, fresh waffles, eggs, bacon etc. The custodial staff greeted everyone as they walked by. Exceptional service. Great beds and pillow and stylish room. Will stay again. 
21157 We absolutely loved the location, very near transit and close to the galleries. The rooms were small but immaculately clean. I felt like it was a bargain for the location. 
21158 Found a great price through QUIKBOOK for two nights in this "Center of it all" area on west 44th street. Quiet room with large marble bathroom. Excellent restaurant next door 
21159 at the room in the Edison. I was very apprehensive after reading the negative comments but I couldn't fault our room. It was clean and spacious and perfect for our requirements. 
21160 I stayed at tshis hotel for three nights. The rooms are very well maintained, ony the shared areas (bathrooms) were sometimes a bit dirty (probably mostly due to the other users). Staff was OK. Location is just perfect on the lower east side of manhattan. 
21161 If you are seeking a clean, quiet hotel with a wonderful Central Park West location (walking distance to subway), this hotel is for you! True, no freebie coffee maker, but hotel does have breakfast room on premises (though rather expensive). A place to visit and return again...I will! 
21162 stayed here for three nights in july and found the hotel to be excellent. very close to macys and very central for all sightseeing .the rooms were small but very clean and the staff were very helpfull. would stay here again if ever im in new york again 
21163 We were there to attend wife's company Christmas party. Excellent setup for pary, very good food, service was top notch. In regards to our stay at hotel, it is a very nice hotel in a very convenient location downtown. Would recommend to anyone 
21164 Completely agree with all POSITIVE reviews. Hotel is exactly as everyone says....location, amenities, spacious, clean, etc....all very good! I would like to comment on the staff. Front desk, bellmen, housekeeping, concierge are all wonderful! So helpful and friendly with such positive attitudes. Would definitely stay here again. 
21165 The hotel was really nice. We got a great deal on Priceline, too. $107 in the middle of Manhattan! Within walking distance of the Theatre District and Times Square. Very clean and the people were very nice,too. Most hotels in NYC have very small rooms. Not this one. Excellent experience. 
21166 Great hotel! Everything was clean, new, comfortable and working. Check-in was painless! About a 10 minute walk from Times Square! Will definitely return in the future. 
21167 Very nice location.. More BANG for your $$$ and the management and front desk are nice. Oh and its SUPER clean which is an A++ for me 
21168 From the Front Desk to he General Manager, very focused on making your stay comfortable. This was our 2nd stay at this hotel and they showed their appreciation. Nice size rooms with great bar and restaurant 
21169 Location is unbeatable! 
21170 I love this hotel. As a Hilton Diamond member I am usually upgraded. I love the location. Easy to walk to the theatre district or to the UN. Right near MOMA. Always a friendly staff and the food is decent as well. What is not to love? 
21171 Comme souvent a NY les chambres sont petites, mais les lits l'etaient encore plus. Pas grand chose a dire pour les prestations, elles etaient correctes, avoir un Starbucks et un Diner dans l'hotel constitue un plus et Midtown East est pratique pour explorer une bonne partie de manhattan. 
21172 A perfect hotel - great staff, great value for money, great room and location. I searched through trip advisor and we were over the moon with our stay. We got upgraded on arrival - it made our stay! 
21173 my family of four all loved this great location for our first trip to NYC. the grocery across the street was great, the diner on the corner was delicious. the proximity to subway exchange and central park was perfect. Levain's bakery so close we went twice! 
21174 Muy buena ubicacion, cerca de todo en una zona muy tranquila, muy cerca de central park. muy recomendable. 
21175 Great hotel, value for money indeed AND free breakfasts clenched the deal. Family of 3, 2 adults &20 year old loved this hotel. Good location, subway on next street, safe area. Staff go way beyond the call of duty to help you with any query. Beds are so comfy. 
21176 Hotel pulito; posizione indiscutibilmente ottima; Personale Gentile; Camera ottima; Ottimi servizi di zona (2 metro); Prenotazione con Hotels senza problemi; davvero tutto ok...fidatevi...non ve ne pentirete: essendo inizialmente scettico mi ero promesso che se tutto fosse andato bene avrei lasciato una buona recensione. Davvero tutto ok. 
21177 Excellent hotel with excellent service from the entire staff. Bill, Brie, Amber, Eden, Juan, Jose and everyone are always ready to help. 
21178 Clean rooms, nice comfortable room size. Great location. 
21179 This is without doubt,the best hotel we have used in New York.Decent sized rooms with a self-contained kitchen.The staff were extremely helpful.Superb location right opposite Madison Square Garden.We will certainly use it again. 
21180 Perfect stay, no complains at all. The staff was nice and the room better than expected. Close to everything, highline, soho and Empire state building 
21181 Un Hotel bueno en un area con mucho que ofrecer. Como Eataly un mercado italiano para chefs con varios reataurantes y muhos productos de Italia. Ralativamente cerca de Chelsea Market.. Varios Deli muy cercano y con una vida nocturna muy activa el su alrrededor. 
21182 The room was clean, as usual for the Hilton Chain BUT there was absolutely no sign of a coffe maker. If you wanted coffee downstairs, it cost 7.00 for one cup. For room service coffee, it was 12.00. We walked down the block to McDonalds for our morning fix. 
21183 Excellent location adjacent to the time square Rooms a bit small and the rate is expensive (300$ night) but this is New York !!! We look forward to come back.. 
21184 It was what every as I rated above,and the staff was great,plus we got it for a cheap rate.A nice breakfast and the lobby is very nice 
21185 Great hotel, fantastic location, ace bar and good value for money. I don't get the previous bad reviews on this hotel. 
21186 So I went to Manhattan from Scotland , as a nice holiday/vacation , and I was WOWED at the rooms and good service- has alot of lifts/elevators and cosy- internet connection included. 
21187 Washroom sucks,tv song have remote control,not satisfied with the room coz I had a high expectation...poor...the only think that make us feel good staying is the location.its very convenient.the the washroom is leaking.the lavatory is clogging,no garbage bin in the room only on the washroom. 
21188 As a Marriott Rewards member, I know what to expect of Marriott Properties. This hotel was exactly as expected. Formal enough without being stuffy, decent service and value. The location can't be beat! 
21189 Nice staff, comfortable beds, sheets and decent location- no gym on premises but they allow use of one just a few blocks away, good happy hour in the lobby- room was very quiet which is great in the city. 
21190 This is great property, in a great location, only made better by an excellent staff. 
21191 Great location, handy for broadway and times square. Bed comfortable. Room fine. Staff not the friendliest but it is New York so you can expect that from time to time. Would I stay there again? If it was cheaper. Overall I was satisfied with the hotel. 
21192 22 nd floor in the Heart of Manhattan New York City. Large spacious rooms, bathrooms and surprising Continental Breakfast. 
21193 My girlfriend and I had a great stay at this hotel. The roof top bar was amazing and we couldn't of asked for better accommodations. 
21194 Wonderful staff, super clean rooms. Newly remodeled. The elevators suck but they give you access to the service elevators. Close to all midtown attractions. Fluffys for breakfast and coffee is good. They give you discount card ask at the door 
21195 View is of courtyard view. Few rooms with street views. 
21196 Good location , miserable Internet ! I told the reseptionist the Internet- conection was important for my work 
21197 Instead giving me A new room at lower floor , i was told to go down to second floor in The CORRIDOR with my computer !! 
21198 Great location with fantastic view!! Recommend that hotel goes 'Green' as nothing seems to get recycled. 
21199 I've stayed here many times and as usual it was a great experience. the staff is always helpful and friendly - and they did not dissapoint me this time either and the location is so convenient. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
21200 Great location for a vacation in New York City. Comfortable. Our room was very high up and we had a great view. 
21201 Got a great price but expect a small room with view of two walls and the HVAC units, 
21202 The grand enterance into the hotel is beautiful - The rooms and bathrooms are really small. Beds are not very comfortable. Would of been nice to have one of the updated rooms. The location is great- a couple of blocks from Grand Central Station. Probably won't stay here again. 
21203 This a a great hotel if you want to stay in Times Square. It is centrally located to uptown and downtown to the village. The staff is so helpful and the rooms are are updated, comfortable and cozy. 
21204 The manager Amanda and the shuttle driver Joseph were amazing over our trip to Houston for the Thanksgiving weekend. The hotel is very convenient to some of the best areas near downtown. I wanted to make sure the Sheraton hotel chain knew what valued employees they have. 
21205 Excelente lugar muy confortable y con buena ubicacion Nos atendieron muy bien Las habitaciones limpias El personal muy atento Recomiendo mucho este lugar El precio es muy accesible Cerca de los lugares mas visitados 
21206 The hotel was comfortable and the staff was great. I only wish the rooms were equiped with wifi. 
21207 Pros: Comfortable rooms. Amazing location. Cons: Too expensive Internet (in Business Center it cost 1USD/min!). Dont make phone calls from the room. 
21208 We took the garden suite and had no complaint whatsoever. Great location - our first time to NY and got to feel like a local. We'll be back. 
21209 the service is great, specially the supervisor of the cafeteria, Ivet... they exceeded our expectatives, we travel very often to NY and we always stay in this hotel, is cozy, clean comfortable and the most important thing the people...they are the best!!! 
21210 I read all the wonderful reviews for this hotel and was pleasantly surprised that it lived up to its expectations. My room was clean, with decent space(for nyc) Comfortable accommadations from the bed, to the linen to the HD tv. Will definately stay there again. 
21211 We just adore this hotel. From the smiley greeting to the lovely rooms, we feel right at home. Kudos to all the staff who really care. 
21212 We were excited to stay over for my Birthday but were truly disappointed. The staff was horribly rude giving an attitude when asked any questions. They went out of their way to treat us like second class citizens. It's a shame it had a lot of potential. 
21213 first rate amid the hustle and bustle of NYC, thoughtful (umbrellas for all guests to take when it rains) great Restaurant. Rooms picture perfect. 
21214 Great location...just a few blocks from Times Square, theaters, restaurants. Clean room and bigger than expected (double with 2 queens). Free breakfast had most staples. Internet was efficient but slow. Held our luggage before check-in and after check-out. Nice staff. 
21215 Excellent location, friendly, helpful and attentive staff! 
21216 I just checked in to The Marcel and felt right @ home! Ricky, Chris and Juan got it going on:) I am looking forward to an amazing stay! So hurry up and get here and see what I'm talking about! More to come on this lovely place:) 
21217 Rooms were clean & comfortable with a nice view from our 31st floor room. Smaller than I'm used to but expected for NYC. Staff were all friendly and very helpful. Free breakfast was excellent. Free wifi too! Not a single complaint! Would definitely stay here again. 
21218 Great location, good clean rooms. I have no problems recommending this hotel to anyone. The best thing was the value - we booked on hotwire and got a great deal for such an amazing hotel. The only minus was that wireless was not included. 
21219 Have stayed here many times. Always pleased with the hotel. Reasonably priced for NYC. Clean, spacious, well-located. Good restaurants nearby, including "Barney GreenGrass," a great place for New York deli food! 
21220 I thought RRI was lovely. The staff were very welcoming and the room was very nice and equiped. When I come back to New York, (hopefully in april) I'm definitely going to stay at Red Roof Inn again. 
21221 The location of the hotel could not be better. However, the staff is too young and not very helpful. The room was too dark and depressing and the room service is average. The lobby is disappointing. Sorry guys! 
21222 Five minute walk to the subway, safe area, clean room and under $100 a night. Try finding anything similar/better in NY at that price. 
21223 I have stayed in this hotel four times for a trip to the city. I loved it ,so elegant and friendly this hotel is underrated in my opinion. My granddaughter loved the fluffy beds and the ballrooms. 
21224 Stayed in October 2011, wonderful location, super room overlooking Time Square, staff to be highly praised. Could not wish for a better holiday experience. 
21225 We stayed here 4 noights. About 20 min walk to Times Square. No room issues, simple clean rooms. Small beds Very expensive Hotel Bar. Staff helpful and accomodating. Air conditioning was so-so 
21226 stayed at this hotel on business - great location - very friendly staff - b/fast could be better and bar expensive for what it is - overall though plusses far outweigh the moans 
21227 Excellent location and better service. Near of all major NYC attractions. Gaby restaurant is elegant and boast a casual atmosphere. Clean rooms and prompt service. Thanks to Mattie at Gaby's, Lirio and Nancy at the front desk, the best. Front desk personnel speaks more than 10 languages, amazing. 
21228 best service ive ever had in new york really good food my favorite was the yellow fin tuna veronica ramirez and oksana were really hardworking people and did the best while eating there best personnel from texas with love carlos uriel castillo ponce 
21229 Original price for this room was $175.00 which we got, after negotiating, for $119.00. Wouldnt have paid any more than that because of the lack of sleep from noise, price of breakfast and no pool. Service was friendly. 
21230 Close to shows. Easy walking distance to midtown sights. Very clean and up to date rooms. Pleasant staff. Attached restaurant serves a nice breakfast buffet. Definitely would stay here again. Free wi-fi. 
21231 very nice, updated hotel. Very comfy, but only negative was that the parking was $38 per night. I believe you may be able to park next door for $28, but probably not worth the hassle. 
21232 hotel in ottima posizione davanti al top of the rock, 5 minuti a piedi dalla 5 strada, 5 minuti da times square. pulito e curato, vicino a ottimi posti per colazione e altro. da non perdere per rapporto prezzo/qualita' 
21233 Posizione hotel molto molto buona, prezzo ragionevole, noi abbiamo soggiornato 4 notti ad agosto e ci siamo trovati molto bene anche essendo in 5 ragazzi in una sola stanza, vista della camera su Time Square. Lo consiglio!!! 
21234 Everything was wonderful. For as old and historic as it is, the rooms are clean, comfortable, new, and fancy. The hotel bar is really cool and the service was wonderful. The hotel is near stops for both the red and blue line. We would definitely stay here again. 
21235 The hotel was beautiful, the amenities were excellent, and the service was exceptional. The concierge was very knowledgeable and helpful in every way possible, all of which helped to make our NYC experience one that we will remember for a long time. 
21236 I thought this hotel was quite worth it. The lobby's ugly, but the rooms are quite nice and clean. The housekeepers and front desk people are really helpful. For about $150 a night, 5 minutes away from time square, not bad at all! 
21237 From the courteous, friendly front desk staff to the lovely room, we were impressed. The room was nicely appointed, the bathroom lovely, and the breakfast in the morning a great extra value! Would certainly stay again and again! 
21238 This hotel is in a great location in one of the best cities in the world. The service, cleanliness and amenities are fantastic. 
21239 I would return to this hotel in an instant. Best staff experience I have ever had. Rooms were super sleek and Pump Room was beautiful. 
21240 My husband and I stayed here for one night on 11th November last. We found the staff very helpful. The rooms were spotless and we thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast. We would definitely stay here again. Their lending library scheme is excellent. 
21241 Please do not stay there! Lock of the door is not working!!! SCARY! My wallet got stolen while I was not in the room. Do not stay there if you wanna enjoy your trip in NY. 
21242 Stayed for 3 nights at the end of October. This was our second time staying at the Novotel. The room was relatively large, clean with a superb bathroom. The location can't be beat. The staff was friendly. 
21243 I was only staying in The Hudson for one night and only had an over night bag with me and even at that i was tripping over myself! Rooms are very clean though and reception area is gorgeous, ridiculously overpriced. 
21244 I thought that the hotel was wonderful! It was very very clean, the sevice was very helpful. The only problem was that from our room we could hear some noise from the street, they did provide ear-plugs, but it still was noisy. 
21245 Staff were friendly and helpful. Location was very convenient. Rooms clean and in excellent condition. Bed very comfortable. Great choice. 
21246 Good price for New york. The room was basic but the lounge and kitchen are nice. Easy to meet people. Good location. Nice walk into the city. 
21247 Great service most of the time, really fresh and clean room, though a bit small. The bed was wonderful and I slept like a child! I really liked this place and I would stay here next time I'm in NY. 
21248 Piccolo Albergo in posizione ottimale, colazione free, buona, varia e abbondante, pulito ed essenziale per un soggiorno vacanza, inoltre personale molto cortese e disponibile...in camera tv, radiosveglia, tavola e ferro da stiro, asciugacapelli. 
21249 This was our 2nd stay at the Chelsea Lodge (18 months later) and once again we were made very welcome and the rooms were very cozy and warm. Thanks again Chelsea Lodge for making us feel at home! 
21250 We were happily surprised. The staff was outstanding and our room was great. Beautiful view from our room. Room was very clean and very comfortable bed. Close to everything. 
21251 Great weekend at the W City Center in Chicago - Laurelin Hefter and the rest of the team at the concierge desk recommended a lakefront beach, shopping area and some breakfast options, all of which we loved in addition to architecture and sightseeing tours and more. We will be back! 
21252 Great hotel. I had always heard wonderful things about the Waldorf and they were all true. It is truly a magnificent place to stay. Everything is upscale and the service was impeccable. 
21253 Although friendly staff, rooms are way too tiny! Impossible to open up completely the door of the room. No space for the suitcases. Overpriced for what it is. Problem with elevator when we were there. We will definitely not come back and certainlynot recommend this hotel. 
21254 We will definitely be back! My wife and I loved everything about Le Parker Meridien. We got upgraded to a beautiful deluxe room overlooking Central Park when we told management that we were getting married. Thank you for a wonderful time! 
21255 Every year, I travel to NY. And would stay no wherebut here. Great price and excellent service 
21256 poor check in low quality bed linen all far too automated one feels like just a part of a process all rather matrix 
21257 The Waldorf was a wonderful home base for a family stay in the city. The location was central to many things, the staff was wonderful, the rooms spacious and comfortable. Truly, there was nothing that we would change about our stay. Sheer perfection! 
21258 Room furniture was very old and in bad conditions, location is excelent. Personnel at front desk not very friendly - all chinese - and didn't solve problems at breakfast. Rom had mini bar empty and Air conditioner didn't work only heater. 
21259 We stayed here for 3 nights and were pleased with everything. There was a good breakfast (only drawback was that it never changed). The location was good - short walk to buses and trains. We got a good rate from travelzoo - would definitely stay here again! 
21260 Christina and at the entire desk staff, the hotels shift engineer as well as the door staff were extraordinarily accommodating. The London NYC is very clean modern and well maintained. 
21261 very basic but clean. Small room and ensuite bathroom cramped. But location out weighs the former. Central to subway, shops, dining. Staff helpful, free Wifi in communal lounge. Would stay again. 
21262 Stayed multiple times at this hotel and found it very good for business visits. Next to the hotel (5 min walk) is a strip with lot of food joints and options. Great location, good rooms, comfortable, great staff! Efficient! 
21263 It was not as bad as some negative comments described. This hotel is at a great location! However, the room was small and the heater was noisy at night. But again, consider the location, I have to say the price was fair. 
21264 Had three stays here and have to say that I really like this hotel. The rooms are really nice and spacious, the staff incredibly helpfull and the bar downstairs friendly and entertaining. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean also. Would definetely recommend this. 
21265 Really enjoyed the stay. Clean rooms, nice people. Close to Times Square. Everything that I needed. 
21266 We always choose Hampton no matter where we are travelling, and this one did not disappoint. The room was gorgeous, the staff were exceptionally friendly, the location could not have been better, and the price was right. 
21267 10 dagen in dit hotel verbleven en alles was goed tot zeer goed. Zeer propere kamers, elke dag goed schoongemaakt, redelijk groot voor New-Yorkse begrippen. Zeer centraal gelegen, Empire State Building & 5th Av. om de hoek. Times Square & Macy's op loopafstand. Zeer zeker aan te raden. 
21268 I was surprised at how close the hotel was to Times Square and the Broadway district, yet it was so quiet! An oasis at the end of the night. Friendly, helpful staff, and a lovely continental breakfast buffet and a nightly wine and cheese party. Loved it! 
21269 The best hotel for vacation. In the middle of the city. Near all. Choose with brekfast included, its excellent! 
21270 Small noisy room. Overpriced. Bad location on run down part of Canal Street. Near subway. Great front desk staff. Good neighborhood restaurants within walking distance. Free Internet in lobby. Good fitness center. 
21271 First time staying at Indigo Hotels. Pleasantly surprised. Location is very good close to shopping and restaurants. Staff is professional and very attentive. Free internet a plus. Would definitely return. 
21272 Comfortable hotel, stayed there on a company business trip. Good locationa dnq uite good service. I recommend this hotel. Will stay in this hotel again on my next trip. thanks 
21273 Finally a hotel that has it figured out. When you step into the hotel you are engulfed by amazing aromas and greeted by friendly staff. The rooms are by far the nicest in NYC. Every guest is treated like royalty and the amenities are convenient and a luxury. Great hotel. 
21274 The room with the king size bed was a good size for the price. We did a special for 3 nights. Staff was great and the room was very clean. I would definitely stay here again. Very Art Deco and great location, near everything. 
21275 es te hotel fue uno de los mejores en los que he estado es unlugar maravilloso,y se lo recomendaria a todas las personas q sigan como van q van muy bien 
21276 The hotel is a short walk to a ton of theatres, time square and central park. The rooms were a nice size complete with a king bed and a desk and clean. I would stay here again. I have Nothing negative or critical to stay! 
21277 Staff was very welcoming and polite throughout the stay. The room was pretty tight, but was clean. The location is great and is convenient to all of the shops. 
21278 Hard to say something that havnt been mentioned here earlier, exellent location, close to many good resturants and close to broadway shows. This will certainly be my first choise when returning to NY next year. Dont think, just book it. 
21279 We stayed at the essex because of the Lion King Play. The Staff was very good. The room we had was excelent. The Savoy Restraunt was very good also. I would reccomend this hotel to anyone staying down town. 
21280 I would love to stay there again. Thanks and I love your service and your beautiful hotel! 
21281 For $300 a night you get a super location, attractive room that is 10x12 without even a chair, no refrigerator, shower that leaks on the bathroom floor, air conditioner that stops working over night, pleasant staff. 
21282 Was upgraded to a junior suite, unfortunately not high enough. The room was eternally dark and dreary with a view of another wall and HVAC equipment. Great location. Do not allow them to put you low, felt like we were in someone's basement. 
21283 Air broken....hot...gave us a fan. Requested a high floor, given 4thme floor. Killed 2 tiny nat like bugs in bathroom. Had to flush toilet twice to clear bowl. Disappointed ....... no compensation was offered when complaints were shared. :( 
21284 Very quiet and pleasant hotel stay. The hotel staff is very professional, friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again as the location is great and the hotel is close to the trains, etc. 
21285 Great location, great staff, and spacious rooms in an historic atmosphere. 
21286 The Standard has become my hotel of choice, for both business and pleasure. Formerly The Cooper Square Hotel, it's location across from The Village Voice and Cooper Union can't be beat. The rooms are modern, clean, streamlined and the service, professional yet warm. This is my go-to hotel in NYC. 
21287 We really enjoyed our stay. It was clean and secure. Their sprinkler system did get spots on my car,, but it was dirty anyway. The walls seemed thin. but for 200 bucks it was a cheap week 
21288 Ottimo albergo ,classico ma con tutti i confort,,molto pulito ,riservato,tranquillo buona colazione ,vicino tra tre metropolitane,zona uffici finanziari e porto escursioni turistiche,ottima impressione lo consiglio a tutti 
21289 Lovely hotel.. Amazing view of the Empire State building from my room. Clean and spacious 
21290 My favorite hotel in the Hilton family in Manhattan -- right in the middle of Time Square (good and bad) with real 1 bedroom suites. Feel free to read my travel blog for my detailed thoughts: http://www.extrapoints.us/doubletree-times-square/ Dave 
21291 This place was excellent, clean and friendly. would recommend it to anyone. As for the post about bed bugs, we did not see any bed bugs or signs of bed bugs so that is not true. great place to stay! 
21292 We stayed for 3 nights in November, great choice. The rooms are big for NYC, at $200 a night via a web deal it was great value. Best location, very close to Empire State building. we were very happy here and would stay again. 
21293 This an excellent address to be near of everything in NYC. Very clean, not too noisy with an excellent breakfast buffet included. We loved the situation so we can walk around or take the subway,There is a lot of restaurants nearby on the 9th Av. 
21294 Cleanliness can be better but acceptable. Rooms are small but the price and location cannot be better. (booked with expedia with flight package) It is right on magnificent mile. 
21295 We hebben in dit hotel 6 nachten verbleven. Dit hotel heeft een schitterende ligging, heel centraal, waardoor we op wandelafstand al heel veel dingen konden zien. De kamers waren niet overdreven groot, maar heel net. Prijs/kwaliteit heel goed!! 
21296 Everything about this hotel and our experience was fantastic. The room was nice, clean, and well furnished. The staff was very helpful. The location was perfect. I highly recommend this hotel for any trip to NYC. 
21297 We go here a lot, and we always get good service. My husband goes here for business and likes it very much. Overall a very good hotel. The only problem is parking, it is very expensive, $60 a night. But New York is New York. 
21298 Got an excellent deal on this hotel for my mid-week stay in Manhattan. Room was typical NYC, small but nicely appointed. Location is right in Times Square so it is very convenient. Breakfast was ridiculously expensive. Go outside the hotel. 
21299 Stayed for a long weekend and although we did not spend much time in the hotel, or eat here, I would recommend as a good stopover. Rooms a touch small on the basic price. 
21300 The Carlton has done some fabulous renovations. The lobby is spectacular as are all the public rooms. We had a quiet room with super beds and other amenities. The location was just perfect for our nedds and the staff very helpful. 
21301 nice hotel would go back again, love the location, also nice sitting area with complentary coffee, tea, and pastry. 
21302 Just had a great holiday in NY, hotel was in great location close to everything but the rooms need a make-over but apart from that it was clean and had all you need plus a large comfy bed 
21303 We have had the pleasure of staying at The London NYC many times. The London boasts wonderful food, top notch service and great rooms, not to mention the splendid location. I can not see myself staying anywhere else while visiting New York. 
21304 great hotel, so close to everything, didn't even need a cab just walked everywhere, staff very friendly and professional 
21305 Good hotel in a great location. Small rooms but it's New York, you shouldn't expect anything else. Breakfast suited our needs. If traveling to/from Newark, use a shuttle not a taxi. Taxi will cost around $75 each way because you have to pay extra rolls for crossing state lines. 
21306 We loved the Hotel! The staff and location were excellent and it was really clean!!!! 
21307 The owners of this hotel are incredibly accomadating to all needs. The rooms were quite impressive with comfortable beds, speedy internet, and very clean. The breakfast was also simple, but good. For the price, it's a great deal. 
21308 Just returned from a 5 night stay. This surpassed all my previous hotel experiences. The entire staff makes you feel special. The hotel and room was extremely clean. Loved the walk-in shower instead of a tub. 
21309 Comfortable room. The bathroom was great. The concierge "Showtime" was great, he was funny and had lot of good info about the city, especially about using public transportation instead of driving. 
21310 As an airline pilot on a long layover, we normally will get a good location. The Radisson Martinique on Broadway is a great location. It is within walking distance of Central Park, World Trade Center and Times Square. 
21311 Zeer comfortabel hotel op prima locatie. We hebben er alleen geslapen. Eten en drinken in hotel duur maar met geweldig uitzicht vanaf het Sky-terrace. Bediening aldaar sexy en dus leuk voor de mannen! Wel erg donker in het hotel. 
21312 This is very close to Grand Central and all subway lines. So easy to grab cabs in front of hotel too. The bell staff is great to work with and will arrange your trip back to the airport for a great price. 
21313 Great location--walking distance to all the great parts of the city. Ample room space and loved the 2nd floor with coffee & treats. It was a very comfortable stay 
21314 stayed at this hotel 28/1/05 to31/01/05, 4 adults, 2 rooms, rooms spotless, beds REALLY comfortable, staff ok but found our accent troublesome - SCOTTISH. didnt eat or drink in hotel so cant review this but hotel in great location. 
21315 Excelent hotel. Staff is friendly and welcoming, the restaurant is out of this world, room is ample, great bed, incredible views, clean, bathroom is big an full of nice touches (as the floor heater). The Hotel on Rivington is in a class by itself....totally reccomended!!!!! 
21316 A very good hotel at a great location. Just between 5th and 6th avenue and a few minutes from Time Squire. Small breakfast just enough to start the day. The rooms were clean and the staff was friendly and helpfull. Ron & Sophie The Netherlands 
21317 Although a little too far downtown for my business meeting(s), I had no regrets about staying at this cool boutique locale. Typical small NYC hotel rooms, but a nice lobby area and good staff 
21318 Esta a una cuadra de times square, es relativamente barato comparado con los hoteles de la zona. El hotel esta limpio y los cuartos estan chicos pero bueno. Lo recomiendo para los viajeros que pasaran mas tiempo en la ciudad que en el hotel 
21319 stayed for 3 nights feb 2012. nice size rooms with good facilities. modern and in good condition. bathroom and shower very nice and comfy beds. large lcd tv with on demand movies. restaurant and bar on site todd english very good if pricey. cocktails and sliders went down very well. 
21320 Stayed at the Sofitel for 5 nights and it was amazing. It was our first trip to NY and couldn't have asked for a better location. Just a couple of blocks to TImes Square and many other attractions. The hotel was beautiful and very classy. Thanks for a great experience. 
21321 We stayed in Sofitel for our first trip to NYC. The location is brilliant. The hotel itself is fantastic 
21322 The room we stayed in was a good size with a huge bathroom and very clean. The staff were all very polite and helpful. 
21323 rooms were small, and not impressive especially for the price. management was awful. would not suggest anyone to stay at the w on lakeshore. 
21324 Bottom line - I've stayed at many hotels west of the beltway and I-10 in Houston and this hotel is Excellent across the board! Clean, great service, great staff, fun bar and great food! Nice area with many places to go hangout and eat in walking distance. 
21325 This is our third stay a the Westin Times Square and we will be back. We thought that the hotel was clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. The location right off of Times Square cannot be beat. 
21326 The Sofitel is a very elegant hotel in a good Midtown location. The hotel has a very European feel, the restaurant is very good, and the rooms are fairly large for New York. The staff is good too. I will certainly stay at the Sofitel again. 
21327 Hotel with perfect location in center of Manhattan. Very friendly staff! Very large, spaceous rooms! Extensive review will follow later! 
21328 Great value for good location in NYC, near Times Sq- bigger than a breadbox room, clean, well appointed, excellent service, didn't have to wait long for an elevator, and quiet, too. Would stay again- 
21329 Stayed there in August. A great location and staff. They have a good diner with very good prices for downtown Chicago.Secure parking was free, right near your room.Very close to alot great places.Will stay again for sure. 
21330 OK there is a small window lokking right onto a 1 meter square shaft so no light comes in. The fitst thing I noticed was an odd smell but I've got used to that Did i mention the sullen staff? How do these people find work? 
21331 Yes, the rooms are small-even for New York, but they are so clean and furnished beautifully. The entire hotel has an upscale and fashionable feel. Don't hesitate to stay here. The location is wonderful, we would stay here again anytime. 
21332 What a great expierence from begining to end, very sexy and hip.. Food was killer and the Tapas off the chart... 
21333 This is a great hotel - well placed for shopping and all the sights of NYC. Rooms spacious and clean, staff very helpful indeed. Go to Chin Chin chinese restaurant 1 block away and have a fabulous meal - we did! 
21334 We've just returned from a long weekend at the New York Palace. It's a great hotel, good central location and very spacious rooms. Staff were very helpful. I'd definitely stay here again. 
21335 Unlike any hotel I have stayed in--It's an oasis in the midst of the hussle and bussle of Manhattan-the charm, the convenience and the service all make the Algonquin the place to be in NYC! 
21336 visited this hotel in November 2008. quiet rooms, in the middle of busy city :), close to good shops, theatres and famous places. enourmous breakfast ( pances with fresh fruit) yummy:) 
21337 This place was a dream! We were treated like GODS! They really know lux here - if you have the means, I HIGHLY reccomend you stay here - you won't be dissapointed!!! 
21338 Great location, close walk to Theaters. Pay the extra and stay on the upper floors, so that you do not hear and feel the subway. Hotel staff are adequate, but not friendly. Diner directly across from hotel entrance had great breakfast , great price, and friendly 
21339 close to all metro lines, clean and safe hotel, friendly staff 
21340 Absolut empfehlenswertes Hotel, preiswert, sauber, kompfortabel, 100% positiv! 
21341 Ottimo hotel in upper west side. Central park a due passi, fermata della metro vicinissima (museo di storia naturale). Camera comoda e spaziosa, personale cortese, gran scelta di bar e ristoranti in zona. Super consigliato. 
21342 Por viaje de negocios. Tiene perfecta ubicacion y las habitaciones no estan mal. Me aloje en una deluxe muy amplia con pantalla grande de plasma. Las estandar estan bien siempre que te den una de las renovadas, las otras estan pasadas de moda. El desayuno muy completo. Servicio regular. 
21343 Centrally located; convenient mid town Manhattan. They were undergoing a lobby remodel the weekend we stayed, but it did not detract from out experience. Room was nicely appointed with expected amenities. Good value - would visit again. 
21344 We have stayed here many times because we love this hotel. The location, the ambience, the friendly staff, the morning coffee & biscotti in the lobby. We'll definitely be back! 
21345 Un hotel qui me semble tres moyen. Seul atout l emplacement qui permet d'acceder au centre de la Ville. Il y a surement mieux sans probleme. 
21346 Thomas the front desk manager made it possible for me, my brother, my two sons and their two friends to have an impropmtu overnight adventure. We had left the final day of the Auto Show when Thomas helped to create a wonderful overnight in the very nice Hyatt Regency. 
21347 Great location. Staff were very helpful. Only complaint is the room was so warm and had to leave the air-con on which was fairly noisey. But for location it is perfect. Highly recommend it. 
21348 Small room but nice, clean and updated; very useful to have the kitchen in the room as well. Hotel is very quiet even though it is right next to the ground zero construction zone. Friendly staff. And the price was reasonable for New York hotels. I would stay here again. 
21349 The Hotel is old is true, but I had no problem with my stay. The staff is helpful and nice too. And is so close to Times Square that in two days will be boring to pass by Times Square to go to the Hotel. LOL I definetly recomend it. 
21350 nl complesso buona impressione personale molto disponibile e gentile 
21351 Negativissimo il fatto che nelle camere si percepisce tantissimo in modo da esserne infastiditi continuamente anche di notte il rumore proveniente dall'esterno(strada etc,) 
21352 This hotel was lovely, the staff were friendly and helpful and it was well placed to get to major attractions. Woud definitely recommend it for a cheap, clean base for exploring! Would stay there again. 
21353 2 days early July, family of 4 ( 2 kids under 7). Large suite. Excellent service, walking distance to most everything. 1 bed suite with balcony ( that's right), decent size for NYC. Include refrigerator, microwave, nespresso, etc. Room service could have been better. Would definitely stay again 
21354 the rooms were very comfortable,very spacious,clean, very good location central to everything,the staff were exceptional elias, gina,mohammed,jonathon,angelo all made us feel at home.they always took their time to ask us if we needed anything. we will always remember their genorosity. 
21355 If it's not too expensive for you, I recomend you to try this place. I like this place very much, hope you will like it too. 
21356 Watch out for the Sutton Place Hotel. They overbook. We were upgraded to a junior suite, probably because we had already paid in full for our room that had been given to someone else. You might not be so lucky---and who wants to start off a vacation with a hassle! 
21357 Great Location, Hotel Lobby & Bar was under construction but still a nice stay. Would stay here again next trip to NYC. 
21358 Excellent location, comfortable rooms (though no tea or coffee facility, and no scissors or knife). Table service at the Gaby bar / restaurant however is very disappointing (very slow and inattentive). 
21359 I would recommend this place for your stay. Great location, tremendous views, wonderful staff. 
21360 The good: The location is great and the rooms are spacious and well appointed. Everybody was friendly and attempted to be helpful. The bad: Our first night we had no hot water. It was corrected on day 2. Also the rooftop bar service was below par. 
21361 Decent digs. Good bang for the buck. Not so hot on conceierge, or common area, but room dandy, breakfast fine, great location. Fine for the money. 
21362 Hotel centralissimo, grandi spazi comuni grandi camere, non molto competenti alla reception,non riuscivano a trovare la prenotazione ed invece di una tripla ci hanno assegnato una doppia ed ho aspettato fino alle 23 il terzo letto che era un piccolo scomodo letto pieghevole....ma per NY questo ed altro! 
21363 This is a solid three star plus. Rooms are newly renovated. Lobby/restaurant/etc under renovations though. Will be a great place when done. 
21364 Clean rooms, great service and the best location. Very close to the subway on 72nd and plenty of places to eat and shop close by. A really safe area to walk around late at night and a close walk to central park too. 
21365 I have stayed in many hotels all over the world. This hotel was one of the best I have ever been to. The service, attention, food, rooms etc etc were excellent. Forget the Waldorf Astoria, or The Plaza. The Plaza Athenee knocks spots off both of them. 
21366 Great location for this hotel. Some detail could be a bit "seasoned" but the accomation is very clean and comfortable. 
21367 Fantastic location, great hotel, felt like we lived in NY for a week. Don't tell everyone, before you know it looses it's charmes. 
21368 Very nice hotel. Especially the rooms which have view to Crysler Building! Very cosy and big room, clean in the heart of Manhattan, two steps from Times Square and the broadway theaters! I would definitely stay there again, if i find again the offer with the better price. 
21369 My stay at the Sofitel, NY was better than expected. The hotel was located to many attractions. The service was great and the room was VERY nice. I would stay at Sofitel hotel, NY (or any other location) again. 
21370 Rooms were good size, excellent location, service was fair, bing we got woke up by security at 7:00 am. and the fact that they really never booked us in, and we had pre-paid for the room. Other than that it was a great hotel. 
21371 I enjoyed staying at the Dream. But the rooms are small (even for NYC) and for the price, I think there should be at least a real window in the room... Nice, though small bed and good sized bathrooms. Elevators are a mess... 
21372 Pretty good location, great staff. All the issues that came up were solved as fast as possible. The only issue is that the parking is paid. 
21373 Carmen, the houskeeper on the 22 FL was so friendly and nice. She always made sure we had EVERYTHING we needed! She did a great job and takes pride in her job! 
21374 I spent a few nights here with my teen age daughter. We got the penthouse with an exquisite view of New York city! The service was excellent and the location is second to none. 
21375 We spend 4 nights in may 2004 very pleased in this hotel. Clean ,good sized room and exelent location. I'm going to N.Y. next October and I hope to stay at Southgate Tower Suite again! 
21376 Fantastic location, big rooms, best bed's I ever slept in! 
21377 I thourghly enjoyed my stay at this facility. The room I stayed in was very clean and the hotel staff was very nice. 
21378 great service great stuff nice and comfortble rooms been there twice and for sure will come again. loved it 
21379 E' la seconda volta che soggiorno in questo hotel mi sono trovato bene pulito accogliente quest'anno era aperto il ristorante al 21 piano buono lo consiglio non buone le briosce di starbuke la buffetteria al piano terra da migliorare 
21380 and very handy. Not five star luxury, but neither are the prices. It is clean, comfortable and easy to use as a base. 
21381 The staff at the Larchmont Hotel in Greenwich Village helped make my families visit a very pleasant new years holiday, and of course NYC's ever diverse Village surroundings kept everyones interest! 
21382 very good hotel not so expensive regarding its standard and location. will be renovate soon. view on un building and east river is very impressive. 
21383 average rooms, great location (broadway and hells kitchen around the corner), good service (reception, bellmen, ...). 
21384 We got a very good rate for this hotel on priceline.com. The rooms were clean, we had a great veiw of time square and it was minitues away from central park, 30 rock, empire state, central station, shops and restos! 
21385 clean but small rooms, super location, plenty of restaurants around, easy to reach all attractions; use hop on , hop off busses, if you travel to NY for the first time. great city trip around Christmas time 
21386 The hotel is very well located in the midtown, between the rockfeller center, the empire state building and time sqaure. Good looking hall and rooms. The room was quite big and clean. Employees were kind and friendly. 
21387 We stayed at this hotel in Jan 12 , service was good but rooms slighty smaller than average and had issue with the smelly toilet and constant sound of garbage collecting was unbearable 
21388 Apart from that great location close to central park and ballet theatre 
21389 On a nice quiet street. Not many amenities, but it was a good place to stay for my first trip to New York by myself. Very helpful staff. Close to subway and bus stations. Short walk to Central Park. 
21390 This place is great. Clean large rooms, in very good repair. Beds were very comfortable, large closet and TV. Bathroom very clean. In walking Distance of MIdtown, Theathers and Javits. FREE PARKING!. GOOD service from the staff. You just can't beat it for the price. 
21391 centrally located, convienent to all top tourist destinations and shows; reasonably priced.. excellent(!!) staff 
21392 Buen hotel, de mediana calidad, habitaciones decoracion moderna, ubicacion exelente, a 1\2 cuadra de Time Square, el centro del centro, buena limpieza, atencion de conserjes exelente, tienen una ayuda para excurciones pero no hablan espanol, bar muy bueno. 
21393 My boyfriend and I like the new feel and the modern look of our small room. We were also very close to all the gay attractions of Chelsea and West Village, which was a big plus for us. All staff were very friendly and helpful. 
21394 Aside from the chic decor and fun LES location, the staff at this hotel was amazing. Noah, the concierge, went above and beyond! Lots of great bars and restaurants within walking distance, including my favorite, Katz's deli. 
21395 I recently submitted a review/story explaining my experience. The general manager quickly responded to me and corrected the problem. I will take him at his word that corrections have been made to correct the issues identified and look forward to giving the Hotel on Rivington another try. 
21396 Nice hotel, looks relatively new and convenient to Times Square. 
21397 Loved this hotel and love our view on the 17th floor. Staff was very friendly. I am returning on August 20th for 2 nights and looking forward to a city view room again. I can't say enough about this hotel - very professionally managed! P Barwise 
21398 Do not stay... Club in hotel will keep you up all night. Communication is awful, had 30 different answers given to me to my one question. This place only pretends to be cool and hip. It is not. 
21399 Great hotel. Ordered the hotel via internet, but they did not have the room type. A little expencive. do not bother to eat breakfast at the hotel. Nice food - but far to expencive. 
21400 The location was very close to Times Square. The bed was amazing, felt like I was sleeping on a pillow. Everything was clean, very friendly staff, we were happy overall!! 
21401 Great located, around the corner of Times Square. Good size rooms, small bathroom however. Breakfast is good and not expensive. Very good price-quality ratio. Free Wifi! 
21402 i enjoyed sleeping on the large beds, the rooms were huge, the breakfast was amazing with so much food to choose from plus a chef who makes custom orders such as pancakes, omelets, etc 
21403 Title should explain a lot, I wouldn't consider staying anywhere else when I travel to New York (which is with some regularity) staff and hotel are simply fantastic. 
21404 Our flight was delayed. We arrived at the hotel very late. I was afraid we would be given the ugliest room in the house, but they gave us a huge room. True, the hotel could use some refurbishment, but excellent value for money. We will return for sure 
21405 Everything in my room was upgraded and fabulous. The pool and exercise are were the best! Loved every minute. The bar was cozy and very English. 
21406 Situado en plena times Square, con acceso a toda la ciudad. Moderno y lujoso. Excesivamente caro 
21407 Good hotel very clean. Service was good all staff members were nice. Easy to get a cab out front and in time square it is almost impossible. Bathrooms in room are tiny but beds comfy and clean. Lounge is ample. A good place to stay with a great location 
21408 Large rooms, clean, close to airport - and it was all at a great value. Front desk staff was marvelous - phones weren't working for a wake up call, so the front desk staff came personally to my door to be sure I was awake. Very friendly and accommodating. 
21409 This little Inn is next to a disco open untill 3:30 every night. The managers didn't seem to be aware of the noise. Also the paperthin walls didn't help. Rooms are small. We won't be back. 
21410 Yellow water coming out of the sinks. Terrible smell. Burned out light bulbs. Broken ac in the first room. Close enough to the airport jetway to have the planes rumble the room. Need I say more? 
21411 I stayed there a couple weeks ago....wow what a great location in the loop...Large rooms, Everest a wonderful restaurant steps away... Hotel Staff makes you feel at home. 
21412 Fantastic hotel with great location, staff and rooms 
21413 My wife and I stayed there for our fifteenth anniversary. We were greeted with a room upgrade, chocolate covered strawberries, and a bottle of champagne - excellent way to start our stay! The hotel is stylish and centrally located. Would certainly stay again. 
21414 We stayed 6 nights and found this hotel very well located and friendly. The room was comfortable and well appointed but not huge. The 'free' breakfast was a great advantage and good value. The concierge gave us good advice on restaurants which were all within easy reach. 
21415 Great location. Comfortable rooms although a little small. Stayed for 4 nights and moved from the 2nd floor to the 18th floor after the first night at the receptionists suggestion and had a great view of the Empire State. Staff attentive. Restaurant a little expensive 
21416 Nice rooms, great location! 
21417 The location of this hotel was excellent. The room was a bit on the smaller side but still perfectly acceptable. The service was good and we would stay here again in the future. 
21418 Great location, close to central park, times square, theater district and subways. Great ambiance in the restaurant and lounge. Rooms are very nice and beds are comfy. All for a very reasonable price. 
21419 Very cool hotel. Very Different from the normal standards I know. Top! Very near at the time square and the Port Authority Bus Terminal 
21420 Good price for a basic but good quality hotel. The front desk was good, easy place to get cab / buses/ subway and good locale restaurants 
21421 I stayed for a week and loved it. Nicely appointed rooms and great skyline views. 
21422 Do Not Stay Here!!! Our room was unsanitary and the front desk staff did not care - even the woman who identified herself as the front desk manager. This is not worth it to you no matter what the cost. 
21423 We love this hotel. We stay at it every year that we go to NYC. It's right at Time's Square and near all the Broadway shows. Super nice rooms and service 
21424 An absolutely horrible stay. The front desk is rude and incompetent. The room stunk like dirty socks. I will not be back. 
21425 le parti comuni sono molto buie, ma "cool" e alla moda. le camere sono pulite e spaziose. da apprezzare soprattutto l'ubicazione in pieno centro, a 50 metri dalla 5 avenue e a pochi passi da time square e quindi dalla metropolitana. 
21426 We have now been back to the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square NYC three times. It is a perfect location for seeing theater, the hotel is clean, the staff are very friendly and helpful. It has a nice, warm feeling. 
21427 We had a fab tine! The hotel is in a perfect location. The concierges are awesome and the doorman also. Extremely helpful! The apartment rooms are large and clean. Decoration is a bit boring in main area but bathroom rocks! Love the tv in mirror! 
21428 One of the best I ever stayed. Friendly staff and extremely well located. I would recommend it easily 
21429 Het totale onderhoud van de kamer was slecht. Afschilferende plafonds. Bad en wastafel ook aan het afschilferen en niet schoon. Regelmatig maar 2 handdoeken voor 3 personen. Ook na bellen voor bijlevering de volgende dag weer maar 2 handdoeken. 
21430 bien situe dans times square la reservation peut s effectuer en direct et en francais accueil correct 
21431 Clean room, well supplied. The pillows were too soft and not very many TV channels. Several restaurants close by, but avoid the Hibachi Grill next door. Nothing special, but a good basic room for a reasonable price. 
21432 it is new hotel, front desk people are very very nice, rooms are small (even upgraded once are small). Location is great especially for shopping and dining. 
21433 Stayed on northwest corner suite. Noise was never ending from WTC site. 
21434 I stayed at the Holiday Inn for the unofficial kickoff to the Houston Rodeo- BBQ Cookoff. The service was top notch and the atmosphere was perfect rodeo, cowboy entertainment! 
21435 Great room. Separate bedroom with access to bathroom from either living room or bedroom. Big TVs in both rooms. Beautiful bar in living room. Great value. Perfect for theater goers. Wonderful staff: Marie at the concierge desk and Damaris at the front desk were very helpful. 
21436 Lovely hotel with hard wood floors. Sitting outside having a cocktail was a great way to unwind after a long day in the office. My only issue is that on my way to my room, I could hear someone taking a shower. 
21437 Great venue for business meetings; good food; and, comfortable rooms. The fitness center is well equipped but limited when large groups convene. The group rate is reasonable - perhaps, a bit pricey/over valued for its individual rates. 
21438 Excellent hotel good location third Holiday Inn Ive stayed at in the last 18 months. Walked to Subway Madison Square Garden lots of restaurants close by. Room was a little small but didnt spend much time in it anyway. 
21439 Recently my Family and I had the pleasure of staying at this hotel for the weekend. This is now our favorite hotel in Houston. The service was extraordinary!!! We will be back! 
21440 We stayed in the Mondrian for two nights and it was perfect for a quick party weekend. The decor is girly and adorable, all silver and blue. The staff was most helpful from the time we arrived until the time we left. Would definitely return. 
21441 We spent three nights a Yotel. The location is great. The hotel amenities are just right. It was very clean. The staff is wonderful and fun. And the terrace and restaurant area allowed us to socialize with friends without having to leave the property. Can't wait to return to Yotel. 
21442 El hotel no es lujoso pero me parecio fantastico. Esta justo en el centro de Manhattan, caminando llegas a todos lados. Limpio, habitacion comoda, serviciales, las camas buenisimas, descansamos muy bien en las noches. Lo recomiendo. 
21443 Nice place.. close to subway.. safe place in night... nice people at desk... very helpful... rooms were good not too fancy but clean and neat...checked out in morning and flight was in evening.. they kept bags till evening in their storage without any extra charge...have to good value for money 
21444 The front desk representative was not friendly and seemed unhelpful. I know good service when I receive it. This was unacceptable. The price was not cheap so I did expect better than the service I received. I would never stay there again. 
21445 Great location to go to city attractions. Great staff and clean rooms at a great price 
21446 kamers zijn goed schoon en prima verzorgt, zien er gezellig uit alleen erg klein, er is een mogelijkheid om koffie en thee op je kamer te maken openbaar vervoer is dichtbij een erg goede deli aan de overkant,lekkere broodjes 
21447 Hotel is very close to the Magnificent Mile - shopping and site seeing. The guest room, while a little small was well appointed, bed was very comfortable and the bathrooms were very nice. Make sure you don't miss "the Bean" at Millenium Park. 
21448 A very nice moderately priced hotel in the middle of NYC (Times Square). The real hidden treasures are the hot tub rooms. Fully jetted tubs With a TV, an excellent way to relax after a long day of walking around the most amazing city in the world. 
21449 I am a business man from Miami, FL. I am in the Oil and Gas Industry and this hotel located in the heart of the Oil and Gas Corridor - Westchase Area. The hotel restaurant was great. Front desk was friendly and helpfull. 
21450 Had a fantastic week at the chelsea. The whole place has such a nice atmosphere. Clean, cheap and nice rooms. Best location. I will stay here from now on when in NYC. 
21451 I have stayed at the Chicago Swissotel on several occasions. The facility is amazing and the service is excellent. I would suggest and recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a really upscale place to stay! 
21452 The River Hotel is a very special place perfectly located in a beautiful old building, right downtown and with a spectacular view of the river and its bustle from our window. The place is really warm and comfortable.We would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
21453 Good rooms, nothing fancy but fabulous views of Empire State building from our room and ideal location for sightseeing and shopping. 
21454 Funny old hotel. The lobby is as crowded as a shopping mall. This is accommodation factory. Big basic rooms, but everything seems very old. Superb location. A little disappointing that there is no wi-fi, but Starbucks is right across the street. 
21455 The staff was also friendly and helpful in addition to the entire facility being very well maintained and spotlessly clean, 
21456 Great location, highly recommended!! Will come back and stay at this hotel again...hotel is centrally located to everything. 
21457 Es un hotel de habitac pequenas pero tiene todo. No le falta nada. Hotel muy amigable. Excelente ubicacion. Todo Nuevo y todo functional. Tiene caja seg en la habitac. Y precio acomodado acorde a lo que ofrece. Wi if q siempre funciona. Lo recomiendo 
21458 I just spent a night at the Hilton with our family and could not have been more impressed. The hotel staff was very outgoing, service was excellent and it is in a great part of Chicago. I will make sure to return when we go back to Chicago. 
21459 We stayed 1 week on April, 2011. It was excelent. We dont have any problems. The room is clean and beds are good! Perfect location! Next time we want to stay here again! 
21460 I took a group to New York this spring and we stayed at the Renaissance for 4 nights. Everyone loved the hotel, the location, the price and the staff. It is one of my favorite hotels in New York. 
21461 can't come up with anything negative at all. Manager is visible, all the staff very friendly- desk, housekeeping, servers, cook ... breakfast s very good $16.95 and served till 10 
21462 Hotel provided great service and was exceptionally clean. The Front desk from the time I walked in was extremely helpful. Louise gave us great ideas and was amazingly helpful. Thank you. In the middle of times square 
21463 So much fun! I recomend this location to everyone!!! 
21464 I stayed hear for a few nights and enjoyed myself. The staff were very friendly, location good, Overall a good place to stay. 
21465 Got a corner cabin. Comfy, clean and looks great. Staff was very pleasant and helpful. A little pricey, but worth it just for something other than the usual Holiday Inn experience. Could've used an in-cabin fridge/microwave, but the nearby "galley" on each floor was a clean and useful alternative. 
21466 A very cool hotel - why?? A great location, great bars and cool roof top pool. Quality feel and worth the $400 per night. Go if you like a lively and contemporary hotels. 
21467 Frente al central Park. Un poco lejos del centro pero muy bien comunicado. Por ser NY precio correcto y limpio, paseando tienes un barrio que no pareces un turista. Bueno para una visita a NY y gastar lo correcto en dormir. 
21468 Ideally siutation in the center of Times Square. Staff were very helpful and any problems were solved immediately. Once in the hotel you could not tell that you were in the center of one of the busiest places in the world. 
21469 stayed on the 48th floor with a spectacular room, with some issues. the room is extremely average for a fourseasons. the decor was like a dorm room with very few amenities. the location is good, the lobby is beautiful. I would choose the ritz or st regis next time. 
21470 Stayed in this hotel recently, awesome place. Very clean, friendly staff and location is perfect. No ifs no buts or maybe's...book this hotel you won't be disappointed! 
21471 Nothing more to say than if you can afford it - stay here! It's an incredible experience. And don't miss breakfast, lunch or dinner at the 57 restaurant - everything you ever dreamed of in high-dining experience. Can't wait to go back. 
21472 This hotel is great. We go in once a year to the city for girlfriends weekend and stay here. It is in the hert of city. Rooms are clean, spacious. Staff is great. Bar is great as are the bartenders. Would highly recommend this location! 
21473 Clean, comfortable rooms, helpful and pleasant staff, walking distance from Penn Station. Expensive, but maybe not bad for NYC -- I do not travel there much. 
21474 Recently redecorated - beautifully. Posh room design. The only downside would be the sliding door on the bathroom. 
21475 Lovely deco & ambience. Beautiful setting, helpful staff & great location with convenient access. Clean...especially love the white color with blue contrasts in the rooms. Will definitely return again! 
21476 This hotel is packed with hookers and gross johns with a few Euro tourists mixed in. The beds are terrible, the furniture has cigarette burns, really nasty. I would not go here again. 
21477 nice clean rooms ,wonderful staff,yummy breakfast, 24hour coffee,tea&hot cocoa and easy walk to times square,Wicked,Lion King ,good restaurants,subway,couple blocks to ride hop on hop off grey line(we enjoyed the bus) WONDERFUL PLEASANT STAFF 
21478 Very friendly staff...great room! Very clean. We loved our stay and will definitely go back. 
21479 As stated, excellent location and excellent service. The only downside is the small bed. 
21480 Located on 6 Avenue between 53 & 54, the Hilton is great for a Manhattan urban holiday. The delux rooms were really comfortable and we enjoyed ourselves in the hotel very much. The fitnes center is also very well equipped. 
21481 Consistency and excellence is service; that is what makes this such a wonderful place to stay. One could find flashier, fancier or pricier but this hotel will not be outdone in actual quality. 
21482 I enjoyed the stay here in NYC. I was in Manhattan for a friends wedding, and the retro style and incredibly polite staff were very courteous, and helpful, particularly getting dinner reservations for a VERY last minute bachelor party, and getting around a very busy city. 
21483 Just spent two nights in March. The hotel is in need of some repair. My room was good and quiet. Staff was helpful. It is a convention hotel and is very busy. Room was clean. Not a special place but definitely central. 
21484 close to everything...central park, time square, 5th avenue shops. Hotel is older.Rooms are basic. Elevators are very small. staff was nice and very helpful. Park Cafe rest. at hotel was good. I will be staying there my next trip to New York. 
21485 I learned of the Chandler by staying across the street at a very expensive hotel. So, I looked it up on this site and liked the reviews. Most reviews were accurate. Very nice room, bathrobes, turndown service, free wifi, newspaper....nice place.. 
21486 The hotel did live up to my expectations. Loved the location, easy to get to metro and restaurants and shopping. Its a very comfortable hotel with great amenities. 
21487 This is the certainly the place to stay in New York - right on Broadway. Stayed on the 45th floor with a fabulous view over Times Square, and in the evening went up to the revolving View lounge and restaurant to see New York lit up. Way to go....! 
21488 Trip starts at the front door with Marco and Charlie M. When you get to Front Desk Danny , Michael, Carla, Demarris, and Jenny will take great care of you. Great security system in place 
21489 Good hotel , location not great but ok 
21490 Concierge very helpful but front desk a bit awkward. Bar prices OTT. Room was big and great view but bus tours dont start unril 10 am in the area. Would stay again though as on the whole a good experience. 
21491 The Hotel is well located but the service in general is not good. The attendants were not polite enough with us. We had a problem with the room shower that was not solved while we were hosted there. The room we stayed didn't have a mini-bar or a mini refrigerator. 
21492 the renaissance hotel is really best hotel i gone many times in this hotel and i founded it very best and the very good hotel in all over new york i highly recommend you to go to this hotel and enjoy everything 
21493 This is a great hotel in a great neighborhood. Terrific value with kitchenettes in the rooms. Very week-appointed and convenient. This was my second stay and I will return. 
21494 Large room for a reasonable rate. The friendly and efficient staff are a plus. The location is excellent. Recommend Penelope at 30th and Lexington for breakfast. The hotel restaurant Rare seemed very popular and is reasonably priced. 
21495 We were very well looked after during our honeymoon in early March. The staff is exceptional and the property has an old world charm. Our room was a spacious delight. We cannot wait to return to this most wonderful place. 
21496 Some of the carpet and wallpaper were a little worn, but great overall. Awesome staff. 
21497 this is the best place i have stayed in, in Chicago. friendly and always ready to serve.but they need free coffee in the am. Leon S 
21498 We were delayed so we were put in this hotel. 3 adults and 1 child in 2 double beds. We got a roll away bed without charge. Very tiny rooms, about 15 min from airport. We didn't like the noises of the Ac unit. 
21499 Fitzpatrick was clean. Staff was professional and friendly. Helpful in directions, places to eat,and getting a cab for us.room was a nice size, for NYC. 1 queen size bed, good size bathroom with tub shower. Irish bar/restaurant attached to hotel. 
21500 Nice hotel, very close to Murray Hill and Grand Central Terminal. I would stay here again. 
21501 could not have asked for a better location and the fitness center and spa amenities we fantastic 
21502 Hi everybody ,we been in this hotel 6 days & nights and we are very satisfied .The service is great ,the stuff very friendly,the view was huge ,the room comfortable ,the pool not bad .The only one thing was that the hotel restaurant did not work in august:( 
21503 Everyone was so nice and pleasant right down to the cleaning staff! The free parking was a great plus especially in Chicago. 
21504 Stayed here for several nights during the US Open thanks to Hotwire. Hotel and rooms are quite old and out-dated. Front desk staff was helpful when checking in. I would not recommend using the valet service as our car was damaged. We won't be returning. 
21505 found this great hotel on hotel.com and what a gem, awesome place great location will go back in a heart beat. 
21506 I recently visited New York and stayed at the Park Central Hotel. The staff was exceptionally friendly and knowledgeable about the area, especially Ellen who was wonderful. The room was clean. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
21507 great staff, but only 3 elevators for 44 floors of rooms. Very long wait, even at 1:00 a.m. Also, the shower broke and i couldn't get the water to turn off. They weren't too happy about having to come and fix it but finally did. 
21508 Wonderful hotel. Great staff, fabulous large comfortable rooms. Smaller boutique hotel, part of the relais and chateaux group. Love the location ..one of the best hotels in new York 
21509 The most divine beds! Nothing can beat the moment you check in and relax and start your holiday! 
21510 Hotel petit mais sympa tres proche de michigan avenue. A environ 25 minutes de marche du loop. Hotesses d'accueil tres gentilles et avec de bons conseils. Hotel propre et chambre conforme a la description. A conseiller. 
21511 nice bed,tv and clean bath and great water pressure,all pluses.almost perfect location ,bellmen very helpful,loved the ground floor restaurant for breakfast.if you're not a fussbudget,stay here. 
21512 Stayed there in October 2011. Price was good, service was excellent. It was conveniently located only a few blocks walk from the convention center. 
21513 THis is a stunning relaxing, beautiful part of the city and would stay there again. stayed on concierge floor which i would highly recommend for anyone. Room was large by NY standards, people sooo helpful and nice 
21514 Was recently stranded due to sandy and this was all I could find for me and my mum.. Was great location close to everything we needed with some great resturants nearby.. Staff were very friendly and full of knowledge and help 
21515 Quarto grande, com cozinha e perto do grand central station. Otima localizacao, preco acessivel. O Predio e um pouco antigo, mas ainda assim Bem confortavel e seguro. 
21516 We staying at the Hilton Time Square and it was perfect for walking to attractions and the subway. They were helpful. Always felt safe. Would stay there again. Rooms were clean. Beds very comfortable. We purchased through a third party advanced sales for a deal. 
21517 Very good hotel, clean and spacious suites. Friendly staff, very good location. 
21518 Stayed at this hotel on a number of occasions over the last 3 years and always found the quality of service the same high level. it might be expensive for some, but if you want quality you have to pay for it. 
21519 Perfect location, courteous and polite staff with outstanding customer service. Our suite was beautifully decorated with the perfect mixture of class and elegance. I highly recommend this hotel if you're interested in having a top notch experience in quality and service! 
21520 The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the facility was very clean. We were very pleased with our room. We plan to go back again soon. 
21521 Excellent base to visit NY. Incredible Staff. Free High Speed Internet. Good breakfast. 
21522 Just stayed two nights at W Hotel-Union Square to attend a family wedding located on the property. Would stay again at the wedding/ group rate we received, but not at the regular rate! 
21523 This hotel is great and in a brilliant location. New York was amazing - all of us want to go back asap! 
21524 Probably singularly the second-best hotel I've stayed in. Great atmosphere very un-hotel-like, and amazing rooms IMHO. I actually very much liked the fact that it was hidden down a side-street. It oozed class and ambiance, and was just a cool trendy place to be. 
21525 The service was super, and the room was perfect nice bed.... you couldn`t wish for a better location. 
21526 Fantastic hotel with a swimming pool, hot tub, and sauna on the roof. Lots of conference rooms; perfect for hosting corporate events. Food service was excellent with an open floor plan. The first floor lobby seemed to have an odor from time to time near the elevators. 
21527 hotel sporchissimo,moquettes polverosa, bagno pieno di peli,tenda della doccia con muffa e personale scortese!in 14 giorni ci hanno cambiato le lenzuola solo una volta e dopo che insistentemente lo abbiamo fatto notare!!!non consigliato!!! 
21528 Enjoyed recent stay. I had booked 2 rooms with two twin beds and one with a double bed for my mother. Both rooms were surprisingly large for New York standards, however the bathroom is quite small. Everything was new and clean Staff every friendly 
21529 Nos hospedamos mi esposo y dos hijos de 4 y 9, el hotel esta muy bien ubicado, la habitacion esta limpia y segun lo que habiamos reservado, la atencion es muy buena, el desayuno esta bien, para iniciar el dia de turismo. 
21530 Excellent quality hotel, particularly for the price we paid. Staff was quick to help us with anything. Breakfast in morning was very complete (and allowed us to stock up on snacks for the rest of the day!). I highly recommend this hotel! 
21531 The staff was extremely helpful and nice. Our room was beautiful with a great view of the city. The restaurant and room service were excellent. I will definetly stay their again and recommend it to everyone. 
21532 We loved this hotel. Perfect location. Wonderful service. We will be back again 
21533 The Gild Hall hotel is a small hotel in NYC Financial District with friendly staff. Rooms are typically small but comfortable and clean. Beds are very comfortable. The location is great for meetings in the Downtown area. The Felice restaurant serves a good selection of meals throughout the day. 
21534 The position is not really comfortable but there is a metro station nearby. Staff is polite. Wi-fi connection is free and available in each room. Breakfast is quite expensive, it's better to have it in the street. 
21535 This is a fantastic hotel located near Wall St in Manhattan NY. All of the staff were very courteous and efficient. Rooms were modern, clean and good size for NYC. The rates were high. Food was good and the bartender rocks! 
21536 Not a quiet hotel. But staff was nice and room very, very clean. 
21537 Great hotel excellent location, the hotel staff professional and efficient. Clean and comfortable room has a viewto the Empire State. Not cheap but worth every dollar. Good breakfast No doubt this hotel will be our choice next time we visit New York 
21538 We took a day trip to downtown and stay at this place with our two young kids. This is right behind the Hancock building. The rooms are modern and spacious. We had a living room and and a wet bar kitchen. The stay was amazing. 
21539 No option for early check-in ,for late check-out (3 hours) they charg 94 $ ,to store 4 small bages they charge me 16 $ ,30 minuts wait in row during Check-in .small and old rooms it cost me around 660 $ for two nights, i will never retrun. 
21540 We stayed in the Fantastic Suite, which has wonderful views, big windows, tiny balcony- loved it! On the not so positive side- the sofa thing is so outrageously uncomfortable to relax on. Time to make a change in the decor. 
21541 Stayed 1st of May 2004 for 5 days. Great location literally 2 minutes walk from Grand Central Station, 15 minutes from Times Square. Room clean but a bit of a musty smell although my friends said their room was fine. Fabulous bar but pricey. 
21542 nice rooms, in the center of Manhatan, very close to the metro stations to every destination, very cleen, good price, recomended as the best place to stay in N.Y. 
21543 Stay here two night at the start of the Great American Crossing Tour, great location, a stones through from Time Square. Fiona, my wife, bumped into Snoop Dog, but he didn't ask for her autograph! Very pleasant staff, would use it again 
21544 Good price for Xmas time stay. Nice rooms and very cool staff. Central, mid-town location with walking distance to Grand Central and al sorts of Manhattan goodies. Good times! 
21545 This place is new, so no complaints with the rooms, etc. The service from the hotel staff was outstanding! Very enjoyable stay.... 
21546 This Days Hotel @ Broadway is an amazing surprise. Its clean, smells fresh and affordable. I would come back and I would recommend this hotel to everyone. 
21547 has rats in rooms, even roaches horrible hotel 
21548 I haven't slept better in months. I woke up with no lower back pains. I looked out my bathroom window and reached for the camera. 
21549 consiglio per chi vuol girare new york a piedi....perfetto e centrale con la fermata metro a 50 metri, vicinissimo a time square ed altri posti di interesse, e ovviamente a central park, personale disponibile e gentile, pulizia ottima e ottimi servizi. 
21550 Totally enjoyed the service and the clean room.the mini stores like Starbucks were top of the line. A helpful staff made the stay quite enjoyable.with a downtown location that is close to everything the palmer house is a classic place to stay. 
21551 It's hard to find affordable hotels in Manhattan that are clean and inviting. The Hilton Garden Inn fits the bill. The room itself was clean and bright and the bathroom had great toiletries. The location can't be beat. 
21552 The Benjamin was absolutely brilliant, from the moment we arrived until we left we where treated with care and respect. I would recommend the hotel to everyone I know. 
21553 Great location. Very courteous staff. Clean. Accommodated special requests. Great to be away from the more tourist populated neighborhoods. Bed could have been a bit more comfortable...but overall, my new favorite hotel. 
21554 Great location near Times Square - staff could not do enough - great facilities. Food really good - could not find fault and when come back to New York will definitely stay here again. 
21555 The one sentence says it all 
21556 rooms old fashioned and in need of update 
21557 Not that cheap ! Lobby and location are only good features 
21558 Consiglio vivamente questo Hotel! Si trova praticamente dentro Time Square e costa anche meno rispetto a tanti altri holtes di rango inferiore! Non ho mangiato in Hotel quindi non posso lasciare un giudizio in questo senso. 
21559 Great location for hotel by Columbus circle and central park, but was very noisy in the rooms, very dark hallways/lounges-suppose to be eloquent/modern, but not my style! staff was helpful and friendly. 
21560 Die Lage war fantastisch, Times Square , Broadway in der Naehe. Die Lobby war schoen, aber alles inklusive das Zimmer waren besonders winzig, staendiger Laerm und kein Fenster zu oeffnen. Wenn man preiswertes sucht und mit geringem rechnet kann man das Hotel weiterempfehlen. 
21561 Down by the USS Intrepid, this Kimpton hotel has a very friendly staff, clean room, very quiet location and good value for the price. 
21562 Family stayed in a king suite and used the sofa bed in the sitting room for the children. This worked out really well - we had lots of space and a great base for a 3 day trip to New York. Hotel location was perfect and staff were most helpful. 
21563 This hotel is close to the magnificent mile. Check in was swift. Room was spacious, especially for a city hotelroom. Nice view. Very comfortable beds. There's is a nice breakfast restaurant across the street (The Egg Cafe). 
21564 True: location is great. Otherwise, very tired and not too clean... 
21565 Everything was perfect from doormen to maid service and their GILT dining room was excellent 
21566 Just stayed here for 4 nights and was very pleased with the hotel. Room was a good size for a New York hotel, and was cleaned daily, with the towels also being changed. Great location. I will stay there again without hesitation. 
21567 We stayed there in September for 4 days! It's worth for its money! We had a room on the top floor and a great view to Times Square! It was a bit humidity in the room but the rest was great! 
21568 I liked the proximity to the Maginificant Mile and lots to do. It is especially nice to have the Contemporary Art Museaum so close. Rooms are nice and fresh with lots of comforts. Staff was helpful and price is low for the area. 
21569 We love the ZaZa! This hotels just oozes fun and.....! I totally recommend a night for any marriage that becomes "routine". This place will jumpstart your libido. Great location and close to everything. 
21570 It was a great hotel and perfectly localized, at 5th avenue, in front of the central park. 
21571 Wonderful hotel..Wonderful Room..Wonderful staff..My room on 11th floor overlooked the memorial site - comfiest bed i have ever slept in..views are beautiful..Can't fault my 4 night stay..Thank you W! 
21572 Great place to stay, complementary breakfast, comfortable rooms, excellent location near Galleria Plaza and near excellent restaurants. But the best of all, very good service and great people. I will recommend not only for business but for leasure too. 
21573 Very Nice room - small bathroom but did not spend a lot of time in the room. Use the intercon website to get the $149 rate and you won't be disappointed. 
21574 Grosses, sauberes Zimmer mit bequemem Bett, Schrank, Schreibtisch und Flachbildschirm, sauberes Bad, Starbucks und Metro nebenan, allerdings hatte ich keine Sicht nach aussen, sondern vor der Fenster eine hohe Mauer, ausserdem war es sehr laut 
21575 Hotel was sold out but they still offered individual attention. Each guest was helped fully if they were not satisfied. The food at lockwood is great. Did not use the gym but guest that did seemed to like it. 
21576 I spent 3 nights in this hotel. General std is good, rooms are not brand new but spotless, good Gym and Swimming pool, great breakfast buffet. Concierge as well as other staff friendly and helpful, shuttle bus to companies around the hotel available 
21577 Stayed for four days In March- thoroughly enjoyed the ambience and style of the place. Location fab. An ideal place for a short sight seeing break. Breakfast fine, nice coffee. 
21578 Royalton has the perfect location but the Hotel itself i don't think i'll go back. The entire hotel is DARK. The walls are painted in dark grey and black, the room was small and almost claustrophobic. The AC - super noizy. Overall: Creepy!! 
21579 Staff, especially Elizabeth, are fantastic. Rooms are exceptionally clean and roomy. Front desk staff very helpful. Food is excellent. Highly recommend. Location of hotel is a real plus. Front desk helpful with all questions. 
21580 Molto bello e pulito.sapone, shampoo e lozioni corpo di Bulgari (Made in Italy).Stanza piccola, ma accogliente. Bella terrazza panoramica.Ci ho trascorso una sola notte, in quanto torno a casa dopo visita NY e fantastico tour dell'est. La metro' ha la fermata davanti all'hotel. Staff gentile e cortese. 
21581 What a superb place to stay in NYC! Gorgeous rooms, friendly and helpful staff, perfect location. Totally delightful. 
21582 Don't stay here. Old rooms, slow elevators, and poor service. They also got the bill wrong twice and when I called to get it sorted out was hung up on by the front office manager. 
21583 The location is very convenient to many things that are New York, but some rooms are very dumpy. See the attached pictures - broken furniture, scratched furniture, and a view of a smokestack and wall. But the room was nicely sized for New York. The staff was also very excellent. 
21584 Hotel was typical Hilton and nothing too grand. Position was good! 
21585 stayed at this lovely venue on a trip here, i little off the beaten track but we had no problems walking to all of the relevant attractions 
21586 I had a brilliant stay at fashion 26. Service delivery was superb and extremely friendly staff. 
21587 Terrible customer service. Terrible communication. Would never stay there again. Worst hotel of my experience. Try the Alden they are much better 
21588 Just stayed one night there, but it was very nice. Great views of Clear Lake, nice pool area. Rooms redone after last big Hurricane. As nice as it gets in that area 
21589 Treated like royalty by an outstanding staff. I even bought a couple of coffees for the Valet's as they were standing outside the hotel in 30 degree weather that is not characteristic of Houston. Every aspect of our stay was outstanding. 
21590 Excellent location. Fantastic lobby. The rooms need some refurbishment. 
21591 Good location. this hotel had everything you could want. My only complaint was that my room faced on to the street and was a little noisy - but it is New York so there is not much you can do about that! Recommended - good Midtown location too. 
21592 Location is number one wherever I travel. Here one can walk to the theatres, Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Columbus Circle, Central Park, Lincoln Center, many restaurants, Fifth Avenue, and the subway is one block away. Need more be said? 
21593 My husband and I stayed at the Jewel this week and thought it was a great hotel. It's location couldn't be better - close to everything in Midtown. The rooms were very clean, modern design, and the concierges were very helpful and nice. I would recommend this hotel to everyone! 
21594 This is a perfect hotel for visiting NYC. Great location, rooms are super spacious compared to similar hotels in NYC. Very clean. Price was good as well 
21595 We stayed here for 7 nights and loved every minute of it!! The hotel is central to everything and is really really clean with maids on duty every day. I would defo recommend this hotel. 
21596 Wonderful place to stay. The rooms are huge! even the bathroom. Great mid-town location. I will stay here from now one. 
21597 Fantastic hotel with huge rooms , great location and only around the corner from Central park and a few doors from Angelos Pizza. We have stayed at the Salisbury twice now and will be returning again. 
21598 Perfect location for walking to the river front attractions. Modern Marriott, upscale, comfortable, helpful staff. 
21599 Buen hotel por El precio tan conveniente, muy recomendado si van a hacer negocios por El Northwest Freeway, esta todo muy cerca, best buy, academy, restaurants muy buenos, etc. 
21600 Syayed with two colleagues on Sun 25th and Mon 26th. Very friendly staff ,rooms very nice (Had a Junior Suite) 
21601 Location excellent for getting around Manhatten. Lots of bars and Resturants within walking distance. Would definately recommend 
21602 We would, without a doubt, stay here again. The old world feeling in both architecture and service cannot be surpassed. So much is within walking distance. The price was very reasonable. 
21603 This was a great hotel is a very accesible location. Nice service, free breakfast, nice and clean rooms. I would highly recommend this hotel. Great for larger families as you can get a room with 2 queen beds. 
21604 My first trip to New York. Yotel was as it looked on the travel agent website. Clean. funky and spacious enough for our needs. Adequate storage, great shower and comfortable bed. Efficient services and excellent staff. I can't think of one negative, Will definitely return 
21605 Great location. Hotel was old and in need of updating but adequate. Service was excellent. Room was noisy but clean. No view. 
21606 Especially Adriana, who is always cheerful and helpful. This last trip, my wife offhandedly mentioned that she was a few months pregnant, and Adriana had a wonderful and thoughtful personal gift waiting in our room when we returned after dinner. Heart-warming. 
21607 The W hotel was a great hotel in a great location. The cozy rooms are small for sure but well decorated and the service is great. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would recommend it. I 
21608 Very cool hotel. Nice break from the usual bland hotels for business travelers! Eclectic decor, great service and fitness room. My advice- take a cab or shuttle. Parking can be tough at rush hour. Overall, great experience. 
21609 We loved this hotel. The room was great, staff were really helpful and friendly. Amazing architecture! Great, central location - close to Central Park, museums, subway, restaurants, delis. Easy commute to Times Square. Great neighbourhood. Would love to stay here again. 
21610 Stayed at this hotel in August and we were happy with the location, room, bar and workout facilities. Room was clean and bedding was extremely comfortable. Staff we encountered were all helpful and personable. 
21611 I've been staying at the Westin New York at Times Square for almost 7 years. The staff is warm and gracious, friendly and knowledgeagble. The rooms are clean with a modern feel. I cannot wait to return! 
21612 Albergo ben tenuto, colazione ottima e abbondante, personale disponibile e ad un passo dalle maggiori attrazioni!! In centro, esattamente sotto all'Empire State Building (che sembra di poterlo toccare!) e vicinissimo anche alla metropolitana, che ti porta dove vuoi. Ci siamo trovati davvero bene. 
21613 great location and very good rooms. room was big and the small kitchen made it ideal to save you looking to buy breakfast every day. small pub beside it was nice though too. nice staff and good gym and room service. 
21614 Really enjoyed my stay here. Location is wonderful - right in Times Square with all the NYC attractions. Rooms were large with great views. Amenities above average. 
21615 This place is fine. Not really near any amenities but only 3 blks. from subway. Modern, functional and clean. Absolutely OK! 
21616 This hotel does not let you become unhappy. Breakfast is sufficient and rooms are spacious. Mine had a big flatscreen, a small kitchen and a nice size fridge. The hotel is close to the galleria mall and nice bars. I would definitely stay there again. 
21617 Stayed here with my wife for a few days. We loved the hotel. Room was clean, service excellent, location was close to everything, times square , rockefeller, central park. It's gonna be our preferred place to stay. 
21618 the hotel has an awesome location, great staff, delicious breakfast, huge rooms, beds are comfy like clouds. simply awesome there is not much more to say. if you are looking for a place in new York, the residence inn is the place to stay! 
21619 Great location, so close to everything whther walking or needing the subway. Rooms fine, clean had everything etc. Highly recommend. 
21620 You can't ask for a better location in New York. Staff bent over backwards for me. Stayed in a very comfortable room with a great view and loved it. Business or personal travel, this is a great hotel in the heart of the city - you can walk to everything. 
21621 Everyone was so nice and helpful. Beautiful rooms, very clean and such a nice place to be. 
21622 Great Hotel and Outstanding Staff with always smiling faces and willing to help and resolve the issues on the spot. Stayed in the hotel in and out every week for almost a year. Everything is so nice....request is to keep it up... 
21623 I've been staying at this La Quinta off & on for the last 6 months throughout my medical treatments & I have yet to experience a bad visit. Staff is always friendly, rooms are clean, easy checkin & checkouts, good breakfast selection. 
21624 Hotel is very nice. BUT- when we checked out the rate they charged us was not the rate we had been quoted. When I told the guy at the desk, it was corrected, but there was no apology given. For these prices this is not acceptable. 
21625 Great hotel and oustanding location. Center of everything, walking distance to everything, steps to subway. Our only complaint was our room was way too small, but not sure of all rooms. 
21626 Very nice rooms at a great location in NY. Price is a value for Manhattan. 
21627 Found this place on booking.com, very pleased when we arrived, hotel is small but clean and welcoming, no more than a ten minute walk from times square. Room was bigger than id expected for New York and At the price couldnt be faulted 
21628 We really enjoyed our stay. The staff was very friendly. You can't beat the location with easy access to the Canal Street Subway stops. 
21629 It was terrible that I called them several times for claiming my lost clothing and charger for DC. They always ignored it by answering that "I will call you back if..." but nothing gonna happen. 
21630 Comfortable hotel as you would expect for it's not cheap. Clean and well maintained but without any soul. The wireless is stupidly expensive and you would think that they'd throw it in for nothing or next to nothing. 
21631 Room was very nice and comfortable. Surprised that there was a charge for the internet. We took the Blue Rail downtown and it would have been nice to have a shuttle. We walked to a Hotel down the street and jumped on their shuttle. Staff was friendly. 
21632 Clran and comfy this hotel is close to n Michigan ave the magnificent mile. Tons of good shopping and restaurant Choices. Rooms Are standard but offer everything one needs 
21633 There were cigarette burns in the blankets and hairs under one of the sheets. The room stinks like smoke. Channel 4 has hardcore porn for some reason? Loud people walking by. I suppose for the price you get what you pay but I'm actually afraid to fall asleep. 
21634 Just opened, very clean, top breakfast, just over a metro station (direct subway to JFK and Brooklyn). Rooms are nice and stylish. 
21635 My daughter and I travelled with my 4 year old grandson to the City for the weekend. I have stayed at this Westin several times and have never been disappointed! The staff is excellent- So helpful and accomodating! The rooms are beautiful and the beds are Heavenly! ;) 
21636 Covered in bites after one night in this hotel. Check-in process was insane, I have never waited so long to check in in my life. Sure the location is great for tourist stuff, but I wouldn't stay here again. Save some extra pennies and find somewhere else. 
21637 This was our first trip to NYC. Wanted to be in the middle of it all. Got a Times Square room and loved every minute of it. The view was spectacular. The View restaurant was wonderful. The bar was great too. Recommend the Almond Joy martini. Will return. 
21638 Perfect hotel! We had booked a room with queen-size bed, but were upgraded to king-size bed. The rooms were very smart decorated, large and very confortable. The service was high and the staff was very nice. We even had free access to a gym in the same block! 
21639 The location is good as it is near subway lines, also good restaurants in walking distance. The complimentary continental breakfast is very fabulous! 
21640 No better spot to stay in the Big Apple. Absolutely smack dab in the middle of everything. Sourrounded by the Theaters and excellent restaurants. If taking a day trip to Atlantic City, the bus terminal is steps away. 
21641 This was a great location for the price. I have stayed several places in New York and found this hotel to be very clean and the staff was wonderful. 
21642 Nice hotel, good location. Rooms small but new and clean. Davide 
21643 I had a very nice experience at this hotel. The beds were great! The hotel staff were very courteous and helpful and the room was very clean. The television was good but did not measure up to the rest of the hotels amenities. I will certainly stay here again. 
21644 I had a great time at the hotel. It is a bit more expensive than other hotels in the area. However there are a lot of things to do close by i.e. Tomes Square, Broadway and good restaurants. 
21645 The hotel was beautiful. The staff was very kind and helpful. The food was delicious. The parking is good. There was not one reason for us to complain. 
21646 We just returned from a long weekend spent in Chicago and stayed at The Avenue. The rooms are small and kind of dark but the location can't be beat. We walked to shopping and restaurants. 
21647 At first we weren't very happy. Huge construction project going on outside and very tiny, not terribly nice rooms, tiny bathrooms down the hall, steep steps, no elevator, a little creepy. However it was very clean and an absolutly wonderful location. 
21648 Kamer was ruim maar slecht onderhouden. Echter hadden wij ook een hele goede aanbieding die we via Expedia hadden geboekt en hebben ons niet al te druk gemaakt over hoe het er uit zag. Je bent er tenslotte voor de stad! 
21649 For what you get it is very good value, great location - one block away from MSG, near Penn station, Macys and in Chelsea which you can roam around. Breakfast was included, no safe in room, but safe deposit box. Rooms are small, but hey it's Manhatten- how cares. 
21650 Stayed here to attend business training in NYC (July 2009) -- wonderful boutique hotel. Loved the amenities, the wine social - and sweet bar! So convenient to Times Square. 
21651 Great location near Central Park, St. Patrick, and the 5 ave. The staff is very professional. The concierge know by every millimeter they city and also encourage you to explore the City like a Local. 
21652 The staff was tremendous and made our trip. The were helpful and polite and arranged everything we asked. The rooms are funky but modern, comfortable, and clean. The food was incredible, and the ambiance of the hotel made our trip one we will never forget. 
21653 HOTEL AU LOOK ET AU CONFORT VIEILLOT, A RECOMMANDER UNIQUEMENT POUR DORMIR (TRES CALME, TRES PROPRE, MAIS CHAMBRES TRES PETITES, PAPIER PEINT HORRIBLE ET COULOIRS TRES SOMBRES). SALLE DE BAINS COMMUNE TRES PROPRE. 
21654 We stayed here for 1 night & found the room & premises to be extremely neat & clean, and such a value! 
21655 Goede prijs-kwaliteit verhouding, goede locatie, goede service. Onze verwarming stond veel te hoog. na een telefoontje naar de balie stond er iemand van maintanance binnen 5 minuten voor onze deur, op zondagavond 22hr! Je mag je bagage opslaan in het hotel mocht je een late vlucht hebben, erg prettig. 
21656 My wife and I stayed there March 21-24. The hall carpets looked as if they hadn't been vacuumed for a month. Same for our room carpet. And, the bedspread wasn't clean. Hotel has a number of things going for it, but for the price-no longer worth it. 
21657 Not a bad hotel, hotel service could have been better. Rooms along the street a bit noisy. Great food and service at the restaurant and bar. 
21658 We popped in for a drink where Dorthea Parker and her gang drank - had the most arrogant waiter - totally ignored us...put a damper on our excitement. 
21659 3 nachten in dit hotel geweest ,kleine kamer maar erg netjes 
21660 Het twee persoons bed aan de kleine kant 
21661 Voor lange mensen geen aanrader. alleen om te slapen goed te doen 
21662 Voor ons perfect ,ook de ligging t.o.v metro en andere bezienswaardigheden ,vriendelijk personeel al met al goed bevallen 
21663 Friendly, helpful staff, awesome rooms, clean, easy on easy off access to IH-10. 
21664 Love this charming little hotel. Have stayed many times and will definitely go back. 
21665 Bem localizado, mas nao compensa a falta de higiene e o pessimo atendimento/servico. 
21666 Heard about a great band playing at Hotel Sorella and was pleasantly surprised with this fresh new concept! Plus Eric Lindell & band was awesome in the Monalisa Lounge. 
21667 goed hotel. standaard kamers zijn niet erg groot. Er wordt veel gebouwd in directe omgeving, let dus op waar je kamer is. Koelkast in kamer maar niet te gebruiken voor eigen spullen; je kunt wel een koelkast huren tegen bijbetaling. Airco maakt nogal veel lawaai. 
21668 Bad service from front desk. Bathrooms were shocking from a hotel of this class! Bedrooms were just above average. Great location. Overall not impressed. Very poor by intercontinentals normal standard 
21669 I was pleasantly surprised during my recent visit to the Hilton Garden Inn. The hotel was very clean, surprisingly quiet at night, and the staff was super helpful. The location is perfect - close to everything. I would definitely stay here again. 
21670 Very Very Poor Staff Service - Slept there but the bar staff put us off the first night out of 6, insead use your money to eat elsewhere. 
21671 Clean rooms, great location (on Rush near the bars & just a block away from the Mile) and fairly priced compared to the other locations in the area. No 5 stars because the hotel rooms are getting a little older but that's about the only critique I have. 
21672 Overall the New Yorker was a great choice. Very central location, near to all the popular tourist spots. Very friendly staff. Only downside was a small room, however it was adequate for what we needed. Would definitely stay again 
21673 I didn't really have any problems with the hotel during my stay. However, when I returned, despite having paid the bill through Expedia, the hotel charged an additional 664 dollars to my credit card instead of 8 dollars for phone calls. 
21674 Me gustan los hoteles mas modernos, pero era bonito 
21675 The location was great, between 5th and 6th on 46th street. A good breakfast with a nice eating area, parking discounts arranged with local garages. I felt that the value at this hotel was excellent for the area and I would definitly return, and highly recommend to friends. 
21676 The DaVinci Hotel is still NYC's best secret!. I love this hotel, its location and staff. There just isn't a better place to stay in the city. I recommend it to many people and they are most thankful. Wonderful place. 
21677 This was our 3rd Spring Break stay at The London NYC and it was another great visit. The service, location and cleanliness are all excellent and we will definitely be back. 
21678 Hotel was older and not glamorous but was clean and an excellent bargain. Couldn't ask for a better place to stay for the price with such a great location. 
21679 spent 5 great nights at the westin 23rd-28th march. lovely hotel, had a corner room on the 28th floor with a spectacular view, the heavenly bed and shower were amazing. lovely and clean. the concierges were really helpful and very friendly. thoroughly recommend this hotel 
21680 great location, thats it. old and slow elevators, rooms need to be updated 
21681 I have stayed here several times for business and pleasure. While the rooms are smaller they are more then adeqaute to 1-2 people. The rooms are clean and beds comfortable. The bathrooms are a pleasent surprise be cause they are spacious and have good showers. 
21682 Our corner room, although small, had a direct view over the Empire state building and the Hudson river. It was a very cozy room also. The staff are helpful. Breakfast at the Tick Tock restaurant was ample and delicious. The location is great, near to everything. 
21683 Location of this hotel is not too bad. Walking distance of Willis (Sears) Tower. However, the service given by the associates is not the best. Some were friendly but most just didn't "get" it. 
21684 Very comfortable, very quiet. Great Service. We had 2 double beds for 2 adults and a 10 & 7 year old and we had a good amount of room. $245+tax for a Sat night city view. Only problem was the distance to uptown. Very close to Ferries. 
21685 Excellent place to stay. Make sure you ask for a goldfish upon checkin. The lobby bar is fabulous, but don't visit before 1AM. :) 
21686 Staying at this hotel made our NYC stop-over just perfect. Great staff - very international - the concierge gave us some lovely tips for our trip to Paris, France. The breakfast buffet is totally worth getting up for!!! 
21687 loved this hotel. the staff even upgraded us to a suite for free. beautiful and you really feel like you're in Europe. Great to just sit and relax with a glass of wine. Great location and i really felt special being here. 
21688 Awesome hotel. Excellent service, beautiful view and the Tapas restaurant is amazing. 
21689 I was looking for a clean safe place for a couple of nights. red roof fit the bill. The building is aging, the room is in need of fixing but it was priced just right. Would stay again. 
21690 This was a nice clean hotel. The desk staff was very nice. We only stayed one night. The room was clean. We had a room with two double beds. I would stay here again. 
21691 I stayed here over the weekend as I was in town for a friend's wedding. I stayed in one of the hotel's new rooms. It was nice, clean and spacious. I had a chance to go to the American Museum of Natural History as it was just down the street. 
21692 My husband and I just stayed here for 3 nights and it was wonderful! The room was clean, the bed was comfortable, the staff extremely helpful, and the location can't be beat! I recommend this hotel to anyone. 
21693 Very nice rooms, tidy and clean. Decent sized room with a great view. Helpfull staff, and a safe neighbourhood. Will defenitly choose this hotel next time I visit NY. Nearby everything in midtown, downtown. I recommend this for everyone who is visiting NY:) 
21694 Just what we expected. A decent hotel a couple of blocks from Times Square. Basic, but clean rooms with wifi and a hot breakfast included. Would definitely recommend at a good rate. Only real issue was slow elevators! Friendly, courteous staff 
21695 This hotel is by far the very best valve in NYC. The rooms are very clean and although a bit small (king) they are very attractive and cozy. The staff members are courteous and efficient seeing to your every comfort. I would not hesitate to stay here again. 
21696 Good city hotel. The room was small but clean and comfortable. Perfect location: near Penn Station and the Empire State Building. Free coffe and biscuits. Negative things: one of the employees at the front desk was quite rude, the rest were nice and helpful. 
21697 Quick review - NO bed bugs, long wait to check in, location CAN NOT BE BEAT, rooms are good size, good security, fine breakfast. Worth the stay. 
21698 Just awesome. Great location, good room, tasty breakfast and invisible staff. Could anyone ask for more? :-) 
21699 Great hotel. excellect location, very clean, modern and well organized room! Very helpful staff. Freindly and quick assistance. A great way to spend out vacation. Will want to come back again for sure. 
21700 Very comfortable, upscale hotel in a very civilized part of Manhattan. The staff is alway's very accommading from the doorman to the front desk to the reservations manager Scott Calderon. I'm a former New Yorker and I alway's feel right at home staying at On The Ave. 
21701 I spent a few nights at Off Soho Suites and it was very comfortable and located in a convenient area for walking to many places. I also had a kitchen in my room, which made my trip cheaper because I didn't have to go out for food. 
21702 I always stay at this hotel if possible when I visit Houston. The colors, food, staff, and rooms make it well worth it! 
21703 Hotel perfetto, pulito e silenzioso per la famiglia e il nonno. Camere pulite servizio preciso e puntuale. 
21704 El hotel era muy accesible para ir en coche a los centros comerciales, el reliant stadium. Muy comodas las habitaciones!!! Dormimos espectacular luego de un largo dia de shopping. La presion del agua de la ducha era increible. Definitivamente me volveria a quedar aca al regresar a Houston. 
21705 It's purely a business hotel. Best thing about this hotel is that it's in Manhattan...but I feel Brooklyn is the place to stay if you are vacationing. The close by cafes are very good for breakfast. Also close to the Grand Central station...walking distance from times square... 
21706 We have stayed here many times and have never been dissatisfied. We do prefer the standard side over the upgrade side. Great location, within walking distance to all Times Square attractions. 
21707 Delightful hotel, fairly spacious and very clean. Cannot get better value than this, right in the heart of NYC. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Pros: Excellent location, friendly staff, clean and spacious, free wi-fi, comfortable bed, affordable Cons: Nil 
21708 Zoals anderen merkten ook wij dat slechts 1 van de 2 liften kon worden gebruikt 
21709 De draadloze internetverbinding was te zwak en de receptionist wist niets anders te bedenken dan het telefoonnummer van een hulplijn te geven! Lokatie prima. Er wordt opgeknapt. 
21710 Hotel bellissimo. Si trova al centro di NY. A pochi passi si trova la Central Station dove potete prendere treni e Metropolitana. Camminando a piedi si possono raggiungere tutti i posti. Stanze Splendide e grandi. Pulizia ottima. Bagni grandi. Eccellente 
21711 Sumptuous decor. Staff is really nice. Rooms are tight as you'd expect in NYC but well appointed. I like it. It's a wonderful quiet oasis compared to the chaos outside in NYC! 
21712 Bathroom extremely small... 3 bulbs were out in my room.... lots of lights come through the door at night.... can hear all the noises from the hallway.... Internet and phone system was done for many hours... 
21713 I loved the location of this hotel - across the street from Carnegie Hall, 2 blocks from Central Park, 4 blocks from Times Square! The rooms were small but nice. The only disappointment was no views! For the price, however it was great. 
21714 If you are visiting the 9/11 memorial or want to see Wall St., this location is perfect. It's a short walk from both and only 2 minutes from Broadway. The staff was polite and the rooms were comfortable. 
21715 Great hotel, very modern. The room was very comfortable with a great shower (dual shower heads!! loved it). Wonderful view from the 27th floor and totally silent at night. The noise from the elevator was a bit annoying at first (we were right next to the elevator). 
21716 This is now my first choice of hotel when I visit NYC. Service is superb, cleaning of the rooms is spotless (which I have only see once in my hotel stays before). Rooms are very spacious, prices are reasonable, and the location was perfect for us. 
21717 The service was above and beyond. Especially Gabril (not sure of spelling) at check in desk who helped us get a larger room with two beds. It was greatly appreciated. 
21718 Given the price everything about the hotel and neighborhood exceeded expectations. The staff were helpful, the room on the second floor was clean and adequate. The restaurant next door was inepexsive for breakfast. Public transportation was steps away from the hotel. 
21719 very good hotel. friendly, efficient staff. i would return. 
21720 I was there for theatre. I could walk to most shows (7-15 blocks). Hotel was decent. The only problem was the shortage of elevators. They only have two and its not enough for a hotel of that size. Be prepared to wait for an elevator. 
21721 Got a room on 35th floor with a nice view of Empire state building just outside the window!! Good breakfast resturant called Tick Tock diner just on the corner. Close walk to time square, broadway theatres etc. I really recommend this hotel! 
21722 The room was quite big, by New York standards. The bathroom was nice and clean, though by no means new. The bed was comfortable and the linens were really high-quality. We were pleased with the service as well. 
21723 Complete lack of interest in regard to property in room. Item reported missing and no action taken by staff. Marriott have taken no responsibility for their negligence. $300 item of clothing went missing without a trace! 
21724 the most disrespectful stuffs i ever meet ,they must be tired of the place the place is very dirty 2 please dont stay at this place find you a better place near by with the same amount of money 
21725 Classic Hilton Garden Inn decor, but a great view. I was on 17 so ask for a room above 15. I also liked that their restaurant was the Weber Grill - you know, like the BBQ. Good for breakfast, lunch & dinner. 
21726 I like the dark decoration in the room, kinda modern & trendy style. I also like the breakfast in hotel. 
21727 Thank You for making me feel right at home It was nice to see familiar faces from my earlier trips and stays at this hotel. It was nice to see people that enjoy their work and are so very friendly to the customers they help. 21 
21728 2 friends and i just returned on saturday the 8th from New York, The Hotel staff were friendly and helpful, The room was large and spacious and extremely clean. Fabulous Location! Bloomies just down the street. 
21729 The location was fantastic and the other attributes of the hotel were very good, too. I would stay there again! 
21730 The Beekman Towers is the perfect place for families. The suites are spacious and clean, the staff was friendly, enthusiastic, and very responsive to all our needs. It was a great value for the dollar. A perfect place to unwind at the end of the day! 
21731 Came back to the Interconti to do some early Christmas shopping. Can't beat the location. Staff always friendly and helpful! Love the pool too. Brings you back to the 20's. Got a massage this time. Ona was very professional. 
21732 The customer service, cleanliness, aesthetic and amenities were awesome! I especially enjoyed and got the most value from the one on one personal training session with Sam at the Westin Spa. He was very professional and gave thorough advice and training instruction. 
21733 Easy to find. Staff was pleasant with us, but told the couple before us that they did not accept AAA. We found this odd, because we had a AAA discount. 
21734 Very good and clean room, my NYC hotel of choice, convienient location, across the etreet from Penn Station, great bar with great bartenders, easy to check in & check out. What more can you expect ! I will be back again and again. 
21735 its a great place especially for younger travellers, about 10 min from times square and the un, in every room theres a docking station for ipods, nice and helpful staff, great people 
21736 Lovely welcome from shuttle driver and manager. Comfortable room, spacious and clean. Great overnight stop. 
21737 I liked the atmosphere in this hotel. Much different then midtown hotels I saw before. Room was quite big for NY. Stuff was OK but not extremely friendly. 
21738 Travelled alone to Chicago for a meeting off Wacker. Stayed here 2 nites and loved it. Well appointed small rooms and great service. Do not bring a family her but you can't go wrong if you are alone or a couple! 
21739 Mooi hotel, in 2008 opengegaan. Het personeel is erg relaxed en helpen je graag met alles wat je maar wilt. Als ik weer naar New york zou gaan zal ik hier zeker weer overnachten. Midden in Manhattan met Madison Square Garden en de Empire State Building om de hoek. 
21740 Ok the entrance is beautiful the staff is professional the place is very clean and well run. The room is large and comfortable with a king size bed. Unfortunately people may have smoked in this room but the ac helps to keep air moving. Probably worth the price. 
21741 This was our third visit to the Doubletree Times Square. We are always very happy and plan to stay here many more times. The rooms are clean and the staff is friendly. The location can't be beat. This is one of our favorite hotels. 
21742 We really enjoyed our stay. Great location. 
21743 For a big city, downtown hotel the rooms and bathrooms were spacious. The concierge was prompt and helpful, as we're all the service people. Would happily stay there again. 
21744 Nice surprise. On 42nd Street. Times square is at your feet. Enter from the street and take an elevator up 20 floors to the modern minimalistic lobby. Friendly, but not pushy staff. Great furnishing with unique local art in the room. Great views of the city. 
21745 Great location 1/2 block from Times Square. Great breakfast restaurants nearby. Hotel staff was nice and very accomodating. Small, quaint lobby and hotel, but rooms were nice and beds were comfortable. 
21746 Like the concept - small clean rooms - imagine being inside an ipod (just bigger). Location is awesome. I will stay there again. 
21747 great location.not enough facilities in the room, no body lotion, no coffee every day ,dirty in the halls etc. not good for a chain that sells themselves as luxury and confort. 
21748 Our 3 night stay was just wonderful. Staff from front desk to cleaners were helpful, polite and friendly. Excellent location in midtown Manhattan.Next trip to New York will stay here again. 
21749 Great location, close to time square, but on a side street that is relatively quiet. Nice room. Very pleasant and helpful staff. Free internet a bonus. 
21750 We really enjoyed our stay at the Excelsior Hotel in NYC. The location is excellent. Nice views of the park on 81st St. Close to many museums. Very friendly, helpful staff. Well maintained facilities. 
21751 The rooms are very small and strangle ,no way to open window,the room face to building in construction and have noise all day from 6:30 AM also in Saturday! 
21752 Staff was very helpful. The location is right in the middle of everything. Our room was clean and quiet. I'd stay here again. 
21753 Value is actually below a 1 Bathrooms are from the 70's Rules and regulations are from the 20's. No denim allowed in lobby sothey escort you to a side valet entrance. Cleanliness is less than par. Where is a Hilton when you need one. I will not be back. 
21754 Great location centre of everything, rooms aren't as small as we were expecting from reviews! Stayed for three nights perfect base for sightseeing! Next to time square, fifth avenue broadway, subways everything great stay and booked well in advance so got a great rate! 
21755 Only two blocks from Grand Central Station, very reasonably priced. A baby crib was promptly delivered to our room on request. The bathtub was awesome, and the hotel's soaps & shampoos are very nice. We will certainly be staying at the Bedford again! 
21756 I couldn't have had a worse experience staying at the Sofitel. I was unimpressed by the curt and inept hotel employees who made my hotel stay unbearable. I would NOT recommend this hotel to anyone. 
21757 love the convenience of your hotel to Broadway theaters & restaurants, but the staff makes sure we are treated well, & that's a big plus. 
21758 posizione strategica per lo shopping e le visite ai musei, di fronte a Central Park e a 5 minuti dalla Fifht Avenue., Moma, Brodway. hotel abbastanza vecchio, hall buia e non molto accogliente. non esiste collegamento wi fi se non a pagameneto. camera grande per lo standard di new york. 
21759 New York hotels generally suck. Tiny rooms for the price, way too much comotion and noise coming from outside and inside the hotel. Le Parker Meridien is different, It's an oasis. I look forward to a few minutes away from the chaos. 
21760 Large room with kitchen, close to Watertower place, great breakfast. couldn't get any better. $10 cab ride to Macy's and Daley Plaza for 4 people 
21761 all was good, liked the blue lighting under the bed for a night light...would like something for breakfast with out going out 
21762 Affinia Manhattan is the best hotel I stayed in NYC. The service is first class, rooms are spacious and the kitchen and office were a nice surprise. I will be coming back. 
21763 Awesome Hotel. Purchased a package over the Thanksgiving/BlackFriday long weekend on Bookingit.com. The price was a great deal which included Breakfast & Entrance to in house Jazz (which was also great). The Beds were great, Great location on Park Ave, Very clean and quiet. Would recommend this location. 
21764 The hotel was great. the room very nice and clean. The location is good near all the attractions. You can go by foot to every places 
21765 Can't get a better deal in manhattan. The rooms are adequate, small and can get noisy, but are fine. This is a great way to stay in the city without paying exorbitant rates. 
21766 We liked the hotel and would recommend it. It was a very covenient location and the room was a good size and very clean and comfortable. However, at times we were a bit cold and the water in the evenings wasn't very hot. 
21767 Enjoyed my stay at the Westin. All amenities one could want are here and we enjoyed a beautiful view of the Chicago River from our room. The staff , both front-desk and concierge, were very helpful and I would stay in this hotel again. 
21768 Walking distance to the theatre district, 5th Avenue shopping, Times Square. Updated small room with everything you need. Desk & free wifi. No fancy lobby or restaurant. But 10 places to eat within 5 minutes walk from the front door. Pleasant, efficient, helpful staff. Reasonable price for the city. 
21769 Limpeza, de 2 em 2 dias e cheiro de mofo. Conforto baixo, aquecedor funciona mas nao adequadamente, se necessitar, solicite cobertores na recepcao. Localizacao - Fantastica ! So ela ja vale a pena, e os outros problemas sao insignificantes. Voltarei la, sem duvida. 
21770 Absolutely a GREAT time!!! The hotel was clean and neat and the employees were VERY accomodating!!! we LOVED the hotel and service and will be staying here again the next time we visit NYC!! Thank you! 
21771 Have just got back from a 6 night stay at 70 Park Avenue. A great experience, lovely rooms, incredibly helpful staff, excellent location. 
21772 Nice staff, elegant, hype, very good restaurant, though the room would be better off without the surrounding music. Comfortable, though not very spacious rooms. A spot to visit in Manhattan. If not a guest, at least go for a drink at the excellent bar, or for a wonderful dining experience. 
21773 No se podia estar mejor ubicado al lado de time square (maravilloso). La relacion calidad-precio perfecta, volveriamos sin dudarlo.. 
21774 From the second we arrived we were treated like lost family, the hostel was clean, comfortable and the staff was great...... We will be back 
21775 This hotel was booked by my company, evidently they went by alphabetical order when looking for a hotel. Older hotel, our room had dirty carpet...I made sure I had shoes on when walking around the room. There are much better hotels near Hobby Airport. 
21776 Great hotel in hip and real NYC -- great rooms and great location, a true classic with modern amenities. One of those places to see and be seen without being pretentious at all. As I said, totally real 
21777 my family & stayed here on an overnight trip to new york! great location...very close to time square! the hotel though is not very clean. probably would not be staying here again. 
21778 This hotel was not $350 like the one review said. It was very economical--room is small but clean and comfortable. So close to both Penn Square Station and Port Authority. Great variety of breakfast foods. Highly recommend. 
21779 this is a very nice place to stay...location is great, pool is nice plus...staff is excellent 
21780 Hotel proprio dietro Time Square sulla 42esima. hotel moderno, personale giovane. La stanza un po' piccola ma molto pulita e con arredo di tendenza. La vista della nostra stanza era verso il cortile interno quindi niente di che. bagno piccolo ma pulito. 
21781 Great staff, great room, great location. I always choose Le Parker Meridien when I am in the City. 
21782 Reasonably priced, friendly staff. Rooms are not luxe by any means and amneties are limited but location is excellent for those seeking proximity to midtown and GCS. 
21783 Es perfecto para ir a conocer New york en familia, a 2 bloques de time square y lejos del bullicio. Limpio, comodo y la atencion es estupenda. Demoraron en darnos la habitacion y por eso nos compensaron con 4 desayunos de cortesia. 
21784 The service and atmosphere at this elegant hotel are unparalleled in my opinion. It was like being in a small southern town in the midst of NYC. A refreshing alternative and well worth a litlle extra from the budget. Be sure and visit the rooftop bar for an amazing experience. 
21785 Nice hotel, near to all attractions and good restaurants in Manhattan. Rooms clean are very comfortable w/frig,microwave and coffee maker. Breakfast was included in our price and was good. We enjoy our stay and will look forThe Belvedere in our next trip to N.Y. 
21786 The location is really great. Rooms are large and nice. Close to subway station. Friendly staff. Excellent value. You can find cheaper parking close by. 
21787 Well located, good value for the price. I had no problems, room was clean and comfortable. I will absolutely stay in this hotel next time I am in N.Y.C. 
21788 Stayed here on bumsiness for one night. Great bedroom, good service from concierge longe and reception staff. Would stay here again if in New York. 
21789 small trendy hotel with a nice feel to it..very comfortable beds, nice marble bath, contemporary /warm, not to far over the top. perfect mid town location. We had a second floor room and had no problem sleeping. nice staff..perfect for our needs. 
21790 We were pleasantly surprised at how nice the place was. It was most importantly very clean. The room had 10 foot ceilings and the decor was top notch. The free breakfast was good and very convenient. We will definatley stay again when we come that way. 
21791 We stayed for one evening in the hotel in the club level. We really enjoyed the extra large room and club lounge. The location was right on the river and we were blocks from Michigan Ave and other restaurants. They are updating the hotel, but we enjoyed our stay. 
21792 Wonderful property with a gorgeous room with impeccable service. Great location and very friendly and helpful staff. 
21793 Loved the WJ - what a great little hotel! Good food, good rooms, great staff, and an exceptional location. I will definitely be back!! 
21794 Great Hotel, with a very good location. Close to everything, and not too noisy. Rooms are good, The bed is very confortable. And they give you free coffee :) The staff is just about the best! 
21795 Extremely friendly staff is the first impression. After that - clean, modern rooms (albiet NY sized), fantastic location. 
21796 -Too close to everything, close to the metro, perfect location -Cheap -Clean enough and good service when we wanted something -Too much noise and cold coming through the windows -Uncomfortable and noisy beds It's a good and cheap solution in NY!! 
21797 I have been stay in this hotel for many times.. The service of this hotel was good, but the cleanliness need more improvement. The variety of the food was good, I will choose to stay in this hotel again.. 
21798 Expensive but my favorite NYC hotel.The staff makes a nobody feel like a somebody without being pretentious.Too bad the health inspector made them put a leash on Matilda, the hotel cat. Next time I want to see the cabaret act in the Oak Room. 
21799 Affinia Manhattan was totally fabulous! I will return! Big rooms, great kitchen in it by the way, lovely staff, perfect location - everything was perfect! 
21800 Reasonable for NYC and close to the Javits Center nd Times Square... 
21801 I enjoyed my stay at the Westin Oaks. The rooms were large and the staff was friendly and helpful. The biggest down side was the charge for Internet service. Most hotels offer complimentary Internet. Also there was no access to a microwave on the premises. Overall, we enjoyed our stay. 
21802 Wonderful accomodating staff at front desk, Spotless clean great area 
21803 This is a terrific hotel. The staff is great. They could not have been more helpful or polite. The food in the pub was also good. We had a double room which was quite spacious. The location can't be beat. We will stay here again on our next visit. 
21804 Good facilities, decent rooms, however, I left my wallet in the hotel room accidentally when checking out and when I went back later they claimed the couldn't find it. I think someone dishonest on the staff took the cash and tossed the rest. Very disappointing at a high quality chain. 
21805 This hotel has a great location - near most everything and easy access to transportation and shopping. Very clean - excellent service with real desire to make sure everything is perfect. this is first time staying in this Hilton property and I definately recommend and will be back! 
21806 Beautiful hotel! We had a great weekend stay here. Awesome staff and great location. Room was beautifully designed and very spacious. Huge for right in the city. This is our new favorite hotel and we'll definitely be back! 
21807 pros: - great position - close to underground, bookstore, theatres - clean rooms - free wifi - no moquettue - quite close to central park (10min by walk) cons: - very very small rooms - very very small bathroom - hot water quite slow 
21808 Very central hotel (just a few blocks from Times Square). Room was as described and very clean. Staff very helpful. Very good shower. Security safe complimentary. 
21809 My fiance and I loved this hotel. The bellmen and front desk were extremely nice and courteous. We loved the decor of the hotel and our room (which was small, but it's NYC, what do you expect?). Great in-room amenities. Will definitely stay there again. 
21810 Niet meer dan een gemiddeld hotel waar niet meer dan het hoognodige aan wordt onderhouden. Kamers zijn prima geschikt om de nacht door te brengen, niet om langdurig te verblijven. 
21811 Excellent service. They exceeded my expectations! Staff is very friendly! This hotel is all about customer service, and you come first! I got a suite upgrade. Excellent room. Anything I needed staff was able to help. Great concierge! 
21812 My Girlfriend & I stayed here for a romantic weekend. The hotel staff was very attentive to make sure we didnt want for anything. 
21813 First time in NY, location was the best. Will definately stay there on my next visit. 
21814 i like it! 
21815 It's a hip little place, attentive team, bar and perfect location at a great price! Shops across the street, Starbucks next store and friendly helpful staff always available. Check out Dizzy's Jazz on the 5 th floor in Colbus Circle and run the park and reservoir on Sunday morning! 
21816 We had a wonderful time - close to Macys and Penn Station - can walk almost anywhere And breakfast was great! 
21817 We stayed here for 3 nights for my husbands 40th birthday. The staff could not have been more helpful and friendly. Lovely room with champagne and a great view. Great location, many thanks 
21818 Stayed here with a layover....Why else would you stay in this part of Houston? There are limited options in the area for an overnight stay and even fewer for dining. We ate in the lobby bar. It was suffice. Nice people; hotel served the purpose. Shuttle worked fine. 
21819 Great staff. Great views. Great rates. Great location. Will stay here again. The staff went above and beyond and the room was better than perfect. Heard no construction noise inside the hotel and room. 
21820 Stayed here for 4 nights - hotel was brilliant, slap bang in the middle of upper west side. Loads locally and only a 10 minute walk from central park. Good diners and eateries nearby - would definitely go back. Staff were friendly and extremely helpful Just grand! 
21821 Everything was outstanding. Loved having a Keurig coffee maker in the room. Would love to stay here again! It was not inexpensive but worth it. Beautifully decorated too. With a wonderful restaurant attached. 
21822 Mooi hotel, receptie is op de begane grond, de kamers vanaf de 30e verdieping. Ruime kamer met fantastisch uitzicht op Empire State Building en Chrysler Building. Ongeveer 15 minuten lopen naar metrostation. 
21823 Great staff are not just found they are developed and this hotel has great staff. Rooms are good but beds are really hard. If I had one suggestion it would be to offer some rooms with foam beds or sleep number beds. 
21824 Charming hotel in a great neighborhood, close to Central Park and the subway. 
21825 I booked affinia 50, for a business trip to NYC. My room was comfortable, my bed was excellent, but the customer service I receieved was horrible. That alone has assisted me in never staying here again. 
21826 Room sure is small. The best thing about this hotel is private bath. Wifi did not work at all during my two nights stay. Also, the hallway is very narrow. Room is clean. The hotel is about two blocks from subway, two blocks from central park. 
21827 Extremly good vbalue for money...good breakfast and very courteous staff 
21828 Hotel fantastico nel cuore di new york.... Lo consiglio a tutti.... A pochi minuti a piedi da central park, 5th avenue, time squadre e Broadway....... Ottima pulizia, personale molto professionale e simpatico..... 
21829 We were in Manhattan during Hurricane Sandy and the hotel not only had power, but went overboard to make sure our stay was comfortable. Would go back to this hotel anytime we are visiting New York (we live in Florida.) Staff was great, especially Tito at the front desk. 
21830 Motel was fine-dinner next door was great-One and only problem was difficult to locate and get in & out of.Must be a lot of either rd construction or something. Stayed other Wyndham facilities as nice or better for less money. 
21831 Hotel was in a great location. The room was small, but very clean and comfortable. The bed and linens were very comfortable - the bathroom was great. Room was quiet. Overall a great place. 
21832 My husband and I just spent the weekend in NY. We wanted a convenient inexpensive place to stay. Is that possible in NY? Yes it is - the Hotel Penn right across the street from the LIRR. (We live on Long Island). 
21833 I had a wonderful stay at the Hilton Time Square! The hotel staff was wonderful and the room was just to my liking. The location was perfect, it was close to everything worth seeing in NYC. I would totally stay there again on my next visit to the big apple! 
21834 Estuvimos en marzo 2009 5 noches y nos parecio expectacular. La ubicacion perfecta en pleno Times Square, habitacion planta 27 en esquina con vistas impresionantes, super bien equipada, con la mejor cama que jamas he tenido en un hotel. Todo excepcional. 
21835 Way too expensive for what's offered. Small rooms and bathrooms. No wifi-really? Will not stay here again 
21836 disappointing - bit tired. service at check in poor. uninterested. room was actually a decent size for nyc. downstairs bar and breakfast room dark and expensive. need try harder hilton 
21837 Nice place for the price. Convenient location. Breakfast, however, was lacking. It didn't look fresh. 
21838 Holiday Inn advertised, through hotels.com complimentary breakfast, and we paid extra to have that - instead we got 20$ off coupon. We took it up to the management - to no avail. No one cared. Rude staff barely speaks english - this is a very unpleasant place to stay. 
21839 Direkt am Empire State Building gelegen. Kleine Zimmer, sehr sauber, freundliches Personal. Starbucks im Haus. 
21840 Clean, affordable, well located in mid-town, service is professional and polite. The rooms are adequate in size and updated nicely. We will return to the Shelburne Murray Hill. 
21841 We stayed at the Palmer House for the Chicago Triathalon. Perfect location Just blocks from the lake. Staff was very friendly and let us have a late check out. Also, loved Starbucks downstairs and Miller's Pub next door. 
21842 Disgusting, terrible, very bad. My family and I went to this hotel I sincerely would not let my dog live in such condition. The room stink, the walls are filthy, the carpet is very dirty, words cannot describe how bad this place is 
21843 I stayed here in the beginning of June and everything from start to finish was great. The staff was accomodating and the wine hour was delightful. I'm staying here again this weekend and couldn't be more excited. Hotel is 2 blocks frfom Penn Station and central to everything. 
21844 Nice size suites right on Time Square. Great service; thanks Benny for the friendliness and taking care of my family at breakfast. 
21845 Hotel needs an update. I e-mailed the H.O. when we got back but they did not even acknowledge. 
21846 The hotel is good. Location is great, parking available, which is terrific. Lounge/restaurant part of hotel, which is a great plus. The rooms are just ok. They need to be remodeled. Seem old. Everyone was very helpful and friendly at the hotel. 
21847 You'll love this hotel if your house is dirty and your 100 yrs old!!. 
21848 Hotel has prime location in Manhattan. Room was large, clean, and bed was very comfortable. Hotel appears to have updated lobby and common areas. Wished I could have stayed longer! 
21849 The rooms are ok - pretty dark though. The fitness center upgrade is nice! There aren't many hotels in the central loop area and the location of the Westin is close enough to the business districts and lots of river north restaurants/shops, which is great. 
21850 I could not be more pleased with this Hotel. They are always friendly and very accomodating. 
21851 This is a basic hotel with everything someone might need. It's not plush or fancy accommodations but is clean, spacious, quiet, well maintained and definitely worth the cost. 
21852 the ideal base for holiday. tour buses across from hotel near all the shops staff friendly food good in ginger resturant on 5 floor shows on doorstep an a mcdonalds would stay again we were on 33rd floor no noise 
21853 Our double room was very small, no comlimentary drinks tray, had to go down to Starbucks for a coffee. The room was very tired and needed an improvement. The bar was very expensive, didn't bother with the restaurant, found a nice Irish pub round the back. 
21854 Right on target for the price. All the comforts, ease of cheek in and out and a great staff. Definitely worth another visit. 
21855 if you stay there you will be spoiled in that hotel... very good service and nice clean perfekt rooms.... please stay there if you have a short trip in NY very close to 5 th Ave and Empire Staate Builing close to verything for the subway is so close 
21856 Grande location ; Time Square. Albergo tipico business con grandi stanze. PAlestra con vista su Times Square All'ultimo piano ristorante girevole con vista mozzafiato su Manhattan Con buon anticipo si trovano stanze a prezzi ragionevoli per NYC (230 US$) 
21857 Located across from Penn Station, so easy for us after we left Amtrak. Friendly service, thanks Maureen and Rosalynn! Everything is so close, hotel was spotless, cleaning staff is very friendly and thorough, my family had four wonderful days there and we expect to return this summer! 
21858 A beautiful hotel, fantastic location over looking Central Park. They made us feel very special, even upgraded us as it was my birthday, and sent up champagne! Little touches like always addressing you by name, add up. It's the Ritz-Carlton, you know how good it's going to be! 
21859 This is a very large, hotel, with endless crowds and lines. The staff tries to get the job done, but during our stay there were just too many people to get checked in timely, get a cab, get luggage out of valet. Rooms nice, but smallish. 
21860 The hotel is OK and it's not a 4 star as they claim. At best, it's a three star. Mold in the shower grout, missing floor molding, etc. Great location, at best $150 a night hotel. 
21861 I was traveling alone and the employees went out of their way to be helpful. Rooms are spacious well equipped w amenities. I would highly recommend this hotel.. 
21862 The Soho Grand Hotel deserves its four star rating. The accommodations were first class. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Even our eleven and thirteen year old boys were impressed. We could not have enjoyed our overnight trip to Manhattan more. 
21863 Will definitely stay in the future. We loved the pool, spa, fitness center, room, everything about hotel. Excellent and extremely friendly staff. Can't wait to go back. 
21864 This was our first visit to NYC and we couldn't have picked a better hotel to stay in. Excellent location, brilliant service and great value. Rooms very comfortable and clean. Highly recommend this hotel!! 
21865 This is a dirty hotel in a bad location. The rrooms are dirty and the service is bad. the Chinese man at the receptionist is angry. 
21866 Highly recommended! Clean and extremely roomy! We would stay here again! We were able to walk to every local we needed: ie, TImes Square, the theatre. Very good price---use AAA discount! 
21867 Very good location for this hotel with nice room with good size. The bathrooms are also nice although the water was not very hot and you had to wait for 5 minutes before the water would get hot. Also there is no mini bar in the rooms. 
21868 Very elegant with excellent service. Great location near the South Shore railroad station and the Metra as well as one block from Michigan Avenue. Very clean and well maintained. 
21869 Very chic hotel with impressive lobby and bar area. Rooms are clean, but very small, can hardly walk around the bed. Only shower en-suite. Pleasant but you are certainly paying for the location as opposed to the accommodation. 
21870 Recently stayed at the Affinia Dumont and the staff was very friendly and attentive. Good midtown location. 
21871 I thought this hotel was great. We had a corner room on the 34th floor and the view was amazing. The room was also very clean and quiet. The bed was large and comfortable and the staff was very friendly and helpful. I also loved the location. 
21872 Location, location, location! Walked everywhere! Felt safe! Hotel is very clean and comfy. Will definitely be back! And will definitely recommend to anyone! 
21873 went to NY for honeymoon. stayed at this hotel. very nice hotel. not much food restaurants around though. will stay there again. 
21874 Very historic hotel (look for it in The Fugitive). Nice facilities. A litle far from Magnificent Mile, but close to Aquaruim and Museums. Definitely worth visiting 
21875 Enjoyed the hotel. Rooms were very clean and modern. Beautiful views from the floor we were on. Staff was helpful. Only thing we didn't love was the elevators... very narrow! Would stay again in a minute! 
21876 The hotel has very good serevice and a very friendly employees. The rooms are very clean but a renovation might benecessary, a lot of little things look run-down and lower the good impression. It has a second cooler for own beverages. The internet connection was not fast. 
21877 Rooms are tiny. Front door closed. Jack hammering at 6:30 to replace sidewalk. TV sketchy trying to watch ballgame absolutely NO reason to return. 
21878 The rooms are very very small, but the room as well as the bathroom were clean. The complimentary breakfast was very good and allowed to save a few bucks every morning. The location really is awesome : 5 minutes from Times Squarre and still quiet at night. 
21879 The Waldorf Astoria is a Hilton property which has impeccable service and great accommodations - not to mention the historical presence. We had a wonderful experience and plan to go back in the near future. 
21880 Good location, large room, great bar downstairs. All the staff I spoke to were helpful and pleasant. For a business hotel with a bit more character or a nice hotel for a weekend (romantic or not) I would recommend it. 
21881 geen gratis wifi in dit hotel en per device wordt er aangerekend, ongeacht of je op dezelfde kamer logeert.. uitstekend ontbijt maar aan de duurdere kant.. 28 dollar .. prima ligging in hartje Manhattan ! 
21882 Hotel Blake is a beautiful hotel in an excellent location! The building is historic and fabulous, and the rooms are comfortable, roomy, and quiet. I would absolutely recommend staying here. 
21883 rien a dire, service et chambre parfait, tres bon emplacement 
21884 I liked this hotel very much, we felt at home during our 5 day visiting to NY. Rooms were very spacious, lobby very nice, personnel very friendly (bagboys helped us for NBA tickets) etc. Really, you get a great hotel at a moderate price. 
21885 Second time I stayed here in transit in the last 6 weeks. Yesterday pleasantly surprised with a free upgrade! Have stayed here frequently and not been disappointed. Looking forward to come back and hopefully getting a corner room again. 
21886 Usual standard stay at the Hyatt downtown Houston. Only issue I had is that there is no wired Internet above about floor 22, and my laptop wifi was playing up. They offered to move me though. Overall good hotel, handy for south west downtown. 
21887 We stayed two nights at the Salisbury hotel last April. The hotel is very well located. The room was slightly old but very large (especially for NYC) and had all the necessary facilities. Also a very large and nice breakfast buffet included in the room rate. 
21888 A good place to sleep while you are visiting nyc 
21889 Decent hotel. Very large room (suite) though rough around the edges. Free continental breakfast in the lobby, though it was pretty much a madhouse and hard to find any place to sit. 
21890 Stayed for 1 week at the Hotel Metro, NYC. Could not find a fault with the place, clean and tidy in a good location in NYC. Free wi-fi. Would stay again. 
21891 We stayed here a few months back, just for the weekend. How lucky we were to run into the GM while walking around the area, he was so helpful and sweet, he even gave us a late check out (comp'd!) Amazing staff, very professional. Loved every minute. 
21892 The facade, the pool, the other guests are all a bit scary. If you must stay here, stay in the main building with 3 floors. The rooms are updated and decent, but the smell is old and the over all feel is ghetto fabulous. 
21893 it was good...and i like this hotel...location is very very good...near the times square and 5th avenue...have good staff..also good personals and foods.........this hotel near the all nyc attractions......enjoy 
21894 Handy for Westlake with very friendly pick-up service from Westlake. For those without hire car, the hotel has a bar and restaurant serving nice food. 
21895 Standard W. Very friendly front desk, that never makes you wait. Free Acura car service around immediate area. Free continental breakfast for gold/ platinum members. 
21896 Great hotel, ideal location and staff very helpful and friendly. The rooms were very clean, beds comfy and towels changed daily. We would definitely stay here again and recommend to our friends and family. 
21897 Tanto el servicio como la ubicacion del hotel son muy buenos! El personal esta siempre a disposicion para atender las necesidades de los huespedes, la limpieza y excelente ubicacion hacen, que de repetir este destino, piense en elegir este hotel nuevamente. Muchas gracias! 
21898 Worst hotel experience and value .. ever. This hotel should be billed as a youth hostel because the comforts and amenities are minimal. Their is no desk in our room and there is no shelf in our bedroom. Definitely not advertised correctly. Truly disappointed. 
21899 Small rooms backing onto brick walls and Indifferent service. 
21900 Stayed here one week in October for business. Staff were friendly and helpful. Good restaurant for breakfast. Room was adequate. Concierge lounge was minimal. Passenger elevators did not work one afternoon and guests were forced to use the freight elevator. Hotel owner needs to spend some money to upgrade. 
21901 Take the pretty crappy room spend your money on food 
21902 Really big hotel, expenditure as a central station. Old-fashioned rooms. Executive lounge with good views but the catering simple and modest. Is not attractive to visit again. 
21903 Good choice if you want to stay in a central location at a cosy place. Friendly staff, rooms not too small, modern equipment but old style interior at the same time. All this at reasonable cost. But as this is a relative small building you won't find a skyscraper view. 
21904 Excellent hotel. Clean nice room and everything worked perfectly (well-maintained). Friendly staff who were very knowledgeable and helpful. Very good breakfast with plenty of fresh food and a good variety. 
21905 This is no doubt convenient to midway. The breakfast buffet left a lot to be desired. The room felt old. The water pressure was non-existent. But then for the area it's in, I'm not sure you are going to find anything better. 
21906 Me parecio un excelente hotel, mucha calidad en los detalles, tanto sabanas, como almohadas y colchones.- La vista desde los pisos altos es espectacular, una postal de NY.- Un hotel divertido para gente joven en una zona muy dinamica.- Volvere.- Es muy recomendable.- 
21907 L'Hotel si trova alle spalle della cattedrale di St.Patrick, ad un isolato dal Rokefeller Center. Praticamente tutti i luoghi principali del centro di Manhattan sono raggiungibili a piedi in 10-15 minuti: Central Park, Times Square, Central Terminal, la zona dei teatri, il MoMA, Morgan Library, ............ 
21908 Nice hotel. Clean, nice room with big flat screen tv. Shared bathroom facilities a good and cheap option. Good location and close to lots of good restaurants/coffee shops. Close to subway too. Recommended! 
21909 Fantastic location, beautiful lobby/bar areas...small but lovely rooms. We would definitely stay here again :-) 
21910 meh... dorm room. you can grab a drink form the mini bar, answer the phone, open the door and take a pee by just spinning around in the same place. Next time I'll take a taxi from the other side of town and sleep in a real hotel room. 
21911 Location is perfect, rooms were large and clean, all staff was very helpful. Security is excellent. We will definitely stay again. 
21912 Great location, and if you like older hotels a great ambience. But... when booking make sure to book a refurbished room. The hotel is mid-facelift meaning some of the rooms look great (see the photos) and some are just small, poky, dark and a bit grubby around the edges (mine). 
21913 El hotel esta, en mi opinion, en la mejor zona de Manhattan, pero las habitaciones son extremadamente chicas! no tenes lugar para caminar, entras y lanzate en la cama o rompete un dedo del pie chocandote con todo! el resto OK, muy caro para los metros cuadrados ofrecidos 
21914 wat iemand ook zegt van dit hotel, de ligging is zo optimaal, midden tussen de 5 en 6 avenue, metro om de hoek en twee straten ten zuiden van central park, kamers ruim, vriendelijk personeel, alleen lift kon wat sneller. 
21915 We stayed July 31-Aug 2 weekend. What a great hotel. Right off Michigan Avenue and connected to Ditka's restaurant (go there). Metro was close, you could walk to the water easily...safe neighborhood. Antonia was the best!! Great employee and very sweet. Really enjoyed our stay...would def. stay there again 
21916 wow for the price.this hotel is Clean and Feels new. It's only a a short walk to times square. A few short blocks from the theaters. The service from the hotel staff is top notch. over all this is a great jewel for NYC. 
21917 Traveling here and there I understand you never know what you're going to get..but WOW..what a lovely place. Yes..is is beautiful, but the service really is wonderful. From the moment we pulled up to the moment we left we were catered to. And the location..amazing. Couldn't recommend The Roosevelt more. 
21918 My room was freshly decorated and clean. The staff was helpful and attentive. I would definately stay there again. BTW, there is a bus that stops in front of the hotel and takes you to the lake and the Lincoln Park Zoo. 
21919 Put up here as a conference I am speaking at is nearby. Street noise, free but too slow Internet, movie that stopped half way through, hallways not air conditioned. Just isn't up to business travel standards. 
21920 Roof top bar was the BOMB on a saturday night! too much fun. didn't matter that we were not in our 20's, had fun and danced! room was clean, nice, modern and just big enough. would definitely go again. 
21921 This was a wonderful hotel in a great location in midtown Manhattan close to all major attractions from Rockefeller Center to Times Square. Matthew was great up front and truly a credit to the place. The one complaint we had was low water pressure in the shower. 
21922 This Hotel is dirty and I don't recommend anybody to waste her/his money on it! 
21923 Great location; safe; clean facilities; excellent, knowledgeable staff. Walking distance to theaters, museums, Central Park and our favorite restaurant - Tony Dinapoli's. Plus, they offer great deals through their website (and honor those deals after booking) Good breakfasts at the Cafe Edison; efficient, fast service; reasonable prices. 
21924 This hotel is in a great corner of Chelsea with a fab cafe across the street and friendly locals. The hotel itself is furnished in ikea esque materials. Very nice bathrooms, but the rooms look dirty. And we stayed when the place was almost new. 
21925 Went for a birthday celebration and love this hotel! Staff friendly...room roomy(by NY standards)...great location...watch out for parking next door...$$$...would recommend no parking or parking elsewhere! 
21926 Largest rooms i have ever stayed in, old fashioned but that's not a problem ! Reception is permanentely busy with check ins and out, so normally a bit of a wait. But all in all great value for the space you get. 
21927 Any where you go, the kimpton hotels are the best, wether its the staff or the rooms its all great! 
21928 This Hilton Garden Inn was similar to all the other Hilton Garden Inns. One standout was the very personable staff at the breakfast buffet. The morning staff was friendly, helpful and very service oriented. (thank you Domingo Martinez). 
21929 I had a very pleasant stay here. Very friendly staff. Newly refurbished hotel. Excellent location. Would recommend 
21930 Hotel 5 minutes walk from Times Square. Big rooms for Manhattan, very clean. Comfortable bed and nice staff. Excellent value for the price, totally recommended. 
21931 hotel in spelendida posizione con metro vicinissima ,ottima pulizia anche se lo stato non e' il massimo. unica vera pecca e' il servizio alla reception, non sono molto ben disposti all'aiuto del cliente. 
21932 Stayed here 1 night. The staff is fantastic. The place appears VERY clean. The rooms are good. The cleaning staff can be loud. Basic pool. The staff really did seem to know a LOT of peoples names. I knew that was a good sign. 
21933 abbiamo trascorso 4 notti in questo hotel a pochi passi dall'Empire State Building in una camera molto spaziosa con angolo cucina, un salotto con tv megaschermo, divano, scrivania, 2 tavolini e nell'altra stanza 2 letti matrimoniali. Hotel pulito, comodo per vicinanza con stazioni della metropolitana 
21934 Very Nice hotel and staff in the heart of the Magnificent Mile; easy walking distance to the John Hancock Building and Contemporary Museum of Art; Rooms are smallish, but clean; we had a great stay and would book at this hotel again. 
21935 I just stayed at the Gild Hall it was a nice hotel well placed for our purpose but I was very surprised there was no free WiFi you would think in today's world it would be just there no questions. 
21936 Lovely old-style, classic, but modern hotel. Just be sure to upgrade to a better room though, otherwise the rooms can be cramped! Wonderful location too! 
21937 Fantastic Hotel. Room is very basic but if its only a place to lay your head at the end of a long exciting day this is the place to stay.Very Clean Very Very helpful staff excellent location,beautiful building. Cannot recommend it enough. Will definatly stay again. 
21938 Very nice cllean bedrooms, air con and free wifi. The pool is small (a spa pool) but very refreshing on a hot day 
21939 Hotel simple avec des chambres assez spacieuse mais avec de la moquette pas toujours hyper propre mais largement bien quand meme 
21940 Piscine et chambre avec vue sur l empire state bulding et tous les bulding du au recul formidable a regarder le soir toute eclairer 
21941 This renovation was brilliant! It was both modern and cozy. Truly inspired! I will definitely stay there again. 
21942 Very good service in all areas not much more i ca add 
21943 Liked the room. Nice as kimptons always are. Noisy outside, comes to the inside. I have stayed here multiple times and will again, just with ear plugs 
21944 Fantastic hotel in an excellent location. Three blocks to times square and in a nice safe neighborhood. We stayed for 7 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. Rooms were great, staff were friendly and super helpful we will most definitely be back! 
21945 This place makes you feel at home...friendly service, rooms neat and clean, make your own breakfast from the fridge, and it has special features for those with medical needs. They care. 
21946 Definitely recommend this hotel. Very helpful and friendly staff. Always a smile to greet you. Clean rooms, excellent housekeeping service. Used the workout room, which was nice. Great location. No complaints. 
21947 Spent two nights there. Great view of the park. Terrific location. The wine bar exceptional. Intimate atmosphere and tasty morsels to go with good wine selection. Excellent service. Roof top pool a nice way to relax after a day of trekking about in the city. Although too many kids. 
21948 We loved this Hotel. Booked the Triple and loved it. The room was pretty big only problem was the step up of about an inch or too into the bath room which i stubbed my toe on. The sheets were not really soft either but the price was right 
21949 THe Westin Galleria was a wonderful hotel to stay in for a conference that I recently attended. The attention to details and customer service were outstanding! I would highly recommend this hotel for business or for pleasure. 
21950 If you're looking for a nice place to stay that is convenient, Sofitel is it. 
21951 Stayed last week with my daughter. Staff were great. Always helpful. Room was terrific. No noise, own kitchen, great views and huge beds. Location was brilliant. Going back November. Thank you Affinia Dumont for a great stay 
21952 Good location, pleasant staff, clean room, shower in bath room could have done with a screen rather than a curtain. Pity that drinks in the adjacent bar/restaurant could not be charged to room. Decent value compared to other hotels in Manhattan 
21953 Pros: - cheap -close to galleria area - beds are comfortable Cons: - Front Desk clerks are for the most part friendly but you have to catch on them on right day - Wireless is awful - towels are rough - some of the hotel neads work ( hallways, etc) 
21954 Stayed for 7 days on the occasion of the OTC. Nice hotel, friendly staff, good value for money. 
21955 Nice hotel with a couple issues. Our room is 1 Queen Bed! I didn't nllknow rooms like that existed! Hey frigin King beds Westin! Also cheap plastic cups in the bathroom really???? Whose idiot idea was that? Gives the hotel a Motel 6 feel! 
21956 The hotel is too modern for my tastes. It gives it a depressing feel, but the beds are wonderful. The black slate floors in the bathroom always look dirty. It was nice and quiet. 
21957 Stayed here in March in a presidential suite and it was out of this world. Butler and driver service on request ! Would recommend it. Robin Tinto 
21958 The rooms are small, but this isn't a big deal if you limit yourself to 2 people per room and will be mostly out of the room anyway. The location is excellent and within walking distance of the magnificent mile. 
21959 Nice hotel with good management & staff. Several new items in the restaurant also that are very good. 
21960 We stayed with our two kids five days for thanksgiving and it is really difficult to get a good size room in Manhattan. This hotel has new modern decorated rooms with plenty of space and good service 
21961 I stayed here for one night. There was nothing really great or really bad about it. It was clean, in a decent location, and that is about it. 
21962 Lovely rooms and staff. Nicely furnished. Not the biggest rooms, but in a central location you can accept that. Got a great deal through a search engine and it was worth every dime. For a nice place to stay wit out blowing the budget this is perfect 
21963 Although the rooms are clean and the hotel quite well placed, the noise of the trains rattling past every 5 minutes was ridiculous and spoiled what is otherwise a nice hotel. Also, no ok food outlets close by for late night eating. VERY VERY NOISY 
21964 A very cosy and original atmosphere right next to Times Square! Simply love the place, the wall paper, the cosy loby, the old fashioned elevator and the despite small rooms, the beds are simply fabulous! 
21965 Massive hotel, always busy, felt like sleeping in a shopping mall. Didn't make me feel at ease. Well sized room, little worn out. Bed ok. Clean Noisy, street noise from the outside as well as internal from the neighbours, bathroom usage and people walking the corridor. 
21966 Stayed for 5 nights. Great location: - 2 different Metros and lots of shops / restaurants within walking distance. - safe area - close to Javits Center for conventions Staff absolutely fabulous: professional and personal. Will definitely consider staying there again for next trip. 
21967 A large proportion of the hotel is very outdated and in desperate need of refurbishment. We were unfortunate enough to end up in a room which stank of urine !! It was even worse in a bathroom. After paying 230$ per night, I would expect more. 
21968 I'd just like to thank Herald square for making our stay such a plesant one. The service was great, as was the rooms. We'll deffinatley be booking here on our next visit! 
21969 I had a great experience while I was here a few days ago! Very hospitable staff! Highly recommended =) 
21970 Staff very ill mannered especially the maids who by the way look through your cases for money also the rooms rarley get cleaned properley and i found may stay there horrible. 
21971 The rooms are tired and worn out. The neighborhood is border line. The staff is very warm and very friendly, the hotel has just seen better days. 
21972 This lounge was incredible. My wife and I hung out for over an hour having a drink and dessert. The atmosphere was really chill and the view is 2nd to none. The staff there were friendly and seem to enjoy taking care of us. 
21973 This hotel is in a superb location, great suite, good staff, good buffet breakfast. Above average all rounder. Would definitely stay again. 
21974 Great location, fantastic views, nice rooms, but a little noise from the WTC construction. You can't find a better price for a 4 Star hotel in NY. Highly recommend it. 
21975 Stayed for two nights on a business trip. Rooms are relatively small, but was still comfortable and clean. Staff was pleasant. Location was good, relatively central, walking distance to public transport. Absolutely fine for a business trip. 
21976 My Wife and I stayed here for 8 nights around St Patrick's day and although pricey was well worth it for the location alone. We had a corner queen room which looked right down onto Times Square. Can't wait to go back and would love to stay here again. 
21977 Excellent service and staff - rooms are tiny but very clean - great location. Room service is faster than promised - food was not gourmet but better than average. My room got very hot and dry through the night - didn't find the temperature control. 
21978 Clean, updated rooms, a great location and an attentive staff. One of the managers, Frank, was particularly welcoming and helpful. I plan to return to NYC in May with my sister and will definitely stay here again. 
21979 We stayed Doubletree Hotel Chicago-Magnificent Mile for 3 days. The room is clean and staffs are very helpful. The location is perfect! Walking distance to everywhere. And there are plenty shopping centers, restaurants & bars around hotel. We love it ! 
21980 Having just come back from here I must say what a fantastic hotel this is due to the fact it's just been decorated while having a great location. Finally I got a great deal when booking through low cost holidays usa 
21981 Great hotel if you want somewhere cool to stay, but not great for long stays or business. Rooms aren't practical - plugs in random places, weird lights. But enjoyed having a deck in my room and a great bar downstairs. 
21982 NYC hotel in good locale, within 4-8 blocks of Times Square, theater district, Central Park, Radio City Music Hall. and of course lots of restaurants. Good value considering midtown hotel prices. 
21983 Went to the Wellington Hotel over 4th of July. The hotel has some age to it, but is clean overall. Rooms are smaller, but comparable to other hotels in NYC. Staff is nice and helpful. Great location, near all the hot spots in Manhattan. Would go back again. 
21984 Great Price. Located close to subways. Clean room & bathrooms. Each floor has 3-4 bathrooms. A bit noisy, but just bring some earplugs. 
21985 Our stay at The Allerton was very nice. Upon check-in we were upgraded to a junior suite which was lovely. The hotel staff was very accommodating. We plan to stay at The Allerton when we are next in Chicago. 
21986 A fresh, contemporary oasis in Murray Hill. Staff was extremely pleasant. A slight problem upon checking in was addressed immediately, and our room was upgraded.Our "--06" room was very spacious for NYC. Terrific local restos within walking distance. Overall great value for the money. 
21987 Well located, spacious, comfortable, not cheap but still a good value for NY. 
21988 Love staying at the Roger Smith Hotel. The staff are so friendly and warm, and the service is excellent. Especially love the artwork. Great location, close to everything - will definitely be back. And the wireless is free! 
21989 We stayed here two nights. The rooms are spacious. And the architecture is very impressive. Hotel needs some friendly up-keep. Some paint chips and has a flavor of a hotel needing renovation. But it is an ok hotel, great location, and good staff. 
21990 My stay in Marriott for four days was perfect as it could be. The breakfast was nice and staff was very friendly. I liked the rooms and the proximity of the hotel to my office in NY. Recommended for business as well as personal stay. 
21991 Vicky Martin at the front desk was so wonderful. The reservation got mixed up and she made everything right. She went out of her way to provide exceptional customer service. 
21992 Historic property recently renovated with crisp modern style. Very reasonable pet fee per stay. Cheerful and helpful staff. Near Penn Station and theatre district. Convenient to subway stations. Classy little restaurant on site. Adding conference facilities but construction is barely noticeable. 
21993 The location of this hotel is very convenient. There was a big conference at the hotel when I stayed there. So there were long queues for check-in, check-out and the restaurants. The service is quite good but the rooms are quite small. 
21994 Great staff, wonderfull interior design, located perfectly on times square, Just now as you exit Brian the ever helpful and polite doorman will take the door for you and then the wonderful tones of Frank Sinatra eminate from across the street. 
21995 The Public is exactly what is should be a well-designed hotel, run efficiently by friendly people at a fair price... nicely done. 
21996 If this site would let me, I'd post a picture of the black mold on the ceiling and the hole in the wall. The carpet was ripped and rumpled. Check-in tool 50 minutes and he front desk workers were rude and incompetent. 
21997 Very clean new hotel. Prompt service, friendly staff, free breakfast and free high-speed wifi. The rooms are not huge, but are nicely furnished. Great location with many bars, clubs, and restaurants in the area. A short walk from the subway. All in all, highly recommended. 
21998 Fabulous decor. Outstanding staff and service.Spacious room that is decorated beautifully. Perfect location. Food was amazing 24 hr room service. I will be staying here often for mini-vacations. I love it! 
21999 This hotel is awful. The room is small and the bathroom is really bad. The AC is right next to the bed and you can feel the air blowing at you when lying down. It smells old too. Would never ever stay at this hotel again. 
22000 Everything was perfect from A to Z... What more can I say? 
22001 Great location and very cool structure with provacative interiors and sapcious rooms. totally exceeded my expectations and I will absolutely go back next time in Manhattan. 
22002 Convenient. Price was right, but the bed was hard and sheets were itchy. Noisyish street. Look, this is a no frills experince, a bare step up from a backpacker. Still, in NYC, a good clean bed in a safe place is all I wanted and all I got. 
22003 Hotel is ok, rooms are small as to be expected downtown Chicago, but the internet access is about the slowest I've seen with www.speedtest.net results 0.35 Mb/s download 0.24 Mb/s upload. (Cable internet can go up to 60 Mb/s and even my old Droid one 3G phone was 1.531 Mb/s) 
22004 What a fun, energetic hotel! Rooms were modern and clean! The pool was fabulous! And the staff was very friendly and helpful! The central location is great for visiting the pier or all of that magnificent shopping! 
22005 I came to NYC for a meeting. My first stay at the Paramount Hotel. What a great hotel. Usually I stay at the W but moving forward I will be making my reservations at the Paramount. Whish you had hotels like that in other states ;) 
22006 Excellent value. great location and service. We had booked a room with a king size bed so the room size was fine. Terrific location for catching shows. Had breakfast in the restaurant and really enjoyed the meal and the service. 
22007 I enjoyed every moment of my stay and was treated like a king. The room was spacious and the bed was as comfotable as my own. Great night sleep. The best part of the visit was Raquel. Raquel provided award winning service. Looking forward to my next stay. 
22008 Stayed in a King suite, cooked own breakfast as excellent food shopping across street. Wonderful restaurants within easy walking distance, room quiet and very large 
22009 Small room good brekfest neer the empire state buildind and macyes Good location for shopping trip 
22010 Great hotel - location is awsome, gym and training are awesome 
22011 It is renewed again since my last visit which was a year ago.The location is great. Very close to theaters.The bed is amazing. Great breakfast ( although missing the rasberries, blueberries they had before ). Would recommend and stay anytime i visit NYC. 
22012 This is about the quietest hotel we ever stayed at. Everything was very comfortable. The staff very friendly. The location is perfect. The price is steep, but so are all hotels in New York City. Overall we loved everything about this hotel. 
22013 Very good experience in this tiny hotel with a lot of charm. Room very clean and a lot of space. Amazing bathroon for NY. Location is not great and people don't smile easily but We definitively recommand you this hotel 
22014 Huge rooms with nice view. Clean clean clean! Free business room with computer and printer. Excellent location! The elevatores are a bit slow... 
22015 Trip highlighted with US Open! Hurricane Irene delayed our plans, but our hotel kept us safe,comfy, informed and helpful in every way! Staff was very sweet and delightful! Especially Vana and Elvin! Didn't make it to the famous rooftop we'll catch it on our next visit! Great location and hotel! 
22016 Loved how quaint and luxorious this hotel was. Free esspresso machine access, and wine happy hour each evening was a great amenity. Most comfortable bed I have ever slept in at a hotel. Great customer service. 
22017 We stayed on 33rd floor ,room was nice size with the best beds weve slept in. Bath small but shower was incredible. Found staff very helpful. All in all a great holiday. Thank you Westin. 
22018 I have stayed here many many times. This hotel takes care of you. Sure this is not a 5 star hotel, but this is a hotel where you can sleep well and be very close to the airport. The staff is professional and the small breakfast is great. 
22019 It really was a very nice hotel! Very friendly and helpful staff! Nice, clean and modern rooms! Nice swimmingpool with bar and spa for after hours relaxing... Location: at about 100 metres of times square, which was wonderful!! Absolutely recommended hotel!!!! 
22020 We got a really good price via priceline. (120$US/night) Located in the Financial District, close to a Subway Station. Small rooms; Modern; Beds are really comfortable; Not really a nice view of NYC; No bed bugs; Clean; 
22021 Tiny rooms. not worth the money. Had a handicapped room on the 7th floor. Weird decor- hallways are kind of creepy and dark., Nothing in hotel. Internet was awful. Would not go back, Did not try food. Went elsewhere. 
22022 We went for a couples weekend. The hotel is luxurious, comfortable, and beautiful! The service was excellent. I would go back in a minute! 
22023 Beautifully furnished, very clean, courteous employees, located in the Persian rug district far enough away from the crowds and craziness, and yet centrally located in Manhattan minutes from everything. Would definitely recommend! 
22024 Great place....excellent location...great staff....very nice rooms .....great bar lounge... 
22025 Lovely Lobby; attentive service; as advertised: Dreamy beds, towels, comfy rooms, great dining, and convenient to all points mid-town! 
22026 Excellent in all respects...room a bit small but thats Manhattan. Concierge Vanessa was delightful and got us great tickets to theatre. Tje little bar is cozy and has a vibe too. Clean and friendly and great location...a gem. 
22027 it takes a little getting used to finding your way from the interstate onto the service roads but after a day or so we got used to it 
22028 Typical of NYC hotels, the lobby is huge and really noisy, the rooms are tired and need a refurb, the windows are old so you hear everything from outside, good luck getting to sleep! 
22029 We really enjoyed our stay in the Red Roof Inn. The staff were warm, friendly and helpfull. Our room was spacious and comforbable and the self service breakfast was an added bonus. The hotel was ideally located near the Empire State building , Macy's , Penn Station,and Madison Square Garden. 
22030 I am on an extended business trip and have found the service both house cleaning and front desk. All of the people working here has been very friendly and helpful during my stay. Also, the rates are reasonable and I would stay here again. 
22031 We stayed two nights in this wonderful hotel and have nothing negative to say about. The staff were so friendly and helpful and we especially enjoyed the complimentary refreshments during the day and night! 
22032 Supper was very good. The food was good and reasonably priced. Restaurant staff very friendly. Breakfast offering should be expanded. Front desk staff friendly and helpful. Need to expand storage area for luggage. 
22033 Stayed there with my husband Dec 13 - Dec 15 2011, fantastic location, excellent doormen, room was better than expected. Would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again in 2012. 
22034 The sparse decor is very relaxing, no rugs, no furniture. It could use a place to put your luggage. It was hard to find at this big intersection of two major roads. 
22035 Very good location , close to Central Park , nice walk to time square with lots of places to eat along the way. Staff was very helpful in any questions we had as was first time in New York Room was large, very clean and quiet. 
22036 40 min standing for Check in Smallest room I ever saw - 40 cms max around the bed. +/- clean Air conditioning Extremely noisy 
22037 Good location to Bear game/ shed aquarium/ museum. No in/out parking sucks. Overpriced for the room quality. 
22038 This hotel seemed like other Amerisuites that we have stayed in. The room was large and clean. The high speed internet worked great. The staff seemed friendly and helpful. We didn't try the breakfast this time. No complaints. 
22039 Very nice place and a great rate. Staff very friendly and only a few miles to MD Anderson. Will stay there again 
22040 Took my wife to NYC for here B-day and we got everything we expected from the Dumont; great location, view and comfort. The people at the hotel were very helpful and with the neighborhood, Murray Hill, we were able to get a taste of NY as if we lived there. 
22041 Can't fault it. Great room, geat position, great service throughout my stay. Loved the room designs, made such a nice change from the bland offerings of other chain hotels. I will definitely stay again. 
22042 Very comfortable hotel rooms with Frette linens, great rainfall shower heads, perfect for business travel. Convenient to Macy's, subway, SOHO bars and restaurants, and the Empire State Building. Perfect for business travelers. 
22043 We found this hotel quite nice. The staff were very pleasant and went out of their way to make our stay good. We found Rosalind absolutely excellent to deal with. Location was the only negative. 
22044 os funcionarios do hotel sao muito rudes, diferentes de outros que ficamos nesta mesma viagem... a cama do quarto tinha o colchao velho e torto para um lado de tanto uso, o que nao deixava confortavel para duas pessoas dormirem na mesma cama. 
22045 Very beautiful, most helpful concierge, convenient to the theatre district, Times Square, 5th Ave and Central Park. We will definitely stay here next time we visit NYC. The place is very kid-friendly, many places to eat around the hotel. We especially liked Ashland Alley. 
22046 Small but very clean rooms- Ludlow Street is dead in the morning but hopping at night. There is a club and eateries open until 4am so ask for a room in the back. The service was good- Parking is a couple blocks away so drop off bags first- 
22047 Clean comfortable hotel. A great base to visit the sites of New York 
22048 Found hotel staff very helpful. Tick Tock diner attached to hotel and open 24 hours 
22049 Very hard to find a hotel room with 2 double beds in NYC... this hotel is in a great location - near Times Square - the rooms were clean, big, and we enjoyed our stay. Would definitely stay here again. 
22050 This hotel in just a stones throw from Times Square. Beautiful reception area and staff very helpful. Rooms clean but on small side. Corridors dark and grey, looked a bit like a prison block! 
22051 Very comfortable bed, decent hotel although only 2 lifts which took ages to arrive during a busy time of day which was slightly annoying. Bit of a strange area of NY but I am told it is on the way up! I would stay here again. 
22052 Good location, close to all of the downtown hotspots, staff was excellent 
22053 We took the whole family to New York this Easter and was very pleased with the Hotel Edison. It was clean the staff were friendly and we would certainly stay there again when we visit New York. 
22054 Live in Connecticut took possible sun inlaw with daughter to show stayed at Courtyard W 40th St. excelent location. Every thing we wanted to do was walking distance. Room was good size even for N.Y. Bell Hop was very helpfull! 
22055 For US$250 we got a deluxe room (330m2) on the 33rd floor with a fabulous view ! I was very impressed with how efficiently the hotel was run and added something special to our stay in NY. Great Location for first-time visitors & well worth checking out ! 
22056 Make sure your room does not face the street. All night long the doormen blast on police whistles looking for taxis 
22057 I recommend Belvedere Hotel to anyone who is looking for hotel accommodations in NYC. The location is great, the staff personnel are courteous and very accommodating, service is prompt, and room amenities are very good. 
22058 I love the happy hour, free cont.breakfast, and the great service. I nice to come back toplace any the staff remembers you. 
22059 Great hotel, very friendly staff, we could walk every. This was our second visit to NY and to The New Yorker. Recommend to anybody. 
22060 This hotel had it all for us. Recommended by a relative it was our first visit to New York. It completely lived up to our expectations. Great location, super room with comfy bed, lovely staff, great bar and restaurant. Would recommend to anyone. Everything we had hoped for and more!! 
22061 We had great views, lovely hotel, friendly staff, nothing to much trouble, great location. 
22062 This hotel was clean, rooms were nice size, it was quiet at night, and the staff was INCREDIBLE. Very friendly, informative, and helpful. Our experience was wonderful. We will stay here again. December 13th, 2011 
22063 Staff is very nice and went out of their way when a package arrived late to the hotel. Rooms are clean, but typically cramped without much desk space if you're working much. Easy access to Penn Station and Midtown. Breakfast a step above the usual Hampton fare. 
22064 im not lookin for a marble fancy hotel.casablanca is the best for me.i feel like human being.they show respect and they (staff) were very helpful and accommodating. i had peace in this place.i greatly recommend this hotel as per my own experience with my family. 
22065 First time in New York and the staff were wonderful. Clean. Love the upgrades. Close to everything and not to mention right next to the 17th precinct so I felt pretty safe. Hope to stay there again soon. 
22066 Super Hotel, total nette Angestellte, kleines Zimmer aber sehr sauber, super zentral und ruhig. 
22067 Whenever I travel to New York again. I will make sure that I stay at the Algonquin. The staff are great and the rooms are immaculate! I highly recommend this hotel. 
22068 Clean and well located. Staff was friendly. Fitness room was excellent for a smallish hotel. I recommend it for business and couples travel. Well priced. 
22069 I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Hotel 41. The front desk staff are very helpful and pleasant. I look forward to staying there again. Ann 
22070 The stay was good. Joanna was excellent, always smiling, courtious and went above and beyond to make sure our stay was pleasant.Improvement needed in the room, especially in the bathroom. 
22071 We loved the Doubletree Guest Suites in Times Square. The location was convienient to all Broadway Shows. We could walk anywhere we wanted to. The suites are large and clean. We will definitely return !!! 
22072 We stayed here for 3 nights. The rooms are nice and what you would expect at a Hyatt. It offers a great location if you are visiting the museums. 
22073 We were very pleased with the location and price when considering the value offered. The staff (Kierra & Zerina) was very helpful and gracious. I would highly recommend you consider them on your next trip to Chicago. 
22074 Everyone here is exceptionally nice. This has been a very good experience, accessible to everything you want to do and all major transportation. Clean room, WiFi, comfortable bed! I'd stay here again anytime. 
22075 Stayed there twice, once with young child, other with friends. super friendly staff, great location, brand new hotel hence extra clean and design, and price more than reasonable. A real gem. Cheap parking nearby. 
22076 Nice facility, very nice people. Great location, within walking distance of many attractions. My room did not have a mini fridge, I called and they delivered one right up! Will certainly come back.TK was very helpful in suggesting a restaurant. I wish there was free internet in the rooms 
22077 Had a good stay at the St. Marks. Pros : Good location, very close to subways, restaurants, bars, etc... Price is fair for NYC. Clean. Cons : They only take cash. No elevator. Bathroom and the room in general was tiny. 
22078 The staff was very pleasant and the upgrade to the suite was a plus.. Room was very clean and spacious. Restaurant was a bit pricey though. 
22079 A five night Marriott reward stay and hence unbeatable value. Clean and spacious room. Recommended if you are on vacation or on business. 
22080 This was a great stay. Everything was clean and worked well. I thought the bed was very comfortable. Great bathroom. Staff is so friendly and helpful and very good looking. 
22081 Had a great stay. Rooms are good, the overal design feels nice. The restaurant was not to recommend, the breakfast wasn't good. But the location is good and the rooftop pool is simply fantastic when it's hot! Great to just hang out and have a good time. 
22082 Great location, we had a room on the 22nd floor, nice outlook, and quiet. We walked to all the tourist attraction from The Avenue Hotel. Staff extremely polite and helpful. Would not hesitate to stay again 
22083 Staying in Chicago on business and decided on this hotel for central location. You can walk to all locations on mag mile, Ohio and state st. Comfortable bedding, larger than normal rooms, great Internet. Breakfast had something to be desired. The egg's were awful, rubbery and tasteless. 
22084 This is a wonderful hotel located near the Subway in Mid-Town Manhattan Island. The rooms are very nice with a great staff. No guest laundry or pool. Nice restaurant on the 12th floor. Did I say comfortable beds. Large room with refirgerator. 
22085 chic and sexy huge, quite, plush rooms best, best, best bathroom products great service awesome bar 
22086 Great hotel. Best bed I have ever slept on. Pricey but would recommend to anyone. In room internet but could not connect to www. Would definitely go back. LNMD93 
22087 This hotel is clean, and the rooms are quiet. They have done a lot with small spaces. It is really well located in Murray Hill (midtown), within walking distance of the Empire State Building and other great attractions. Very friendly staff. Free walking tours on Friday mornings. 
22088 If you want comfort, this hotel is for you. Inexpensive, good access to downtown, free wifi, free purified water... I strongly recommend this hotel. 
22089 The location was excellent, room was spacious, no complaints! 
22090 Clean, quiet, comfortable; friendly service in an excellent location. 
22091 The manager Kaizad Charma and Sandra Martyn was very helpful and pleasant. The rooms were very comfortable and clean and the breakfast was very good. Five stars in every category. 
22092 Met het gezin 4 dagen New York gedaan. Goede centrale ligging. Zeer goede bedden en alles vrij nieuw en schoon. Wij boeken hier weer bij ons volgende verblijf. Goed verzorgd ontbijtbuffet. Virendelijk personeel. Geweldige Bar op het dak met uitzicht op Empire State Building. Aanrader ! 
22093 Great place to stay. Shuttle to Medical centers is a wonderful service. Breakfast buffet was so good. Room was fair. The bed was perfect. Friendly staff. 
22094 I look for hotels that are cleand and quiet, and this one fits the bill. Roomsare well appointed, bed is comfortable. Somefood options about 3blocks up the street. Parking behind the hotel for $25 per day. I have stayed here before and will stay her again. 
22095 This location is a great location for any activities near Grant Park and Millenium Park. However, the hotel rooms, restaurants, and lobby are very outdated. The hallways are dark, older carpet and older elevators. I would only stay here if you needed location only. 
22096 This was such a nice hotel...very roomy, great locations, excellent staff. I found a great deal online, and I would definitely come back! 
22097 The service was excellent. Staff was very knowledgable about surrounding area. Rooms were clean and had a feel of home. Location is close to whatever you want to experience. I will stay this Hotel again. 
22098 This hotel was ideal. Great location. Plenty of places to eat & drink on the street. Great staff - they couldn't have been more helpful. Angel & the others went out of their way to make us feel welcome. Price was reasonable too. 
22099 We had a suite...so the room was not tiny as others have mentioned. No noise from the street, no noise from the hallway....all was great. Elevators are slow...but breakfast which we had included was fantastic. Great location.....staff is stuffy, but that's the charm. 
22100 ottima posizione, vicino a central park e alle maggiori attrazioni di manhattan. albergo davvero molto bello e alla moda. Camere piccolissime (ameno la standard) ma sistemate perfettamente. Nn adatto a famiglie. Di certo ci tornei! 
22101 Nice Property if your interested in being on the south end of Manhattan. Rooms are clean, check Inn was great, Property is close to World Trade Center memorial, Battery Park, etc. 
22102 I would definately stay here again, the hotel is in an excellent location, provides a good continental breakfast in the price, is clean, with helpful staff. The rooms are small, but I didn't find that important as we weren't in them for most of the day 
22103 We have been remiss in complimenting your fine Hilton hotel unit. We have been guests numerous times and our stay was always enjoyed. The service and greetings at the front desk were punctual, professional and friendly. Cleanliness has always been observed and appreciated. Food service and quality have been outstanding. 
22104 I highly recommend this hotel. we found the place by chance and we were so happy to have stayed there. 
22105 Cannot praise this hotel enough. Had a wonderful stay there in November. FAB location, AMAZING staff and GREAT bar! Thank you. We will definately be back :-) 
22106 This hotel was very nice. The best location, could walk to all the shopping. The bed was comfortable, bathroom very nice and very clean. Would definately recommend this hotel. 
22107 Great location, very quiet rooms which is brilliant for Manhattan. Rooms are small but well equipped. Staff are ver helpful and friendly. The Red Lantern restaurant next door is a terrific NY diner. 
22108 I truly enjoyed my stay at Hotel Sorella and plan to make this a quarterly weekend get-a-way. I've always lived in Houston but this hotel and staff made me feel like I was on a tropical island. It was so very relaxing the entire weekend. 
22109 Tiny, noisy rooms and shared bathrooms but still worth it for the West Village location and the very, very relative value. But especially for the fantastic cafe and its brunches. Style overcomes all else. 
22110 We love this hotel but were really disappointed with the breakfast offered. They force you to order off a menu at an extra charge if you want anything hot to eat. 
22111 Great location, clean, and friendly staff. Stayed here for business. There Internet and pool all required additional charge but it was very nice. Would pick this hotel as top choice in NYC. Nice bar and sports game watching atmosphere. 
22112 My ultimate favourite hotel in NY - and as great this time as always before! Some problems with the WLAN but the staff was most helpful. Such design! Such an experience! Also, do try the restaurant! 
22113 We've been a week during Xmas in Newton hotel: nice place, simple but comfortable rooms, very reasonable price considering the season, and: NEXT to 96th st subway station (stop for express trains to downtown Manhattan). Excellent option to stay away from tourist crowds. 
22114 We had a very nice stay. The location was great with easy access to the subway. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms were clean, and the staff were very helpful and friendly. Kudos to Joana and Bill who went above and beyond being helpful. 
22115 Great location. Service pretty lacking. Front desk staff slow, concierge rude and unhelpful, but the location.... Subway stop right outside front door. Oh, and it took forever to get help with our luggage. Rooms good size for NY. Bottom line, nice room, nice location, poor service. 
22116 simply agree with all the good stuff written below - and what a great video runs in the elevator! couldn't stop watching it! 
22117 habitaciones muy espaciosas. con carta de almohadas. con moqueta. te hacen el check in para el avion de vuelta. 
22118 We stayed here for a weekend getaway without the kids and thought it was wonderful. The location was great, the hotel was very clean and the doormen were fun and full of great info. Omni is just a better place to stay and we love them! 
22119 The Muse offers excellent staff along with spacious rooms and great beds. We stayed there four nights and loved the location and the people working there. I would highly recommend to anyone! 
22120 The facility, staff and atmoshpere are excellent here! The hotel is centrally located to all area attractions and destinations. Ricardo the food and beverage supervisor and downstairs bartender always makes you feel at home. 
22121 Spent four nights at the Sofitel. Very impressed over all. Very friendly staff, big clean room, excellent bed and linen. Only comment would be high cost of breakfast (although quality was very good) and charge for internet usage - all major hotels should provide this free now in my view. 
22122 Location was perfect for access to subway and walking to Roosevelt Center and Times Square. Room was comfortable and clean. Would stay again. 
22123 Everyone in this hotel, from the manager Tammy, the lady at the front desk LaToya, to the maintenance man Frank were very polite and efficient. On my next job in NW Houston, I will certainly stay there again. 
22124 The Comfort Inn was great, very clean and while my room was small, there was enough space for my large suitcase and room to move around! The shower had a curved shower curtain rod so you have more space in the shower too.. great neighborhood, excellent hotel. 
22125 The location is superb, european style hotel, rooms though small (consider them like a cruise cabin on earth) have all you need to stay in NY. Breakfast is enough to start your exploration day and is included in your room rate. I will return to it on my next trip.. 
22126 one problem after another given a room already occupied erroneous charge on bill after checkout no staff at front desk when room key would not work no staff at front desk when checking out broken lamp in room 
22127 I have been staying at the Edison for the past ten plus years. Have always found it to be a great economical place to stay. Location is great for the theatre district. Rooms are always clean and comfortable. 
22128 The hotel is in a great location, easy walking distance to many of NYC main attractions. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms were a good size and clean. Great hotel, would stay here again. 
22129 This hotel offer good access to all the major attraction such as MOMA, LIncolin Center, Upper Westside, and upscuale shopping and entertainment. 
22130 My Jet Privilage number is: 115134235 Excellent service, well apointed rooms with kitchenette and free wireless internet. Excellent food and friendly service. Extremely clean and tidy. 
22131 This hotel is great. Perfectly situated in the heart of Manhattan. The staff are excellent. A real jem. Our room was big by NY standards and everything was perfect. 
22132 Very stylish rooms. Got a room at the back so it was very quiet. Like the flat screen tvs and Philosophy bath items. Can also bring your pet. 
22133 Wow- great place to stay in Upper East Side. Calm, Sophisticated 
22134 Service excellant, everyone focused on customer service. 
22135 Location, Room, Service - everything is 5-star in this lovely hotel. 
22136 Prima locatie, net uit de drukte van time square. Onze kamer had een mooi uitzicht op de Hudson (24e verdieping) Personeel vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Kamer brandschoon met vernuftige snufjes o.a. het bed wat verlengd kon worden. Een trendy hotel en aanbevelingswaardig. 
22137 Flawless service, beautifully appointed and immaculate rooms, sumptuous linens and heavenly beds overlooking Central Park. Is there a reason to even look at another place to stay in NYC? 
22138 Waitress from the bar were really bad. Plus the hotel is really average. In our room, it smells as if something die !!!! Not acceptable when you pay such an high price !!! 
22139 Had a room on a layover in Houston and it was wonderful stay at this hotel including d staff! 
22140 The motel was very clean and welcoming. the staff welcomed us and any questions we had were able to assist. wel done. The motel was very clean and welcoming. the staff welcomed us and any questions we had were able to assist. wel done. 
22141 This place totally exceeded my expectations. The room was clean and furnishings were all very nice. Location was awesome. I would stay here again. 
22142 Front desk is terse, rooms are old and in need of renovation. Wifi is expernsive - they charge per device! Fantastic location though. I might stay here again. 
22143 I stay at this hotel for the service and exceptional hospitality. I must say that Ricky is always professional, warm and makes guests feel a sense of connection to the place. Thanks to him, I'll return even if I can't accumulate my marriot points! 
22144 Have stayed here many times on business. Great hotel - clean & comfortable, centrally located to all my meetings & the hotel staff is wonderful! 
22145 Great Value. Looks brand new. Spotless. Very friendly staff. Quite helpful. Listed most places as 2 Star, should be at least 3. Free Internet Access, workout room. Nice bar. 
22146 Great night, great service and right in the middle of the downtown action! Customer service was great and guest services helped us to plan our evening and mapped out areas that would fit our interests. Loved our stay!! 
22147 Had a great stay Hotel position was fantastic and staff very helpfull, The only down point was the size of the basic room it was very small but they did change me to a larger room after 2 nights this was a much better room. 
22148 The view of the freedom towers is awesome. Rooms are cool but the dudebthat checked me in, Jimit was so friendly .. Walking distance to the Stanton ferry too. Battery park and the subway. If you can request a room with a view. Like the statue of liberty. 
22149 Not too much else to say. This place is a joke. the hallways are filthy. Rooms are so small you hit your face on the wall getting out of bed. Horrible. Absolutely awful. 
22150 We love the beds and showers and got a complimentary upgrade to the newly refinished Atrium Club which was a terrific perk! Espresso, fresh fruit and oatmeal for breakfast and snacks and drinks in the afternoon. A delightful stay! 
22151 This hotel is a great deal for a NYC hotel. The prices is lower than uptown, the rooms are clean and quiet, and the health club is more than adequate. I really like the refurbished rooms with great A/C and air purification systems! 
22152 Stayed here on business for a few nights. Room was clean, spacious and modern. Unfortunately I didnt' even have the time to look out my window or spend enough time at the hotel to appreciate it fully. Staff was friendly and helpful, and service was quick and efficient. 
22153 The service is very friendly, especially Nathalie was very competent and helpful! 
22154 I have visited this hotel several times in the past 5 years and each time I thoroughly enjoy my visit. I want to give a huge shout out to Ramona and Tasha S. who handled all of the administrative details of my visit and made my stay stress free. 
22155 Quality and room size should be better for the price. 
22156 Good value hotel. Very nice view over the central park. Good central location. Nice lobby and bar, proper rooms, exterior improvable (and currently under refurbishment), very good service. It's not the top of the pops, but the hotel offered a good value for us. 
22157 Great little find - good value for money - clean - so handy to everything - thoroughly reccomend. The coffee shop next door does a mean breakfast too!!! 
22158 We stayed there for a week, during the summer July 1st to 8th. The hotel is located within walking distance to most major NY important attractions. Rooms very clean and the staff is always ready to help you in your needs. 
22159 Da leider alle Zimmer ausgebucht waren und wir reserviert hatten bekamen wir eine Mega Riesen Suite! Super Geil! Mit 250qm 4 schlafzimmern und nem direkten Blick aufs FiDi und dem Empire!! Super Cool!! 
22160 A very good hotel in an excellent location. I must say that this was the tops of our trip; can't understand why this isn't rated with 4 stars and why it isn't priced higher. Not that I'm complaining. Parking at $ 30 is high. 
22161 This hotel was a pleasant suprise! The premium queen room was perfect for me as a single traveler! Very modern and very close to Times Square! 
22162 Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Disappointed that the Bar wasn't open full time! A lovely, quiet, and relaxing place to stay! 
22163 We were so sad to leave your hotel, exscellent location,great staff,very comfortable room...need to say more?! We will definitely be back! 
22164 Staff are friendly and helpful. Rooms are small but with awesome views on times square. Some rooms have a slope and we felt a bit like being on a ship... Expensive but worth it. 
22165 Stayed here for a couple of days. Great location in the heart of mid town east. Room was basic given how much they charged per night. Also found a general need to do maintenance in the public areas. 
22166 The staff, the location, the cleanlines, and the food all exceeded my expectations. The concierge/ shuttle drivers were OUTSTANDING! Close to IAH, and many of the North Houston businesses. Would definitely stay here again. 
22167 Nice clean, light rooms with refrigirator, coffee machine and small stow Good service Laundry room Shuttle bus to airport (prepay/order before departure) Near Subway, restaurants and Central Park No breakfast (can go to restaurant round the corner) 
22168 The rooms are big and quiet, the King bed was very confortable and the bathroom was spacious and clean. The position is ideal to visit SoHo (at walking distance) and the rest of Manhattan since the hotel is right above Canal Street subway station. 
22169 The place will get you in the real NYC mood in notime. Classy, but not over the top, modern but not inpractical, this place has it all. Go foe the LES, it is the place to be now! 
22170 Good location is all I can say about this hotel. Carpets looked dirty. A musty, damp smell in our corridor. Toilet didn't flush properly.Glad we were only staying for 2 days. Not what I would expect from Holiday Inn 
22171 Is becoming one of my fav NYC hotels! Love the staff, location, awesome rooms and suites. They take of their guest so they can't wait to come back! Thank you! 
22172 Traveled here on business to Houston from Pune and this is my third visit to this Hotel. The service has always been superb and the staff is excellent. The food & beverage quality is exceptional and the rooms are very spacious. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. 
22173 My Second visit and without a shadow of a doubt I will be back! The maid service was fantastic, spotless room everyday, towels changed, friendly staff and great location. For a budget trip to New York you will not get better than Hotel 31. 
22174 We stayed here for two nights in May and really enjoyed it. The hotel itself is fine and clean, beds comfortable and bathroom adequate and clean. For the price in NYC it is very good and the location for us was perfect. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again. 
22175 we stayed here in April. we went for it because we are familiar with Travelodge in the UK and wanted something easy after our long flight. it ids perfectly located for sight seeing. breakfast is available in the cafe next door serving excellent choices. very reasonably priced. would recommend. 
22176 It was not so jolly being in the annex as I imagine it would be in the main building. One felt a bit shunted aside. And there was only hot water available (very hot); even the water in the toilet was hot. 
22177 Excellent. Helpful staff, great location, old building but very clean and breakfast very good 
22178 This is a great hotel. Loved the location. The rooms were a great size (not like some places downtown you feel your sleeping in a closet). They were clean and very comfortable. I thought the price was very reasonable and would stay there again next time were downtown. 
22179 The Tremont is a small, old hotel in a quiet street, right next to the Magnificent Mile. Our room was large, clean and comfortable with a king size bed. Room was very quiet. There was free w-fi and $5 breakfast. Bathroom had been renovated and was quite modern. 
22180 Really comfortable bed. Friendly and helpful staff. Definitely clean. No waiting for hot water in the shower. Though the bathroom is definitely meant for taller people (I'm only 5 feet tall). 
22181 very good location (2 mins from TS)... rooms a little small but that's all, very clean hotel and awesome price-location ratio 
22182 I was only there one night, but I will be back. Good location. Nice restaurants around them. A roof top sitting area with tables and chairs to relax in. 
22183 This hotel is a bit pricy but the service is great. It's location next to Central Park makes it a prime spot to explore what New York has to offer. 
22184 You couldn't ask for a better location in the city. In general the hotel is ok but it's NY so the staff lack the personal touch. The beds are the most comfortable I've ever slept in but the rooms aren't great unless you pay for the executive rooms. 
22185 another hotel group that pads the bottom line with ridiculous internet fees...12.95 a day...when will they ever get it?...dated property in need of renovation...for the full check-in price one can find accomodations with flatscreens, free wifi, dvd players and free breakfast...old tvs...tired looking rooms...very overrated...very. 
22186 Watch out for the manager. HE charged my visa several times. After a while visa contacted me and took the case to court. Watch out: the hotel can only reached by phone. NO FAX/NO MAIL/ .. If you have a complaint they hang in the line. 
22187 Great upper west side location for Thanksgiving stay. Just a few blocks away from balloon inflation and Thanksgiving parade route. Great restaurants, shopping, movies, and subway accessible. Room was impeccable, bed amazingly comfortable, wood floors, only con was small bathroom-but worked out fine. 
22188 Room was clean and comfortable. Price was reasonable. Staff was very helpful, providing us with a map and excellent advice on shuttle service to the airport. Continental breakfast was a little sad, but for a price like that, you really can't complain. 
22189 Kierra, Irma and Patrick were all helpful and attentive during our family's stay. Helping us and making us comfortable while we attended a family funeral. 
22190 We recently stayed at Best Value Platnium Inn on I-45 North near Greenspoint. It was a wonderful experience. Rooms were clean, coffee was excellent and Bimal and others in reception gave great customer service. Thanks for such a great stay. 
22191 This is a great hotel. The staff was very nice and it's close to Boys Town and the "L" Station. The rooms are a bit small, but they are very nice. The continental breakfast was decent. We'll definitley stay here again!! 
22192 For a great value in Midtown The Strand can't be beat. I have never had service as warm and friendly as thiers. The competition will be hard pressed to meet thier combination of location, amenities and service. The view form the rooftop bar is stunning, and not one to miss. 
22193 1000 dollars pour 400 sq, aller au trump tower c'est beaucoup mieux 
22194 Stayed here while on business, and it was a great hotel and location. Rooms are relatively large for NYC. Didn't hear any outside noise with AC on. The bellmen were very nice and helpful. 
22195 We were very pleased with our choice of this hotel for our N Y stay. Location is ideal. It is close to Penn station and easily within walking distance of any Mid Manhattan attractions. Our bedroom was very comfortable and the buffet breakfast is enjoyable. 
22196 Staying there with my daughter was a pleasure. Not extraordinary much space but clean, practicable and pretty central. 
22197 Attractive decor overall and very nice service. Large room with couch and comfortable recliner, comfortable mattress, marble bathroom sink, good room lighting. Well maintained, newer facility. Whirlpool spa, exercise room. Business room with fax machine, copier, etc. available. Will stay at this motel again. 
22198 Stunning hotel with a boutique feel. Bathroom is AMAZING. Huge, with giant walk in slate shower. We got the deluxe suite. Love the Burger Joint downstairs and location is pretty good, but all the cool places to eat and go out at night are a train or cab ride away. 
22199 This hotel has excellent customer service, and I would recommend it to anyone staying in the Houston area. The rates are very reasonable, and the location is great. 
22200 This hotel is well located, was near the metro and the rooms are nice, but the cleaning service is not very good, are slow to clean the rooms, wireless internet service is fine. 
22201 Amazingly friendly and helpful staff, clean and most definitely bed bug free, super accommodating for groups and amazing location with ridiculously reasonable price! I'll definitely be going back to this gem on another over night stay in Manhattan! Big ups to Sean and Gun! 
22202 The Four Seasons in Mid-Town Manhattan is the epicenter of our world -- fashion, culture, finance, sports, celebrities...spending time in this vibrant location with every detail suggesting an elegant lifestyle has a trans-formative and lasting effect. Be your best by enjoying the best in NYC. 
22203 My friends and I stayed at a Deluxe room, and I was hoping it was a big room. Anyway our stay was great, and it is walking distance for many places. There are always a loooooot of people in this hotel, but rooms are quiet. 
22204 I am staying here now and there's a train or something that goes by every few minutes that shakes the room. Beds are hard as rocks. Rooms are noisy. Going to look for another hotel somewhere else for tonight. There it is now. The glasses are shaking. 
22205 I was very happy with my stay at the Hilton New York Fashion District hotel. At night it was quiet enough to get a good night's sleep. The staff was very helpfull and friendly. I plan on returning to the hotel in the summer. 
22206 Overall great hotel, great service , rooms are clean , location is perfect. We were traveling with a two year old and he enjoyed his stay very much as well. 
22207 Clearly showing its wear. Could be quite nice with a bit of tlc. Older hotel in good location. Front desk a bit seedy. Addition of a fitness center would be a big plus. 
22208 Staff was unsmiling and all business. No sense of warmth whatsoever. There is one foreign accented woman at the front desk who was extremely rude to me when I asked her for help after I checked out. 
22209 Great location and great staff.The room was 5 star,the Heavenly bed was hard to get out of on a cold December mornnings. 
22210 For the price with breakfast not sure you can find a better value. Hotel is not fancy but clean. Located in little Korea Manhattan. Walk to times square,etc. We had a great trip 
22211 We recently booked 4 rooms at the hotel for a special reunion of long time friends from college. We had a wonderful stay at the hotel--the staff were outstanding and the accommodations were excellent--and the location was great as well--just a short walk from many attractions, great restaurants etc.. 
22212 This hotel is a beautiful hotel and in a great location. I can't complain too much about this hotel other than they need to spend some money updating the rooms and touching up the lobby area. 
22213 My husband and I and our adult son stayed in one room with a queen bed and a single pull out sofabed, had a comfortable room with a kitchenette. Staff very helpful.Common areas very nice. Location in the loop close to CTA stops and chain coffee/breakfast/lunch restaurants. Very safe area. 
22214 Nel ventre di Manhattan, un hotel unico e spettacolare (le ascensori che salgono e scendono sono tutte di cristallo). Purtroppo le camere sono molto vecchie e quindi non esattamente in linea con quanto si spende!!! 
22215 A very nice place very central located to stay. All clean and rooms are very modern furnished. 
22216 Great place to stay while in NYC. Centrally located, spacious rooms. Would stay here again. 
22217 the room was a little run down this visit but I love the hotel, location, and wrap-around views 
22218 Big let down. Stayed at far better hotels in NYC for half the price. Small rooms. The bar is cool but the service is very, very slow. I was really looking forward to my stay only to feel ripped off. 
22219 Rooms are very clean and staff is friendly and ready to assist out-of-towners. 
22220 Very luxurious hotel, great location, friendly staff. Grand entrance with wow factor. Room 565 was lovely, clean towels daily. Only complaint no tea/coffee making facilities in room but cafe right opposite hotel. Weighing scales on lower floor to make sure cases arent overweight. Brilliant! 
22221 I felt completely safe and welcome at the Motel 6 even though the surroundings were less than comforting. The room was clean, smoke-free, and even the parking lot was patrolled. 
22222 Great location but really tired rooms. The whole place feels ancient. Desperately needs a refurb!!! 
22223 It wasn't perfect... the swimming pool was drained and it was about a mile to the nearest restaurant, but the day of the marathon they provided free transportation and food. The room was fine as well. 
22224 Fantastic location, wonderful view of Michigam lake Very nice people and gilrs at the bar and restaurant Staff very helpful modern and cool rooms nice the fitness with swimming pool 
22225 Waking up to find a cockroach walking around the room of this supposed 4* hotel was the worst experience of my life. 
22226 Brand new rooms, fantastic beds, very friendly service. Location means you can get every where in 10 minutes. Get a room above 15 floor facing Empire State Building - best view - ever. The gym has the best running machines in the world. 
22227 If you get the right room you have more space than a typical NYC studio apartment. Almost no street noise & very helpful & friendly staff. The rooms are clean but need renovating soon. A good value for the money. 
22228 The rooms are a bit small, however the bed was so comfortable and crip and clean. The property is within walking distant of many shos and restaurants. The staff was friendly and very knowledgable of the area. Great breakfast and nice bar for evening drinks. 
22229 A classic, historic, hotel in the heart of a bustling city. We upgraded to the executive level and had a wonderful stay. The Palmer House tends to every detail. We highly recommend this hotel. The lobby is a must see. 
22230 Our family had a very nice stay at this hotel! Good location, clean, great breakfasts with bed and breakfast rate- cool rooftop bar. Good service. 
22231 great location, huge rooms- exellent prices for a nyc hotel, would stay there again 
22232 Spent 4 nights at the Barclay in late June. Great locaton, courteous and helpful staff, fun bar, room was perfect. All in all a great stay and I would recommend it to any of my friends 
22233 We stayed in the Sanctuary Hotel for four nights in our visit to New York. Location is fantastic: near Time Square. Staff very friendly and professional. The rooms are a little small but comfortable. Breakfast could be better! 
22234 Had a conference across the street where they wanted twice as much for a room. La quinta not only has free parking but also free internet access as well as a nice breakfast included. The room was spacious, with an ample desk, comfortable bed, and a great a/c. 
22235 Small rooms, yes, but the point of NYC is to get out. Very trendy. Would recomend for couples or singles. Not ideal for families. Very Euro vibe.Not crazy expensive compared with other trendy hotels like the varios Thompsons. Bar/club is great for a drink even late as you're coming back 
22236 the staff is truly a delight and very eager to serve; the suite accommodation is more than you might expect; the dining is superior; highly recommended 
22237 This hotel is not that bad. the rooms are not the most stylish as they are made for holiday makers that just get drunk and have kids charging around the rooms. The location is 10/10 the cost is also 10/10 but the actual rooms themselves are 6/10 
22238 Stayed at the New Yorker for two nights. From check in it was a pleasure to stay here. Receptionist was lovely and made us feel at home straight away. Room was bright and airy. For such a big hotel that was busy it was surprisingly quite. 
22239 Hip atmosphere. Great rooms. Very helpfull staff. Great location. Hi-speed wireless internet. This hotel has everything i wanted or needed. Would stay here again! 
22240 The first few times I visited I used this hotel for location.However the last two visits the rooms have been refurbished and what a difference.I now will always use the hotel out of choice for location,staff,service and pleasant rooms. 
22241 Found the hotel rooms were clean. For the price and the location, I would well recomended it for a stay in New York if you are watching the budget. Obviously if you want 4 star accomadation pay the extra price. But i could not see a problem with the hotel. 
22242 The staff was friendly and helpfull. There is a renovation around the reception but it didn't bother us at all. Deluxe queen room is very small. It can not accomodate 2 large luggages. Overall it was a good experience, recommend chandler hotel to all. 
22243 I had an incredible night at On The Ave. We had a huge room with a great view of the city. The staff was friendly and super helpful. We were given early check in and extended check out without any problems or issues. I can't wait to come back!! 
22244 We love the location of this hotel. We stayed on the 21st floor that over looked the river at Wolf pointe. Very nice view. Easy to get around. The staff was nice. 
22245 Es gibt sicher modernere Hotels in NY, das WA ist und bleibt aber der grosse Klassiker. Super Lage, zu Fuss alles erreichbar von 5 Av, Times Square, Central park... prima Service und alles in allem ein gutes Verhaeltnis zwischen dem Preis und der Leistung. 
22246 I travel to New York often and this hotel ranks as my favorite. It's excellent value for the money and is located a block from the center of the known universe (Times Square) but still manages to be peaceful. 
22247 Lovely Hotel in a quite neighbourhood. Just what you need after the madness of manhattan. Family Room for 2 adults and 2 Teenagers. Very modern decor, spotlessly clean and spacious. Only complaint, could have had heavy curtains on windows as the roller blinds failed to block out the light. 
22248 this hotel is all about location. It's a short walk to many theaters, restaurants, and is right in Times Square. Good location for family with teens. The room is plain, but comfortable. Plumbing in bathroom is showing its age. 
22249 very good hotel in all sense but no pick up from airport 
22250 The first room was unbelievably awful; the 2nd. had peeling paint, stained carpet, useless shower that dripped and was generally grungy. Never again. 
22251 Tres bel hotel, si vous pouvez le trouver a un bon prix. Le personnel est tres efficace, a l'ecoute. vraiment tres bien, chambres enormes et spacieuse, belle decoration ... tout pour passer un bon sejour 
22252 Goed hotel, behulpzame en vriendelijke medewerkers. Kamer was goed en erg comfortabel,met een super bed. We hadden 1 ochtend een klein beetje last van de kamer naast ons, we hadden verbindingsdeuren tussen de kamers die niet fantastisch geisoleerd waren. 
22253 I appreciated the extra attention the staff at check-in, and then the next day at the reception desk, gave to a local transport challenge I was facing. They made my stay a very smooth experience. Also, the breakfast staff were friendly and busy keeping the buffet in great shape 
22254 Excellent location , very central , close to sub-way, ideal for business travellers, no crazy prices, good size room/bed, clean, good service, good restaurant. so far my choice nr1 for stay in Manhattan , great value for money 
22255 I was caught in a last minute spot to book a hotel for business trip. The rooms are very clean, and the hotel is located close to mid town office. The rate was good tho, so hard to complain too much. 
22256 The hotel location was excellent and the room was clean tidy and everything we needed just for a place to rest at night as we made the most of the city by day. Would use Radisson Hotels in the future. 
22257 The staff was convenient and efficient. In Particular, Laurelin Hefter was of exceptional assistance with the printing, scanning and e-mailing of critical business documents that I needed for the day in a very tight timeframe. 
22258 I would definitely stay here again. Very nice hotel, nice rooms, lobby, and bar/restaurant. It is within easy walking distance to Michigan Ave. For $120 dollars, this was an awesome deal. See you again. 
22259 I would not stay here even if they pay me. The WORST hotel at which I've ever stayed. It's 10 times worse than what you can possibly imagine of a bad hotel. It's so very nasty. I couldn't stand it even with my eyes closed. 
22260 I was staying here during a trade show, it's close to Nordstroms and many places to eat, but the hotel itself is nothing special. The rooms have very few outlets, so it is hard to charge electronics, and the bathroom is very small... 
22261 this is a great hotel. the staff is helpful, courteous and professional. the rooms are really nice, clean and well-sized for nyc. the room service and restaurants are expensive but the food and service are both very good. it's a pleasure staying at this hotel from check-in to check-out. 
22262 I had a great stay at this hotel. Keep the blinds closed as there is nothing to look at out the window. It was warm and comfortable. Plenty of room for me and all my shopping. 
22263 The pierre is located on 5th avenue the best street in all of new york! all the shopping and site seeing is on 5th avenue, just by walking along the street i enjoyed myself. The pierre is a luxurious and great hotel with great facilities and restaraunts. 
22264 The hotel is located inside the airport. A huge advantage for overnight travelers who need some real shut eye. We ended up with a 13 hour layover through the night. The hotel has a great restaurant and is quick to get to via the airport train. 
22265 Great location ,cost effective sandwiched between Soho, little italy,noltia,and Chinatown, small but clean rooms ,decent breakfast, good staff,close to the Manhattan & Brooklyn bridges & the Financial district! 
22266 Checked into the Muse Hotel after staying in Midtown East for 3 nights. Renovations had just completed! Lobby looks fantastic and the bar is a beautiful quiet space, and only 1/2 block from Times Square. - Nightly Complementary wine bar - Great staff - Great location - Free Internet 
22267 Very helpful and friendly staff in a good location in New York. I will stay there again on my next trip. 
22268 Awesome , fantastic & great place to be at. Chill out in the pool and enjoy the hospitality and care taken to make your stay comfortable. Spacious Self contained rooms and suites , Internet fast 24/7 and staff courteous. 
22269 The hotel was centrally located. Rooms were clean and a good size. I would recommend it as a good bargain for the money 
22270 No air conditioning, rooms were hot. Our room faced the street which was quite loud. We would definitely stay here again but would ask for a room away from the street. Good location. Police station across the street. Clean rooms. Great price! 
22271 This place was horrid. The room was filthily, furniture old, scuffed and barely standing. The beds were narrow and uncomfortable. Management was cool and unreceptive. The street noise was loud and distracting. The weight room claustrophobic. Other than that it is in a great location. 
22272 Stayed at this hotel for a weekend. Great location. Busy lobby. Room was small (like almost impossible to walk around the bed to get to the bathroom, had to climb over the other person). Some furniture a bit worn. Staff was helpful and rate was good for New York. 
22273 I was surprised when I walked into the room. It was very clean and the bed was comfortable! Great hotel for the price! 
22274 Loved the suites and hotel. Very clean, and the staff was very friendly. Very nice suites and the price was great. 
22275 Near everything. No restaurants on site, but with so many nearby It is ok. Ask for a corner room, high up as possible. Good concierge. 
22276 We loved the location of this hotel in the center of everything in Chicago. The room was on the small side but very comfortable and pleasant. Our view of the Chicago River was spectacular. I would definitely stay there again. 
22277 This hotel was very nice and in a great location to both Kemah and Galveston. Close by is a mall and lots of restaurants to choose from. Breakfast was good and rooms were nice and quiet. 
22278 I can't say enough about this hotel. Perfect location, very clean, helpful staff........ especially Tom, who went above and beyond to make sure my husband and I were comfortable. I would definitely stay here again. Thanks! 
22279 Would gladly stay there again. Nice staff, good overall experience. 
22280 very pleasent stay, good stuff, well located, nice rooms, very clean hotel... 
22281 After reading reviews we didn't know what to expect but we really enjoyed our stay. Loved Kitty O'Shea's Pub and for a change enjoyed being close to Millenium and Grant Park versus our normal North Michigan Avenue. Red line to Wrigley Field was 1 1/2 blocks away. 
22282 Great attention to detail! Staff was so nice and accomodating! Had a wonderful stay! 
22283 It is worn, but Ok, so if the aim is to get a bed as a tourist in New York City is an excellent hotel for the price. It is located right next to subway, 30 meters and it takes 10 minutes by subway to downtown. 
22284 Small but cozy rooms. Nice decor, and friendly service. Location in the heart of the flower district. Wake up early and walk the streets as the flower deliveries arrive on the streets. Incredible sight and smell. Also go to the top floor for the Rooftop Bar. 
22285 Arrived late but shuttle pick up was quick and courteous. Hotel was standard fare for the price range but rooms were fairly large. Breakfast was again standard fare but with good selection in pleasant surroundings. Would have no trouble staying for a similar purpose again. 
22286 Perfectly located, comfortable and excellent lounge (the M Bar). Rooms were typical NYC - small but at least not dark and very comfortable. Great value. 
22287 Great place to stay in new York !Clise to everything in soho area 
22288 Nice size rooms 
22289 Went to NYC for the Thanksgiving Weekend. The Marriott Marquis in Times Square was very efficient checking us in and the service was nice. We performed a thorough bed bug inspection and room 1516 was clean and clear. No problems and we had a fantastic weekend. 
22290 The Kimberly is perfectly situated for most of the main attractions in Manhattan. The room was spacious and clean. The staff were outstanding. My only issue is, I would have preferred to be on a higher floor, as the street noise made sleeping difficult. 
22291 I agree with Colmiri, great location, the ambiance of a European boutique hotel, great value on Hotwire, professional, friendly, attentive staff. Rooms are small but decorated nicely with a retro, trendy, updated look. Highly recommended! 
22292 Tres bon sejour dans cet hotel abordable pour ny et ultra modern, des bons petits muffins au matin , un personnel jeune et sympatique , des expessos gratuits dans la piece des conso a chaque etage j y retournerai 
22293 Hotel bastante decente, habitaciones grandes, bien situado y sin ruidos. Desayuno gratis de cafe y muffins de varios tipos (deliciosos) 
22294 We absolutely loved out stay in NYC at the TIME - location was perfect - room was "hip" and the staff was so friendly ! We especially enjoyed meeting Andre and Chris - We will be back for sure! 
22295 En plein Times Square ,metro a 20 metres! notre chambre tres petite mais tout le confort. Bruyant a cause des clims exterieurs; Personnels tres affables et disponibles. Cout tres interessant vu sa localisation. 
22296 I highly recommend the W New York. We were treated with such professional customer service by Cindy Cabrera who went out of her way to ensure that our trip was special. We were celebrating our anniversary and she made sure that we felt pampered and valued. Thanks Cindy! 
22297 Gorgeous, excellent location, warm staff, so comfortable, quiet rooms, can only say wonderful things about the Surrey and our stay there. 
22298 very kind and sympathetic waitress Dee. good service and normal room. I liked it 
22299 My stay at Hotel Blake was excellent. The service was excellent, the rooms were clean and large. The bathroom was large and the rainshower showerhead was a treat! The front desk, valet as well as the housekeeping staff were all very accomodating. The hotel's location is fabulous-close to many attractions. 
22300 An incredible experience - having lived in NYC I am always loathed to pay to stay there - I will definitely be staying at the Gansevoort again. The hotel experience and location guarantee a return visit when the roof top pool is in full effect. 
22301 This hotel was in a great location right across from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden. Service was good, folks were nice. Rooms small but clean and nicely decorated. Just don't eat there...menu prices were way too high!! 
22302 Everything fine except that the internet did not work in our room. Had to go down to the lobby to get it working (still annoyingly slow speed) 
22303 In april 08 and may 09 I stayed with my girlfriend in this hotel. We will come back there everytime. Nice service, situated perfectly and very nice rooms! 
22304 I was a first time guest of the hotel June 18-20. Great location to the major mall, Galeria. It was a 2 minute walk from the hotel. My room was huge! Good AC ,which is a must. Bed was awesome. The free internet was slow, but still usefull. 
22305 Very nice, comfortable and clean room. Convenient location. Good breakfast. Absolutely recommendable. Definitely would stay there again. 
22306 I will return to this hotel when in NYC. 2 blocks to the subway, great walking neighborhoods all around it. The breakfast is very good, everything was good, no complaints at all. 
22307 The lobby looks great, the website looks nice, the rooms are disgusting. This place is a dump. I would not stay here again if it were the last room available in NYC. I would opt for Jersey City or other location. Worn carpet, draperies appeared to never have been washed. 
22308 ottima posizione vicino metro buoni ristoranti nei dintorni quartiere sicuro da consigliare stanze nuove ben tenute unico difetto porte non insonorizzate area per la colazione piccola dopo le ore nove fila 
22309 We have stayed here three times during our visits to New York. We are returning in July because of the very reasonable prices..nice location, big rooms and good breakfast!!! 
22310 Stayed for a week and loved the food at Normas and the burger joint. Also loved the location is to die for. The room was large but the bathroom is tiny. We had a view of central park. Fantastic. 
22311 Nice, clean place, with friendly manager and staff. Good bedding, recently renovated. Beautiful lobby. Pleasant location near Columbia University. Well above the average. 
22312 My husband and I just spent 6 nights at this l wonderful hotel. The location,shops, restaurants and bars were great and we loved the cobble stone streets. It was quiet and very clean and the staff was very helpful. 
22313 This hotel is very centrally located. We walked to N Michigan Ave for shopping, the Navy Pier and also Millennium Park. Very clean - super friendly. There is so much to do within walking distance. I would stay here again!! 
22314 Stayed here for two nights in April, uneventful and happy with everything apart from having to pay to park my car. Staff were very courteous, the room was clean and the bed comfortable. 
22315 A melhor localizacao,proximo de tudo o que temos para conhecer em NY,voltarei com certeza,e recomendo;Times Square 10 minutos a pe,fast food a escolher,metro em frente,excelente!!! Valter e Sonia(familia) Campinas-SP 
22316 Un super hotel. Tres bien situe, un design innovant et une ambiance tres jeune. Les chambres sont tres jolies mais trop petites (un inconvenient tres courant a New York). 
22317 I found out about this hotel via Tripadvisor and I can tell you the reviews were right on the money. The place is excellent, very clean, and the the service is impeccable. I think this hotel is one best places to stay in Chicago without spending a fortune. 
22318 Great location on the upper West Side near restaurants and shops. Short taxi or train to theater district. Wonderful staff ... from the front desk to the housekeepers ... especially Enrique who ran to the corner in the rain (twice) to get us a taxi. I'm going back!!! 
22319 I stay here ever time I visit New York. Super value in a quite residential area. The staff is always very friendly and helpful. This visit, Betsy at the front desk was very helpful in straightening out a problem with my reservation. 
22320 un hotel muy bueno, exelente ubicacion.. y una atencion personalizada! y las camas muy buenas! ahaha:p 
22321 great location but will never return. hotel lobby looked amazing but rest of hotel was a discrase. asked to use the toilet whilst waiting to check in- grose!!!!! Blood on floor and seat untouchable. rooms very very dirty and bathroom was even worse 
22322 clean, good service, close to all important transport links - and above all an amazing view on the empire state building!!!! 
22323 Seriously Times Square is a place you walk through once, not live in. This is a cool hotel with great service but I would prefer to stay in Chelsea, the village or midtown East to experience new york. 
22324 Tremendously done, clean, well appointed, we really enjoyed our stay and will be back. 
22325 Alles Spitze, sehr sauber und alle sehr hifsbereit und freundlich 
22326 Situated across the street from Rockefeller Center, this hotels provides great access to local attractions, public transportation, and an easy walk to 5th Ave. stores and Times Square area. Room prices were very reasonable (~$200/night) and hotel amenities were excellent. Highly recommended and would stay there again without hesitation. 
22327 I read the two horrible reviews above and was very nervous, since I had already booked at this hotel. However, my room was very clean and the people that worked there were wonderful. Clearly this is no luxury hotel, but for the price and location... I'd stay there again. 
22328 Broke up with my GF on this trip. but this hotel still made my NY trip fun. 
22329 Stayed at hotel for weekend. Very impressed for big city location. Ideal for most venues, staff were friendly and helpful and we really enjoyed our stay. Booked it having read previous reviews and not disappointed. 
22330 Location great for all venues. Comfortable bed and clean room as well as quiet at a reasonable rate. It's a historic old world place with great service. Not our first time here and I would definately return. 
22331 Elevator didn't work right. Room is old and has maintenace issues. Ran out of food at Breakfast and some items weren't replenished. Desk clerk (night) was not freindly or helpful, never smiled. Day clerk was friendly and helpful and cheerful. 
22332 The Pierre is in a perfect position on 61st and Fifth beside the bottom of Central Park. Our room was excellent with an ultra modern bathroom, small bath but very large separate shower. The bed's are extremely comfortable and the room was spotlessly clean. 
22333 Very nice hotel, with great location. Good value for money 
22334 Excellent location , friendly and helpful staff. 
22335 Breakfast was also very good. Rooms were small and clean.The only downside was the noise from the construction site across the road, which started around 6.30 each morning. However we would stay there again. 
22336 I stayed here for 4 nights. Nice location, the staff were friendly when I needed them. The view from the room wasnt great but hey I wasnt in the room most of the time anyway. 
22337 The hotel is located in a very nice location few blocks from times square. I enjoyed my stay there, the room was clean and nicely decorated. The price is reasonable in comparison to other hotels and staff is really friendly. Overall i would rank it as a very good !! 
22338 Convenient location. Our air conditioner control was fluky, but otherwise the room was comfortable and clean. Nice hotel restaurant and lounge - decent food and not outrageous hotel prices. They even had happy hour $5 Margaritas. 
22339 King and Grove personnel went above and beyond to assure our comfort and accomodate my traveling companions condition. The room was spacious and the beds were comfortable. Even late at noght they sent an engineer to address a problem with the refrigerator. Definitely recommend this hotei! 
22340 During a five-day stay we encountered numerous problems. The elevator was out of commission (we walked 11 flights), our bathtub had hairs in the drain (not our hair), the sink did not drain, could not reach the desk via telephone to leave a wake-up call. The breakfasts, however, were wonderful. 
22341 Oustanding service. Wonderful modern rooms. Extrmely courteous staff. 
22342 Such a nice and friendly place. In a great location and pretty decor. Awesome that The House of Blues is right there, and many other fun things right within walking distance. Great bar too, with the best hummus I've ever had. Lots of fun. 
22343 I highly recommend this hotel. Every amenity available. I felt like I was the only guest. The service is AMAZING!!! I can't think of enough adjectives to describe this wonderful stay. Going back in July. Rooms are huge and amazing! Hurry and book your next trip at the TRYP!!! 
22344 Nice place, modernistic decor, nice view from high floors, wood floors, outstanding staff that make you feel welcome. The location is convenient to everything in midtown like Rockefeller Center, Fith Ave, Times Square, and subway station. 
22345 Stayed here for a "girls night"holiday visit to NYC! Very SPACIOUS like home accommodations. We were upgraded to a larger suite on arrival at no additional charge, just 3 of us, next time we can double our group comfortably! GREAT experience, want to bring my family in the spring:) 
22346 We traveled to NY for our honeymoon. We loved staying at the OMNI Berkshire Place. We loved the rooms, service, food and location. I would definately recommend this hotel. 
22347 Great location in the middle of times square, but the rooms are quiet and the bar/lobby on the first floor make it seem like miles from your actual location. Rooms are great and bed was very comfortable. 
22348 Great hotel nothing spectacular, the price is right, but the location was awesome. Right in the middle walking distance from everything!! 
22349 This was our first time visiting New York City. Our room was excellent!!!! The staff was very polite and very informative. We've decided the only way we'll visit again is if we can stay at the Renaissance. I highly recommend them!!!! 
22350 pas mal mais sans plus, ce n est pas le grand luxe mais on s y sent bien. Pour l 'ascenceur faut etre patient, on etait au 10 etage et plusieurs fois nous avons descendre a pied. Mare d attendre un ascenceur qui ne vient pas. 
22351 The team at the Dream Downtown knows how to show you a good time. We gathered around the pool for cocktails. It's perfect - you can dance outside and then lounge on a comfy chair :) Wait staff are super friendly! You won't be disappointed and even more so...pleasantly surprised. 
22352 rooms are like a crypt. windowless, tiny, dark. missing toiletries, broken safe. simply a disgrace to charge $280 for this place. embarrassing. worst value for money in NYC i have every encountered. staff lacks 
22353 Good location, average room for a huge price tag. If you're gonna spend that kinda money for a night, NY has better hotels to offer. 
22354 This hotel deserves the positive reviews it gets and i'd recommend it for anyone looking for a home from home in NYC. I've stayed here a few times now and, at the right price, i'd always consider it when in NYC. 
22355 Comfy beds, clean room and bathroom. Very good value. About 30 minutes drive from downtown Chicago. Free parking, and free wi-fi. I feel safe staying there. 
22356 The room is excellent and clean, and it has a complete kitchen. The staff are great! Kind, friendly and extremely helpful. The location is great too, near the Grand Station and the 42th street. Definitely a great option in Manhattan. 
22357 Nothing fancy, but serviceable and clean. Bed was good. Bathroom was nicely decorated, good shower. I wouldn't really call this in Chelsea, which is a few blocks west and south. 
22358 Excellent Hotel next to Macys and the Empire State Building, great location. You can walk to Times Square in 10 minutes too. Comfortable Beds, OK the rooms are quite small but have everything you need. I would definitely stay again. 
22359 Been here twice and had a different experience from the last it was serberb the food was really good and the rooms were really awesome and had excellent service in the club and out. 
22360 This hotel was really great, location just off Time Square was perfect, rooms clean and tidy, staff really friendly but didnt eat as food and drink expensive. Would recomend 
22361 The lobby in the Waldorf Astoria is impressive and it is well-located. However our room was quite small and in general it was nothing special. I wouldn't particularly recommend it unless you get a good deal (which we did). 
22362 Chosen for convenience/location for business meetings, was pleasantly surprised by size and style of room, friendliness and helpfulness of staff (including unasked for upgrade), and good breakfast. 
22363 Hotel posizionato nel cuore del centro finanziario e molto comodo per raggiungere le altre zone di New York. Camere ottime per pulizia, insonorizzazione e dimensione. Prezzi abbordabili. Unica pecca l'area breakfast un po' sacrificata, per il resto ve lo consiglio. 
22364 Shockingly poor service. I've stayed in nicer rooms at a Holiday Inn Express If you are willing to pay these rates, stay at a nice hotel - Sofitel, Radisson, Ritz-Carliton. 
22365 Elevators are a challenge getting to and from your hotel room. Service was great and the location is right off Michigan Avenue! 
22366 Hotel was clean and quiet, since there are not very many rooms. Very comfortable accommodations. Small room, but that's to be expected in NYC. Good location. Would definitely go back again. 
22367 Bylismy tam w czerwcu 2010 roku, blisko do Central Park i 5Av, Broadway itp. Bardzo duzy hotel, BUSY ale ok. Polecam. 
22368 We were pleased with our stay and found the staff very hospitable and accommodating of a special need. We return to Houston for another appointment in this area in January and intend to return to the Omni as well. 
22369 Great location, reasonable conference rates, small but clean & tidy rooms, free wireless at a business hotel! Convenient to Blue Line Jackson station 
22370 We recently stayed at the Sheraton during a overnight layover in Houston. The room was nice, the restaurant service was fast and good and open late, and the shuttle driver was friendly and fast. I would recommend this hotel and would stay there again. Beds were comfortable. 
22371 awesome hotel! very cool decor and atmosphere, the place was like a club on fri/sat nights. excellent views and proximity to subway, high line, all of Manhattan Check out photos from my stay here: http://urbanarchitecturenow.blogspot.com/2012/03/dream-downtown-hotel-nyc.html 
22372 Great location, right in the heart of everything. Great for walking around all the sights my teens loved it. The inside of the lobby atrium is spectacular. 
22373 I used an offer from TripAdvisor. So Thanks a lot TripAdvisor :) 
22374 I was in this hotel for two days and i had the worst service i never had. The General Manager of the place was acting like an italian mafious and the service was disgusting, long check in and room unconfortable 
22375 I stayed there for one night with some friends of mine. I really like the hotel's location and the price was quite reasonnable. The room was good size and beds comfortable. Will probably go there again on my next trip to NY 
22376 Have stayed at several HI Exp: Jacksonville, Florida, San Francisco and Houston. All have been good. This Houston property exceeded expectations. Every staff member was professional, pleasant, helpful and went out of their way to make sure we received excellent service. 
22377 What a great hotel! Right on the Park and walking distance to Madison and Fifth Avenue shops. The rooms are brand new and spacious, the staff superb, my favorite spa in the world! (La Prarie) and the afternoon tea is great, the restaurant is pretty good too. 
22378 Great location, clean room, (quite small, the sink doubled as a bed side table!), friendly staff, what more does one need for the price! And a big TV to watch Saved by the Bell as we woke up! Would def recommend it! 
22379 We stayed there for 10 nights. Nothing to complain. Some people and the check in is not very friendly. Excellent situated. Tik Tok Dinner at hotel highly recommended. Our room was a bid small but had a beautifull view. 
22380 Great experience once again!!! Friendly staff and a great location. Fun bar within the hotel. Very close to the recording studio I work out of. Thanks once again TIME staff!! Best, SB 
22381 Great location, beautiful building, superb decoration, great architecture. Great service. Concierges answers in any language with excellent information. Large and luxury rooms, well equipped, clean, calm. WiFi with charge in the rooms and free in the lobby. A must in NYC. Only regret, no buffet for breakfast. 
22382 Nice hotell, well situated close to Central Park and Museum of Natural History. Beds were hard, though, and I didn't get a thin pillow although I asked for it by the booking, several months in advance. Clean. 
22383 Great, modern hotel. Convenient location. Rooms very clean (though compact!) with quiet air conditioning. Although full breakfast not included, free tea/coffee and muffins are available between 7 and 10 am. 
22384 Booked a group of 17 for a week to attend an Institute; everything from the contract for rooms, check-in, services and food was outstanding and exceeded our expectations. Great location and terrific staff. 
22385 The roof terrace isn't too bad either, nice view down on the city life 
22386 Our experience at the Skyline Hotel was great. Our family of five was very comforable in the Jr. suite. Two TV's was an added plus, and the indoor pool was great. It served our family needs well. 
22387 Het hotel is erg eenvoudig, echter wel schoon en vrij ruim. Wij zaten op de vijfde verdieping, wat zonder lift elke keer wel een hele beklimming was. Verder vriendelijk personeel, een lekker ontbijt en de perfecte locatie. 
22388 I spent two nights in this hotel at a business trip. Nice service excellent location, very quite room. Very clean! I can only recommend the hotel. I did not test the food since I had no time 
22389 Superb customer service, excellent food, well appointed room, great view of CIty Centre, did I say superb customer service? Worth repeating. I will happily stay here monthly on business travel, and hope to enjoy this fantastic property for pleasure travel also. 
22390 The great advantage to this place is its location. Rooms are small but fully equipped. If you have to fly out early, this place is ideal. If you want anything resembling a visit to Chicago with its great shopping and great restaurants, this isn't it. 
22391 Stayed in Morgans for a couple of nights in May and am really pleased with the hotel. The room was clean & tastefully decorated, the location is also very good; will definitely stay here again. 
22392 abbiamo usato sofitel in molte citta e questo non vale il prezzo che fanno pagare.la nostra stanza e' piccola con un veduta dei "tetti"di NY.c'e' un rumore sordo e continuo ,giorno e notte,che non fa riposare! di sicuro non tornero'! l'albergo e' pulito e il personale e' molto gentile. 
22393 The location in Chinatown is great, but it's the only good thing about this hotel. It would be ok if it cost 10$/night, but it doesn't. Look elsewhere. The rooms are very small, and you can hear anything what your neighbors do. Wifi doesn't work properly. Shared bathrooms are dirty. 
22394 Excellent room, location, and service at the New York Palace. Will definitely be back. 
22395 Small rooms but adequate. Wish there was a fridge and that the air con was a little quieter. A happy atmosphere, old fashioned/comfortable. Mostly very helpful. The in room safe stopped working and asked several times to have it fixed but no one came. 
22396 Stanze confortevoli e pulite, angolo cottura comodo e fornito, colazione semplice ma buona, nei giorni non festivi aperitivo abbondante gratuito, postazioni internet comode, posizione ottima vicino alla zona di Times Square. 
22397 I'd been Miami Standard Hotel. It was nice, but New York is better than I expected. I should go back there next trip to NYC. 
22398 Es un time share, obviamente no es de las mejores instalaciones ni lo mas lujoso es tipo self service, sencillo, sin lujos 
22399 pero MUY BIEN UBICADO a una calle de broadway, a 2 mas o menos de central park, y 2 de la quinta avenida, que mas se puede pedir? 
22400 Located in Asian section of Houston, one can easily walk to great restaurants and bars with no problem. A little noisy, it is relatively close to the freeway. Well managed, staff is on point. Overall good experience for me, will return. 
22401 Very reasonable price. If you are looking for a place to stay in NY with reasonable price, easy access to Time Square, this is the one. 
22402 and really pleasant decoration and mood art deco. 250 dollars, all included, breakfast included, by booking.com in plain august. A good price. 
22403 great location. The hotel was recently renovated.The staff was very helpful. They offer a good deal for overnight parking. 
22404 Great hotel value. New everything. Not a hotel to hang out in, but a great new hotel with efficient Euro Style rooms and decent gym and other amenities. Good value. Convenient to Rockefeller Center and other spots. 
22405 Room was dark but comfy. They had good facilities including wifi and auto check in. Would definitely stay again. 
22406 Amazing mattress, cool showers and a great bar! Only sore point: not enough room to put clothes away. 
22407 we spend most of our honeymoon at hotel bentley. very nice hotel, the staff was very helpfull, the room was clean and tidy everyday. the only small problem is the the nearest subway station is about a quarter of an hour away. 
22408 It's only one block from Times Square! Easy to get to subway. Friendly staff and I love that quiet room. This hotel is perfect for those who want to stop over 1 night shopping in NY. Reasonable price! 
22409 Only thing missing was a king size bed. Rooms were a little cramped but everything was there. 
22410 Great location, reasonnably priced for Time Square and fantastic service 
22411 I have stayed at this hotel 3 nights and i would like to stay again at this hotel on my next trip to NY.Rooms are very clean , Location is very good and Staffs are really friendly and gently. I really recommend this hotel to travelers of New York..)) 
22412 What can you expect at this price in Manhattan? Location is just perfect, the hotel is clean, although rooms are very small and noisy. The only real problem was our bed: it was noisy and uncomfortable, and every time you changed your position during the night you woke up... 
22413 Ultimate Customer Service and Luxury for both business and pleasure. Easy access to all downtown business and recreational sites that I needed. 
22414 Rooms are very small but location is the best. Close to everything. Kelly and Shawn at the front desk were great! 
22415 Just back from this great ilttle gem in midtown manhattan. Have no negatives about this hotel - food, rooms, location, service etc all excellent. We will be back! 
22416 As a relocated native New Yorker, it was a delight to visit my home town and stay at the SoHo Grand. Every member of the staff from managers to housekeeping couldn't have been nicer. The atmosphere is one of downtown sophistication, the service is like being at a family estate. 
22417 Thank you Judy at the front desk for making arrangements to have room all ready for check -in early morning. Doubletree was extreamly clean and the rooms were fairly larger than other Hilton properties around the area. All staff i can encouter with were extreamly helpful and courtious. Again, Thanks! 
22418 Hotel rooms very comfortable and clean. Helpful staff and free breakfast.No amenities near Hotel, but very good value. 
22419 employees were outstanding service was above expectations room amenities needed attention and it was provided will be returning to stay again 
22420 Not sure if there is a place in NYC without noise at night. However, it should have occurred to me that there would be construction noise at Ground Zero. I just didn't figure it would go all night long. Anyway, the room was small, but pleasant. Had everything we needed. 
22421 1st stayed at the metro hotel in Feb 2011 2nd time 18th Dec 2011 for 4 nights Once again the room, breakfast and the service we received from the friendly staff was 1st class,could not find fault with the hotel well pleased. 
22422 This place does seem older but it has charcter like the Chelsea without all the famous guests. Being a tourist I did feel uncomfortable sleeping and I didn't like leaving the key at the desk when we left.. We were attending a concert at the Double Door. 
22423 Ook al vonden wij de 2-persoonskamer klein (je kon met moeite je koffer kwijt), de kamer was echt netjes, prima bed en een heerlijke douche. Alles was heel schoon. De inrichting is modern en de lobby van het hotel zeer sfeervol en modern. 
22424 3rd rate hotel in an inconvenient part of town, the hospitality is lacking, and the restaurant is trying too hard (almost like a restaurant in some other city trying to imitate a New York restaurant). There are too many nice places to stay in NYC, don't bother with this one. 
22425 Me and my brother stayed there for 4nights it not far from time square just a short cab ride away .I am thinking about booking for next year. The room was just the right size and the service was spot on. .... 
22426 We had a blast after getting married with a trip to NYC at the W. Gina was the best cocktail server and took care of us all night. She even had a bottle of wine delivered to our room in celebration of our nuptials. Will definitely come back again. 
22427 Service, convenience of Magnificent Mile.. Room and price great, Employees were ALL wonderful. I would definitely return. 
22428 Great location can walk almost every where near good restaurant as well. 
22429 I was surprised by the rooms. The bunk bed room wasn't as small as I was expecting. Clean and comfortable beds and well set out rooms with everything you need. Close to Grand Central. Wifi that worked and the roof top bar has an amazing view over New York. 
22430 Nice location on 6th avenue, however the rooms, as most in nyc are relatively small and noisy but this is NYC I believe. Some rooms have been revamped and are more pleasant mine, had only a shower which was enough being on my own (and never taking bath!). 
22431 Great central location, no matter what your plans. 
22432 Best location,excellent service.Best value Manhatten can offer at resonable prices. 
22433 Great location an excellent service The room was just too small for 2 people for 4 nights Great cocktail bat 
22434 great location close to Time Square and subway stations. Good service and friendly staff. 
22435 Great Hotel , Very Clean and Great location. it is smack bang in the middle of everything so you can get to anywhere in Manhattan easily. the rooms are amazing and the beds really are heavenly. 
22436 Amazing... It is all I have to say... A dream-come-true.... The staff is amazing... Even got an upgrade without asking.... Just amazing... 
22437 Great location to explore! Chinatown, Little Italy, Canal street...good starting point for seeing that part of town. Stephen at the front desk was so welcoming and personable! Everyone there was friendly and helpful. Room was clean, really comfy bed and a screaming hot shower! I'd stay there again. 
22438 I stayed here only for a day. Its very comfortable hotel and I wish I could have stayed longer. 
22439 This hotel is just amazing. The rooms are quite large for NY standard and are very comfortable and clean. The service is excellent as is the location.South side of Central Park with easy access to Carnegie Hall, 5th Avenue, Times Square and and and. 
22440 Been to hundreds of hotels and this one is definitely top shelf. Can't say enough. Service, attitude, location, ambiance, food and drink. No detail is overlooked. 
22441 I even took pictures it was so bad! Earlier discriptions of dim lighting don't describe it enough. I took pictures of exposed light bulbs and mold around the sink and tub. The staff was dogmatic and condescending---very unaccomodating. Probably my worst stay on Central Park South. 
22442 excellent location as just off Michigan Ave and next to Northwestern Univ medical complex. Rooms are comfortable and well appointed. Tracee at front desk sets the tone for professionalism and courtesy. All at the people at concierge desk are great 
22443 location hard to beat. Compared to other NYC hotels, the rooms are huge to. The corridors and carpets may be a little tired but that is a very small negative in what otherwise is a great deal. 
22444 Hotel elegante, accogliente, pulito. Se vuoi soggiornare a New York qui ti sentirai come a casa. Personale disponibile e ospitale. Camere spaziose e comodissime (letti super). Colazione semplice e gradevole. Posizione comoda a 2 passi da time square. Complessivamente un'ottima soluzione per soggiornare nella grande mela. 
22445 Myself and a couple of my friends stayed at this Courtyard as a mini vacation away from husbands and kids.. very accomdating and the perfect location to everything we wanted to see. I would highly reccomend this courtyard. Rooms are beautiful and breakfast was great :) 
22446 Great place, great location, close to the subway, super friendly and helpful staff. Very clean and comfortable beds, with great eatery's nearby. Try the church a few doors down, l don't think l have felt more welcomed any place in my life...... 
22447 We stayed at this Hotel for 6 nights and the location being the centre off Times Square is fantastic. We were on the 35th floor overlooking the Hudson River, the room size was well above our expectation and can confirm that our stay was one memorable. 
22448 Every thing worked and was what should be expected for this type of property and pricing. Good breakfast at a reasonable price. Nice staff members 
22449 Place is Clean, People Friendly, Free Parking Only complaint I have is the smell from the cleaners they use is too strong. 
22450 Stayed overnight. Room was small but well appointed. Bed was extremely comfortable. Small hotel with all amenities you need. i.e. fitness center, restaurant. Located on great street in NYC. and within walking distance of many sights yet far enough away from the crowds and noise. 
22451 Very convenient location, good facilities, great steak restaurant. Rooms were a good size. For a large international chain, surprising and Disappointing that there was no minibar or kettle in the room. 
22452 First trip to NYC - pleased to stay in central location - walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, Rockeafeller Sq to name a few. Very helpful and friendly staff with small but comfortable rooms. Not luxury but not priced that way either. 
22453 Das Hotel ist zwar ziemlich weit "Uptown" was aber nicht stoehrt, weil es zwei Strassen weiter eine Subway Station hat. Der Aufenthaltsraum, die Kueche und die Computer-Ecke sind sehr einladend und sauber. Die Zimmer und die Baeder haben alles notwendige und sind sauber, sind aber nichts spezielles. 
22454 I've stayed at the Yotel over 20 times this past year. All business travel and its been great each time. Friendly staff, clean rooms, exceptional dining and rooftop experience. I recommend it to everyone who's traveling to NYC. 
22455 To stay at the park lane u should stay at the new rooms with the park view.......its more expansive but worth. The local its excelente...to the apple store, FAO Schwarz, Plaza food court and in front ot he Central Park, I've been staying in this hotel since 1992. 
22456 Great location and great service at the hotel. The staff from the second that you walk in the door to the room service, bar, and front desk staff are all very helpful and amazing. 
22457 I was extremely please with the excellent service I received at the W Chicago. Outstanding staff, always welcoming with a smile, attentive and always making sure you have what you need. Definitely will be back at the W next time I visit Chicago. 
22458 We were both delighted with our choice of hotel. Great location,the best shops and restaurants all on our doorstep made our brief stay a real pleasure.Good service, helpful staff. Small room but adequate. Did not matter as we were out most of the time. 
22459 Pro: -location -clean -free Internet in the room (advertisement said only free Internet in the lobby) Con: -small room is ok, but super small bathroom is a little too small to me 
22460 Great hotel, staff very friendly always willing to please. Room comfortable and clean. 
22461 The Grand Dame van de New Yorkse hotels! Luxe alom, veel personeel wat dag en nacht voor je klaar staat. Kamer had iets groter gekunt maar was van alle gemakken voorzien. En je slaapt er alleen maar. Een hotel als dit maakt het verblijf in New York helemaal af. 
22462 Dirty towels Dirty walls Dirty rugs Dirty blankets... And so on 
22463 This is a good business hotel. The rooms are just fine and good for the business traveller. Concierge is helpful. Check in and out is efficient. I don't know that I would stay in this location for a personal trip but for business it works. 
22464 Great classic hotel. Comfy room, good shower. Everything available here. It was a nice experience for the kids, and when you stay here, it feels like you are staying at a tourist attraction. Beautiful old building with incredible art deco accents. Breakfast is only $95/person! 
22465 A rarity in NYC. I stayed four nights for business quite comfortably, simply, stylishly, and inexpensively. I will definitely stay here again. 
22466 lavori in corso all'ingresso(polvere,solventi ecc) stanza in pessimo stato pulizia della stanza pessima acqua calda quasi assente riscaldamento quasi assente, perdita di acqua e sfiati di vapore dal termosifone televisore anni 70 senza telecomando posizione ottima 
22467 Went for a friends wedding and had a glorious time. Staff bent over backwards to make sure everyone was looked after. We had an amazing evening. Food and drinks were delish. Amenities were spotless and extremely well kept. Perfect choice for a wedding location. 
22468 Hotel Mela was a great find right in the middle of Time Square. The rooms were a nice size (we stayed in an Executive room so it was a little larger), the staff was helpful and the bistro next door was great. 
22469 This is one of our favorite Manhattan hotels. Perfect Upper West Side location. The staff is terrific and accommodations are sophisticated and well appointed. 
22470 Loved everything about our stay here! Personal service from Jennifer upstairs and Walter downstairs was excellent. Just really enjoyed the overall experience of a small, quaint, clean, centrally located hotel. Will definitely book again. 
22471 Friendly, helpful staff, comfortable beds, quiet rooms, IPOD/MP3 dock, room safe, convenient location in garment district to Eataly, Hop On-Hop Off stop; has restaurant and roof top bar with view of Empire St. Bldg 
22472 Helpful Frienldy Staff!! Clean and neat. Close to subway and reasonable walk to the parks and waterfront. Good value for downtown. Will stay again on next visit. 
22473 My family and I went here and it was great!!!! We will be back again to see the BIG apple. 
22474 If you have a loved one at the Presbyterian Hospital, this could not be more ideal. You can walk into the hospital without ever going outside. Room was clean and comfortable. The parking was a bit pricey but typical of any city downtown location. 
22475 Un gran hotel! Habitaciones comodas, muy limpias, modernas con tv plazma en la pared. Camas grandes, muy agradables.Personal amable y muy eficaz. No dejeis de probar la espectacular piscina en la planta 32(creo)! Hay que tener gorro (obligatorio) y gafas de nadar. Volveria a este hotel en cualquier momento! 
22476 Rooms were great, quiet, clean & roomy. Staff was excellent - so friendly and helpful. Highly recommend. 
22477 We stayed 2 nights, family of 2 adults, youngster and one kid. Room was rather smaller, but sufficient for our stay, clean. We found hotel is greatly located for walking, subway with lots of restaurants & bars next door. The staff was very friendly, welcoming & helpful. 
22478 Small room which was not very clean. Ordered flowers for my wife to be in the room upon arrival but got them the second day. Disfunctional phone on the room. Bad front desk attitude. The location was the only positive thing about this experience. 
22479 We stayed here for 5 days and it really was a wonderful break. The hotel and staff were wonderful. Everything was first class and we will be back in the future. The beds were huge and very comfy, the room was very spacious and luxurious. 
22480 We were upgraded to a lovely suite with separate living room, and dining room area.The service was simply superlative.Room service very quick 
22481 Surely a MUST. 
22482 The hotel has big rooms by NYC standards. However, I found the bed uncomfortable, the rooms not very sound proof and really tacky with floral wall paper. The staff was very nice. I would not hesitate to stay here again if the price is right. 
22483 Very helpful staff, spacious bedroom and bathroom and a very comfortable bed. This is excellent value for its NYC location. 
22484 Great location for shopping, theatre and site seeing - third time and we'll be back 
22485 Basic hotel, a real bargain in Times Square, clean rooms, staff sometimes rude and ugly. 
22486 Excellent location for travel from IAH. Very friendly staff, free breakfast which was actually good. Even a small bar to relax in if you so desire. 
22487 Although you need to be under 30 to really enjoy the scene here the rooms are very nice and service very good. 
22488 They advertise great views from every room and they deliver. Spectacular! The room was far larger than I expected for this price in New York. The concierge's service was spot on. Even the bomb sniffing dog was not as intimidating as one would expect. Great location, great service, great experience. 
22489 Friendly helpful staff, clean rooms, reasonable price. All I need :) 
22490 If u have more than one luggage and u paid for regular room, Ask to have a bigger room (they've some regular rooms which are a little bit bigger) The location is Great, just couple of blocks from TimesSquare. Recommend if it has a good price 
22491 Loved this place. Warm and cosy and only five min walk to Macys. Stayed in two bedroom and the only reason I haven't given it top marks is because when we first checked in we were given wrong apartment and had to be moved. But other than that perfect! 
22492 Excellent hotel, wel positioned, the elevators are a bit slow. Fitness ok, few recumbents, running machines etc 
22493 Great location near Union Square. Olives restaurant on site. Friendly service. But rooms are starting to look tired and need some refreshing; decor drab and dark which doesn't help traditionally small NYC guest rooms. Gorgeous historic building however. 
22494 Booked this room with holiday inn points. The room was amazing with the living room seperate from the sleeping area. Fabulous location. Would stay here again! 
22495 Stayed there on business April 25-28, 2012. Cheddars next door which is convienient. One of the nicest and upscale Holiday-Inns I've stayed at. The beds were great! The shuttle driver, Hazel drove us around the Westheimer area to find places to eat. I would stay there again. 
22496 keys never worked, had to get a new key 5 times in 2 days, was told it neede a new keypad, then get one, elevators horrible 
22497 We stayed at the Hilton O'Hare when we had an early morning flight to Toronto. Nothing beats sleeping in a little later, and just walking across the street (or through an underground tunnel) to check-in for your flight. Good value, and you can't beat the location! 
22498 We stayed overnight in this hotel and had the best experience so far. Close to times square, subway, empire state and other attractions. Best lobby ever seen in a hotel. Rooms are not very big but big enough. The bed was really cozy too. 
22499 Overnight visit and paid standard rate but disappointed with size of room. Strange small circular shower! Service excellent from everyone. Parking valet took 50 minutes on 8:00am Saturday morning.Loud club on first floor, white noise machine helped some. Excellent location for TriBeCa. 
22500 The Roosevelt is an older hotel with updated rooms. Our room was comfortable with nice bedding. The bathrooms are small but serviceable. The lobby bar is wonderful with good food and friendly staff. The location is excellent with short walks to Times Square, 5th ave shops and attractions and restaurents. 
22501 Hotel semplice ma pulito e in ottima posizione vicinissimo a time square. Zona ad ogni modo tranquilla. Staff cordiale, gentile e disponibile. Camere sul retro un po' buie e struttura non molto grande ma in generale giudizio positivo. Wifi gratuito su tutta la struttura. Esperienza positiva.................... 
22502 Got a great rate on this hotel. Awesome location. Had a disability double room, which was large sized. Walk-in shower puddled out to the drain in the middle of the bathroom. Floor would be dangeous for elderly. No complaints. Request for quiet room honored. 
22503 From top notch staff that rarely changes - like Kolby who is a service genius- to perks like the wine hour set the Eventi apart. The vibe is cool w/o being pretentious - I only stay here when in NYC 
22504 het on the ave hotel is een uitstekend hotel voor zowel zakelijk als prive verblijf. vriendelijk personeel, nette ruime kamers(ruim is zowel de standaard kamer) groot flat screen tv, badkamer is verzorgd en best ruim. ligt vlakbij columbus circle met veel winkelaanbod en het central park. 
22505 Hallways are old an dirty and smell odd, perhaps some pesticide or mold. Room dirty, bathtub was missing some coating. Paint in was old and had cracks. Bed linen make me and my wife itchy. 
22506 Stunning room, amazing price and great staff :) Thank you Michael at reception for being so helpful 
22507 The suite they gave us at the London was beautiful, spacious and the service was outstanding. We dined at Gordon Ramsey's restaurant and the food and service was excellent we will make it a point to stay at the London Hotel on our next visit to NYC 
22508 Business traveler. Room was good size for NYC, and totally modern. HDTV, comfortable bed and great service. Evelyn a front desk made check in a breeze and hooked me up with free wifi and gym pass. Will be my NYC hotel from now on. 
22509 The hotel has a great location, and has decent sized rooms and is very worthy of it's five stars. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
22510 Upon arrival, we were upgraded to an Edwardian suite. Staff were fantastic throughout our stay. If going to NYC, will always stay there! The only down side was there were a couple of small hairs on the bathroom floor 
22511 great experience in the best city in the world, only downside is the rooms for the likes of you and I can be slightly disappointing but everything else makes up for it 
22512 Super man, super waiter! Took care of our special breakfast needs every day while there. The hotel was great too, very clean, very centrally located, very contemporary and, other than a pricing mess with Priceline, the total experience was PERFECT!!! 
22513 Great hotel though they took extra charges of $600 on our cards for no reason and then said it would take almost two weeks to credit back. Very, very, very poor customer service. Not a poor ending to what should have been a great stay. 
22514 Loved the location, the staff and the room! We will come back! Always stay on the Upper West when we visit NYC, and The Beacon is now our new favourite hotel :-) 
22515 muy bonito y muy bien situado en el centro de manhatan , pero bastante caro. 
22516 I've been to NYC a couple times but this was my first stay in Greenwich Village. I had a wonderful time. Everyone on the staff here was friendly and helpful. The room was clean and pleasant. I would definitely stay here again. 
22517 This hotel was in the perfect location...close to many NYC attractions. The hotel was very clean and brand new. It was nicely decorated with flat screen TV's in each room. Because of the quality, value and location, I wouldn't stay anywhere else in New York. 
22518 The hotel was perfect for walking to the theatre and shopping. The staff was friendly and helpful. The concierge desk helped us with a city tour , restaurants and sporting event tickets. The front desk staff went out of their way to accomodate our needs. 
22519 DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THIS HOTEL! It is a very unpleasant place. They don't have a/c in the middle of the summer. The bathrooms are like dirt place... I'd rather sleep outside the hotel at least you get fresh air than in the hotel. It feels like HELL!!!! 
22520 check in was simple, rooms clean and tidy.. staff friendly and the lady in the concierge booth was super helpful with buying show tickets. beds were cosy, shower pressure good and walking distance to anywhere.. if you like walking the city.. which my friend and i did.. 
22521 A great location in downtown Chicago. Starbucks in the lobby and great bar and service. Walk to great restaurants and attractions. What a beautiful city. Staff very accommodating. Could have used a mini bar fridge. Nothing a bucket of ice didn't fix. Shall return. 
22522 Stayed here 11-15 February 2005. Staff very helpful, no problem with the two rooms booked being next to one another. Also very helpful when our return was delayed 12 hours allowing us late check out. Great diner around the corner- the Malibu for traditional breakfasts. 
22523 what a fantastic hotel,no problems,no waiting for lifts,great views from 29th floor over to jersey,friendly staff.i will stay here again when i return to new york 
22524 Very large hotel. Rooms were clean. Buffet was Expensive. Had a billing issue but they took care of it. Had an early check out and had a few drunks in lobby that was only down side but in good location. 
22525 I did not like it. It is too big hotel and busy area 
22526 Suite al 37 piano! Meravigliosa! Personale eccellente! Un vero relax esattamente di fronte central park ed al centro dei negozi piu belli di NY! Colazione superba! non trovo un punto di debolezza per questo albergo! E' un vero leading hotel of the world! Perfetto! 
22527 The Embassy Suites Downtown in Houston is wonderful! My husband had surgery at MD Anderson. Our trip was full of caring and compassionate staff, very attentive to meeting our needs. The staff made sure we were well taken care of, from special diet requests to transportation requirements. Thank you all 
22528 This is the 4th time we have used this hotel and have been very pleased each time. If you are looking for a good value at an outstanding hotel, this is your best bet. 
22529 The W Times Square has been my home away from home for a number of years now. On my most recent trip with associates, the W team again impressed me with personal service and attention to detail. What great training and staffing. 
22530 I stayed for few days me and my family, I really liked The palce I was really suprised when i saw all this reviews in Trip Advisor, we got what we paid for. 
22531 Quite room, excelent location and a great breakfast for a hostel, if you Like bagel Like me you will save money eating the breakfast only in the hostel. The staff was very polite and gave all the information that I need. The bedrooms are surpresily quiet. 
22532 Stayed at this hotel for four days. Hotel was excellent in every respect. Location can't be beat. Rooms very spacious. Beds very comfortable. Concierge very helpful for any request. I would certainly stay there again!! 
22533 just stayed at this hotel for 4 nights, hotel in good location, but did not think much of the room very small, other than location would not recommend 
22534 Very nice clean room, good size for NY. Decor and hotel matches website of hotel exactly. Will be happy to return again. Very close to Penn Station. 
22535 Close to the airport, quite, comfortable bed, good breakfast, fast airport shuttle. Great place to stay for an early flight. This stay continues to reaffirm my faith in the Hampton brand ... affordable, super clean and good breakfast. 
22536 We had a wonderful room with a view of the Lake. Staff was friendly and helpful. We used in-room dining and service was fast & friendly, food was delicious. The location is perfect for downtown activities! Less than $10 cab ride to Navy Pier. Cannot wait to stay there again! 
22537 great big rooms, excellent restaurant, great service - terrific location!! view aren't the best, but the physical plant and the service an location make up for it - we had just a perfect weekend - they go out of their way to make yo feel special!! 
22538 Nice clean and comfortable room at an excellent price. The restaurant downstairs was very good. Only stayed for 1 night, so I can't comment on it's location. The room wasn't as small as I expected. 
22539 Next trip to NYC, back to the New Yorker Hotel. We could walk to Macys, Penn Central, Empire State Building, fun restaurants. Rooms very clean, comfortable, quiet, and view amazing, could see the gap of skyline at Twin Towers missing, the Hudson River, and THE CITY for miles. 
22540 Great Room at a great price. Front dest personnel very helpful in traffic directions for my business meeting. Will definitely stay there again. 
22541 A prescindere dal saluto in francesce devo dire che la camera e la posizione erano assolutamente all'altezza. Qualche problema in fase di check in, forse per la poca esperienza del personale di contatto, con la prenotazione risolto dopo un po' di insistenza. Colazione francamente molto cara per il prezzo esposto. 
22542 Very nice hotel, excellent value for the price. Having the breakfast included was a nice suprise. I will definately stay at this hotel agin and I will recommend it to friends and co workers. 
22543 Beautiful hotel in a quiet area of Manahattan with a spectacular view of the bay and the Statue of Liberty. 
22544 I evacuated to this hotel during hurricane Katrina. The service was terrible and the management was involved in price gouging. Total cheats. NEVER stay there. 
22545 For first timers in New York fantastic location,very clean , close to subway , fabulous delis for fresh food, overall great place to stay. 
22546 I loved my stay at the Hudson. Location is amazing 
22547 Rooms are small but hey this is NYC 
22548 Everything is clean. 
22549 Really liked this hotel. Great location, nice clean rooms, quiet. Small hotel meant ease of getting around. Great continental breakfast and FREE! Was recommended to me and I would recommend to my friends! 
22550 Came for the weekend. Nice clean, comfortable rooms. Excellent Staff. Great location, close to all....everything South. 
22551 stanze minuscole, bagno piccolissimo, doccia comoda, posto bello, vicino a central park, abbastanza vicino a due linee importanti della metro. silenzioso. accoglienza cordiale e personale diponibili. se si vuole spendere poco e usare la stanza solo x dormire va bene.. 
22552 Zoals al beschreven is een verblijf in hotel Pennsylvania voor iedereen aan te raden. Goede accomodatie, centraal gelegen, voldoende toeristische informatie, trein en metro naast het hotel, diverse winkels rondom het hotel, restaurants in de buurt; kortom: PRIMA !!!! 
22553 very nice lobby but found some of the staff rude and sarcastic. Room was very small, the two of us barely had space to even open our luggage! No coffee machine and an out dated blowdryer which didn't work properly! 
22554 We stayed at the Staybridge last June and were very happy (and pleasantly surprised). We loved the room, the view, the closeness to time square, the free continental breakfast, the friendly / courteous staff. We will definitely stay there the next time we are in New York!!! 
22555 I was very pleased with my stay. Amanda couldn't have bEen nicer and was excellent in recommending things to do. She was able to recommend the most spectacular places to visit and met all our needs. Will definitely be coming back. 
22556 Beautiful hotel in the heart of NYC, without being too pricey. The rooms are small, however it is just NYC standard size. 
22557 The bed was comfy - besides that it was just so so... I love the Upper West Side, but this was disappointing compared to other hotels in the area. 
22558 Hotel nuovo, ma non ben congeniato... Le camere sono molto piccole. Manca di bidet e di armadio!!! Incredibile a dirsi! Consiglio questo hotel solamente a chi sa bene accamparsi o per brevi soggiorni! Ah, portatevi qualche appendino per gli abiti da casa! ;) 
22559 Great hotel, right in the middle of everything. Excellent fitness facilities, with pool in the hotel. Close to subway and theater district. Would highly recommend. 
22560 Nice mid-scale boutique hotel. Bright colors reminded me of something you'd encounter in the Caribbean. Good service & clean...a pleasant little place. 
22561 Stayed at the Tudor Hotel for 5 nights, really pleased with the hotel. No problems with check in at all. Rooms were small but not too small (and it's NYC after all). Grand Central Terminal is 5 minutes walk from Tudor. So overall good hotel and great location. 
22562 Charismatic room, great loft bar beside the pool, good restaurant, very nice service. The spa is not recommandable, average massage and so so facilities. Overall it is rather noisy. 
22563 i had an amazing stay at this hotel it's very clean and no bed bugs what else do you want me : nothing more only thing missing free wi-fi in the rooms 
22564 Not the most savvy Hotel in NY but you cant beat price and location. Its in a neoighborhood like setting and quiet. Our room had a kitchenette which is perfect for small children that constantly want something to snack on. I would recommend this hotel! 
22565 Always a great experience to be back at this hotel, this place never disappointed me. Detail oriented, well organized, friendly, elegant, relaxed 
22566 you might have noticed by now, I really like that place! 
22567 You will not be dissapointed....wonderful beds, beautiful rooms. Location at South Central Park is just great. If we had questions, the staff was right there to help. 
22568 My husband and I stayed here when we went to the Subway series. The hotel is centrally located. It is next to everything in the City. Its a perfect location. Subway nearby. Hotel is clean, staff is nice. Rooms are really small, but hey, its New York! 
22569 No great shakes, but very nice - clean, safe, updated and modern rooms. Accommodating, friendly staff. Great price for NYC. 
22570 I recently coordinated a 3 day conference at this hotel for 50 attendees. They offered an upscale atmosphere and is conveniently attached to the Houston Galleria mall. The banquet staff was outstanding and took very good care of our group. 
22571 great location. clean room. comfortable bed. very helpful staff. wifi Internet weak in our room, probably a good thing, gave me an excuse for not checking my work emails. 
22572 Tiny room with noisy air conditioner. I have had rooms with bigger closets than this room It is not worth the cost. Don't waste your money. 
22573 OK hotel in noisy Midtown. Phone calls highly overprized. Beds horribly soft. Friendly and somewhat helpful staff. Restaurant Asia de Cuba looks like it deperately needs a touch up. 
22574 Stayed in the Eventi during early August with the family of four (two teenage boys). Had great five days, and great four nights - which was a pleasant surprise in a hotel. Staff was super helpful (thanks Patrick!) and the views spectacular. Will definitrly come back! 
22575 All hotels in NY are too expensive. With that as a starting point, the Warwick is a good hotel and a great location. I would not hesitate to stay here again. 
22576 This hotel has an excellent location near Times Square, Empire State Bldg, and Penn Station. Rooms were clean and good-size. Staff was extremely helpful! Good breakfast, too. Overall, a great stay! 
22577 cockroachs, black mold/mildew in bathroom, staff allow panhandlers into lobby, room is dirty even after staff cleaned; more like just replaced the towels 
22578 Traveling to the Upper West Side, I stayed at the Beacon, which is a very clean and comfortable hotel. Everyone there was very friendly and I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in this area of New York. 
22579 My daughter and cousins stayed here 1 night when we went to jingle ball. It was very chic. Beds were very comfortable and staff was very nice. Decor is very cool & chic. Roof top pool is very cool. We would definitely stay here again. 
22580 I travelled to New York as a disabled traveller, i stayed at the Lexington hotel, i found the hotel to be very clean, the staff were very helpful, and friendly, the food in the Raffle resturant was very good, and reasonably priced, all in all a wonderful stay. 
22581 Me and some friends stayed there for 4 days for a convention. The place is at an excelent location and thats what you're paying. The building is old and it looks like the place from "the shining". You have to pay for everything else from wifi to breakfast. 
22582 Just look at the photos. No curtain in the shower. Lose tiles. Bedding with yellow stains. One very dirty chair. etc. 
22583 Great location! Staff was extremely nice, they even sent a cake to our room for my daughter's birthday. Breakfast is awesome. Rooms are nice and comfy. We could not have asked for anything better! 
22584 Stayed here over christmas 2009. Staff at front desk and in the bar/resturant are very friendly. Rooms are well appointed. Will definately stay here again next time we are in NYC. 
22585 Fantastic location in the heart of meat packing. Awesome bars, great food.. the burgers delivered in room service (at any hour) are magical, and can cure hangovers before they happen. Don't stay here if you want early nights and quiet rooms... 
22586 Design of the room was optimal. Next time I would try to stay at yotel again. Everything we needed was there and was well working. Also the service was good and always someone was there to answer questions. 
22587 First impression wasn't superlative, but maybe we were tired from the trip. Everything was wonderful instead, position, helpfullness staff ( Betsy deserves a Nobel for patient and efficiency), security. And least but not last the size of the apartments 
22588 The Doubletree Chelsea was in a great location. We could walk to most everything and if we couldn't the conceirge was more than helpful. Great hotel for a short trip. The rooms are very small but have heard that most hotel rooms in NYC are the same. Would stay again! 
22589 The rooms at the hotel are small and there are no dressers to put clothing in. One uncomfortable chair, not enough outlets and a small bathroom. Very good location and the staff was superb. 
22590 This is relatively quiet and clean for a place so close to the airport. Great Mexican restaurant out front Neighborhood not so nice 
22591 very relaxing, great location and very friendly staff. Easy to ask for help and easy to talk to staff. comfortable and would recomend to anyone looking to stay at affordable hotel in times sqaure. 
22592 The hotel is clean, great little restaurant on site. Close to Times Square, Theatre Disrict, Central Park, The Empire State Building and the Subway. Staff are extremely friendly and helpful. 
22593 The room and service was great. The staff was friendly and the free breakfast was great. This is my second stay at this La Quinta. I fully recommend this La Quinta. 
22594 Muy buena opcion para vacaciones cortas en N York. Accesible a los principales centros de atraccion turisticas de Manhathan. Excelente vista de la ciudad. Personal muy cooperador. Habitacion bastante amplia y confortable.. Emmanuel 
22595 Very hard to say something special about this hotel. It's clean, has big rooms vith quite nice view from the higher floors. It looks a little bit old-fashioned.. 
22596 Yes the rooms are small but who cares when you're traveling by yourself. The ascetics make up for the tightness. I loved the fabric of the bedspread. And so comfy. And in the hall is a fill your bottle water dispenser. Who wonderful. Totally recommend this hotel for Chicago. 
22597 siamo stati all'hampton inn nel periodo di natale,le camere erano accoglienti e spaziose, molto pulite. il servizio ottimo a disposizione per qualsiasi necessita' con gentilezza e professionalita'. la colazione buona e abbondante .servizio computer ed internet gratuito. vicino a Midtown a piedi si puo' davvero andare dappertutto! 
22598 Amazing hotel. Incredible view over Manhattan. Ask for a room on 15th floor and above & downtown side. Nice service with professionnal staff. Restaurant somehow expensive. only problem: access to the roof bar (boom boom boom) is not easy even for hotel guest. 
22599 The rooms are a bit older, and the bathrooms are tiny, but comparable to other NYC hotel bathrooms. The location cant be beat and the room spacious---great working space for business travelers. Very clean and a great location, central to it all. Fairly priced for NYC. 
22600 This is a small hotel in a wonderful location and walkable to Penn Station. The room was roomy and very clean. Service was very good. One hot day we came back to no A/C throughout the hotel but it was fixed within an hour. 
22601 This hotel can not be beat! It is a beautiful property. Location is great. Service impeccable! If you can afford it...do it! 
22602 Geweldige locatie in midtown manhattan, alles binnen korte looptijd bereikbaar, zoals Times Square, theatre district, central park. De kamers zijn voor NY begrippen RUIM, schoon en comfortabel. Het personeel is zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Het ontbijt bij de prijs inbegrepen is gewoon goed. Voor iedereen is er wel iets! 
22603 Although not central New York, this hotel on the Upper West Side was only 20 minutes walk/5 minutes cab from Times Square. Clean and comfortable room. Nice, safe neighbourhood, with lots of places to eat very close by (and places to get laundry done). Staff polite and helpful. Would recommend. 
22604 posizione ottima, stanze enormi e ben servite, pulizia quotidiana ottima, silenzioso, lo consiglio vivamente!! 
22605 Great location, very warm and cool environment. The restaurant is worth having dinner for the food and the atmosphere. All blu and white, cool and welcoming at the same time. Best place to enjoy downtown soho! 
22606 we stayed 5 days on level 21 was great room with kitchen , loads of room with 2 bathrooms , position was excellent as we walked to all the attractions 
22607 would definatley stay again Cheryl - sydney australia 
22608 Sono stato una settimana a ny al chatwal dovei hanno fatto sentire come a casa mia. Personale disponibilissimo e gentile,stanze confortevoli,ubicazione strategica.unici nei il prezzo e la colazione 
22609 Te sorprende por dentro,ya que desde afuera no se ve...aparte estas en medio de Time's Square... 
22610 We stayed for just one night and will be back again. Rooms are much larger than most NYC hotel rooms. Very clean. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We booked the "executive room" and when we checked in, they upgraded us to the "studio" Great location for theaters. 
22611 There is nothing goid to say about this hotel. The staff are rude and are not very helpful. Keep looking around and don't waste your time or money with this hotel. 
22612 O atendimento foi muito amigavel e simpatico. A localizacao e instalacoes do hotel Sao excelentes. 
22613 Good hotel to stay at as it was close to times square. Nice big rooms and the free breakfast was good. 
22614 If you are looking for location, service, design and nice rooms, this is the place. I try to visit as often as possible and always please with the staff and the rooms. Andaz 5th Ave is certainly one of my favorite hotel. A must in NYC! 
22615 Our stay at the Chelsea Savoy was supurb. The personnel are very helpful and matter of fact. It is a quality place to stay with minimum frills. The hotel has high security with excellent locations to the METRO and PATH. We are looking forward to returning soon. ALEX 
22616 We stayed for 4 days and everything was great! I recommend this hotel for sure! 
22617 The Crowne Plaza certainly lived up to our expectations. The location, friendliness of staff, and rooms (spacious) were excellent. We really enjoyed our stay and definitely will be coming back. The location was perfect for shows , restaurants and shopping. 
22618 i had a wonderful experience at this hotel- Staff was very,very,friendly,helpful and most courteous. The lobby is beautiful, rooms are large and very comfortable, fantastic view from the rooftop bar. this is one of my favorites. 
22619 staff was excellent!! very accomodating to my every request. very trendy restaurant and club. theres nowhere else you need to look for a city vacation. they made me a customer for life! 
22620 Despite having traveled numerous times to Chicago for business and pleasure, I was unfamiliar with this hotel, which initially made me skeptical. However, while my room was not large, it was clean and well appointed, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I'd stay here again. 
22621 This Hampton Inn has everything you need and then some.... good business center, free printing, good wifi, different breakfast every day, large clean rooms, recently renovated, good beds, a courtesy 3 mile shuttle to the destination of your choice.... Highly recommend for business. 
22622 Posizione ottima........ Richiedere assolutamente le camere ai piani piu' alti per poter ammirare l'Empire illuminato che ogni notte cambia colore e i grattacieli circostanti parzialmente illuminati.Di notte piu' volte mi sono svegliata e avvicinata alle vetrate per godere dello spettacolo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Da consigliare 
22623 This hotel is perfect for visiting New York. It is very close to Central park and Times Square and there is a subway station right outside so you can go anywhere in New York easily. 
22624 Worst hotel ever. Automatic key check in didn't work, Yobot was broken, rooms are sooooo small and the service was awful. 
22625 Clean, well presented hotel, lobby is it's highlight, rooms comfortable but in need of TLC. Highish prices, location ok, not really worth the amount you pay, especially if you are just using it as a base, will pick another hotel next time. 
22626 Very nice room (junior suite), nice staff, very clean, great location and if you are travelling to another city and returning to NY in some days to stay again in the hotel, you can keep your baggage with the doorbell for 3 dolar per bag per day. 
22627 I loved everything about The Waldorf except the standard rooms. They are too small for a family of four. Two people could not walk around the foot of the bed at the same time. Service was fantastic and the decor was breath taking. 
22628 I went to New York for one day/night while visiting familiy for a wedding. This hotel is perfectly located to Centeral Park, Broadway, and 5th Ave shopping. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Rooms are small, but clean and updated. Highly recommend this hotel. 
22629 Great location for a theater weekend in NYC. Was able to check in earlier than the 3PM stated time. Nice rooms - larger than most NYC hotels. Concierge was very helpful with restaurants. 
22630 The location is great - Everything else was pretty poor. Staff was not friendly in the least sand the rooms and TV's were dated. Worth the stay if you can get for $200 or less, bur I wouldn't pay a penny more... 
22631 Title of my review says it all. I would have loved to stay more nights, but it was already booked solid. There is a reason it is booked solid, and it is because it offers everything a traveler wants and needs: location, price, service, space, comfort, and amenities. 
22632 Nicely located in Soho, very close to the subway and the world renown Soho district, China Town is really close by, Little Italy is a 10-15 mn walk. Rooms are quiet good, but the hotel needs a face lift from the inside. 
22633 Fijn hotel. We hadden een comfortabele, niet zo grote kamer met een heerlijk bed. De badkamer was wat gedateerd, maar olp zich OK. Pre van dit hotel is de locatie: aan het central park en vlakbij 5th avenue. 
22634 This was the second time I stayed at the Moderne. The hotel is clean, in a great location, and the attitudes of the staff were much improved from the last time that I was there. I would stay there again in a heart beat! 
22635 Upon arriving I was greeted by the receptionist named Rita Washington. I've only stayed at the hotel once previously, however she knew me by name and was beyond friendly. I'm a strong believer that the employees make a company, and Rita made my trip enjoyable. Thanks for a great stay. 
22636 Unfortunately, I stayed in the Kimberly Hotel. What a nightmare. I was put on the floor below their bar. Loud music all night. Did absolute nothing to stop it and would not move me to another floor. This is a five star hotel? You got to be kidding.... 
22637 The Alex is the best hotel in NYC! If you can find a deal then you should definitely stay here. The customer service is remarkable, accommodations one of a kind and you are fully treated as if you are a VIP. 
22638 excellent all the way around. Elegant, great rooms all new, great beds 
22639 This hotel has a great location, comfortable beds, and excellent service. It is clean and friendly and we would definitely come back. 
22640 The housekeeping services were excellent. The room was spotless and the Executive King Suite we stayed in had a Tempu-pedic mattress that was heaven. We couldn't have enjoyed any hotel more. 
22641 We came back to our tiny room after a nice long walk to find a huge cockroach in the closet. The staff was sorry but basically said they could not do anything. It was disgusting. 
22642 May be not a luxury hotel but sure one of the most agreeable and confortable one.If a family in New york,than this is the best choice!Extraordinary staff,very confortable and big rooms and excelent location!Next time in New York I will be back for sure!For the whole staff:GREAT JOB!KEEP IT SO! 
22643 Funky hotel, great location, cool bar, yummy food and friendly, helpful staff. Great coffee at the bike hire place down the road. Room was spacious and well appointed but the fridge is not usable except for the minibar items. Will stay again. 
22644 Hotel ben collocato a pochi isolati dal Moma, Central Park e Quinta Strada. Bellissima vista (eravamo al 22 piano). Silenzioso. Pulito. Camera spaziosa. Avevamo due letti matrimoniali grandi (famiglia da 4). Metro (linea 6) a 20 metri dall' uscita! 
22645 Have stayed here before and found it very comfortable and clean. Staff friendly and a good bar downstairs. Staying there again in a couple of weeks and looking forward to it!! Its also an excellent location and very reasonable. 
22646 The hotel had a lovely atsmospher. The rooms were clean, tidy and inviting. The food in the resuarant was excellent and so was the serivce - both breakfast and eveing meals. My only complaint was the lack of closet space. 
22647 Stayed here for the first time over the weekend and I would definitely stay here again. Great location very good sized rooms. Hotel was in good shape the staff was really friendly. 
22648 I stayed here for one night in February and was not disappointed. The rooms are great and the location of the hotel cannot be beat. Overall, a great find and would highly recommend this hotel. 
22649 Our family didn't stay there, but it is a wonderful place for a wedding. Probably one of the best prices in Houston, Texas for a wedding. 
22650 The staff is amazing. The access to the subway and proximity to many of the sightseeing spots is great. We loved everything about this Comfort Inn. 
22651 We heard mixed reviews before we left but got this hotel at a great price and couldn't have been happier! Amazing location and good size room. Would definitely stay again. 
22652 You can't beat this location, subway station outside the hotel, rooms are clean and staff is friendly. It's usually very expensive so I'm not sure it's worth the $400+/night that they usually charge but I got an amazing rate on Priceline so I was happy! 
22653 Went to a broadway show & dinner. This was an awesome hotel to do just that. Location was the BEST! The room was very comfortable & the view was absolutely superb. I already booked a return trip and I'm counting the days till I go back. 
22654 Rooms are large. King Bed. Sofa two chairs and a round four top in the sitting area. Spacious kitchen by Manhattan standards. Lots of closet space. Furniture and carpet are dated and worn but clean. Linens are fresh. Outstanding value. Convenient to Grand Central, Bryant Park, Empire State Building. 
22655 Understated elegance, outstanding service, fabulous location, classic yet modern....really perfect in every aspect. Great value in NYC. 
22656 Terrible customer service and the room was absolutely disgusting. I checked in and out in 10 minutes and moved to a nearby hotel. Personnel was extremely rude I have never been treated so rudely anywhere else. I rather sleep in the street than at this establishment. 
22657 excelente hotel,muy bien situado,habitacion fabulosa con vistas a times square,una delicia 
22658 Stayed here with my family a few times, Funky hotel in the museum area, bar and restaurant were great. Advertisement for the "divorce party weekend" made us smile. 
22659 Good value. Good location. Free Internet. Not pretentious. Probably one the better alternatives in that price category. I have been visiting NYC yearly since 1988 and this was probably the best value hotel I ever stayed in. It is not luxury and it doesn't pretend to be so either. 
22660 Stylish looking - great location. DIRTY rooms - especially bathrooms. If they can fix their housekeeping standard and have one or two people replaced from the front desk - this hotel would be ideal. 
22661 Well I've never had a Caesar Salad with powdered parmesan out of a packet before! And all other aspects of the hotel were in every respect similar to the quality of my salad. Need I say more? 
22662 Very good Location,good service,clean rooms.many attraction near by 
22663 A wonderful location, Its not 5 star luxury but has a campy quality to it which is appealing Very friendly staff and clean, sizeable rooms. Across the street from Babbo which is excellent if you can get a table. Would recommend if you want to be in the area. 
22664 Had a Liberty views room. It's great being away from the hussle and bussle of times sq and the like. Great gym, didn't use room service or restaurant so cant really comment on these. Would stay here again without question. 
22665 You will not find a better hotel for the price! It is the only place to stay! 
22666 hotel carino ed accogliente, personale gentile, frequentato da giovani e famiglie con bambini le camere sono accoglienti anche se non grandissime lo abbiamo consigliato ad amici e conoscenti per prossimi viaggi e ne terremo conto anche per future visite a new york nel complesso giudizio positivo 
22667 Ha sido un gran descubrimiento, la proxima vez que volvamos sin dudarlo sera a este hotel. 
22668 Was planing to stay here for 4 weeks but after one night of stomping going on upstairs and people up and down the hallways drowning out the television in my room was enough. Apperantly the walls are as thin as the ceilings. 
22669 rundown, seedy old motel, mold all over the bathroom, no blanket (had to ask for one), threadbare towels and sheets. Wife wouldn't stay..no refund offered. Candlewood Inn is right next door for $10 more a much better room. 
22670 Noisy location, very pricey, no view, good sized rooms. Overpriced. 
22671 We stayed at the sofitel in June 2004 for 9 nights. It was fantastic in everyway. The location was brilliant, the room was luxurious and large, and the staff were very helpful. I would recommed anyone going to NY to stay at this gem of a hotel. 
22672 This hotel is very good, the locations is perfect, in the lobby you can buy tickets to brodway (they have very good prices, and you don't wasted time)...... but always is crowded and also is a little expensive! 
22673 Molto pulito, personale cordiale, posizione veramente ottima...15 minuti a piedi da time square 
22674 Typically small NYC hotel room, but clean and well appointed. Impressive view of new Freedom Tower and WTC site. Conveniently located. Would have liked complimentary wi-fi. Very expensive room service breakfast (welcome to NYC). 
22675 Look at my photos, they speak for themselves, it is just really run down. The managers reception is really chips and sodas. 
22676 The hotel is perfect for both business and leisure travel. You can't beat the location and the rooms were well kept for an older hotel. 
22677 The location is great, the breakfast helpful. The free Internet is a nice plus. I just wish the service was a little better. The front desk attendants were not friendly enough. The best part is the location, so close to Times Square. I do reccomend it. 
22678 Was greated at the door with a complementary upgrade to a suite (due to Starwood status) and non-stop service once I checked in. Service staff came to fix my A/C without my even halfing to ask. The Flooor Managaer Jessie was great. 
22679 I had a great stay in this fantastic hotel. Staff were always polite and room was perfect for what we needed while staying in the city for a few nights. Great location and easy to get around the city. 
22680 We got a discount, so we definitely got value for money. Large rooms for NYC standard. Nicely decorated hotel. Free use of computer and internet. Staff wasn't too helpful, but they smiled alot. 
22681 This is a great new York hotel in a great location. Short walk from central park, quick cab ride from downtown, with lots of great, cheap and authentic eating opportunities nearby. Highly recommended. 
22682 Excellent concept for a hotel, it sets its self apart from the normal boring accomodation.. Had a great time. Will definatly go back! 
22683 Great stay! The hotel still have the history and grandeur as when was open!! I will stay again and again... 
22684 Stayed at the Empire end of October for 5 nights. We were immediately upgraded to a larger room, which was fairly large for NY standards. Restaurant was excellent and so were drinks in the lobby bar - rooftop terrace was already closed though... Overall very pleasant stay, would recommend! 
22685 I attended a conference at the Hilton literally 500 ft away and couldn't be happier to pay a lot less with decent room and service. I'd definitely stay again 
22686 Stayed for one night...clean, classic, old world hotel. The Beatles once stayed here so that made it worth it to me! Room was clean, reception was friendly. A little pricey, but its NYC so nothing is cheap here. Very good location, close to everything!! I would stay here again. 
22687 Das Zimmer wurde "mangels Reinigungs-Personals" erst um 18 Uhr frei, danach Zimmerwechsel wegen Bauarbeiten im Haus. Wasser wird erst nach 4-5 Minuten warm (Dusche!), WLAN teuer. Zimmer stilvoll, Lage sehr gut. 
22688 Return to a little slice of heaven after enjoying Manhattan. It's quiet, discreet, and just lovely. Staff are its gem. 
22689 Loved everything about this hotel: the iPads, the hip decor, the locarion, the attractive doormen and concierges, the cool bar, delicious restaurant... And the hilarious items for sale in the minibar (personal massage device anyone?). Ignore the other complaints: the rooms are the appropriate size for New York. 
22690 The rooms are comfortable, the staff is excellent. I highly recommend it. 
22691 This was a great place....rooms are new, very nice, within walking distance of alot of things. Quiet. A very professional staff. I'd stay there again in a wink. Ann Guins 
22692 Superb Location. Value for money. Located just off Magnificient Mile. Very Friendly Valet and Concierge. Water Tower and Hancock Center a 2 minutes walk. Ice cream - Ghiredeli and cheese cake factory 2 Min walk. Over all amazing location. You dont need any transportation at all 
22693 nice location, friendly staff. allow early check in. 
22694 I visited The Barclay again in August and it's still my favorite in NYC. Jose at The Barclay Grill mixing fantastic cocktails, it's a great place to relax after the hectic outside. 
22695 Io e mia moglie siamo stati 5 notti in questo hotel e lo abbiamo trovato pulito e situato in un'ottima posizione, tra central park e time square, con la fermata della metropolitana all'angolo del palazzo. Ottima anche l'idea della colazione a 4,00 dollari con un'ampia scelta di alimenti e bevande. 
22696 Location, standard of rooms and general standard of rooms are all great. The executive lounge is a perfect bonus when I can have access. For business it makes the perfect location for both up town and down town. 
22697 Very handy location, friendly welcoming staff, rooms quite small but perfectly adequate. 
22698 A centrally located hotel with good value suites. I was impressed with the food quality, the comfort of the beds, the size of the rooms and friendly staff. Some of the public areas looked a little tired, but were being renovated whilst we were there. 
22699 Stayed for one night in March and was really disappointed. Restaurant was under construction, room was run down, lobby was lame and room service was mediocre. Not even hip in decor! For over $400 per night, it was severly overpriced for what you get. If you want boutique, go elsewhere... 
22700 A great hotel in a great location, its the perfect base for exploring new york. Great breakfasts too....the best waffles I've had in the US! 
22701 You get all the benefits of a hip NYC hotel, without the accompanying attitude. Attention to detail, smiles, answers to questions and a good sense of what's going on in town. Great choice. 
22702 We stayed at this hotel to see the sights. Location was great for the Statue of Liberty cruise and 9/11 memorial, one subway ride to Times Square. Staff were unbelievably helpful, went of their way to accomodate our request to check in earlier. 
22703 In the heart of the city, it's ideally located to enjoy the holidays in New York. Spacious and lovely room - only negative was the gorgeous shower but no tub! Great service, but a bit of confusion in their luggage handling, etc. 
22704 The location couldn't be better.... just few steps from Empire and Macy's. Right next door there's a subway station. Clean and spacious for NYC patterns. Despite of being an old building it must has gone through a recent renovation since it seens modern and well kept. 
22705 great location, comfy beds and pillows, love the sheets and new bedspreads! front desk clerks were very nice and helpful. housekeeping does a wonderful job! indoor pool and hot tub was very nice. close to mall and many good restaurants. 
22706 The maid admitted taking $800. sunglasses in a bag from the room thinking they were trash. The hotel was not willing to compensate me or put it thru their insurance. No customer service. Will not stay here again. 
22707 I was very well treated from the time I entered the lobby. The service was friendly and helpful, and the room was very clean, comfortable and had a great view. I was delighted at the excellent value and would definitely come back. 
22708 The Crowne Plaza was wonderful, great Location, great staff, all around wonderful experience! We booked it through Magellan Vacations and got the concierge level and corner room with a spectacular view of times square! I am already planning my next trip. 
22709 This was my first stay at a Best Western and I was pleasantly surprised. Welcoming staff, clean, and great price for a Chicago Hotel. Also, good restaurants within walking distance. I will be visiting this Best Western often on business and look forward to accumulating Best Western points :) 
22710 Lovely hotel in an excellent location. Staff are extremely helpful and friendly! The only negative I could fine is that the hotel bar was very expensive. Overall experience was excellent and will stay in this hotel again when returning to NYC!!!! 
22711 Het hotel licht op een goede locatie om de stad te verkennen. De kamers zijn niet al te groot, maar voldoende. De kamer is wel somber van kleur en de airco maakt erg wel erg veel lawaai. De bedden daarin tegen waren goed. 
22712 In the 300 block of West 42nd, the hotel is right next door to the New York State Board of Parole. The parolees are coming & going!!! 
22713 Huge rooms for NYC. Great stay I thoughts the folks were friendly and the former Marine Bellhops were awesome and very friendly. I highly recommend this hotel. 
22714 Habitaciones con falta de limpieza. Restaurante con menu super limitado. Ubicaciones buena para Soldier Field, pero no optima para visitar los sitios turisticos mas importantes. 
22715 Our stay at The Mave was most enjoyable! Everything from first greeting to checkout was superb; the perfect spot for a NYC vacation. 
22716 Ottimo hotel, con camere grandi e confortevoli con vista su Time Square. In linea con la categoria di appartenenza. Da non perdere il ristorante girevole all'ultimo piano per una vista stupenda di Manhattan, specialmente con il brunch della domenica mattina! ;o) 
22717 It's a very nice hotel. I enjoyed the tv on the mirror. 
22718 Nice, clean rooms. Lovely bar. Fantastic location, stones throw from time squae. Biggest drawback was the constant mouse though the night outside our bedroom window, everyday for three nights. Sounded like we were on a building site. That said, would stay here again but only if facing another direction 
22719 I stayed 4 days for business at the Marriott Marquis....The Hotel was great, rooms uber-comfortable and service was great as well. Location was the reason for the choice and I was extremely happy....within walking distance to shopping, broadway shows and restaurants....I'll be back! 
22720 Trendy, nicely appointed rooms and lobby! Clean, large bathrooms especially for NYC. Great food court with many choices for a quick bite or drink next door. Fantastic free wine tasting in the evening. Great friendly staff. Have reccomended to friends and will definitely go back! 
22721 Nice stay at the Algonquin for a weekend theater getaway. Room was upgraded to a king- very comfortable bed. Great location. Rooms are small as this is an old hotel- not unlike Historic Horel rooms in DC 
22722 Nicht sehr teuer, aber dennoch zentral in SoHo, nicht weit von Chinatown und Little Italy 
22723 Extended a business trip and stayed a couple of extra nights at the Marriott. Location is great. Amenities good. Paying mostly for the location. The entrance on Michigan Ave is not the main entrance. Will hold your luggage if your flight leaves after check out. 
22724 Hotel room was comfortable. Rates - overpriced. Downfall - charges for wi-fi in room and for using the gym. 
22725 This hotel is the best hotel i've stayed at in a long time. Everyone from the staff was very courteous especially Tim at the concierge desk. He booked my wife and I dinner reservations in their lovely restaurant and the food was first class. We plan on returning soon. 
22726 Hotel heeft een zeer goede locatie, maar dat is dan ook zn allergrootste pluspunt. Bij de balie werden we door een zeer onvriendelijke vrouw geholpen. In de badkamer vonden we een kakkerlak, duurde maar liefst 2 dagen voordat de schoonmaakster hem hadden opgeruimd. 
22727 This hotel provided a clean and comfortable room. The staff was polite and helpful. I liked it and would defintely stay there again - it is not a luxury hotel but for the price you get a great location and a comfortable clean place to sleep and shower. 
22728 Nice Hotel. Good Place to stay prior to a flight. Front desk staff very courteous. Rooms are standard FI rooms. Our room had a flat screen TV. They have breakfast out and ready by 430am (self service) which is a nice touch for early departures. I would stay here again. 
22729 Love the location, style, and feeling of the property, the rooms are starting to show some age. Still a good spot, above average, but hopefully they update it soon. 
22730 Relatively new La Quinta, in top shape. Friendly, responsive staff and the nice little happy hour bar helped make it an enjoyable stay. Recommend it to anyone staying in Houston with business on the west side of town. 
22731 In dit hotel verbleven wij in ruime kamer (double double) met vijf personen. Ruime fraaie badkamer. Vriendelijke receptie. Veel faciliteiten, minibar, kluis waar zelfs een laptop in paste, verloopstekkers konden we lenen bij de receptie, gratis internet. 
22732 This was an excellent room for the money. Location relative to the airport was great and the staff was super courtesty! 
22733 Yes the room was small but it was very clean, which I appreciate more than a larger room. The hotel is designed for businessmen, but as a couple we were perfectly happy. Interesting amenities: Ipod docking station next to the bed, refillable water bottle stations throughout the hotel. 
22734 Our room was on the 21st floor and the view was incredible! We overlooked the heart of times square!! 
22735 Lovely experience at this hotel. Staff were pleasant, my room on the 14th floor was roomy and looked like it might have been renovated recently, and the staff were helpful with things like storing luggage. 
22736 Super hotel met geweldig ontbijtbuffet. Kamers waren zeer comfortabel en ruim. Het personeel was zeer behulpzaam. De naam zegt het al, zo wat op Times Square, dichtbij alle theaters. Zeer centraal gelegen. Geslapen op de 39e verdieping kamer 19 en 20. Wij gaan zeker nog eens terug. 
22737 I often stay here on business. Its only a couple blocks from Grand Central and very convenient. The rooms have always been clean. The desk clerks are pleasant, and they serve a nice breakfast, 
22738 The location is perfect. The suites make it really comfortable for a family of four. The prices are fair. The building is old but updated beautifully. The pillow menu is fantastic. This hotel is the total package. 
22739 I stayed in this hotel for over a month. It was very convenient and pleasant. The staff was extremely helpful in anything I needed and the service was great. Would definitely recommend this hotel to others. Loved Texas waffles during breakfast!!!! 
22740 This was our first time staying there. The hotel was FANTASTIC!!!! and we will be back next year. Some of the best sleep I've had while on vacation. 
22741 Furniture of rooms were very old. Beds and linnens perfect. Towels as well. Breakfast wonderful. Service very helpful and friendly. 
22742 The hotel is very centrAl, being between Maceys and the Empire State. It may not be the newest or largest but was clean and convenient. Continental breakfast included and very welcome. In all a good place to sleep but not to luxuriate. 
22743 The Hotel is nice, good breakfast for a delux contential. They make you pay $10 per day just to park your car. With $160 room rate, it ended up at $200 per day with parking and tax. Just too expensive for what you get. 
22744 Are you looking for a hotel with: - unfriendly staff - small rooms - old but good situated? then go there... 
22745 Nice location. Booked on Priceline and paid over $200.00. I feel $150.00 would have been a fair price. Definitely not a four star Hotel! Room was uncomfortably small. Queen beds. Hallway was dirty but the room was pretty clean. Would not stay again!! 
22746 Stayed 3 nights. Absolutely great hotel. Friendly staff. Rooms are clean. Right in the middle of all the theaters. Will recommend, and will return. 
22747 My boyfriend used to live at this hotel and I was there often.It's a fairly nice place if all the other hotel's are booked. It's really clean and quiet. 
22748 I am not a lover of the east side, but love the location of this hotel. Very close to Bloomingdales and good window shopping. The hotel is a typical Courtyard, but certainly a clean, accomodating place and one I would visit again. 
22749 Stayed at this hotel from May 19 through May 22, 2011. The room and bathroom were clean. The breakfast was delicious. It was a self serve breakfast with lots of variety. This is an easy walk from Broadway and Times Square. Elevators are a little slow. 
22750 I've stayed at a lot of bad places but this was the worst I got bed bug bites alll over 
22751 This hotel is located in the heart of the Theater District..steps away from Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Bryant Park. Everything is within walking distance and the subway is easily accessible. Our room was fantastic and the staff was very helpful. 
22752 This was a great experience, nice and clean rooms and good service. The location is somewhat not so good, but they provide shuttle service to make up for it. This includes pick up and drop facility. 
22753 Fab location for all the main attractions. Real luxury feel staff very friendly & helpful well worth the money. Rooms very spacious for a city hotel. You can tell its an old building but that adds to the charm. 
22754 I stayed here while visiting family and I loved it ...the staff was nice, the people were nice. I think Texans are nice...I think this will be my hotel for all my houston stays. Not sure what all these other people have to say but it was a great stay. 
22755 highly recommend the Double Tree- in the middle of everything- hotel is great clean and affordable. Had the top floor with a fantastic view. 
22756 My Favourite hotel in New York and evrey year i`ll stay at .i lije it so much! 
22757 A new and great concept. Rooms are small but well designed and adequate. Have everything you need and then some. Great rates for a Times Square NYC hotel. Really enjoyed our stay and will definitely go back. Hope more hotels like Yotel. 
22758 Stayed here for a night. I found the hotel build tinny so you could hear a lot that was happening in the building. Personally I'm not too keen on the modern furnishings - there was a cheapness about them. Not bad, but not great either.... 
22759 very nice hotel and one block away from time square. rooms slightly smaller, but location great 
22760 Amazing hotel ,great staff ! Stayed there 3 times during April and May .Very modern ,staff are well trained .Great value for money 
22761 We visited NYC from 22nd - 26th of feb. The location of the hotel is perfect. The rooms were really nice, modern and CLEAN. All the bad reviews on Tripadvisor make no sence because the hotel is outstanding and I will for sure stay there again. 
22762 Location location location! Hotel is great, seems popular. Has a very present 'eighties' vibe. Thankfully, our room seemed to have been recently renovated so i would advise you hit the top floors. I would come back again since nothing upset our stay & the location was superb. 
22763 I stayed here for a couple of days with my son. The rooms were huge for NY standards. View from the room was great and the convenience to the Subway was a bonus. 
22764 Very comfortable and clean room. Staff very helpful and friendly. 
22765 Needed an escape from the burbs. Ink48 ,great vibe, staff, find. Problem with our room was graciously handeled by Jeffrey, the manager. Understated luxury , staff that aim to please, city view rooms, spectacular, a DEFINITE repeat!!! 
22766 Spent two nights here and thoroughly enjoyed the comfort and amenities provided. Very modest tariffs, very affordable. All mod cons provided in the rooms and sleeping arrangements quiet and cozy. Extremely close to shopping and food places. Woould highly recommend both for couples and family. 
22767 We spent two nights at the hotel and a pleasant experience all round. Rooms were clean, Lobby was spacious, and the area was great. Thanks to previous reviews for the recommendation 
22768 My husband and I enjoyed our stay, even if it was just overnite. The front desk reps were excellent and very funny. I would definitely recommend the hotel to friends and family. 
22769 New Beds made for a great nights sleep. Rooms are quite even though we were besie the elevator! Good location and Great staff. Rooms were comfortable and a good size. Close to good restaurants and sites. 20 min walk to Javits Center. Overall a Good place to stay! 
22770 Rooms are fantastically equipped with all the amenities a traveler needs. Very clean new and pleasant staff. I highly recommend this hotel. 
22771 Wonderful little hotel, clean and conveniently located on Broadway and 77th, a few blocks away from the park and from the museum of natural history! We stayed 2 nights, must say it was a bit noisy (they are working on the hotel these days and therefore offering lower rates...) 
22772 Other than that, the slow elevators and no bathtub, what's not to like? Near good breakfast and markets, convenient to the subway, free lobby wifi and clean. Left drapes pulled to combat historic late July heat wave. 
22773 Close to Central Park, all museums, Times Square and Broadway. Can walk to all. Great warm Indoor pool at rooftop for kids after sightseeing. 
22774 I've stayed here many times through many years---I enjoy the rooms, the great staff, good restaurant, and watching my grandkids having fun outside---we all feel at home here. Thanks! 
22775 Great hotel, especially for weddings or banquets. A 10 dollar cab ride from downtown Chicago. It does not have eateries right outside but many delivery options exist. It might be better to go elsewhere for a couples only trip. 
22776 Great location hotel, very good service but...little expensive!! 
22777 Stayed at the Marriott East Side in NYC in May 2011. A friendly get-together from three continents! Nice staff, fabulous location... would not hesitate to recommand it! 
22778 Clean, modern and friendly. We did'nt spend much time in the hotel but enjoyed it when we were. 
22779 good location, excellent courteous, helpful staff. stayed many times and always enjoy the stay. rooms well appointed, clean and modern. 
22780 Comfortable room, smallish but have had worse in central New York. Short walk to bus from Newark and subway stations. Reasonable breakfasts in room on ground floor at back. 
22781 Ubicazione perfetta, a 500 metri da Times Square. Hotel molto pulito, personale disponibile e cortese. Wi fi gratuito nella stanze, ideale per un soggiorno turistico, vicino ai teatri e alla zona shopping. 
22782 A reasonable cost option for a far northside hotel. Free parking, free beakfast, decent rooms, not too noisy. Very convenient to Lake Shore Drive. Straight out Peterson to the Edens. 
22783 midtown location, no long lines, quiet, nice folks, Korean food Nirvanna, small room but fine 
22784 The room was very small... smaller than most "small NYC rooms". Walls weren't that thick, as I was awoken in the middle of the night by a drunken couple who couldn't get into their room. Room was clean, although it was a bit heavy on some potpourri scent. 
22785 Basic but clean and comfortable. A bit noisy. We could hear people out in the halls and in adjacent rooms. We could also hear street noise. The heating unit was sub-par. Room had poor air circulation and was stuffy. 
22786 We stay at this hotel every year and consider it our home away from home. Consisently good service, great location and very metropolitan. We love it here! 
22787 We stayed for a week and had a short walk to the subway and all attractions in Manhatten. The breakfast sandwiches around the corner were grest. The staff was friendly and helpful. The business room was well appointed and the rooms were quiet, modern and clean. 
22788 Not like the pictures on the website, needs major cleaning and updating. Wireless did not seem to work well as everyone was sitting on the stairs in the hall as we arrived. 
22789 The kind staff, fantastic location and appealing design make this hotel a winner. Loved the floor to ceiling windows in every room. Very expansive feel and views. Definitely would return. 
22790 Room was rather small, but had everything you generallly need in a hotelroom and most of all: it was very clean. The bed was marvelous, as was the shower. The hotel is literally one minute away from Herald Square (and Macy's...), and just a few minutes more from the ESB. 
22791 We stay in this hotel for our anniversary every year and we love it. It is very modern and clean. It is also a great location. I would not recommend to stay with children but for a romantic getaway away from the kids, this is perfect. 
22792 A bit dubious about staying in this hotel after reading the reviews, but the hotel was fine. Excellent lobby, adequete clean rooms pretty basic but what more could you ask for the price. An excellent location to get to see all those beautiful sites. 
22793 Good location. Good sized rooms for New York. Helpful staff. 
22794 We stayed at The Hotel at Times Square Feb 19 - 23rd. Location is excellent, rooms small but very nice. Free breakfast was great. Would definitely stay here again ! 
22795 Great stay! The staff could not be friendlier, the facilities are nice and it really was a great value $169 per night. Close to the river, few blocks to subway. Highly recommend 
22796 The room was pretty nice and the bed was so comfortable. However, the elevator was very slow. I also think the shower area is extremely small. I would stay here again, but not for a long period of time. 
22797 Good location, nice superior room, friendly staff and original restaurant "asia de cuba" Will come back 
22798 Just arrived after a long flight from the uk!! Very ignorant staff!! Place smells!! Full of creepy people!! Room disgusting!! No tv or sink or plug, stains on the walls, dirty bedding!! Burst into tests and wishing I was on next flight home!! Awful awful!!! 
22799 Super centraal gelegen om de hoek van Times Square en op loopafstand van 5th Avenue Empire State Building, de theaters, Central Park etc. De standaardkamers zijn erg royaal en hebben een kingsizebed. Op verzoek krijg je gratis een koffie/-theezetter. 
22800 My husband and I stayed three days at the Essex Inn. The staff were friendly and knowledgeable; courtesy shuttle to City sites. Great location, clean and affordable. 
22801 To the Bellman , mohammed for his kind & diligent service with sincerity 
22802 This hotel was off the beaten path and above average in service and comfort 
22803 The staff was attentive and mohammed helped me out the most duringy stay 
22804 The rooms are tiny and the front desk clerk had a bullying attitude (but backed down after a firm response), but beyond that I got a clean room in a well located mid-town hotel for 189 bucks and I'll take that deal anytime. 
22805 Due to an early morning flight, I stayed at the Marriott Houston Airport. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. The room was clean, bed very comfortable and all the requests on my Marriott profile were met. The proximity to the airport is excellent. 
22806 I recently stayed at the 414 hotel. The rooms are very spacious and very clean!!! The Manager, Sakina was professional and courteous - -superb customer service! I will definitely stay here again and will recommend to all my friends!! 
22807 next to galleria, good location with kids as cheese cake factory a kids favorite. room had pull out sofa. 
22808 While there are some oddities with this property, it serves the purpose. I think it's odd that therooms have no drawers: only red boxes you pull out. The breakfast is good and it's nice tone at a mew property. 
22809 We stayed in this very clean, super efficient hotel. We had a premium king on the 42nd floor and there was a sofabed in the luvingroom which was very comfortAble. Security aS good, location was great. Drawbacks: Super Douper expensive even booking 10 months in advance. 
22810 This is truly a 5 star hotel! From the moment you arrive to the moment you leave they make you feel special. No complaints, figure out yourself! 
22811 Great little hotel in Greenwich Village. Reasonably priced (for New York), good location, very good breakfast included in the room fee. Only complaint was getting a room next to the lift but at least that wasn't working between midnight and 7am. 
22812 We stay here frequently as it is located well for where we visit. The rooms are abit small but very clean. The restaurant RARE is great for gourmet burgers and the roof top bar has some great views. The pricing is a good value for NYC. 
22813 Busy but pleasant. Despite its proximity to Times Square, my room away from the Broadway side of the hotel was reasonably quiet. 
22814 The staff was friendly and very helpful. Many thanks to Bernita, Sharon, Jacqueline, Victor and Taron. We were there for our family reunion and the hotel was conviently located. 
22815 I've stayed here twice and I love the location for all the touristy stuff you can imagine doing. Walking distance to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, and right next to the A, C, E subway line for easy access to other points of interest! 
22816 Hot, hot, hot, what can I say!! This hotel is so awesome. Rooms are not that big but gorgeous nonetheless. Hotel lobby bar is sexy and worth a looksee for a drink. Food is good at restaurant too. 
22817 Excelente ubicacion, confortable y buena atencion. Algunos comentarios mencionan que siente ruido de la calle, pero ni con la actividad de los agitados dias decembrinos, llega a molestar en las habitaciones. La ubicacion es genial para tener todo al alcance. No necesitas alquilar carro, ni usar taxis 
22818 We decide to eat breakfast at the restaurant. Hot oatmeal was lovely....One banana on the side at $10.00 was a royal rip-off. What a disgusting finish to a wonderful stay at the hotel. 
22819 Great Hotel! Staff made you feel like family - rooms were 5 star plus -- will be staying here for all my trips to NYC!!!!!! Great location!!!! 
22820 We chose this hotel based on previous reviews on tripadvisor and it was everything we hoped for. Great hotel, wonderful room, great service, very clean and very friendly staff. The hotel is just a few steps away from 5th Av, Rockefeller Plaza and even Time Square. 
22821 Choose to stay at this hotel for a conference. The front desk people were very abrupt...bordering on rude. Aside from them, the rest of the staff is extremely helpful and the facilities are gorgeous. However, I won't necessarily come back because of the front desk staff. 
22822 Zeer goede prijs/kwaliteitverhouding. Aardig personeel. Heerlijke douche. Gratis draadloos internet heeft soms wat storingen, maar na opnieuw inloggen is dat verholpen. Ontbijt is goed genoeg, de wafelmaker is wel een leuke aanvulling. 
22823 Enjoyed our stay here, the room was large and quiet, nice bathroom. The hotel's location is wonderful, we walked to the Art museum as well as took in the fireworks at the Navy Pier. The staff from inside to the bellmen outdoors thanked us for our stay. Definitely will return 
22824 Everything A1 from arrival to departure. We were 4 adults, a child and a baby ant it fitted the bill perfectly for all. 
22825 Location is right in the heart of Chelsea. The staff is attentive, welcoming and the property is clean. Rooms are small, but typical for New York. The fitness center is quite small with dated equipment that no longer functions properly, but I'm told it will be replaced early 2012. 
22826 Posizione ottima e ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo 
22827 The Michelangelo is one of my favorites in NYC. The location is perfect and the rooms are gorgeous. It is a little pricy but totally worth it if you have the $$! This is where we always choose to stay when staying in the city for the night or weekend. 
22828 We got ripped off by this hotel. We booked and paid for a superior room with aircon but we are given a budget standard room without airconding. I do not recommend this hotel. 
22829 Everyone at the hotel had a desire to make our experience top notch even before we got there! The Living Social contact and the Hotel Manager could not have been nicer or more accommodating! The front desk staff was friendly and extremely knowledgeable. Service at its best! 
22830 The location is very convenient to Broadway and Time Square. If your room faces the street be prepared for excessive noise. There is no access to coffee/tea or vending machines on site. Many of the rooms are extremely small. The staff are very friendly 
22831 Watch your charges on your credit cards and service desk is dry and rude. 
22832 It is very near Central Park and walking distance of many attractions. The rooms are clean and very spacious. The room was ready when we arrived (10 in the morning) what was great after a 10 hours flight, the staff is very friendly and helpful. 
22833 As far as New York goes, great location, valet service was great so we didnt have to worry about parking...great rooms, come to think of it I'm not sure --what-- if anything they could improve on other then the price. 
22834 Great service, great location, great rooms! 
22835 I was very happy with my choice of Hotels. Simply, it was clean and friendly, and I had the best time talking with and getting to know one of the front desk fellows. Friendliness and kindness go along way in creating an atmosphere of home! 
22836 Stayed one nite. Very nice room with a fantastic view. Very clean. Great service. Doorman was very helpful in getting us cabs. Great location. 
22837 Fantastic hotel set in a nice neighbourhood. Rooms are clean and a good size. Good breakfasts served. Good metro access. 
22838 Amazing hi-tech hotel in New york! The room is not huge but very comfy and pretty. Breakfast was included but nothing special. I loved the galley where tea and coffee were complimentary and perfect for a nice coffee. You cannot find a better hotel in New York. 
22839 The public spaces and the restaurants are excellent, but the room itself was extremely small (likewise the bathroom), and the mattress not especially comfortable. At $269, a poor value. 
22840 These are the worst rooms I have ever stayed in - they are no bigger than the tiniest cruise room and the bathroom is ridiculously small. This may be the place for nightlife but not for comfort. 
22841 Excellent location, value and high quality experience. Everything you need for a perfect trip to NYC. Staff is warm, professional, and accommodating. Elizabeth, manager, welcomed us and helped us with our special requests. We would highly recommend this hotel. 
22842 Great location and very spacy suite(junior). We were allowed to keep our bikes in the room, great service! 
22843 We spent one night in a 2 bedroom suite w/kitchen. Room was very spacious and clean. Bathroom was small, but everything else was great. Bed was comfortable. Will recommend to others and stay again. 
22844 Very friendly service from the staff - and in general some nice, big and functional rooms. The breakfast / restaurant was a seperate one and not part of the hotel - but many great eating places in the area. 
22845 Only one nite stay but very pleased. Room was very clean and in excellent condition. Good breakfast and friendly staff. Microwave and fridge very handy for restaurant leftovers. Location was good. I was very impressed overall and would stay her again when visiting the area. 
22846 Uncomfortable bed, old, torn syntetic blankets and sheets and malfunctioning, noisy heating system. Dirty sofa. Overall a rundown hotel. 
22847 We loved the Eventi Hotel in New York. Everything about it was first class. The location was great, the rooms were nice, the beds were comfortable. The staff was very helpful and everything was just right. I highly recommend this hotel for visitors to New York. 
22848 The service lack finesse and consistency for a AAA - Four Diamond Award hotel. Requests like point credit and weekly email bills are ignored. Issues continued to be unresolved regardless of escalation channels. Location and newer room do not make up for their weak points. 
22849 In the heart of Manhattan, you can not get better value for money! The only quibble: Internet in the room is priced too high! 
22850 We had a suite for our family of five. The housekeeper introduced herself the first day and made our room home away from home! 
22851 We enjoyed our stay very much. The hotel is clean, modern, and well maintained. We couldn't ask for a better location in midtown; steps from Times Square, theatres, public transit, restaurants, and numerous other attractions. Included breakfast was very good. 
22852 It was fine. Glossy lobby and pool deck areas. Rooms probably were great when they were built, but they have definitely seen better days. Bathroom door swipes the toilet...the bathroom is that small. 
22853 Dit is een van de mooiste hotels waar we tijdens deze vakantie verbleven.. Vriendelijk receptie-personeel, mooie nieuwe kamers, goede parkeerplaats, net zwembad. Erg aan te raden! Natuurlijk telt mee dat het hotel erg nieuw is. De locatie is niet 'wow' maar wel oke. 
22854 E' un residence/albergo con appartamenti di due stanze e cucina, tutti i conforts e soprattutto in un indirizzo comodo e vicino al Central Park 
22855 Bellissimo hotel, vicino a Time square e Central park, le stanze non sono grandi, ma l'hotel a tutti i servizi a disposizione.. consigliato!!! 
22856 Couldn't have been more pleased with my recent stay. The staff was so nice and accommodating and my room was clean, bright and spacious. Perfect choice for a stay in the heart of Manhattan!! 
22857 Small and hot rooms, very noisy in the room. Impersonal service, and yoy feal that it is a sleeping factory. We was not impressed, The Doorman was very helpful. 
22858 All our family (2 kids) slept very well. Room was small but clean. Parking and subway station were pretty close. We will come back for sure. 
22859 This is our second stay at the London. I love the suites, you can fit three W rooms in there. The upper floors usually have a glimpse of the Park as well. Location is great - you can walk to great shopping and Theaters. I would recommend it highly. 
22860 Quite a big hotel very near the centre and in a good position. Room very luxury with two bathrooms. Very beautiful palace in fron of Grant park. Typical Hilton hospitality. 
22861 The Soho Grand just 'gets it'. The only place we will stay when we go to NY. great staff. They will even give you goldfish if you like! 
22862 Very nice small hotel in quiet neighborhood but in short walking distance to many attractions such as the Empire State Building and Times Square. Staff was very helpful and friendly. 
22863 Very well-placed for key mid-town locations. Room (as expected) quite small with limited facilities, but that was fine. Good shower and heating facilities in room. Used wi-fi service - worked perfectly. Staff very helpful on few occasions we needed them. Could see Empire State from window! 
22864 Just returned from a 4 night break with three other couples, hotel very warm and welcoming, rooms clean & comfortable, great location, staff cannot do enough for you, even checked and printed our return flights, we will be back, what a find!!!! 
22865 nice entrance of the hotel. great stall nice people and service, good food , beautiful pool area, and a very but very good spa. tha massage was uniqeu, the food in the restaurant great and i will be back for sure 
22866 We stayed here on our way through to Belize. The staff couldn't be more accomodating. Friendly & efficient, they really made us feel welcome. 
22867 The location is amazing, but the price ($310 per night for 4 nights' stay WITH Military discount!) was way too much for the tiny bathroom, tepid & weak shower and grim aspect of the front desk. 
22868 Most incredible stay. The staff is pleasant and very helpful. Rooms are extremely clean. Views and the veranda are excellent. Aston was more then helpful as always. He made us feel very comfortable. This was are second stay in the hotel and are looking forward to going back. 
22869 The check-in time was fast and friendly. Although I wished the room could be cleaned or beddings changed more frequently, given the very competitive rates, I guess I had value for what I paid. If I ever have business in the area, this will be surely my place to stay! 
22870 Stayed at the hotel the week between Christmas and New Years.The location is good to the show areas. There is a lot of coffee shops and place to eat near the hotel. 
22871 More a convention property than an upscale Fairmont property. Well located near the Art Institute and Millennium Park, this is a good property that delivers little of the personal services you expect at a quality Fairmont property. 
22872 Stayed here recently and were very impressed with the clean room with small kitchenette. the happy hour was fantastic with wine, beer, hot appetizers etc. The breakfast the next morning was also expansive and delicious with hot eggs, bagels, oatmeal, fruit etc. The doormen were so friendly and nice. 
22873 We had a great stay. The room was new and the staff friendly. Particular note to Brian the Doorman. 
22874 Just stayed 6 nights at this hotel and were overall very pleased. Clean room, friendly staff, free breakfast and free WiFi, and the location was perfect. A special thanks to the staff member who saw the long line-up at the elevator and took us up the service elevator. 
22875 Have real difficulty in understanding the negatives on the Park Central. For the price it is excellent. Rooms are clean, the staff is helpful and the location is great. 
22876 The staff was very helpful and friendly. The only negative is the elevators are a little slow. Great location 
22877 Wonderfully attentive hotel staff, especially the front desk. Would go again in a heartbeat! 
22878 booked last minute at newark airport.were the first people to stay in the new up-graded rooms.very clean !! double bed flat screen tv, bit of a walk to time square but plenty of life in the area 
22879 Stayed there on the recommendation of a friend.. After my stay, I had to call my friend and thank them for the great suggestion. Would recommend it to anyone and look forward to staying there again, the next time I'm in town. 
22880 The rooms were beautiful. The central location was great and the staff was excellent. The price was also right!!!!!!!! Whenever I make it to Houston again I will most definitely stay at this hotel. They also have 24hr security. 
22881 I don't know if I was lucky but I got a huge room, clean, and comfortable! Internet was $5 per day easy and working. Everything was fine and the price affordable. Bravo! 
22882 This hotel was fab, lovely rooms and facilities. The location is absolutely brilliant, 5 mins walk to Saks 5th Avenue and the Rockefeller Centre. 
22883 Fastest hotel check-in I ever experienced! Rather small but functional room at great price. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would stay there again. 
22884 Hotel was beautiful. The room was bigger than most New York hotel rooms. Which made the stay that much better. Very clean and the staff was so friendly and helpful!! The gym is HUGE and the spa is fantastic 
22885 Hotel perfetto, servizio ok, camere grandi e ben tenute, collegamento wifi gratuito, colazione ottima, anche europea, posizione invidiabile. 
22886 Convenient location, comfortable, and nice staff. I'd recommend getting a room with private bath. Relatively quiet, but I'd recommend earplugs if you are sensitive to noise. Hotels in NYC are expensive, and this place is a good deal for the price. 
22887 Great hotel in Manhattan. Excellent location, large room by NY standard, great free breakfast, very friendly staff. The only issue was the housekeeping, always careless. Some reviews complain about noise problems, it was not an issue for me. 
22888 Hotel was quiet, staff was always friendly. Great area to relax after site-seeing. Room was small but adequate. I have seen much smaller rooms for more money. 
22889 I wanted to personally thank David at the front desk and Carmelo David, for fixing up the room thanks to a booking stuff up (he fixed it in no time) Carmelo for being a good guide and great service. Location, room everything was great. Will be definitely heading back! 
22890 Room was upgraded when we checked in. Hotel was excellent. 
22891 In my opinion is a bit old but the attention was excellent.The best of the hotel is the location!! Just half block of time square.. Also is very clean. There is no wifi and is not true that room is noisy on the contrary it is very quit. 
22892 The moment we arrived there we felt the brialliant atmosphere and the service of the people were ace all in all it was one of the most delightful hotels I have had the pleasure of staying at. It was the best by far. 
22893 The hotel is clean and the staff is friendly but the rooms are a bit small.. other than that i didnt have a problem here had a great time in NYC 
22894 Stayed just for a day as a business traveller. Overall 1. Good sized room - compared to those in NYC 2. Decent view - considering 3. Good location bad - you have to pay for breakfast which can be costly if you are a tourist 
22895 We resisted advise to stay in the heart of Times Square & really enjoyed the location of the Blakely. It was convenient to the theatre, Central Park, TOTR, & the subway entrance. 
22896 Stayed at this hotel on a recent business trip. Room was small but nice. Location was convenient to Michigan Ave shops and Rush Street restaurants. Staff was pleasant 
22897 Had a great stay at the Lucerne over Christmas. Staff was friendly and helpful, and our room was very clean. Unfortunately it was also very tiny. Should be expected though in New York. Overall had a terrific stay! 
22898 Top located Hotel in Manhattan 
22899 Short distances tot e.g. Rockefeller Center, central park, moma 5th avenue , Limes square and tot subway. Ihr Roms are very small gut clean. You dont spent man time in Tee room so it fits 
22900 Free wifi at Tee lounge und in Tee Roms. 
22901 Spent a long weekend here in January 2008. We typically stay at the Roosevelt when we visit NYC. Good location. Close to Grand Central, Times Square, Rockefeller Center. Nice accommodations, friendly staff, clean rooms. 
22902 Abbiamo soggiornato al Paramount fidandoci dell'agenzia ma avremmo dovuto leggere le recensioni di Trip Advisor! Confermiamo le camere minuscole, rattoppate (frutto di un restauro approssimativo), i bagni sporchi. Buona solo la posizione e la cortesia del personale. 
22903 Trendy hotel with young clientele. Even though we were given an upgraded room upon arrival, our room was smallish with shabby furniture 
22904 It was very hot! Even when we turned off the heat and kept the windows open (in the middle of winter), it was warm. 
22905 Not bad for last minute stay in the city. Close to Subway which was nice. Room and bathroom were clean but would have preferred private bathrooom. 
22906 Top hotel. Walking distance to everything. If you are going to run NYCM, this hotel is top. We will book in next year too. Looking forward to 2012. Nice people clean hotel. Just go ahead. Have no fear. 
22907 The DoubleTree Metropolitan Hotel by Hilton on Lexington Ave. NY was excellent... Great Service and our housekeeping in Room 1635 was perfect...Enjoyed a great night of rest for a reasonable price! 
22908 the hotel was great so was the staff me and my friends loved it, we will be coming back here the next time were in town. the room was clean, relaxing, water was great, and location was great we all loved it. 
22909 The location is very central. You can reach Time Square in a view mintues walk. The rooms are clean an the service excellent. The rooms are a small, but at least they have enough space for a short visit. 
22910 Fantastic service and rooms. Roof top bar was a little shabby undergoing renovation at the time. A fair walk to ockerfella ect but done us good Lovely resturant attatche (RARE). Had a wonderful time!! 
22911 great hotel great location for ny city.rooms comfortable and clean.hotel staff very friendly and obliging.good choice for breakfast free wifi.free safe.free extension on the room.free gym on the basement.couldnt fault anything would recomend this hotel to any one.would stay here again 
22912 Stayed in June 2003. No restaurant just bar snacks, contrary to website information. Breakfast appalling, may harm you! Indifferent service at best. Staff more interested in their image than guests. Noise from street constantly from delivery and rubbish vehicles. Best thing was central location. There must be better vfm elsewhere. 
22913 room was dirty, and I ordered a wake up call but was never awaken. The hotel doesn't even have a vending machine in case you want to drink something cold 
22914 The room was neat and clean. The bed was amazing! Staff was super friendly and helpful. It was very close to Times Square and within walking distance of the majority of the tourist attractions we went to. Will definitely stay again if we make it back to New York. 
22915 This hotel is in the heart of Times Square! The hotel itself is beautiful and has a great atmosphere! Our room was a good size, with a very comfy bed and an amazing view of Times Square. The service was fantastic. Highly recommend this location! 
22916 I went to Chicago for concert with a bunch of friends and Hotel Felix was in the best location to our venue.plus so many food options.great time had by our whole bunch!!!! 
22917 My wife and I indulged ourselves with a stay here over the Christmas holiday season. Absolutely beautiful! The hotel's Christmas decorations were exquisite. The amenities were great. Expensive but worth every penny for a special occasion. 
22918 This is a real good choice for multinight stays. The Envoy Club rooms are surprisingly spacious, clean and well maintained. The staff work hard to please. I would definately return. 
22919 The price for the type of room and location was very good considering how expensive hotels in manhattan are. We stayed in the superios suit and the service was very good. Only downside is that the building has no elevator...and the stairs are very tight 
22920 Such a convenient location; rooms very clean; nice meal. Can't beat it! Only problem is there are two elevators for nearly 20 floors; a very slow system; 
22921 The Empire Hotel's location is perfect! It's walking distance to the Central Park. The rooms are chic and hip. My only comment was that the bathrooms need a little renovation. I am not fond of bath tubs and maybe they should consider just installing enclosed showers. 
22922 Lived up to our expectations. A truly peaceful respite from the craziness of Times Square. We had a problem with the car service pick up but the front desk made amends for the consequent delay. Otherwise perfect. 
22923 Great Experience. Accommodations were unique. Would definately stay again. Avada Products in bathroom. 
22924 Everything was perfect and everyone at the hotel was very friendly and I needed the refrigerator for my room and with in a few minutes someone brought it up to my room. We all had a great stay and good food in the restaurant. 
22925 Zu den weiteren Einrichtungen des Hotels kann ich eigentlich nichts berichten, wir haben es nur zum Schlafen genutzt und waren sonst unterwegs. Reservierung problemlos, aber sonst haben wir keinen Service genutzt 
22926 This well maintained LaQuinta offers easy access to the Museums and Medical Services in central Houston. Breakfast is sufficient and varied for guests with special needs or preferences. This is our practical and pleasant hotel of choice in Houston. 
22927 The hotel is in a great location - within walking distance to Broadway shows, Subway exits and Grayline tour. The rooms were very nice and surprisingly, no sound from Times Square could be heard inside. I would definitely stay here again. 
22928 Just stayed at the Crowne plaza, wonderful experience, Staff was great, everyone was very helpful. Great location in Times Square. Would definitely stay there again 
22929 Rooms are small (which is the average for New York, but not particularly THIS small), staff is pleasant enough and the beds are comfy, but you can definitely do better as far as picking a place to stay, even at another Hilton family hotel. 
22930 He estado con mi familia por una semana aca, y ha sido una excelente opcion, ya que este hotel esta muy cerca de todo. Las habitaciones algo viejas, pero muy limpias y muy bien equipadas... Definitivamente una abuena opcion!!! 
22931 What old world charm and feel. it was a differenct era when service and luxury was expected and delivered. 
22932 Just back from three days at Yotel. Nice place, well located and helpful staff (Jeremy the concierge in particular). Rooms are small and perhaps a bit noisy but it is overall great value for the price. I would return. 
22933 Very proffesional staff. Hotel rooms need modernizing. Beautiful, classic lobby 
22934 Great location, clean room(though small), nice bathroom, friendly staff. 
22935 The hotel rooms were under renovation and the new decor was really pretty. The parking lot is kind of dark and hardly had any guests. The only complaint is I was awakened by construction workers who began working before 8 AM directly across the hall from my room! 
22936 We had a corner room on the 19th floor with a great view over Manhatten. That was truly a great experience. The room was big (got an upgrade), the bathroom was huge and the amenities the best I have seen! I 
22937 El Hotel es excelente a no ser por la cantidad impresionante de personas que circukan constantemente por los lugares comunes. Como casi siempre se realizan convenciones, supongo q ese fue el motivo.No volveria. 
22938 Atencion del personal ( espectacular), ubicacion magnifica, solicite un piso alto, por lo que no me molesto para nada el ruido, El unico detalle es el tamano de las habitaciones, pero seguro que regreso. 
22939 un hotel alla moda, arredato con uno stile eclettico e molto ricercato. le camere standard sono effettivamente piccole e i soffitti sono bassi, adatte a chi viaggia con un bagaglio leggero, ma sono confortevoli e ben organizzate. molto buono il livello del servizio. 
22940 Perfectly efficient, meticulously clean, smart, and modern. When the purpose of your visit involves minimal time in your room, but when you want to trust that your room has all that you need. Fun, and the future. 
22941 Very central, close proximity to major tourist areas. Very pleasant staff, room is very clean. Would stay here again. 
22942 Really budget type hotel needs cleaning up, has smell in the corridors that does not get to the rooms. Makes up for it with excellent staff lannete, Lydia. Relatively safe environs. 
22943 A great deal right in midtown Manhattan! Surprisingly big rooms, great concierge, great value. Unable to afford a brownstone, I use this hotel as my New York pied-a-terre! 
22944 Nice lobby, public areas, breakfast and bar. Short pool schedule, but worth arranging the day to accomodate a relaxing soak in the 92 degree pool. It was wonderful. Our room on the west side was dead quiet. 
22945 We stated at the Marriott Marquis for the weekend. What a great location for going to the theater or just enjoying New York. We had a room with a view of Times Square that was just fantastic. 
22946 another kind of hotel is yotel ... small, but very stylish rooms/ cabins! ... great self service wakes the child in the man --> robot locker,.... ... test it! 
22947 I stayed here on business during labor day 2007 and the hotel is excellent. The rooms are spacious and well appointed. The seperate bathroom is a incredible. The staff was very helpful. The location of this hotel is great for walking to the local parks and history venues. 
22948 We spent there 9 nights. The hotel was located quite near to the Empire State Building and many other attractives. Price was also reasonable. It included continental breakfast which was good enough to carry you to late lunch. 
22949 A 10 min walk from times square this hotel is a great one.Brand new , very clean with very friendly staff , topped with an excelent location 
22950 I went to this hotel during the Columbus weekend with my husband! Had the best time! the food we ordered in the room was amazing, the service was fast. Beautiful room. One of the most relaxed weekends of my life.. 
22951 Our room was dirty. The carpet was caked in filth. The bathroom was dirty. There was mold in the shower. The room was tiny. It's the smallest hotel room I've ever stayed in. The air conditioner blew directly on the bed. The location was great. 
22952 Lo suggeriamo per chi si reca per la prima volta a NYC la location e' strategica. M&G 
22953 This is the third time we've stayed at Hotel Edison. Hotel Edison has met our expectations each time and we look forward to visiting again! 
22954 I wish I would have known about The Marmara sooner. I stay in NYC often. Such a great value! The staff is so helpful, and very pleasant! The suites are so spacious and clean. It's not a bad walk to central park. I would highly recommend The Marmara!! 
22955 fantastic hotel, great area, super service, speachless !!!!!!!!!!!!!! we'll be back 
22956 A typical overpriced NYC hotel. Tired, dirty and damp hotel room. Carpet was discusting. 
22957 Firts time in NY and we sayed in this hotel for 7 nights. Smal room, but clean and cozy. Metro at "the next corner" and walking distance to everything. Near Greenwich Village and Meatdistrict, lots of restaurants .... Jazz clubs ..... Short terms, Great location and nice hotel. 
22958 Higher Floors feature views of Statue of Liberty. Non-connecting rooms and rooms away from the elevator and ice machine are the quietest. 
22959 Right in the heart of the mall. Great location. Not great sound proofing between the bedrooms. 
22960 We stayed at The Drake for one night. The service was wonderul and the room was fine. We were shocked at the price of valet parking, considerably higher than other ramps nearby. inquire about the charge before you book 
22961 Hotel price increased and service reduced They charging $ 15 for breakfast now... No option for me anymore Was last btime to stay there 
22962 Just a word - this isn't really a destination hotel per se but it is a great place to stay in LA. It's a lovely city hotel tucked into a side street, with smaller rooms that are beautifully appointed, a gorgeous, fabulous restaurant and terrific staff. 
22963 Just spent a fabulous few days in New York with my son. I have stayed in Sofitel in New York before and yet again had a very enjoyable stay. The staff are very welcoming and helpful. Location great for shopping, theatre and all main attractions. 
22964 I had I lovely stay at the affinia shelburne hotel. I got in rather late but Yvette was there to greet us with a smile and a suggestion about a 24hr deli that was open and Delivered!!....The room was comfortable and my stay in NY was great...I'll be back........ 
22965 Esta ofertado por el corte ingles. Pero es un gran timo, luego te dicen que no lo sabian y que le hablan muy bien de el,(y te lo cobran muy bien). Solo la situacion es buena.Si quieres pasar la noche en vela te lo recomiendo. 
22966 Great hotel. Check-in was easy and the room was as expected. Room was comfy and cleaning staff extremely nice with the customer as their #1 priority. Located very close to subways, Broadway, Central Park, the LOVE sculpture on Avenue of the Americas, Rockefeller Center, and more. 
22967 The service was fantastic. The view is breathtaking from the clean and beautifully decorated rooms 
22968 The staff was courtious and helpful when ever they were called upon. i certainly would recommend this hotel to any of my friends or business partners. 
22969 I was here in October, room was clean and nice, location of the hotel is excellent!! Monica - one of the staff - was very nice and helpful!!!! When I come back, I definitelly choose Ameritania again!!!!!! 
22970 Friendly & helfpul staff. Great location. Great view from our room. 
22971 Great stay that surpassed my expectations. Enjoyed the restuarant as well, the service was superb. 
22972 Pros: Rooms completely restored. Ipod docks. Kindly Staff. Good location (Broadway and 77th.). Internet wifi free in rooms. Cons: Too small rooms. 
22973 The room I had is a suit with separated bedroom with 2 side window viewing downtown Chicago. ihome, nice hair dryer, very small impressive details. Yet, I paid $145. No brainer. 
22974 The staff was outstanding. The rooms were very large and the tubs to die for. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that appreciates great service. 
22975 I have a wide range of options as I stay for business. I always choose the NY Hilton as I love the location, I love the Hilton Honors points and I love the staff. It is a big convention hotel but, they somehow make the traveler feel welcome. 
22976 We were made very welcome and made to feel special. The manager Lesley was exceptionally good and went out of his way to ensure our stay was fantastic. All in all the staff were friendly and so helpful. 
22977 This is a very nice hotel in a great location. Only complaint is the wifi in the room which was terrible and generally didn't work, the signal was fine in the reception lobby though? 
22978 Nice hotel and atmosphere. Excellent location! They have the most amazing staff,their concierge Sergio exceed expectation. We will look forward to staying there whenever we visit New York as well as recommending the hotel to all our friends. 
22979 Located on a side street about 5 blocks from the main part of Times Square. Wonderful upgraded suite with big living room. Very clean and up to date. Friendly staff and a especially good breakfast. Small but adequate bathroom and a very comfortable bed. Would definitely stay again. 
22980 The room was very nice, but was charged a $21 fee for local calls and wi-fi service that I didn't use. This is a mandatory fee and is not included in the Hotwire price. 
22981 This was the second time I have stayed at this property due to it being connected to O'Hare. Both times were nice. The cost of everything from room, food, and parking is a bit on the high side. The staff is very friendly and the rooms are updated and clean. 
22982 Muy buena ubicacion,cerca del lago,subte y centro.Tiene una cafeteria y restauranta aceptables.Habitaciones comodas.Excelente precio.Vaya tranquilo 
22983 hotel centralissimo a midtown, camere accoglienti e pulite, staff gentilissimo 
22984 The mini bar is quite expensive, nice bathroom and a comfy bed! Small room, back alley view but so far we have enjoyed our stay. A nice hotel with very nice employees. 
22985 Het hotel is op sommige punten gedateerd, maar het schoon en netjes. Goede prijs-kwaliteitverhouding. Locatie is perfect, centraal gelegen. Waarom meer luxe, je bent in New York, dus zo min mogelijk is je hotel! 
22986 This place is like a factory Rooms are tired to say the least. Good location if you like theatre but really ad said it's like a mass factory. So many rooms too Many people to make one feel relaxed. 
22987 per chi non vuole la baraonda del centro ma vuole tenersi in posizione comoda e in quartiere elegante. Buoni ristoranti nelle vicinanze (Isabella's - Citrus) Bella la terrazza, la camera confortevole, non la vista dalle finestre (un muro), personale cordiale - 
22988 stayed 6 nights. Great location. Rooms are absolutely tiny, nearly had to stand in hall while husband got dresses!! Got used to it and didnt take on notice in the end. Bar quite expensive and resturant is sushi and chinese. Staff couldnt be more helpful. Would return again, no problem. 
22989 The location is OK, close to the '1' metro line. Room is very very small (Can't leave suitcase open when in room). Free Wifi with code reseved at front desk. 
22990 This is my second visit and second review of the Wingate Inn. This is a wonderful hotel, the staff are absolutely fantastic (dramatic improvement on my visit last year), great location. Complimentary breakfast, comfortable rooms. 10/10 for everything! Will use this hotel again. 
22991 Very nice hotel ;Helpful staff day and night , parking facility ,excellent room service 
22992 All this in a very good location 
22993 Location is excellent if you're looking for River North area. Hotel is very quiet, clean, and well appointed rooms. The value for the price is very good but this is a basic business hotel without the large groups. 
22994 We had a great stay at this hotel. Staff was friendly and courteous. Would stay here again. 
22995 It's easy to get on the CTA and commute to other areas of Chicago while staying at Club Quarters. The room has some noise early in the morning, like water pipe banging noise. The hotel also offers a laundry area which is a big help when you're hoping between hotels. 
22996 So-so hotel. rooms good size. tired looking lobby. doors slam and really need modernizing to keep noise level down. We moved after a night to Holiday Inn Express. Much better there. 
22997 Gran Hotel, muy buenas habitaciones, buen servicio, buena ubicacion. 
22998 This place is unbeleivably basic but cheap and very good location 
22999 Just across from Penn Station makes this place easy when coming and going by train. Don't expect top service and possibly expect long lines. But the rooms are pretty good and usually you can't beat the price for NYC. 
23000 This hotel is perfectly located in Manhatthan, close to the subway and ESB. The service was fine, when our tap was broken, they fixed it right away. Breakfast is simple, but fine. I would definitely recommand this hotel! 
23001 Staff provided excellent, friendly service. Room was small , but adquate. Restaurant was great for breakfast and wonderful for quick lunch , grilled salmon was wonderful. Close to everything 
23002 Paramount hotel gives you a good NY experience. The location is real very good, near Times Square and Broadway. The rooms are real real small but that was the same in my previous stay in another NY hotel. Very modern and clean. Nice decor. 
23003 Weird wrong but centrally located. Walls are carpeted and the reception frequented by strange types... Not pleasant in the slightest 
23004 This is a clean, well-staffed Hampton Inn, though the rooms are small. That's okay, it's the surrounding neighborhood that is very uncomfortable. 
23005 We spent five nights here the second week of August and were very happy with the room, the price-point and the service. The only draw-back was not having wi-fi available in the room, but it is available in the lobby. I would stay here again in a New York minute. 
23006 OK, but was expecting more. Great location, service was accepable but at the price expected more 
23007 A supposedly top hotel in the city that never sleeps needs to offer 24/7 bar and coffee shop facilities. 
23008 This hotel has very friendly and attentive staff. The rooms are spacious with the most comfortable beds. Hotel also features a rooftop bar and swimming pool. The restaurant is also wonderful with late night dining hours. We would definitely stay at this hotel again. 
23009 Nice location, nearby Empire State Building and Time Square! But very Small... 
23010 They were very rude, unhelpful, and the rooms were very small. I checked in and it had a weird smell once we got into the room. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. You can find a much better hotel for the same price, or cheaper. 
23011 The waldorf towers is the best hotel i have every stayed at. The service was impeccable and the rooms are absolutely gorgeous. i felt like royalty. no wonder why all the famous people stay here. everything was perfect. 
23012 Had an excellent stay at this hotel over new years. The staff are so polite, hard to fault this place. 
23013 Wonderful location,Large rooms,Fantastically comfortable beds.Staff mainly friendly.Eat out rather than in the hotel,it can be costly 
23014 Great location, clean, tidy, staff are extremely helpful! Only downfall is that the hotel rooms are in need of refurbishment, they're very tired looking. Must say it didn't spoil our trip! 
23015 Stayed here for an overnight before going on a cruise. It is in a super location convenient to great shopping,restaurants, and theaters. Very clean and modern with an amazing bar and view. Large rooms for NYC. I would stay here again. 
23016 To stay somewhere in mid-town Manhatten that is reasonably priced and has the most comfortable beds ever together with really luxurious pillows and linens is worth sharing. The room was quiet and cool and had all the usual ammenities plus really good coffee to make in the room - perfect. 
23017 One of the best hideaways in the middle of Houston. Premier service and the level of quality only the discerning guest could appreacite. We look forward to going back soon. Keep up the great service Granduca!!! Sincerely, Gary and Louise Moss 
23018 Arrived at the hotel, staff friendly and helpful, room exelent, large clean and welcoming.First time in new york hotel staff very helpful would stay again.The work going on in the hotel did not affact us in any way. 
23019 A great value at a great location great staff nice bar overall a real find 
23020 This is a fantastic hotel, with great service from all. The location is wonderful. We ran along Lake Michigan in the morning. The El is right outside the door. Endless shopping and a great museum within walking distance. 
23021 Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights and thoroughly enjoyed it. A very well placed hotel close to Times Square, Central Park, etc. Hotel is clean, rooms are more than adequate for the length of time you spend there. Would definitely recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Manhattan. 
23022 Buono il prezzo per gli standard di NYC ma assolutamente carente il servizio di pulizia. In una settimana non ci sono mai state cambiate le lenzuola e gli asciugami del bagno. Non ci sono partizolari servizi all'interno dell'hotel che non riporta nemmeno l'insegna all'esterno. 
23023 My recent stay here was excellent as usual. There's not a lot that can be improved! The hotel car was a real boon over using NY cabs. Joel the concierge was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. There's no other place to stay! 
23024 We got a great deal through Southwest Vacations for this hotel. We only paid about $200/person for air and hotel from MSP. We were pleasantly suprised with the hotel, great location, friendly staff, good cookies. 
23025 This Is my second rekview. Last time I gave four points, because I had encountered some noise problems and some entering the hotel. These problems seem to be solved. Everything was great. The only negative point is the arrogant way of some female receptionist at check-out. 
23026 Would definetly stay there again staff was wonderful service was great and rooms were very comfortable pricey but well worth it. 
23027 Some rooms are newer & nicer than others - ours was full of beds which were incredibly squeaky. Two bathrooms per floor (about 6 bedrooms with 6 people sharing them) so gets dirty and long waits... Decent location but expected more for the price 
23028 The room was small but very nice. Bed was comfotable. Room was quiet (no street noise for us). Bell man was also helpful. We enjoyed having an after dinner drink at Murphy's next door and suggest trying the 'Baby Guiness' before going back to your room. 
23029 davvero notevole, bellissime camere, albergo recente, servizio eccellente 
23030 Exceptionally well located boutique hotel. Never pay retail here, always go to skoosh or easyclick travel to get rooms at 50% off. The hotel does not match. Very pleasant lobby and small but well appointed rooms. Comfortable hotel for business, that is anot a westin or hilton in character. 
23031 Given that I travel every week I always look for properties that are comfortable and a good value. The people at the Westin go out of their way to make your visit enjoyable. The reservation staff are top shelf!! 
23032 great location,great air conditioner-very friendly people .front desk was under construction but it was still great 
23033 Great location right on Michigan Ave for shopping/restaurants. Very nice Hotel! 
23034 the first room they palmed us off with was grotty,stained walls ,thread bare carpets,and smelled musty,this room was on the sixth floor. after complaining they put us on the eleventh floor,this room was decent,so if you stay here stay on the eleventh or twelth floor. 
23035 Generally friendly staff doesn't make up for the total lack of daylight and bathrooms the size of closets... 
23036 Nice hotel with a friendly staff. Room was clean and everything was in working order. Lighting in the room does need improvement. The rooms do have a cavelke feeling. 
23037 The location is great, clean rooms, warm hospitality, discreet service and privacy. 
23038 well small rooms but clean and great location - where else can u get a room in ny for less than 100$ 
23039 central location for most attractions, we were given room 2007 on top floor overlooking downtown, breakfast included, free wi-fi, free local calls, friendly staff 
23040 nice clean hotel at a great location: walking distance to Soho, Chinatown, Little Italy (what's left of it), Washington Square and battery park. A 30 second walk to the subway. Staff friendly and helpful. If you can get the right price, this is a good option. 
23041 Wonderful European style hotel located near Broadway and Times Square. Rooms and staff are great. Bernie, the bartender in the lobby lounge, has been there for years. He does a great job and will give you the straight scoop on restaurants, shows, etc. 
23042 Always loved this hotel, could not believe the beautiful job done on remodeling. Great location, we loved it. 
23043 this was a family vacation everything was excellent from information to directions. could not have had a better place to stay. 
23044 Its clean in the City and is easy to get to Places every one once to see Hotel arranges also trips 
23045 We stayed here for 4 nights and really enjoyed it. Good location for walking, close to Empire State, Penn station and great Asian food all around. Rooms were clean, comfy and quiet. The breakfast was ok, had to be in early for the nice fruit and yogurts. 
23046 This was an great hotel. I was a little scared due to some of the mixed reviews I read. But I had a excellent time here. The rooms were large and clean. Everything was in walking distance. And my Wi fi worked perfect. 
23047 Nice stay for three day weekend. Utilized accessible room and it was very functional. Staff very helpful. Pricey for weekend, but what isnt these days. Comfy beds and pillows. Nice exedcise facility. Close to museims. 
23048 The room looms nothing like the pics on the web. They are very poorly maintained and smell like mold. There also isnt even any bath soap provided. I was completely grossed out and would never recommend this hotel to anyone. 
23049 my friends came to NY and i stayed at the Affinia last summer and it was great! loved the style and it was extremely clean. I've been to quite a few hotels in the city and this is certainly a good one 
23050 the rooms are sound proof and your r right in the spot!!! very trendy.... i loved it 
23051 We were presently surprised by this hotel. This hotel is a great find with very clean rooms, solid luxury furnishing. It has the feel of the top hotel and the price was right. Very large rooms with nice bathrooms. 
23052 Location is ideal about a five min walk from Times Square. Room was big for New York with 2 double beds. Free business centre with printer available to all guests along with complimentary tea and coffee. Staff were friendly and helpful. 
23053 Had a good stay at Ramada Inn during out visit to Chicago. John Brown, our driver, was very nice and made us feel right at home. THanks John! 
23054 Would not stay here again. Service was bad and the concierge was nothing more that useless. 
23055 Old hotel in great location, staff are friendly, its just a big hotel lacking a bit of life, have to pay to much for wi-fi , rooms are adequate, lifts were dodgy if not working at all. Overall it was fine 
23056 Efficient people at the reception - very slow service and not always friendly at the breakfast in the restaurant 
23057 Terible rooms ar badlay neading atenshon and i just hav walkted in my 3rd room since the outher 2 wer deskusting i hav staid in far better frentch youth hostals that ar cleener 
23058 When I say I was treated like absolute loyalty I'm not kidding!!!! The service was amazing!!! The check in and check out was pleasant and efficient. The location is amazing!!!! My only little problem was cleanliness, but the staff immediately took care of that too for us!!!! Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! 
23059 We had a large room on the 24th floor with a wonderfull view over Central Park. Good queensizebed, nice bathroom and the decoration was classic buth tastefull. The location is perfect, next to fifth avenue. You can have breakfast at Sarabeths next door. 
23060 On Central park West, between W 106th and 107th street. Clean, small room, essential (no fridge, no safe box, no brealfast as usual in NYC, no frills), enjoyed low price. 
23061 This hotel is beautiful inside and out. The rooms are delightfully decorated. The staff pays attention to details. Always courteous, offering water, opening doors, and handling the luggage. The food was yummy. And the lounge had great energy in a spectacular setting. I was one happy lady at this hotel. 
23062 ho soggiornato in questo hotel per una settimana con la mia famiglia. posizione strategica per le principali mete di new york. camera spaziosa pulita e molto silenziosa, personale disponibile per tutte le esigenze. veramente 4 stelle! 
23063 Everyone in the the hotel was very friendly and professional. I stay there frequently and always feel at home.Ann Mara Gayle who is in guest relations is always on top of her job and and very courteous. 
23064 I wanted to command the excellent service we have received, specially from the concierge staff that helped us with the directions and booking a quick tour of Chicago. The hotel location is just excellent and in the center of all attractions in the city. 
23065 The carpet smelled like sweaty feet. I asked to have the carpet cleaned but to no avail the smell stayed. Although it was faint but it still existed. But on the plus side the room service was great. 
23066 Location: It's just a couple of blocks to Rockefeller Center. Next door there's a Cafe Metro so you can eat something quick. Service: Good, they even give you a hot cookie when yoy checkin. Room: It was ok, but a little cold. 
23067 We checked in on Friday July 3 for one night. This hotel is conveniently located within walking distance of Times Square. The room was nicely done and large by NY standards. Check in was a breeze. Underground parking was pricey -$50 for a night. 
23068 it is a great place to stay at when on a budget... i had a great time there..its a no frills place with shared bathrooms... the manager (forgot his name, a greek guy) was very nice to us and seemed very professional. i will stay there again when in NY. 
23069 Great stay! Everything was great, especially Antonella who recommended a great Italian restaurant. Our bathroom had a view of the Empire state building and was very roomy. This hotel is extremely clean and very quiet. I would definitely stay here again! 
23070 Ottimo hotel, camere pulite e spaziose, una chicca la vista del Chrysler Building dalla finestra della nostra stanza, personale disponibile e gentile, arredamento bello e confortevole. Ottima posizione e zona abbastanza tranquilla per il riposo notturno; nel complesso uno splendido soggiorno. 
23071 a wonderful old landmark on the magnificent mile, beautiful architecture,close to bus line, subway, lovely staff at the front desk, an all around wonderful experience!!!Only down side, elevators small and crowded when conventions, meetings let out. 
23072 Great location and great rooms! I was very pleased with my stay of two nights via a nicely discounted Hotwire room reservation. $150/night plus big NYC taxes. 
23073 The staff here could not be nicer or more helpful. Came here for my mom's birthday and they took great care of us! One of the best hotel experiences I've ever had in NYC! 
23074 The best hotel in my trip to USA this summer. The view of the rooms is amazing. And the service is perfect. 
23075 Staff was very helpful, courteous and the internet was easy to use with the password provided. 
23076 And we will definitely be back! We love the friendly, super clean, comfortable atmosphere of this hotel. It's conveniently located to the subway with plenty of stores and restaurants in walking distance. Our home away from home :)) 
23077 We stayed for 6 days and had a great time. The rooms were clean and much bigger than most hotels for the price. There could have been more cable channels but not bad. Right next to the Flushing Mall, and many great restaurants. We Would and will go back there. 
23078 Great bars and a lot of energy wanting to be cool. Awesome location. Lousy service , lousy rooms. Not even a bottle of water I can buy in my room?? 
23079 Great location, near the metro, restaurants, shops, bars, Central Park, the Hudson. Big Nick's Eatery is just beside it -- great for everything you could possibly want for breakfast. Staff were very friendly though the plumbing was uncertain. 
23080 very impresive hotel very kind stuff the best location in ny for tourist 
23081 Great central location, very friendly staff and well maintained, clean rooms. Especially liked the complementary cookie on arrival. Can get a little noisy with the fire station so close but overall a very enjoyable stay in NYC. 
23082 Wood floors in the spacious bath with a large counter. Solid core beds so comfy with no bugs. Sign up with Accor Hotels online for good deals $200/nt upper floor king room in Theatre District. Maid iii. 
23083 people were fabulous, even the doorman and the service..however the property itself is getting "run down"....been staying there for years..now seeing its age....had to switch rooms twice because of heater issues, food was only mediocre (room service)..used to be great ! 
23084 Recently opened, small, contemporary boutique small hotel. Private, quiet and personal. Service and accommodations superb. Stayed last weekend and hope to go back next week! 
23085 Stayed three nights. Everyone was extremely friendly. Front desk, maids, the man who cleaned the workout room, all were very, very nice. Room was adequate. Not posh by any means but nice. I would stay here again. Oh, and the hotel is well located. 
23086 fabulous stay made all the more so by the attentive and warm staff, particularly Danielle at the front desk. A beautiful chocolate cake awaited us upon our arrival ( for our anniversary) and our room was comfortable and clean w/ a superb view. would not hesitate to stay there again. 
23087 Absolutely lovely, great location and fantastic staff. would def. recommend 
23088 Very small rooms, uncorfortable bathroom, and a lot of people at the lobby. Absolutely unpleasant for the amount of money you must pay. 
23089 I booked one night stay online. Two consecutive nights were booked. I stayed the first night and checked out. I was billed for two nights. Management rejected my request for credit and were totally unsympathetic. I will not return to this hotel. 
23090 99% perfect !! Always return to the Le Parker - consistent. Singing bellman Maurice is a keeper 
23091 Very close to Wall Street, Native American Museum and Battery Park. Hotel was overall really good. Bathrooms a bit small and only three elevators for 44 floors of rooms. Chocolate chip cookie at registration is delicious. 
23092 Best room I have stayed in New York. Sure, still small but hey its NY. Clean, tidy and good standard. I never tried the food or other service but I received good help by personell at the desk and lobby. Recommended. 
23093 The Belvedere really is a great hotel in a superb location. The staff are helpful and courteous, the room was a good size and immaculately clean, and the location is perfect. Recommended! 
23094 The reception staff & management were really helpful, in particular Idris and Kristin. As for the bellmen, Jamie, Eddie and Ray to name but a few, they were ever present and could not do enough to help. The breakfast staff were efficient and the food was of a nice standard. 
23095 The location is amazing - 2 minutes walk from Time Square. The rooms are tiny, but - you haven't arrived to see the rooms, and they are arranged in a way to max out their space. They charge 4$ 'heating fee' and 2$ charge for luggage store. 
23096 Easy Access to Airport and Restaurants. The staff was very attentive. Very Friendly. This location is used for all our business Travel. Free WiFi is so convenient 
23097 Dear Sir's please tell the valet gay and the lady with him do not seal the trips agen to the taxi driver !!! I still remember his name ( Mike ) !!! thanks much Smith walker 
23098 The rooms were good but the person at the front desk was not that helpful. The parking was very expensive. Of course very nice location close to time square and food in the NYC area. I stayed there for my friend's bday and was overall a good experience. 
23099 The overall experience at the Stay Hotel was excellent. Nice lobby, good internet access, room with enough space for a couple, not big and spacious but well fit and clean. The hotel crew is nice and warm and for anything you need you'll get proper advise. 
23100 Daniel and Carla at the front desk are like family to us. They are gracious, helpful and wonderful hosts. They are the best in the business. We can't wait to see them again. 
23101 Visited this hotel for just one night whilst returning from a cruise. What a super value hotel right in the middle of all the action. Nice clean room, outstanding customer service. A great base to walk around and explore New York. Will definately use again ! 
23102 this hotel is placed in an exelent loccation. we would like to thank again Joella Cumberbatch- director of guest service in the hotel - she is really something rare. kind, simpathy, and very proffetional. hilton should be proud to employ her. paz family 
23103 Great hotel. Great location. Great staff. Would stay here anytime. 
23104 A one night stay for wary travellers turned out to be very enjoyable and comfortable and the price was unbeatable at $79.00 for a room with two queen beds. Hilton is my choice for short stays in the US! Thanks! 
23105 Highly recommend to stay here the staff terrific clean just overall wonderful. Walking distance to attractions specially the Navy Pier. I wish I could say more The Hilton in chicago you can't go wrong. 
23106 Remote for the TV was terrible but everything else was great. 20th floor overlooking the WTC construction - just high enough to not have any noise. 
23107 The wi fi at Allerton is simply the worst!!!!! ok, the location is great! But how can someone live nowadays without a good wifi signal???? This is as important as a good service, clean bathroom and clean room! 
23108 The hotel is basic but fair priced. While somewhat run down you dont pay for more than you get and you have a great location near the pulse of NYC. This means its never quiet but the service is sufficient and the rooms OK. We wouldnt hesitate coming back. 
23109 Stayed at hotel azure for two days, was not able to check in early morning but my lugagge was stored for us. Room was very clean, flat screen tv,great location, 1 min walk to train station, next to chinatown/little italy,felt safe, good hotel for price. 
23110 Charmantes, typisches New Yorker Stadthotel - wunderbar zentral gelegen, direkt hinter dem neuen Moma, nur ein paar Blocks vom Central Park, von der Radio City Music Hall und von Bloomingdales entfernt. Sehr nette Bar und gute Restaurants in der Umgebung. 
23111 Great hotel. Lovely decor! Friendly and helpful staff. Room was large and very clean. Would highly recommend this hotel. Loved being able to walk to The Plaza, Bergdolfs, Saks, and Rockerfeller Center. HOWEVER, do not order take-out coffee from the Peacock Room. Outrageously expansive!!!! 
23112 Condo/Hotel where the owners' rooms/aprartments are rented when they are not there. Huge rooms for the City, expecially the suites which are fabulous apartments with balconies. Quietest hotel I have ever been in in New York. Faced the rear and never heard a siren all week. 
23113 We were here for new years and loved it! The location is amazing! So great value for money! Yes the rooms are small but space is at a premium in new York! 
23114 Stayed for 2 nights at start of a tour. Conveniently placed for walking into town (about 10-15 mins. Rooms adequate and staff friendly and helpful. Would use it again. 
23115 I booked this hotel on www.ghotw.com and felt the site overrated it, it does have a great view and good food but some of the rooms are a bit tired. 
23116 My boyfriend and me stayed at the Morningside Inn on December 2007. I didn't like it! In our room there was a terrible and a lingering smell of smoke. It was quite small and not so clean. I'll never come back there! 
23117 We stayed two nights while sightseeing and attending two baseball games. All public transportation within 3-4 blocks, good restuarants close by, and good shopping in area. Hotel is older but very ciean and staff is very polite and hepfull. Parking garage is next door. 
23118 This place is awesome!!!!! We stayed for only one night but it was worth every dollar. The room was big enough,,,,we had bath robes :) On friday they had a dj in the lounge and the vibe was really good. The drinks and food were only a bit pricey. 
23119 Room is soso, nice restaurant, but stupid hospitality. White female receptionist don't like Asians. When I was troubled by a swindler on the street infront of Mercer, I asked the female receptionist. But she said with cold voice "I don't know, It's your matter" 
23120 Fourseasons is much better. 
23121 This Hilton offers high quality service and rooms in the middle of busy Manhattan. Its lobby is bright with cordial helpers, the rooms a well-equipped, and the restaurant on the first floor offers a varied, tasteful menu. 
23122 great location, great beds and pillows, clean, the towells were old and a little torn but in general de hotel was just fine. I get a 25% discount on rental car, because I stayed at the hotel, the internet was included. 
23123 Great hotel, fantastic location, friendly staff. In the heart of Manhattan convenient and personable. Unpretentious yet elegant, with excellent staff. The suites are comfortable for a family and a great value. Highly recommend. We will be back. 
23124 We stayed in the 2 bed apartment in the hotel. Top floor with balcony, so, amazing photo ops. Superb positon 5 min walk to 5th Avenue, Bliss spa on the corner of the block. Very clean good facilities. 
23125 Impeccabile come tutti gli hotel Hilton situato nel quartiere finanziario di new york di fronte al grand zero! Pero metro a pochi passi quindi e facile raggiungere il centro di Manhattan! Comere dotate di tutti i confort ma alcune guardano su quel che resta delle torri!! 
23126 Good value for money. Breakfast was good. Sheets seem very old and flimsy - thread count issue or just old and worn? Location is convenient to airport but neighborhood is rough 
23127 Garbage bags in the hall, shower had rusted fixture and filth everywhere, the carpets were dirty, walls were dirty. What a terrible experience. 
23128 all'approdo pensavamo fosse un quartiere marginale, ma l'apparenza inganna, e l'indomani abbiamo trovato l'hotel in una buona posizione, camere confortevoli la suite con un'ottima visuale sull'Empire e Crysler building e wall street. L'accoglienza e soprattutto l'assistenza offertaci sono state eccellenti da parte di tutto il personale. 
23129 As worldwide hotels go, this is a just above mediocre establishment. However, as US hotels go, I would say it is quite a good hotel. Friendly, though not overly efficient staff, reasonable sized bedrooms, nice bar and good food. 
23130 The hotel reception and lobby look very good but the rooms need renovation. Great location in NY. I am giving a "very good" rating relative to other hotels in NY. 
23131 Am I the first Irish person to review this Irish hotel? Fantastic location, just down the street from Bloomingdales and many great restaurants. Very friendly staff. Rooms OK size for NY. Bathrooms small. Would certainly recommend for value and location. 
23132 Stayed at Hilton Times Square and had a wonderful time. Hotel views were superb overlooked the Hudson and convenient for all sights. Would stay here again. 
23133 This Hotel was great... Exactly where we wanted to be, walked out the door and everything was right there or within walking distance. Service was great and it wasn't expensive! We would happily stay there again! 
23134 The Manager and Staff were excellently polite, The entire Family enjoyed the excellent Hospitality and friendly nature. We would repeat the experience any day. We strongly recommend staying at the Staybridge Suites. The evening tea and drinks are the icing on the cake, besides the delicious breakfast. 
23135 This is the worst ever hotel I have stayed at in NYC. Visited the hotel in December. The room was very old and extremely cold. Crowded with youngsters - tourists. The building itself - seen from outside has a Nice architecture, but the innsiden is not Nice. 
23136 Excellent stay at this hotel. It was quiet, off the beaten path, which I loved also. Room was perfect, bed was great to sleep in, loved the bathroom! Great location to everything...within walking distance to shopping, dining, etc.. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay again! 
23137 we were able to walk many places from the hotel. Penn station only a short cab ride away ($10). nice, helpful staff. do not eat here, very overpriced, even for NYC. many great options just a few blocks away. would stay here again. beautiful atmosphere. 
23138 Close to Central Park,(two blocks)Times Square and Theaters. Easy to drive to. Staff very helpful and professional. Bed was very comfortable and room very spacious and clean. Bathroom somewhat dated and need of a renovation. 
23139 Everything was great, except. Towels at request, the reseptionest should've had more convent access to them, no waffle batter, and a cot ( fold up bed) would have been nice for our small child. 
23140 hotel molto bello, pulito, spazioso e centrale 
23141 Well located, very clean, helpful staff. However, I would not recommend to use their shuttle service for airports. Twice faster and twice cheaper options are available at Grand Central station. 
23142 Great size rooms for a NYC hotel, rooms decorated to a hgh standard. Lovely bar area but very expensive. We found the Concierge a little unhelpful but rest of the staff were great! 
23143 We had Lovely time and enjoyed anazing views. The staff were most accommodating and friendly. The hotel overall is besutiful and elegant. Stayed with family and enjoyed dinner at michael jordans, cheese & spirits at eno and had the buffet breakfast. All very enjoyable meals. Cannot wait to come back. 
23144 Very helpful in every way, try to take a room at the back of the hotel not facing the street as not slept very well. Rooms are quite small and clean but staff really make up for it, it is very near all conveniences. 
23145 The hotel has a great location if you need to access the financial district. The rooms are just about ok, hallways clearly dated and restaurant is limited. As long as work continues at Ground Zero next door, it is a bit noisy. 
23146 The location, the room, the staff. all was good, and the awesome deal we found on the internett (finn.no) made it even better. we will stay her next time we go to NYC 
23147 Room was great just what i needed, service was where the value is. from my Desires welcome note to amenities, all people here and what they do for guests are 1st class. Do not forget this gem when visiting The Apple 
23148 I was in january , and is a very nice hotel, clean and comfortable room. employees are gentile and collaborator. room is a little small. great location 
23149 We had a great stay at the Travel Inn. The rooms are simple, but the location is fantastic. Within easy walking distance to everything. Times Square only 5 minutes away. Room was comfortable and surprisingly quiet. Staff were helpful when needed. 
23150 We stayed for 4 nights and really enjoyed the hotel. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Not a bad location. Walkable distance to Times Square. Rooms were nice and clean and beds were super comfortable!!! 
23151 Great location, plenty nearby. The rooms were pleasant, quiet and very comfortable. Staff were quite nice to deal with and there was discounted parking across the street. I would definitely book there again. 
23152 We were totally satisfied with this hotel, perfect location and renovated rooms with nice view! A very nice hotel to stay at ! 
23153 Free breakfast buffet was hearty and delicious. Perfect location for walking to theaters and Times Square. 
23154 Room was extremely tiny. Rude staff. No one helped us with our luggage getting settled in. Has got to be the most horrible service i've had in a long time. 
23155 A one bedroom for an affordable price within walking distance of Central Park South. This hotel is quite a find. Our room was clean, spacious, and there was very little traffic noise. The staff were courteous and helpful. 
23156 We stayed a night at the Soho Grand and had a wonderful experience. The Staff was welcoming and efficient (a glass of champagne offered at check-in was a lovely touch). Location in NY was great. Can't wait for another excuse to stay there again. 
23157 Good location, close to subway and Times Square. Friendly and helpful staffs. Breakfast was good but same thing for 5 days and dining room was too small. 
23158 We must have stayed in a different hotel. It was awful. Noisy, dirty smelly room, carpet and decoration needed a good clean. Staff were abrupt and distracted. Would never stay here again. Location was OK though. 
23159 My recent visit to the Hilton Garden Inn was my third stay. The hotel is in a great location, the rooms are very good and the staff is wonderful! I highly recommend the HGI Times Square and I will return! 
23160 It is a great place if your only going to be at the convention center. It is a bit far from downtown. Not a p.leasant walk 
23161 Stayed there in early/mid April 2004. Nice hotel. Small rooms, SMALL bathrooms. Still some problems with the renovation, e.g., no running water for a couple of hours, toilet clogs easily, most elevators out of work. Frankly, stayed at much better in NYC for cheaper. 
23162 The Affinia is a great place to stay to see all the various sights of NYC. Rooms are very large and well equipped with a small kitchenette area. Staff are brilliant although very busy at most times and you have to queue. Well worth a stay! 
23163 I stayed at this hotel for business, it is a bit of a cab ride from Time square of the Javits center but it was clean, very safe area. I would stay there again. Never tried the restaurants but they looked nice and had great views. 
23164 Spacious suite, clean and comfortable. Friendly staff and perfect location. Exactly what we were looking for during our first trip to New York. Exceeded expectations. Will definitely be checking back in for our 2011 trip. 
23165 Great modern, clean hotel. Close to everything and priced right for a stay in Times Square. 
23166 Terrible. Rooms have peeling paint, exposed wall wires, no desk and no closet. Shower basins had permanent mold stains. Same for all 3 rooms we had. DO NOT stay at this hotel even if their price seems enticing. It will ruin your stay. 
23167 It's a cool space, in Chinatown. The location was great but we had a room that overlooked the train! Sleep was hard, but otherwise a nice hotel. 
23168 best hotel ever, just like a dream... what a room! 
23169 Good atention, small room, but clean. FREE INTERNET, I will come again. 
23170 the bathroom was bigger than the room. the price was totally outrageous. it just seemed like a very unkept hotel. 
23171 I want to thank the kindness and the excellent attention of Jesse,and Joseph ( consierges) Ashley, Nick, Andy Robert, Saul (doorman), and Jose, this invites me to come back Thanks a lot Fabiana 
23172 Really enjoyed my stay at this oasis in the city. It was very central to all the attractions and just off Times Square. Rooms were surprisingly large, clean and well maintained. The afternoon wine and cheese was a welcome relief before heading out again! 
23173 Perfect location a street away from Times aquare. Very clean, close to subways. Staff very friendly and helpfull. Will let you check in early and after check out if flight later, late check out and will hold your bags...Transportation from hotel to Airport provided. 
23174 There is no welcome in front door No one to help u with ur bags In the room no mini bar in the room The hotel is big building but list empty from inside 
23175 Stayed for three nights in February 2012. Central location. Rooms are so tiny and wifi is terriblly poor. Staff was helpful and no complains about them. No noice on the 13th floor room. 
23176 Great rooms, great ambiance whether you're at PHD on the roof, or lounging poolside, service, and the best service/staff you will find anywhere in NYC. I stay here every time I come to New York and it never ceases to impress and exceed expectations. 
23177 Stayed October 20-25 and cannot be more impressed with everything. Great location, super friendly staff, clean rooms. etc. Loved the old staircase and the history of the Hotel. We will be returning again! 
23178 Convenient to great landmarks and transportation. Rockefeller Plaza approximately a mile away. Grand Central less than that. Friendly, professional staff. If you have an early flight out of LGA, the morning cab won't set you back much either. 
23179 Renee & Evelyn the front desk employees were very helpful & understanding to our every needs. They made our stay May15th,2011 a very enjoyable one. I highly recommend this hotel to friends & family. 
23180 Excellent location around the corner from Macy's and a few blocks from time square. Very comfortable beds and great breakfast. would definatley return. 
23181 Their internal controls are awful - they lost my booking and after 2 months charged 300 USD from my credit card without any authorization for fake booking. 
23182 just returned from trip fantastic location hotel was old but very clean, had room on twelveth floor recently renovated. After reading reviews, we were worried but pleasantly surprised. 
23183 We stayed 5 nights in a deluxe queen. Room was very clean and we had enough space. It was great to have fridge and microwave. Could purchase groceries and save some money on morning meal. No complaints at all. Would stay there again. 
23184 posizione centrale perfetta per visitare tutte le zone di NYC. Hotel tipico newyorkese classico, molto bello, curato e molto pulito. Staff gentile e professionale. Stanze nella media grandezza, un po' piccola per 4 persone, ma vivibile. Da consigliare. 
23185 Piccolo ma confortevole, ottima e abbondante la colazione internazionale. Pulito. 
23186 Room was crisp and well appointed. Location is great - just a block to the subway. Customer Service was above and beyond. We needed transportation back to LaGuardia Int'l, the Bellman contacted the Sedan Service for us. Thank you Thank you. We would not hesitate to stay there again :) 
23187 I enjoyed my stay at this hotel very much. Wonderful location! Only a few blocks away from all subway lines. Good restaurants and breakfast places around the hotel. Small room, but very clean. Hotel staff helpful and very professional. 
23188 We had a wonderful stay; the view was great , kids enjoyed looking out the windows in the evening. Carmen cleaned our room exceptionally well every day.the cookies were wonderful.(be sure you receive them!) the location was wonderful and convenient. 
23189 Our stay for the US Open was superb. We were offered an upgrade upon check-in. Concierge was awesome. Location away from our normal Times Square stays was relaxed. Subway is convenient. Clean, sleek rooms were comfortable. We will be back. 
23190 We stayed at this hotel for 6 days in July, it was very handy to all areas, and nice and close to Times Square and easy walking distance to Grand Central station. Staff were very friendly and nothing was to much trouble, I would stay there again 
23191 the hotel is beautiful. great service. helpful and accomodating people. luxurious, clean. 
23192 Centrally located with an excellent support staff, the Park Central is one of the best Hotels In New York City. Extremely cooperative managerial staff coupled with the best in-house services, is what makes this place an ideal 'Home away from Home'. 
23193 We arrived as a group of 7 and they were able to have us on the same floor which was perfect. The location is walking distance from Times Square and various other hot spots. Rooms and bathrooms were always spotless. Concierge Desk always helpful. Would stay here again. 
23194 I'm a business traveller, love this hotel. Can't say a bad thing about it. It's not the Ritz, but for this tier of hotel, it's great! Welcoming, great location if you love downtown. Not a good location for if you want to be in Times Square the whole trip. 
23195 Da vedere e visitare la Lobby e gli spazi comuni (Stark ha dato il meglio). Di sera il bar si trasforma in discoteca, tanta bella gente! Le camere e soprattutto il bagno, sono piccoli e troppo cari. Saranno anche ben arredati, ma la valigia dove si mette??? 
23196 Convenient and well priced hotel in a convenient location. Standard Courtyard with no surprises that meets needs of business traveler 
23197 Great location next to Grand Central Station, you can go to a Hyatt anywhere in the world and know you will get a certain standard. Spacious rooms with nice, modern decor, I would definately return to this hotel, good value for money for New York. 
23198 Loved this hotel! Great room. Helpful and friendly staff. The best burger and breakfast in town. I didn't make it to the pool but I will next time. Close to everything fun to do in NYC so for business you can fit something in! 
23199 Stayed for five days over the Thanksgiving holiday. Was given a free room upgrade as soon as we checked in. :) The staff is remarkably helpful and polite. Everything was clean and tidy, and the location was absolutely perfect for our purposes. 
23200 i stayed one night here with my daughter. the staff was superb and the beds are the most comfortable hotels beds i have ever slept on. i would highly recommend this hotel. i also got a great deal on priceline. 
23201 Im pleased with our stay- our room, a suite, is magnificent - huge and beautifully appointed with antiques. The staff has been responsive and lovely. Have stayed for one night - hoping reminder of our stay continues to be great! 
23202 Great hotel, convenient location Loved indoor lakes and fish Very serene and romantic setting Excellent service, all staff was more than accommodating Close to Memorial Mal and Kathy mills Mal Very nice and specious rooms 
23203 Hotel service was excellent and location in city is perfect. Room and bathroom are clean and ok. "Machine" breakfast ok so far but mostly very crowded in the small available room. 
23204 Location is great. Rooms recently renovated. Comfortable beds. Very useful Kitchen in the room. The only negative was no free WiFi in the rooms , you have to step out the hotel front door to get free Internet 
23205 This older hotel just off of Broadway is a perfect location for everything. Good Morning America is right on the corner and Time Square is just steps away. The hotel is immaculate, and the staff is very friendly. 
23206 They hotel is near the city center (about 15 minutes walking distance). The breakfast could be better but for the price, it s still ok. It was a little bit noizy... 
23207 Poor customer service, tiny rooms, uncomfortable beds, we have stayed with several W hotels but we were disappointed at this property.. nothing special in this property..just like a regular hotel.also i found some authorized charges on my bill... 
23208 Great bargin, semi close to time square and great deal on parking. Plenty of places to eat and drink. The pool was warm and inviting but the hours should be extended. 
23209 A great hotel (we've stayed in 5 others in TS area). Quite (28th Floor/Great TS view). Staff was great at every encounter. Ericka and especially Tito were off the hook! AC worked great. Security was also good. Best NYC hotel experience. 
23210 Stayed here recently for one night and I will definitely be coming back. Staff was very kind and courteous. Trina (i think that was her name) was helpful with just about everything and even helped me set up transportation to the airport. 
23211 What's bad, New York at Thanksgiving. Very crowded, service lacking. 
23212 I was there during "IRENE". The staff was outstanding. They provided board games, cards, flashlights &extra towels. They were very polite and professional, considering all all the stress THEY were under. I would certainly stay there again. Great location to subway, Broadway, Macy's and Pubs.. 
23213 The hotel is beautiful and perfectly located. Clean, silent, fashion in the right dose. Great breakfast. Next time in New York City Grace Hotel will be our destination again. 
23214 Can't say enough about this hotel.....great location, our room had a view of Time Square. Front desk was friendly and so were the housekeeping staff. Rooms are clean and large. Very happy with my stay. Would go back again. 
23215 On the 5th ave, opposite of the empire sate building. Ideal location in midtown Manhattan for Braodway shows, shopping and sightseing! 
23216 We were back at the Parker Meridien for our annual Anniversary trip to New York and had another wonderful experience. Great location, great staff and great rooms (with new televisions)! We'll be back, again and again. 
23217 muy buen hotel, mejor mantenido el hall que todo lo demas pero cumple ampliamente las necesiddes de cualquier pasajero. La habitacion no muy grande pero confortable. La ubicacion es excelente, cerca de los subtes y de Times Square. 
23218 I was in Houston for about a month and the location was really convenient to the highways and cities, and the staff courteous and professional. Would definitely recommend. 
23219 Loved the Hotel and the staff was great with recommendations, Thanks Again see you soon. 
23220 Staff was very helpful regarding TSA confiscated toiletries at 5:30 am. Excellent bar with a very good Dirty Martini. Bathroom somewhat small otherwise a 5 star stay. Very helpful downtown location. The room was well appointed and comfortable. 
23221 You will feel high class staying here! The #1 benefit I had staying here was the unimaginably comfortable beds here. By far the best night sleep and makes u wake up with a smile! 
23222 Hotel was really on its game...as usual. Room was perfect, as was the staff. For me, Gansevoort properties are just superb, and the only place for me to stay in NYC. 
23223 Great hotel food , bar and service! Gets really busy on the weekends. Also has a great restaurant for both breakfast and dinner(omelettes + lobster are a must). Location of the hotel on meatpacking is also very convenient. 
23224 We stayed here April 22-25 and loved everything about the hotel, the staff, and our room. We booked through Hotwire for a rate of $105 per night plus parking is $37 a day - would stay here again. 
23225 If you're looking for a clean hotel with all the basics and not bothered about luxuries this one is for you. Very reasonable prices, excellent location and nice rooms. My wife picked this hotel and I congratulated her for it! 
23226 Very hip hotel - the lobby is bustling and noisy, with techno music. Downside - the lobby is too loud to have a business meeting. The room was clean but small. Great location for mid-town business, but you will need to meet somewhere else. 
23227 Got this hotel as a last minute weekend deal. We got a small room on the 4th floor. It's clean, modern and good value for the area. It's a bit of a walk from the main sites, but nothing too bad. 
23228 Waste your entire NYC stay in line checking into your hotel at Hotel Pennsylvania (and checking out). There are almost no staff at this LARGE NYC hotel in peek season. I stay over 100 nights a year in hotels all over the world. NEVER stay at Hotel Pennsylvania ever. EVER. 
23229 Outstanding in every aspect. Excellent staff, well appointed room, and great location. The Roosevelt is one of NY's finest hotels, it's the only place we stay. 
23230 WOW! This hotel is amazing: location, service, cleanliness, big rooms, ......... I've stayed in this property twice and it has always been a good experinece. 
23231 great hotel, nicely decorated. rooms are a bit small but that is the way it is in NYC. breakfast could be better. overall a great hotel, great stay, great value 
23232 Semplicemente perfetto,Hall molto scenografica,camera spaziosa pulita e di ottimo livello,posizione strategica 2 passi da tutto sopratutto central park,n fronte alla cattedrale di san patricks,prezzi adeguati al lvell,prenotando sul sito si possono strappare ottime offerte,solo il breakfast rimane un po fuori prezzo,fatevi dare un piano alto 
23233 The Waldorf is a beautiful hotel in a great location. However, the rooms are small and are in need of an update. 
23234 Great experience all around ,no problems or inconveniences ,with staff or facility. I would stay in this hotel again if i return to this area. 
23235 This was my fourth visit to New York and by far the best hotel I have stayed in. Very clean, yummy cheap breakfast, quiet, fantatsic location and best of all, very reasonably priced. Will definitely be staying here on my next trip. 
23236 abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo la 1 settimana di aprile, avevamo una camera vista muro al 4 piano, ma probabilmente questo lato ci ha permesso di dormire senza rumore. non abbiamo acceso il riscaldamento anche perche' secondo noi non era assolutamente funzionante. colazione ottima e abbondante. lo consiglierei senz'altro. 
23237 Great location. Clean. Friendly/helpful staff. A bit overpriced for food and drinks though ... there are plenty of cheaper eateries and bars nearby the hotel instead. Rooms were clean and beds comfortable. Lobby is very nice. 
23238 The hotel is perfect ! Great location, great facilities, great rooms! In order to get all that, search for deals to have all this good in a great price! Staff are kindly and make u feel comfortablein the busiest place on earth 
23239 A little introduction about me: I AM SUPER PICKY! So for me to say I love a hotel almost never happens. This place is great, you won't be disappointed! Great location! Awesome swimming pool! 
23240 We stayed on the 17th floor and were amazed at the spaciousness,compared to other NY hotel rooms. The heavenly bed delivered on its promise to comfort. All in all, it was a wonderful experience at a reasonable price. 
23241 This is just a five minutes away from MDA and an easy drive. Clean and the staff was both friendly and helpful. Nice breakfast on site and other resturant options close by. I'll likely be back. 
23242 The Tudor hotel was located about 2 blocks from Grand Central station, which allowed us to take the subway pretty much anywhere. The room was kind of small, but as would be expected anywhere in NYC. Overall, good hotel in a great location. 
23243 We have stayed here before and every time, the room is very clean and the beds comfortable. The area is geared more towards the weekday crowd, versus the weekend, meaning some of the restaurants are slow or closed. However, this hotel is always terrific. 
23244 Five guys and a Dunkin donuts,, in the same block, great for breakfast or late nite snack... Half block from 5 th Ave..21/2 blocks from Broadway What else ould you ask for! One bedroom suite, very large, with a very small bathroom..great price for the location...check the Family Special Rates.. 
23245 My wife and I had a great stay in NYC at Crowne Plaza. Perfect location;easy walking to Broadway shows and restaurants and the subway. Great check-in service with Vicky Martin at the front desk. Especially loved the Keuring coffee maker in the room. The perfect way to start the day. 
23246 OK - say it with me "TINY ROOM". The hotel was fine, clean, and centrally located, but the rooms were painfully small. The service was good and the food was OK, but for $349 per night for the "smallest room I have ever had", this hotel was overpriced. 
23247 Right in Times Square, so great for theatre. Hotel lobby is on the second floor so even the entrance is somewhat unconventional. We had a corner suite with a stunning view south of times square - definitely worth the upgrade. Otherwise, a clean functional hotel. 
23248 Accomodations were exceptional and staff friendly and helpful. Enhanced the joy of our visit to the city. 
23249 Radisson hotel is located in very nice area. Very close to go every places. 
23250 Service was excellent. Very good location right in the center of Manhattan. Huge breakfast and very helpful staff. 
23251 It was not an awful stay, but it felt like the room was dirty. Wtih all the black paint, it was hard to really see how far it went. The staff was nice and the location was good. Overall, I had a nice trip, but I wouldn't stay here again. 
23252 Spent a couple of very comfortable nights on business in this hotel - refreshingly different. Hip yet comfortable: clean, nice decor and a view of the Empire State Building from the rooftop pool. Excellent staff, too. And very convenient. Recommended. 
23253 I could not have been more pleased with not only the area in which this hotel was located, but with the great deal I was able to find via the internet, and how accessible public transportation was all over the city! 
23254 We stayed at Yotel for the first time recently and had a great experience. We have two kids and stayed in the cabin room that has a bunkbed, which our boys loved! The atmosphere is very lively and youthful. The food and service were excellent! 
23255 Hotel dall'arredamento moderno, spaziale.. Camere spaziose con vista panoramica su Times square. Comodissimo come location per tutti gli spostamenti verso i luoghi d'interesse di Manhattan. Centralissimo, pulito con personale cordiale. 
23256 Very nice hotel, but very small room, but it had the most comfy bed and towels 
23257 I stayed at this Hilton for a weekend - it is in a great location near restaurants and shops, and the room was very large and comfortable, as was the bed. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel for anyone visiting Chicago. 
23258 Stylish and affordable. Decor very fresh however rooms very small... But average size for NYC. 
23259 Staff is very personable. Especially bellmen and front desk staff. Rooms are large, clean with comfortable beds. It was really pleasant stay. Hotels is close to both Grant and Milliniuem parks. Expensive for a Wydham property, but all hotels in the area were similarly priced. 
23260 Great hotel ! Good value! Super trendy! Rooms are small but it's New York City there is not a lot of space! Right in times square and metro across the road! Concierge was really helpful and there is a cool bar downstairs!! 
23261 Very trendy upscale hotel with contemporary decor. Looks like a great spot to hang out if you're vacationing without young children. 2 bars. Valet Parking is a bit pricey at $53.00, but you do get in and out privileges. 
23262 Since May 2010, I have continued to stay at LaQuinta for appointments at M D Anderson Cancer Center. The rooms are clean and I feel safe. LaQuinta's shuttle to M D Anderson is a great help. 
23263 Only great things to say...comfortable bed, clean rooms, and a friendly helpful staff. Special thanks to Karen in the sales department for always taking amazing care of me! 
23264 good location,small rooms with bath.fridge,safe.clean,good staff. some noise from outside air con.New York hotels are expensive for what you get. 
23265 a good old fashioned hotel, very close to central park and the theatre district, the only down side is that there is not tea/coffee making facilities. the room was small but clean and a daily cleaning service, soap, shampoo etc is provided, the soap is changed every day. 
23266 In Chicago for business and the spouse came along....The front desk, housekeeping and valet staff were very nice. The location was great and everything was within walking distance. Good restuarants,,,nightlife. 
23267 If you want gracious comfort, simple elegance and style, all amenities, a very professional accommodating staff and location, location, location stay at the Kitano Hoel on Park Avenue. Blissful! 
23268 I stayed at the Americana Inn during a conference. The Inn is ideally located and a great bargain. The Inn was clean. As typical for most NY Hotels, the rooms were a bit small. Nevertheless, I recommend the Americana Inn for budget travelers. 
23269 Love, love, love this hotel. The restaurants, the rooms, the vintage feel of it. However, the last 2 times I've gone there the Sauna and Steam room have been broken. I wish they'd keep the maintenance of it up, definitely one of my favorite things to do at this hotel. 
23270 Great location, The staff is ok but not too kind, the bedroom smells and bathroom has no air change. Sometimes we waited too long for elevators. It's Ok but not good, i won't come back because it's too expensive for the offered services. 
23271 been to this hotel many times while traveling for business and for fun and it manages to do the rare task of being accomodoting for fun or business! the room service was also really good, and the bar scene downstairs in and near the lobby is great. 
23272 Wifi never work! The air conditioning was very noisy. The place is near to the restaurant zone. Very big mc Donald in front of the Hotel. Definitely I aprove this place to see without problems Chicago. 
23273 Great location, within easy walking distance of Times Square etc. Nice size rooms, all well presented. 
23274 This hotel was great. The staff friendly and helpful. The room was small, but comfortable. Bathroom was roomy. Great location in NYC, close to everything. Fantastic Italian restaurant directly across the street. I will make this hotel my first choice on any future visit to NYC. 
23275 If you need to be in this part of Houston, this is a good choice. It's clean and quiet (make sure you request a room not facing the highway). It didnt look all that full, so try and get a good rate. 
23276 Zentral gelegenes Hotel inmitten der Lakefront Chicagos. Alle Sehenswuerdigkeiten sind zu Fuss zu erreichen. Weiterhin ist der Anschluss an das hiesige Metro Netz lediglich zwei Blocks entfernt. Gerne wieder! 
23277 I have stayed in many hotels in New York city over the years but never in this area. My wife and I were pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the locale vs. midtown. 
23278 Great location to shopping complexes. They provide lots of extras such as exercise room, sauna and pool. Another wonderful extra is the ByRequest amenities--well worth signing up for free. As in all Wyndhams, the beds are heavenly. 
23279 Staff was very friendly and helpful. The last 100 meters to the hotel could be a little bit unpleasant if really late. Liked the fact that you could borrow DVD's. Didn't hear the neighbours but the refridgerator was a bit noisy. Could definitely think of staying here again. 
23280 Very modern, clean and ideally located for all the sights, our friends who live on Long Island could not belive how little we paid to stay here. 
23281 It was still under construction but the employees made us feel very comfortable and gave us great ideas on touristic places. The rooms where so hip and clean and nice 
23282 First time staying here. Pros: Excellent service Great location Cons: Outdated bathrooms and no double sinks Furniture could use some sprucing up as well No bottled water and slippers laid out at turn down service 
23283 In the heart of Chicago. Good beds and very clean. All you could want. 
23284 We were very pleased. We had a large room with an additional smaller room. It is in an excellent location - just 1/2 block from Central Park. 
23285 I have stayed here a few times and would stay again. Good location, simple hotel, but nice new rooms, quiet and the beds are great. 
23286 Large beds, great (but expensive) breakfast, superb service! Location is very nice, in a quieter street, right next to Empire state building and Macy's. Only negative thing to say about the room is the Airconditioning that is (or at least was in our room) quite noisy.. 
23287 Clean tidy room. Funky room decoration. Very comfy bed. Great lighted bathroom mirror. Room was cleaned daily with new towels. Great views from window. The location is absolutly fantastic and can't be beaten.. Highly recommend I LOVED New York 
23288 This hotel was just a few blocks from Central Park. It felt like a safe place to stay, and you could easily get to anywhere else in the city from there. Not one of the more expensive hotels, but still very clean, very good service. I would stay there again. 
23289 l'hotel e' molto comodo per la posizione e a pochi minuti dalle principali attrazioni di Manhatta. La stanza era comoda, riscaldata bene e pulita. certo non spaziosissima, ma sufficente per starci comodi. Consiglio l'hotel per l'ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo. 
23290 My Wife and I were looking for an inexpensive hotel in the center of Manhattan and La Semana was perfect for us. It offers everything you need...a smallish yet clean and quiet room and a very friendly helpful staff. We would recommend La Semana. 
23291 Best stay ever in NY, classy, big rooms, clean and well appointed. Very upscale old style. Will go back there ! 
23292 hotel aan 102e straat/Broadway in New York. Prima dichbij de metro. Wel 20 minuten om richting 42nd street en downtown te komen. Vanaf en richting vliegveld kost je wel rond de 70 US$. Terug naar het vliegveld prive-taxi laten regelen door het hotel was een wat aparte ervaring. 
23293 On the Avenue Hotel has become my "home away from home" while visiting NYC. The location is perfect, for restaurants, parks, shopping, entertainment. The service is exceptional and the rooms are comfy and quiet. A perfect Oasiss in the midst if this great city. I LOVE this place!! 
23294 I stayed there 3 nights. We got a nice room with a nice view. Very comfortable bed. The staff at the hotel were very helpful and friendly as well. Very good location, close to subway station. I would highly recommend it. 
23295 Stayed during the hurricane. The hotel had two great resturants kept us well informed. It was a great place to stay with great customer service which is very important to me ... Excellent place to stay great location. With a great coffee shop below. 
23296 Had a great stay at the comfort inn - excellent location - 5th avenue on end and macy's the other. Very spacious rooms, helpful staff, standard breakfast but perfect for our short stay. wewere on 11th floor, but lifts were excellent. free coffee in the lobby too, yum!! 
23297 Stayed here in d beginning of December 2011. D lobby is very attractive. Rooms are nice,nothing spectacular but definitely no problems with them. Without doubt the location is d main attraction. Times square can be seen from d entrance. Overall an enjoyable stay and would definitely stay here again. 
23298 Siamo stati piu volte a New York.Pensiamo che l hotel badi piu all immagine che al confort dei clienti, la posizione e ottima ma la stanza che ci e stata assegnata per due persone era come dimensioni e spazi sufficiente per una persona sola. Non lo consigliamo. 
23299 Room was small and the restroom smelled of mildew. The hotel was in a decent area and a few blocks from time square, about a fifteen minute walk at a moderate pace. There was a great deli near the hotel that had the most amazing black and white cookies. 
23300 We had a great time. Would go to this hotel again in a minute. Parking was right next door with a great discount as guests of the hotel. 
23301 Very nice and modern Yotel, with very friendly people. We where there for 5 nights and we had a great time sleeping there, sitting on their terrace and they had a good snack menu's. Only 10 min walk form broadway. We liked the Yotel very much. 
23302 The rooms are getting a bit worn, probably due to the multitude of travelers. I love this hotel, although the check-in around midnight took over a half hour! 
23303 Very nice value and hotel for NYC. Had a newly renovated room on 7th. Good stafff, good area, highly recommend for the money. 
23304 Just a typical new York hotel, large rooms, comfy beds, bathroom very dated. However it was clean and slap bang in the middle of attractions, not far from times square or central park. 
23305 This was a gooc choice for budget travellers to New York. Located off Times Square it is very central. Staff were not overly helpful, but for the price, it was to be expected. Rooms were comfortable and clean. You wont find much cheaper in New York. 
23306 A good basic hotel, in great position. The room was fine for a couple of nights with four of us, but would have been a little cramped if we were staying longer. 
23307 This place can always be counted on for a cheap rate. Right near everything, but still on a quiet side street. Short walk to subway. Rooms a bit small, but who the hell sits in their room while in NYC?? Highly recommended. 
23308 overall a very good experience. The rooms are small, but clean and efficient. The staff is most friendly and helpful. Usually stay in Midtown East but love the West Village location. Would definately stay there again. 
23309 Robert was extremely helpful, especially when suggesting restaurants. His dinner recommendations were excellent and catered to our specific requests. Thanks for making our first Chicago experience memorable. We highly recommend you speak with Robert. 
23310 Me encantarion las habitaciones y las vistas espectaculares desde el bar. Lo recomiendo mucho!!! 
23311 Stayed and did park sleep and fly. Great kid friendly hotel thats very clean and very helpful staff. Only 5 minutes shuttle ride to airport. Runs every 20 minutes and nice busses. Highky recomend this hotel. 
23312 The indigo hotel is the worst I have ever been to.I ordered wine glasses some one took them to my room dirty with lipstick n dusty the worst ever..will never go back. U get what u pay for right! 
23313 From the fully stocked fridge to the modern sldecor, no expense is spared. The service is excellent. The room service is high class. The spa is near the top in New York. Great location for business or pleasure. After two stays you get your own concierge. 
23314 Looking for a cute and well appointed boutique hotel in New York? Cannot go wrong with TriBeCa Blu. Best part is the staff! Friendly, helpful and accommodating. House Keeping is great too! Special thanks to Mae! 
23315 Close to airport that is convenient to pick her up when her flight delayed. Overall pretty good experience, clean room, friendly staff and would like to stay again. Outdoor swimming pool so we cannot swim as it was cold outside. 
23316 My mother and I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights in August. From the great coffee in the lobby to the incredibly comfortable beds, our visit could not have been more welcoming. We will definitely stay here again! 
23317 Sheets wasnt clean. Roach dead on the floor. People that worked in the front were rude. It was just bad never again........ 
23318 Fantastica posizione, praticamente a 100 metri da Time Square, la Hall bella e moderna, la camera standard troppo piccola, il letto piccolo e il bagno ogni 3giorni andava fatto sturare. Il wifi praticamente inesistente. Consiglio l'hotel solo per la posizione, a New York il tempo trascorso in camera e' minimo. 
23319 beslist een aanrader - overal heel kort bij (loopafstand), eventl. metro hele vriendelijke mensen , kamer wisselen geen probleem verwacht geen luxe , maar alles is wel netjes , elke dag schoonmaak en schone handdoeken. gaan hier zeker nog terug 
23320 Our dream holiday, with a dream hotel to match. Can't wait to stay again, good value, central location to loads of attractions & opp Penn subway stn, so easy to get around. Macy's just up the road & opp Madison square gardens. 
23321 One of the best hotels my wife and i have stayed in the city.We were going to a concert and could not have found a better location, clean room, toilet and shower were pristine, and free breakfast.I would recommend this hotel anytime. 
23322 Just behind Hancock tower in a quiet neighborhood and very close to magnificent mile. We have stayed here several times while visiting Chicago. A very good value with helpful staff. 
23323 Negesti & Donna at the front desk was most helpful with suggestions to see attractions.Friendly staff. Big rooms for New York City includes kitchenette. Excellent location. 
23324 Dirty rooms, dirty tub and toilet. Pee stains on floor, pubic hairs on floor, food particles all over room, blood on comforter and sheets. Disgusting. Unfriendly staff. No breakfast left at 7:45 when breakfast lasts till 9 am. Overpriced!!! 
23325 An average hotel in mid-town Manhattan, small rooms, yet efficient and new furniture. Breakfast buffet plentiful, not fancy, warm family feeling. Internet connection unreliable, maybe was due to Verizon, but not much help can be expected from the hotel. 2 courtesy computers available but they are extremely slow. 
23326 Good midtown location, rude and unfriendly staff, tiny rooms, even smaller bathrooms, no business center, unadequate value for money. 
23327 While the renovated Junior Suite was impeccable, with great furniture taste and comfort, I was moderately happy with the service. They had not prepared the sofa bed, and I had to call 3 times for the room service to come and make it. 
23328 We've been staying at this hotel for years & always enjoy seeing the friendly & professional staff - makes our visits extra special! 
23329 Rooms are nice and spacious. Staff is very attentive - i was impressed. Overall no problems with my experience. Location is very crowded though, so it can be overwhelming. 
23330 My first time in NYC, this hotel was in a great location, walked for 3 days, adjacent to Grand Central Station, off Madison Ave., Rooms were adequate, not too small like most NYC hotels. The lobby was beautiful. Didn't think the staff was too friendly but who cares...... 
23331 This was my first time in Chicago and I had a great working and personal experience. The hotel staff was very helpful and friendly. The location was perfect, with a lot of turist atractions, shopping and restaurants nearby, walking distance. 
23332 its seems they are getting old as a building but still good and perfect service i love the view ow south manhattan that i can see new world trade center 
23333 We checked in with no issues, our stay was great, the room was quiet and the service was awesome. No complaints. We would stay there again in a minute. 
23334 Room was fine but I noticed 2 bed bugs. They tried showing me another room and when I checked the mattress for bugs a crack pipe literally fell out from under the mattress. I couldn't make this up if I tried. Leaving now!!! 
23335 We stayed at the Westin for our recent NY trip and loved the location! The room were nice and clean. The beds were great. Bathrooms were nice but with little counter space. The rooom service was great and fast. I would stay again. 
23336 Booked the executive suite and was certainly worth it. Had plenty of room for my 2 year old to run around. Beautfiul views of downtown Chicago. Would certainly stay there again. 
23337 Great weekend highlighted by the staff in W New York. Kudos to everybody, but especially to Carmen at the front desk. Good location and atmosphere with daily amenities and details that make your stay memorable. Definitely a first choice for future Manhattan visits. 
23338 In walking distance of Houlihans and the movies. We had a lakeside view on the 33rd floor. Spectacular! 
23339 This hotel was a most pleasant surprise. Clean, comfortable, well laid out rooms. Hotel staff friendlyand curteous and the rate is very affordable. I loved being in that part of town because it gave me the oppurtunity to explore the area by foot. 
23340 Very nice 1930s Deco hotel. Rooms quite basic but comfortable. You're unlikely to get a view. Breakfast in the cafe is excellent and inexpensive. 
23341 We just stood at the hotel and everything was great. Thank you Lisa for making such a smooth check in. The rooms were gorgeous. Up to date with all Hi-tech. The entire hotel is spotless. We will be back 
23342 I stayed there for three nights and enjoyed very much. The room is spacious , clean, with many amenities. I've been with my daughter and grand son and was great! I higly recomend. 
23343 I booked a double room, so I knew it would be small. However it had everything you would need. The hotel was in a good location downtown if you want to walk places. 
23344 Great location in the Loop, steps away from Blue Line to O'Hare and just about anything else. Service was excellent and the room was well laid out for doing work (plugs and wifi) 
23345 This hotel is okay. clean with no frills. Okay for an over night stay. nothing fancy at all. just near MDW. Staff was good. 
23346 They have everything you could possibly need to make your stay comfortable. The staff is very friendly and the hotel is clean. Everyone is beyond helpful. The beds are very comfortable!!! 
23347 'Although i did'nt have enough time to stay in Houston for long , staying at the Laquinta made my visit worth traveling for. I have never felt so revived and rested in my whole life. Thanks for making my short stay one incredible unforgetable moment.' - Braxton, Tx 
23348 we had a superb time at the Raffaello Hoteo,the concierge ( both Darren and Jared) pushed every button possible for us and were a pleasure to talk to....we made new friends in them. I can't say enopugh about the accomodations, the staff and of course the Concirege---all suoperior 
23349 Posizione abbastanza favorevole, non molto lontano dal Magnificent Mile (fattibile a piedi partendo dall'hotel) 
23350 Le camere sono essenziali ma non manca nulla. Pulizia ok. Personale cortese e disponibile. Internet gratis. Prezzi assolutamente concorrenziali. Tutto questo lo rende una buona soluzione per soggiornare a Chicago. 
23351 The hotel is perfect location in Midtown Manhattan next door to Empire State Building, Macy's, Times Square, Broadway theaters. Staff is excellent stay is hassle-free. 
23352 Great hotel!!! Very friendly staff, super bussines center with pc's, fax, copy machine, even wi-fi. Rooms super clean...the best bed in a hotel ever!!! Very clean room with great view, no traffic noise at all, microwave, fridge, coffe machine, plasma tv... A+++++ 
23353 Very nice hotel, great position and amazing decor. We had a lovely time at the Muse and thoroughly enjoyed their facilities and breakfast pastries! 
23354 Hotek is situated near Park avenue or Empire state building and subway station 33st street so it has great location for exploring Manhattan. The rooms are little bit smaller, but for few days there are just fine. Air conditioning is quite noisy. Bathrooms are shared, but they are always clean. 
23355 Couldn't have been happier with ritz battery park. Excellent experience overall, from valet to check in, breakfast, concierge. Would stay again without a doubt. Luxury at a great value, nice downtown location, close to subway station. Amazingly quiet, too! 
23356 spent a 3 night stay at hotel and had a very cosy stay. the hotel is spotless and the staff very friendly especially the doorman, Lenny was his name. he made our exits and entry soo pleasurable and was great help with direcctions and hailing us cabs.. 
23357 Just i the middle of Manhattan, from here you can walk to everyting. God and helpfull service at the hotel. 
23358 Went to NYC on work for 4 days.Good location.Helpful staff.Food options need to be worked on. 
23359 the best and most wonderful place to stay to celebrate something special,ie. (anniversary).....food was great...servvice spectacular 
23360 Stayed here in July and the room was wonderful with great views, bar in the evening very relaxing, sub way just beside us and as a Hilton Gold member complimetary breakfast keep it up Hilton 
23361 Decent hotel in a great location. The rooms need updating but are spacious and clean. The staff are helpful. The 4 dollar breakfast is good value. 
23362 The room was clean and modern, the hotel was historic and cool. The location was perfect.- just south of the loop- walking distance to everything. Extra points for letting us check in at 8:00am after a red eye. We were VERY happy with the hotel. 
23363 Worst experience ever! New York trip was ruined due to unfriendly staff, horrible attitude towards the guests. I have had a decent experience with the Ramada Inn's in other locations but this was the worst hotel experience ever. 
23364 Great location and I was wondering if I would hear the noise from the street...to my surprise it was quiet. Stayed on the 42nd floor. Staff that I did encounter was friendly and helpful. 
23365 The room was spotless and the shower was updated with huge glass doors,large tile done recently.T V wouldnd work right but they came and fixed it immediately.Very good service, professional desk staff who were most helpful. 
23366 Very friendly stuff, perfect location right beside the Times Square! Trendy rooms! 
23367 Every single person at this Marriott bent over backwards on the phone and in person with this hotel! I have never had the service that I have had at this hotel....unbelievable! When downtown Chicago, I will stay here again for sure! Impeccable and genuine service! 
23368 We stayed for three days and had the greatest time. The staff were exceptional ... So friendly and very helpful.a special thanks to Victoria and CJ for all your help .you made our stay! this hotel has the best location and we totally enjoyed the second floor lounge. 
23369 Rooms were ok, TV remote was flaky, but the big issue was the "free internet". Good thing it was free because it was so slow I wound up using my cell phone as a hotsport to complete some reports for work. Literally unsuable unless it's 3-4am 
23370 Cris was the best front desk person I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Always greeted the guest by name. She knew the answer to ever question I had about the area. Premium customer service by the entire staff. 
23371 Great view of the NY skyline from the indoor heated swimming pool on the top floor. 
23372 this hotel was nicer than the plaza i loved the view of the empire state building i stayed in the penthouse very excellent 
23373 The room was recently renovated and very clean but very small. We are used to small NYC hotel rooms but this room was smaller than "usual". No valet parking either. I will say the bell hop was fantastic and very helpful. Great location too. 
23374 an expensive hotel for the pokey little room, droning all night with the hotels air conditioning, could not open blinds no doubt because of what was behind(the view). only plus side was location. also no parking facilities you have to use another hotel 30$ a day. 
23375 Abbiamo trovato un buon hotel, con un servizio nella media. Le stanze erano pulite, non troppo grandi ma comunque discrete. Ottima la vista dello skyline. Abbiamo trovato un personale disponibile alle nostre richieste. Si trova a tre isolati dalla metropolitana (grand central station), dove passano tutte le principali linee. Consigliato. 
23376 Good, clean, no frills accommodation in a cool area. It's inexpensive and there are good places for breakfast nearby. Great base to see NY and there are a huge amount of great bars, shops and restaurants in the neighbourhood. 
23377 I went with my Mum and we found the staff very friendly and helpful. The room was very stylish but compact. Very little room for storage but great loaction. 
23378 A group of ~25 of us came to NYC for the weekend and stayed at Hotel Newton. The hotel was lovely. The staff were efficient, gracious, helpful and accommodating. The rooms are comfortable and clean. Great value for the price and great location too. 
23379 Stayed at the W hotel for one night on SPG points. Upgraded room was large, had nice amenities, and was well located. Although i only stayed for one night, I found the staff to be very accomodating. 
23380 Stayed with my family in four rooms,three of which were hot and one was cold,although the outside temperature was in the mid 50's. Otherwise the hotel is outstanding,specially friendly staff and very good food. 
23381 The Casablanca was in a great location...very close to Central Park, the theaters and great restaurants, yet secluded enough from the crowds of tourists and traffic. The staff was very helpful and friendly. The room was very clean. 
23382 The service was unbelievable. Its all the little things they did that added up to AMAZING! I felt like evryone new my name and made a point of getting to know me. I felt special and taken care of. Way to go W chicago, you exceded my expectations :) 
23383 Kind and helpfull personnal. Metro near hotel. Room excellent. Delicious breakfast. 
23384 Wonderful stay. Great views. Very comfortable, quiet room. Very modern. 
23385 Beautiful room, elegant hotel, friendly and helpful staff - couldn't ask for more. Booked the room for almost half the listed price by booking online. Extremely happy with my stay there, and can recommend the hotel with enthusiasm. 
23386 Stayed here for a weekend trip to NY, hotel is in a great location, staff were helpful and polite. I would stay here again. 
23387 I have stayed at Intercontinental properies and have had mixed results. Most were just OK, and some were downright bad. This one was quite good. Maybe they have improved the brand? Room was OK. Location was great. Staff were helpful. 
23388 Hello A friend of mine recommended me this hotel since he knew that I was travelling to New York I had a great rate around $169, it was a special weekend rate The staff was pleasant, the location simply fantastik !!!! I took the buffet breakfast which was quite nice 
23389 We had a good price for the location. It was very comfortable. Nearby, we enjoyed Patzeria. Also, we had a snack at Pigalle in the hotel. 
23390 Appalled by the prices and service at both the St Regis and the Ritz Carlton, the London Hotel offers superior service and a fair price for a stunning contemporary room with a fabulous view above the city. A Great Experience. 
23391 Very nice hotel in the midle of everything. Clean, confortable beds, excelent bistro just outside the hotel. 
23392 excellent hotel ,great service, super clean.front desk reps were kind and helpful. i will surely return. lovely place and so many stores and restaurants near by. 
23393 I have stayed in many hotels across the globe but this was far the worst hotel in the world. Save your money and don't stay there. They don't clean there shared bathrooms and no iron & ironing board in rooms as advertised. 
23394 We visited to celebrate my wife's and our daughter's birthdays. Room was spacious and comfortable. Lots of,closet space and a nice balcony. Room service was good. Had a few maintenance issues and the doormen aren't overly friendly. Great location. 
23395 Staff were really helpful. Good Location with a great cafe around the corner for breakfast. Shared bathrooms were always available and clean. Would stay here again. 
23396 Perfect location to everything...especially Astros, a great breakfast place! Rooms are a good size for a NY hotel and very clean. 
23397 Stayed in this hotel for three nights with my wife. Room was small but I have been in smaller ones. Bathroom was especially small. It seemed clean. Window air conditional units. Nothing really modern here, Location is good. Very plain, very small, no wi fi in rooms. Terrible exercise area. 
23398 My husband and I spent a weekend at the Alex in January and could not get over the bad attitude of the employees. I would avoid the Alex for that reason. 
23399 Great location, this is a nice hotel to stay for anyone used to the business environment,the lobby is normally busy with a mixture of tourist & business functions... but overall great i enjoyed every moment of my stay especially. 
23400 This hotel was so accomodating! Everyone of the staff members were helpful and made sure I was taken care of. I really liked the new renovation, it gave the hotel a whole new look. When in the area again I will definately stay here! 
23401 Reasonable price for smallish room near subway, central park and theater district. We'll watch for deals and stay again, likely. 
23402 We had a room with a city view and could see the Empire State from the window. The room was clean, comfortable, and quite spacious. The staff provided a friendly welcome. It is hard to do better for this money in Manhattan 
23403 We booked using SPG points for a two night getaway. The front desk upgraded us without us asking. Everyone was nice. Very convenient to midtown and shopping. Nice Italian restaurant next door called San Martino. Room size was fine. When in NY who stays in their room !! 
23404 Rooms were very clean Had everything you could possible want Best value for the money, right around the corner from the Empire State Building 
23405 Buurt zelf, maar ook nabijheid van Union Square metrostation zijn grote plussen. Keurige kamer, incl badkamers op de gang. Wel vrij klein, maar ja 'this is New York'. Alleen is alles erg donker, met daaraan bijdragend behang; en onze kamer had nauwelijks daglicht. 
23406 Freundliches Personal, guter Zimmerservice. Zentrale Lage in Uptown Manhattan - Central Park, 5th Avenue und Carnegie Hall in unter 5 Minuten zu erreichen. Hinweis: Hotel wird gern von Franzosen genutzt. 
23407 everything was perfect. Check in was a breeze, the location was great, there were subways in 3 different directions,the staff was amazing even the elevator is lightning quick.we highly recommend this property. 
23408 Great East Side locale, close to shopping, boutiques on our friends residential neighborhoods. Blocks from Radio City. Room Service was to die for on time, hot and a great way to start the day on a Romantic Weekend. Staff were helpful and always had a smile! 
23409 Location is excellent, as is housekeeping staff. Would definitely consider hotel for future NYC visit. 
23410 hotel posizionato nel cuore della citta' a due passi da times square il personale dell'albergo sono stati molto professionali e carini, sempre disponibili ad accontentarci.....struttura dell'albergo abbastanza confortevole e di buon gusto. 
23411 As a business traveler, I found the Warwick to be located well; close to several subway stops; and near many restaurants. Moreover, it was away from the masses of Times Square, but certainly close enough for me to take a walk there. 
23412 Great location in new-york. We travel with 2 teenagers and it was perfect. The bed is very comfortable and the vue of the room ( in the corner) was extra. The breakfast on the terrace is very great too. A very good place. 
23413 Stepanie Gomez checked us in.She was very professional.She demonstrated a great deal of patience,knowledge,and efficiency.During our five day stay,She tried to see that all our needs were met by the hotel.I feel that she is a great asset to your organization.q 
23414 I stayed at the hotel in early June and my family was attacked by Bed Bugs. HORRIBLE. The hotel location is wonderful, but the rooms are dated and worn. 
23415 This old hotel is a very well maintained property. The rooms are large, and many have two bathrooms, probably due combining old smaller rooms. Surprisingly handy. The staff was very friendly and cordial. The only complaint: VERY high internet charges, up to $20.00 for "premium." 
23416 My friend and I stayed at the Crowne Plaza last week and we were overall very pleased with the hotel. Excellent location, superb room (very spacious!) and very friendly staff (reception, room service, concierge,...) It is certainly a hotel we would recommend. Already looking forward to staying here again! 
23417 Enjoyed my stay at your hotel Went on the open bus tour and saw how fantastic new york was. Employee Louise at the friend desk was so helpful and friendly. Appreciated how welcome she made me feel Thanks for your service will stay again 
23418 Perfectly situated in the heart of Manhattan. Very nice and helpful staff. Nice, clean, but small rooms. A perfect breakfast included in price. Little expensive, but worth it. 
23419 Wonderful room with very comfortable bed. Clean and calm. Good aircondition, low noise. Nice view on from hotel window. Hudge fitness center with free access, good workout possibilities. No free internet connection, 16 USD per day is very expensive. Located perfectly for enjoying nightlife around time square. 
23420 Personal trainer Sam great people skills and training skills; concierge Dianne and Lisa very helpful, housekeeping lady very nice - complemented us on our room 
23421 very clean and the apartment was big enough for 3 of us, the sofa bed was a little uncomfortable and the fridge noisy but, the rest of the amenities made up for it 
23422 Would definitely stay here again, it was a really wonderful place to stay 
23423 Very nice boutique hotel. Small rooms but the see through window in shower is fun. Walking distance to shopping, restaurants, subway and Central Park 
23424 My friend and I enjoyed our stay here. We have all good things to say about it except the bathroom was small and I would have liked a microwave for popcorn. Other than that, great price, great location and comfy beds. 
23425 A great hotel with a great location. They upgraded us to a suite no extra charge. Staff could not have been more helpful. You are close to everything for an affordable price.Ignore any bad reviews. Will go there again. 
23426 Stayed here for five days and I cannot find any fault. The location is great, the staff are very helpful (especially the 2 concierge )and the rooms and food ate just great. Would recommend without hesitation. 
23427 Stayed here in April 2003. The hotel is a very high standard - the staff are all very friendly and efficient. Perfect location for 5th Avenue etc. I will definitely return to this hotel next time. (The Jennifer Lopez movie Maid in Manhattan was partially filmed here). 
23428 Stayed here for 6 nights and had a wonderful stay. The staff were very friendly and helpful. the rooms clean, the bed comfortable and located close to pretty much everything for the tourist. I see you can even buy the mattresses on their store, wonder if they ship to Australia! 
23429 Everything about the stay was superb. The hotel spends it's money on the important things. 
23430 hotel bem loclizado limpo sem muitos ruidos, porem na minha reserva, pela intremet clubA, o cafe da manha esta incluso e me foi cobrado foi um bom cafe da mahna e com um bom atentimento sem mais parabens peloa atendimento 
23431 this Hilton Hotel on Avenue of Americas in NYC, was a great location. It was close to Central Park, the theatre district, great restaurants, Rockefeller Center, and Time Square. The hotel was very nice and clean and the service was excellent. 
23432 I loved this hotel just as much as the MArriott Marquis. The room, lobby, and elevators were so nice. This place was much nicer than I had expected and I will probably stay there again. 
23433 What's not to like? Great location. Great Service. Large, updated, clean rooms. Comfortable beds. Great linens and towels. Quiet, quiet, quiet.........no noise from other rooms whatsoever!! Staff is outstanding! We have stayed in many Starwood and other boutique hotels in NYC. I think this is our new favorite! 
23434 We had the pleasure of hosting a conference at the DoubleTree Intercontinental Airport Hotel, and it was fabulous! The staff are committed to making sure that every detail is attended to, and that guests are completely satisfied. I highly recommend this property! 
23435 Thank you!!! What a great stay in a majestic hotel. The room was very neat and comfortable. The service in all areas of the hotel was very professional. I will be back!!! The location is excellent. 
23436 this is a terrific hotel, Downtown NYC is a fine place to stay with excellent restaurants, the High Line and the SOHO Chelsea areas close by. Clean good service and great staff 
23437 The best hotel I've ever seen. My room facilities is good. All staff are friendly. I'll come again. 
23438 Very nice, helpful staff, very comfortable bed, nice midtown location, overall a very nice place to stay for leisure! 
23439 We stayed here on our wedding night and it was perfect. The rate was low in relation to the breathtaking room we had!! It was absolutley gorgeous and perfect!! We can not wait to come back next your for our anniverary! 
23440 Old rooms with paint chips. Old plumbing. Sheets and blankets were not washed. We called to change out the sheets and took them over 30 mins. Valet took almost an hour to get our car. Staff was rude. 
23441 I tell everyone about Off SoHo Suites!!! I have stayed there a number of times and its the only place I will stay in NYC. The rooms are big, beds are great. Easy to get anywhere in NYC from the Hotel. Very Charming 
23442 Extremamente limpo, pessoal competente e educado. Produtos de toucador muito bons. 
23443 Very friendly staff at reception. Great location just beside penn station. Stayed in a room with two double beds, nice big room plenty of space with a big clean bathroom. Great view of the Empire State building. Would definitely stay again. 
23444 This is one shady place! Very creepy, dirty and disgusting. I think it's run by mobsters. It's got rodents and cockroaches too. I'll tell you right now...RUN!!! 
23445 Horrible, horrible, horrible. Dark corridors. Dirty carpets, and dirty walls. Noisy very noisy. Can't wait to check out after a night's stay 
23446 I really liked the Marcel, it is not like the big hotels, the staff new me and I felt very comfortable. I also enjoyed their restaurant a lot, try the sushi - it is superb. 
23447 Las habitaciones no son muy grandes (al menos la que nos tocaron a nosotros) pero son confortables. Excelente la ubicacion, cerca de teatros y vida nocturna. Estas en el centro de la isla, con conexion rapida hacia el norte y hacia el sur. El precio es razonable. 
23448 I stay here all the time when I'm on business because of proximity to the N/R/Q, 1/2/3, 4/5/6 subways--all within a 5 minute walk. Plus, it's close to all of the Flatiron restaurants and across the street from Eataly! 
23449 Took my mom to NYC for 72nd birthday. Hotel was great and staff very professional and pleasant. Convenient to subway, 5th ave, central park, rocker feller center. We walked to many places and when it was too far, subway was few blocks away. Bed was VERY comfortable! 
23450 Das Hotel Trump International and Tower liegt direkt am Central Park und eine U-Bahnstation ist nur knapp 100 m vom Ausgang entfernt. Es bietet klasse Service und gut ausgestattete Zimmer. Im Keller gibt es einen schmalen langen Pool zum Bahnenschwimmen und einen voll ausgestatteten Fitnessraum. 
23451 From checkin through our entire stay, the staff was wonderful! Checkin was a breeze--about 5 minutes. Everyone on staff spoke and made us feel welcome. Beautiful, clean property. It is located next door to the 9/11 memorial. Walking distance to SOL, Seaport, Brooklyn bridge. 
23452 stayed at the smyth for a quick week end and was extremely pleased with the venue. The room was great ant the staff was extremely helpful. The bar and lounge is a nice place to have a drink before going to dinner and unwind from a hectic travel day. 
23453 Wonderful 3 day stay in NYC for my wife's birthday. Thanks to entire staff, the quite room and very good room service. Special thanks to Alan for arranging theatre tics and dining suggestions; every experience was top shelf. Will be back! 
23454 I stayed in Novotel for three nights and was thoroughly happy with the experience. The hotel is clean, quite and in a fantastic location - just off Times Square. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is visiting New York. 
23455 If you are looking for a clean and cheap room, this is it. Thin sheets, no shampoo, but cold air. Was afraid to use swimming pool. Security cameras in parking lot were shot out. 
23456 This place was tastefully decorated, warm and welcoming. The room was comfortable and had all that one might need on a business or pleasure stay. Coffee was gourmet and great. Overall it was really well done. 
23457 What a nice array of touches. Too bad I encountered obviously illegal alien employees who would not bother to speak a lick of English when asked simple questions. What ARROGANCE!! And Hilton, tsk tsk tsk, we don't all go "wink wink" to breaking U.S. employer laws. 
23458 Great location. Friendly staff. Good room size. Always stay here when visiting NYC. 
23459 Want to get away from hustle and bustle when it's time to retire for the evening? This is the place. If you're lucky enough to get a Central Park view, you'll love this property. Perfect place for couples; kids, absolutely not; unless they know how to be really quiet! 
23460 Because of the neighborhood I did not know what to expect from the hotel. I've enjoyed my couple of stays there. The bed is comfortable and the rooms are clean and spacious. Decent selection of breakfast. Overall enjoyed my stay. 
23461 Stayed in February and what a great location, only 5 minutes from Times Square. Arrived mid-day but room was available so they let us in immediately. Only complaint, bathroom was far too small. 
23462 Het Wyndham Blake is een net hotel met uitstekende service zeker in verhouding tot de prijs. De kamers waren netjes en goed onderhouden. Het enige minpuntje was dat onze wc bleef lopen, maar dat was niet echt een probleem. 
23463 Stayed here for 4 days...nice sized rooms, I like the suite concept. Breakfast was good, both cold and hot choices. Staff we always very friendly and accomodating. Keep up the great work. Will be back 
23464 Everyone at the hotel were very friendly, the rooms although on the small side were fine. The beds were very comfortable and clean. Love the blue ceilings! Concierge were always helpful and super nice! Very trendy hotel! Loved it! 
23465 My family and I stayed here with two small children. The hotel was average but great for the price. The staff was friendly and accomadating. I would stay here again if I were on a budget 
23466 Took my daughter on her first NYC trip. Evelyn at the Front Desk was great! She gave us a room with a nice view of Broadway and sent a special treat up to the room for my daughter. She made our trip really special. 
23467 Prima hotel, kleine kamers en smalle bedden, maar de lokatie is top! Het hotel ligt op 2 minuten lopen van Times Square. Zeer nette kamers, erg schoon en netjes. Alles is aanwezig op de kamer. Een aanrader dus! 
23468 Hotel is a bit unusual- but clean and in a great location. Great prices. The keys and lighting a little weird but for the price it is perfect. More european in feel and appearance. Would stay there again. 
23469 This hotel has an inconspicuous entrance off 42nd street and the actual hotel lobby is on the 15th floor. The rooms are huge by New York (or any major city) standards and very comfortable. Not cheap, but this is New York, after all 
23470 I stayed in this hotel for business and found the conference rooms spacious and comfortable, the suites large and well-appointed, the hotel staff friendly and the location just perfect. I would definitely recommend this hotel for other business travelers. 
23471 I stayed there for 3 nights and I loved it. The bathrooms were always clean and never too busy. Close to High Line Park and Hudson Bike Path + free bicycles from the hotel. Very friendly stuff and the front desk manager as well. I will definitely stay again!! 
23472 After driving around for hours, and even with a disturbance in the main fouyer, my guest and i found the night manager Steve to be quite helpful and courteous. We would recomend all our guest consider this hotel as an option when staying in Chicago. 
23473 Nice hotel after moving rooms first night we had no sleep as we were on the first floor and right above the entrance of the hotel and it was really noisey. Once we had moved to another room it was much better. 
23474 Best staff, best service. A home away from home! And so well situated, close to main stores like Macy's. 
23475 My husband and I stayed here one night. The hotel was very nice and we loved our room. It was very quite and safe. The hotel is in a great location. Just a couple blocks from Times Square and lots of shopping! 
23476 You stay neer everything... This is a great location. The staff is friendly and helpfull. The rooms are old but OK. The front desk can be busy. All in all my rating will be "Very good" and I will go there again. 
23477 The hotel was very clean and cheap. The A/C works fine in hot weather (40 C). The staff is nice. Great Location! 
23478 I stayed at this hotel for three nights for a conference. The hotel is lovely, staff was very friendly and food was delicious. There was not a lot to get to in the immediate area but shuttle was very covenient to use within a three mile radius. 
23479 As someone that enjoys restoration this hotel was outstanding. Well done, wonderful detail. They even upgrades me to a penthouse ( with a great view and amazing bathroom). I will stay here from now on when I travel to the area 
23480 Stayed for a one night get away. Recently renovated hotel, friendly staff, cozy bar off main lobby, perfect for drinks at days end. Room was clean, comfortable, typical NYC size, nice amenities. Would highly recommend The Roger 
23481 Guest service manager, Diane Maldonado, set the tone for a great visit by graciously providing ready room upon our early arrival. She was consistently friendly and helpful, offering useful suggestions, perfect directions and warm greetings. Room was clean, quiet, and comfortable. 
23482 That lady at the front desk was OUTSTANDING!!!!! Plus the rest of the staff was very nice. Will stay there everytime I'm in Houston!! 
23483 A great little place to hide from the craziness. Fire is warm on a cold day. Rooms are adequate. Cost not too high for location. Probably a bit worn from its heyday, but I still really like the spot 
23484 Plenty of deals to be had. Recommend 
23485 if you want luxury and comfort the millenium hilton is the place to go. its excellent staff and luxury comfort makes life worth living. 
23486 Affordable room in a good location. The rooms are clean with no major complaints. 
23487 A narrow room at the cost, it is difficult to move to 2 people per room, paint peeling in the bathroom door $ 220 a day average. Can be obtained cheaply Western hotel at $ 170 a Kilmotr / 0.5 miles 
23488 You can't beat its location. Nice, clean and comfortable hotel. You will get amazed with that huge aquarium in the entrance! During the night, go check their bar... awesome place! 
23489 it is situated at a walking distance from the Empire State Building, 5th Avenue... The rooms are small, but clean and warm. 
23490 I stayed there 3 days, 4 nights. Came back with painful, itchy bed bug bites all over my arms, legs, and feet. I reported it to the hotel, and they denied it came from my room. It is not worth the risk to stay here! 
23491 Absolutely no service... Rooms are closets... Staff didn't lift a finger to help... Acted like we were putting them out by renting a room... Shower did not work... Toliet leaked profusely... Absolutely horrible... 
23492 Great Hotel, well located and confortable. Not so roomy, but who stays on bed at Manhattan anyway?Clean and a cosy service. Booked from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Worth the value. Few blocks to Times square, Central Park and Museums. 
23493 This hotel is close enough to Times Square to walk, yet far enough so that you can avoid the crowds and noise. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The front desk staff are helpful and friendly. I recommend staying here. 
23494 Needs updating badly, especially the windows. A lot of street noise especially on the weekend. Ask for a room that does not overlook street. Restaurant is poor for the size of hotel. Nearby hotels have much better quality restaurants. will not stay there again. 
23495 Perfect room, perfect beds and a beautiful bathroom. Everything was new. Personel was very friendly and Times Square is just a walk away. No noise in the hotelroom from outside. We enjoyed our 3 day stay very much! 
23496 We were quite pleased with the hotel, our room, and the generally friendly staff. However, be warned, don't use the Ticket Booking agency. They lied, and took advantage of several people while we were there. The free breakfast was minimal, and the coffee terrible. 
23497 Great location for mid town shopping & access to Central Park. Hotel check in & out fast and efficient. Never seems to have anyone available to help with your bags however! 
23498 Estive neste hotel para a maratona de Nova York que foi cancelada 36 hs antes da largada.Hotel com diarias acima de US$ 200 mas vale pela localizacao e pelo quarto de tamanho razoavel e bastante limpo. 
23499 This was our third time staying here and we love it. The staff is so friendly and helpful, the manager bussed our bags to our room! The beds are so comfy and the room is immaculate. Can't wait to go back 
23500 We spent 4 nights at the hotel. Enjoyed very much the location - close to everywhere in Chicago. The stuff - Very welcoming - ready to help. We were very satisfied - Recommending..... 
23501 Walking distance to all touristic point in NYC. Best breakfast I ever enjoyed in a hotel! Friendly staff and good concierge service. 
23502 We have stayed many times at this hotel and we keep coming back. It's very well run. It's modern, clean, the staff are terrific and the location is perfect. Can't say enough good things about the Sleep Inn. 
23503 I cannot say enough about this hotel. The staff was amazing, the view unbelievable and in every way a dream stay. Kimpton Hotels have become a staple in my travel decisions and Ink48 did not disappoint. We can't wait to get back! 
23504 Highly recommended! Very clean, friendly staff, awesome hotel service, best breakfast buffet with choice of bacon or sausage and egg included. I will definitely stay here the next time I go back in the area. 
23505 Spend three nights on a weekend trip to NYC. The rooms were very large (unexpected compared to many of the places I've stayed in manhattan), comfortable, service very good. It's a relatively long walk to the theatre district, but doable. 
23506 Close to airport. Check in was slow. Computer down? Difficult to make key. Had reserved a king but got 2 beds instead. Walls could use fresh paint. Did have free beer to watch the rangers 
23507 The W is a nice hotel with a great location. The staff is warm and friendly. Although the rooms are small they are definitely upscale. 
23508 Erica at the front desk was so helpful! She really took the time to go the extra step and providing us with aspirin and great places where we could go out and have dessert! Her personality was great! I've enjoyed staying here and look forward to coming back SOON! 
23509 Had a an opportunity to stay at this beautiful property, taking advantage of their introductory rates. Very nice modern rooms, and excellent staff. Valentina, front desk person was able to help us with many different questions. It wasa pleasure to stay at this small intimate property. 
23510 A good place to stay for Midtown NYC - easy walking distance to Times Square and Broadway. Service great and good value. Room clean and comfortable - a bit small bit we didn't spend much time there so it did not matter. I would stay here again. 
23511 A fabulous hotel! Steps away from the Theatre district and across the street from Central Park. The staff were very friendly and courteous, I did not have any complaints while I stayed there. I was able to walk from the hotel to see a Broadway Show. Five stars! 
23512 A perfect boutique hotel. I stayed for almost 10 days and had a great time. Right sized room for single occupancy. Very central but away from hustle bustle 
23513 Will stay again. 
23514 I have a wonderful vacation. The service is good and fast. The staff are friendly and sweetness. But the WIFI had bad reception. 
23515 Suite was PERFECT for Mother, daughter and aunt get-away!! Location is fantastic for theatres and dining! Staff is friendly, helpful, professional. Furnishings and amentities surpassed our expectations!! Will definitely return- as we think "theatre get aways are going to be a part of our "traditions!" 
23516 My sister and I went to New York City right before Christmas and stayed in this hotel. The location was great and close to major attractions like central park and times square. Its a good value and great location for your typical average hotel. 
23517 Excelente Hotel lo recomiendo, muy cerca de las estaciones del metro,te puedes ir a pie a la 5 ta Av. Y esta muy cerca de Rest. Aunque un poco costosos, muy bueno 
23518 Lage super, Personal meistens sehr nett, allerdings am Telefon unfreundlich bei Nachfragen, die das Zimmer (959) betreffen. Ein anderes Zimmer war "in your categorie not available". Keine Auskunft, WAS denn meine Kategorie sei, die Dame hat einfach aufgegelegt. Fragen, warum die Minibar warm war, hab ich dann nicht mehr gestellt.... 
23519 Stayed here recently, clean and acceptable room. Plenty of eateries in the locality. Great for visiting Buddy Guys Legends Club, only 5 mins away. Location is good for visiting the city and is just over the road to the waterfront and parks. 
23520 Enjoyed my stay & would certainly recommend it. Only complaint was my bill - overcharged by $800 for a 5 night stay, but this was rectified very promptly. Rooms are lovely but not tea/coffee making facilities in rooms facing ground zero. 
23521 I recently stayed and all I can say is PERFECT!!! Great staff, amazing location, comfy beds and modern design. Their bellhop staff did an amazing job booking my car from the airport and back. I will be back soon for some more of this cool vibe. 
23522 Our stay at Econolodge was comfortable, and we enjoyed the contental breakfast the following morning. The pool was nice as well. We would highly recommend this hotel near the Bradley Airport in Connecticut. 
23523 The hotel was great. We had a king size bed, and a pull out sofa. We also had a small kitchenette which came in very handy for left-overs, water bottles and such. The front-desk people were very nice and check-in and check-out went very smoothly. Everything was very clean. 
23524 Decent hotel, clean, friendly, but 100 bucks to park for two days, rooms are extremely small, we didn't feel we got our moneys worth at all. We won't stay again. Paid over 500 for 2 nights plus parking.......yikes 
23525 Conveniently located but that's about it. Free breakfast was good actually. Room tiny! I really took my cat and could not swing it!!! Funny old posters from The Cass Hotel give weekly rates of $10! 
23526 This hotel is nearest to Time Square and Empire State. Good hotels. Comfortable rooms, great breakfast. For sure i'll comeback again. 
23527 Excellent hotel. Rooms a tad small but you only sleep there so not a problem. Subway really close with plenty of dinneraround. I would stay here again. 
23528 The cleanliness is not bellow average, the service is almost inexistent, the room are average,... But the best thing about this hotel is the location ! If you want a better hotel with quite the same location, try the Wellington, it can be as affordable as this one 
23529 this was my first time leaving California. Hotel 31 was extremely clean and the staff was beyond belief. Almost all the major attractions that I wanted to view were nearby. my next trip to new york, I plan to stay at Hotel 31. 
23530 Took my mom for her birthday. Was given an upgrade to a suite. View of Park Avenue. All staff polite, incredible to deal with. A must stay hotel. Location is perfect! 
23531 I thought The Hilton was very good. I was there on Business for the whole week, and I have no complaints. The room rate was $179.00, Can't beat that either. 
23532 The room was big, clean and quiet. The bed was very comfortable. I really have no complaints. It was a very good hotel with excellent value and the shuttle to the airport worked like a charm. Just give them a call once you have picked up your baggage. 
23533 El hotel esta muy bien ubicado pero las instalaciones y el servicio son malos 
23534 great location, although noisy. nice area very close to central park. nice to take a morning stroll in. great breakfast. staff ok. bad lift. room large clean,big bathroom. fridge coffee maker etc. great value for money 
23535 This hotel was perfect for our 2 night stay. Great price and nice location for our needs. Breakfast buffet offered many choices. Concierge was very helpful. Check in & out was a breeze. 
23536 Perfect location, comfortable rooms and very reasonably priced. Very friendly and helpful staff. Only drawback - only one (slow) elevator. A great place for enjoying Chicago. 
23537 I have stated at the Barclay every week for 2 years now and it never disapoints. Their Ambassador costomer service repesentitive, Annmarra Gayle makes sure every thing is perfect even when I (as usual) make my resevations at the last minute. 
23538 The location is excellent for most major sights and shops 
23539 Room rates can be pricey but its a dependable standard of accommodation 
23540 Try to secure breakfast inclusive rates as a la carte plates are very dear 
23541 Non lo consiglio a nessuno,si trova nel quartiere ispanico, non proprio centralissimo. Le camere sono scialbe e sporche. I bagni non possono assolutamente essere definiti tali. Sporchissimi! Economico, ma la spesa non vale la pena. 
23542 Great location. very fun in the middle of everything. Very clean, nice room. We were celebrating a birthday and the staff was very considerate to leave a note and snacks for us. We would go back for sure. 
23543 I stayed here a few years ago and loved it. However, it seems to be runned down a bit now. The lobby and the rooms need to renovate...the lounge has lost it following...and staff have lost their youthful appearance. No wonder way my rate was low! 
23544 We enjoyed this Hotel and the price. Hot and Cold breakfast (included) was very good. Clean rooms with stove, microwave, fridge. Golf course right behind the hotel with discount for hotel guests. Happy hour was great the night we arrived, a cold beverage after a long trip hit the spot. 
23545 great location, poor service, not clean, not enough hot water, not enough towels. in short - find another place to stay! 
23546 The location was fantastic! My boyfriend and I could easily get to all the great locations in Manhattan! The rooms were spotless and the bed was very comfy! The service was awesome too! The people were friendly, courteous and helpful! Overall, it was an awesome stay! Especially for the price! 
23547 The new aLoft Hotel in Harlem is a fantastic place to stay! Extremely friendly staff, great bar and a outstanding fitness center! VERY close to some great restaurants. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone! 
23548 Restaurant service annoying- lack of coordination between waiter and maitre d at steak house, rushed, mechanical and same at Bistro 151 for breakfast. Food good but not great, prices high. Room very comfortable. 
23549 this hotel was excellent. very well situated for sightseeing in manhattan. very clean friendly staff, great b&b 24/7 tea and coffee. highly recommended hope to return again. 
23550 This restored 100+ year old hotel was a delight. staff was both polite & helpful. The rooms are small, but what I expected from an older, restored landmark. Beautiful resoration inside the hotel, very stately...of an era gone by. Would defiantly stay again! 
23551 The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. The smiling faces and information available and offered was greatly appreciated. 
23552 Great time. Great Rooms, Great Food, everything was perfect. The beds were super comfy, the view amazing, the executive lounge was great. Nothing bad to say about my experience this time around. So different from the last time I stayed. Good work Swissotel Chicago. 
23553 Muy buen situado al lado del empire state y estupendo si lo que buscas es descansar comodamente tras patear manhattan 
23554 Good hotel. Very clean rooms, nice and helpful stuff, location great for all parts of Manhattan. About 20-30 min walk to central park, same to Greenwich village. For price we paid (360 for 2 nights) it was the best! Nice rooftop bar. Lots of places around 
23555 This hotel was close to everything, but on a quiet street. Great room and the kitchen added a nice touch. I spent three days here for a conference at another hotel and saved a bunch. Good luck! 
23556 Very reasonable rates for downtown Chicago. Parking is a little out of the way. Shopping and restaurants in walking distance. Great lobby bar with fantastic view. 
23557 We stayed at The Muse Dec 2 - 6 First time in New York and loved it. Rooms were large, bed was very comfy - every thing was just perfect. Staff were polite, helpfull and effecient and we would recommend this hotel to everyone. 
23558 Friendly service. Staff helpful. Room clean and updated. Downside was the view looked into a back alley. Good value for your money. Steps to all the action in Times Square. 
23559 We were without power and decided to spend one night in NYC-just lucked into this. Well priced, great location, well appointed, friendly and inviting. We loved the ambiance of a small boutique hotel-a great experience from start to finish 
23560 We have stayed at this hotel several times and always found it to meet our expectations. We will always stay here when visiting NYC. 
23561 Small and dated rooms, but very clean. Location is great; one minute from Times square. Wifi does not work on the 6th floor, but OK in lobby. Rooms facing street are noisy. 
23562 My son and I stay here almost everytime we come to Houston to go to the Shriners hospital. We always have a clean room great friendly staff. 
23563 We stayed at the Hudson Hotel for 3 nights. The hotel rooms weren't the largest ever but were really clean and comfortable. The staff were really helpful and even stored our luggage until 5pm on our last day. I would definitely stay here again and recommend this hotel to anyone. 
23564 La situation de l'hotel est vraiment ideale, a seulement quelques rues de Times Square. Par contre la proprete de la chambre laissait serieusement a desirer et la chambre beneficiait de fenetres qui donnait sur un mur, donc aucune lumiere et pas moyen de savoir quel temps il faisait le matin. 
23565 We stayed here in March 2002 thought the hotel was great. Some of the staff could have been slightly more helpful. The location is excellent in between broadway and 5th Ave, just round the corner literally from The Empire State Building. Would stay there again 
23566 Old furnurure, rood staff and crazy prices for a 3 * hotel. Takes forever to check in and check out. I hated the arrogance of the consierge 
23567 I enjoyed staying at this hotel, very comfy bed, very clean and great location at the heart of Chicago, close to all business conference places, walking distance to Navy Pierre, and less than 10 minuets to McCormick Place. I would very much stay there next time I'm in Chicago. 
23568 This hotel is a gem. Excellent Times Square location, clean and the service is outstanding. For a NYC hotel, our room was amazingly quiet...no street noise what so ever. Breakfast, was not really a "breakfast" but ok for a quick bite of something. Definately will stay here again. 
23569 I am a diamond member and recommend this hotel. Wonderful location. Hotel staff was excellent. Can't beat the price. Be prepared to wait the 30min to get your vehicle out of valet parking, but they tell you that up front as soon as you check in. 
23570 Great location close to Times Square and Central Park. The staff was very friendly and very helpful! Room was clean and quiet. Bed was very comfortable. Free breakfast and internet was an added bonus. Very convenient to restaurants and other attractions. Would definitely stay again! 
23571 Definitely, Great location, friendly staff, and very good size rooms in the nyc. Very close to all the shops, broadway plays, and restaurants just close by 46th st with all types of food. we always come back to this hotel. 
23572 Good Hotel. Small Rooms but maximise space, everything you need available. Good Location. If your looking for a good standard of Hotel but are travelling on a Budget then this is the spot. Helpful Reception Desk and Shuttle Bus to JFk available. 
23573 Beautiful Hotel in great location. Room was well appointed, modern, very clean. Expensive, but what isn't in NYC. 
23574 First time traveling to New York. Location, Service and Room was great! Will defintely be back and will recommend:) Great trip! 
23575 Never got to stay there. I requested a non smoking room and then spoke to them and they tried to charge me substantially more for that "luxury". Poor business sense. Will never book with them! 
23576 Read all the reviews on tripadvisor. It is a beautiful hotel and we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a Junior Suite upon arrival. The morning coffee/tea and snacks are also a nice touch. Location is great, room was clean and comfortable. We will definitely be back. 
23577 I had a short stay in New York where I was presenting a seminar. I found the Omni Berkshire spotless, efficient, friendly and convenient to mid-town. I'll stay there again. 
23578 Overall my stay was good. The hotel is clean. I love the smell of the W fragrance! Location is good walking distance to all shopping and restaurants. The concierge staff is very helpful! I would recommend this hotel. I will be back! 
23579 Niks dan goeds over dit hotel. Vriendelijk personeel, snelle liften, schoon en goed onderhouden. Uitstekende lokatie, 50 m vanaf het drukke Times Square en toch een heel rustig. Goede restaurants naast en tegenover het hotel. Absoluut aan te raden! 
23580 Very comfortable room with soft bed, table and chair. Free WiFI. Coffeemaker with coffee. But it's not all that important, because it's a great value and it's located in 5 minutes of walking from TImes Square. 
23581 The Hotel Zaza, close to Rice University, Medical Center, Art Museums and Hermann Park, is next to a leafy, lovely residential area. The Hotel has that trendy, but comfortable vibe with all staff really friendly and helpful The rooms are attractive with wonderful beds and terrific showers 
23582 Great location right in Time Square. Pricey...parking is very expensive but most parking is in the city. Rooms are not all that great. Try to request a room overlooking Time Square. 
23583 Stellar service & excellent location. We enjoyed the peaceful and beautiful grounds. The rooms were quiet and very comfortable. The walking trail & fitness were better than any hotel we have visited. Best hotel in Houston & we'll be back. 
23584 Too noisy and very basic for the price you pay, there ere no blinds in teh windows that let th noisy strret noises to go trough 
23585 Working with Bindia La Paz is an absolute pleasure!! She is an intelligent, bright, happy person who puts her heart and soul into pleasing guests. The hotel is a boutique hotel that feels like a touch of Europe in New York City. 
23586 Erg groot hotel (ca 1.700 kamers).Veel internationale groepen die slechts enkele dagen verblijven. Heel groot verloop van hotelgasten. Weinig eetmogelijkheden ontdekt behalve het direct aan het hotel gekoppelde Lindy's. Gemiddelde kwaliteit eten. Geen hotel om 's avonds in de lobby leuke contacten op te doen. 
23587 stayed a weekend. Had a decent room, nothing special. There is no computer, so I went across the street to (I think) a Hilton and snuck on... no phone books in room or at front desk. Help a little frazzled by the full hotel. 
23588 Great location at Times Square! Pretty nice hotel other than hotel room bathrooms. Decent service. I would suggest finding a cheaper place to park as it is 45.00 per day at the garage that the hotel uses. 
23589 Our room was tiny, but the price was reasonable for NYC ($185 per night with taxes - when you book in advance), and the location was great - 10-14 minutes away from the Times Square (walking distance). We'll be back! 
23590 Clean and good location. Nice staff. Pls ask for a room away from theroad. I paid a good bit to stay a night and did not sleeep a wink. The noise from the road was too bad..soundproofing anyone? 
23591 Very friendly and helpful staff in a great location near the subway or an easy walk to many places. Very clean, comfortable rooms with 24 hour diner and nice grocery stores next door. Recent long weekend stay offered incredible value with significant discount. 
23592 lovely hotel. nice room. helpful staff. decent location in the city. ran out of some food at breakfast, which seemed odd for an otherwise upscale hotel. 
23593 Excellent location near the airport. Clean, comfortable rooms and excellent breakfast. Hotel has free shuttle to the airport. Nice pool outside, but I just one night and did not get to try it. Taco Bell nearby. 
23594 I will not stay here again. The towels had hair in them. The housekeepers came in my room while my husband & I were asleep. They could only speak spanish & I had to go speak to a Supervisor which helped out. The air didn't get very cool. 
23595 Stayed here for one night, nice hotel, clean room, clean bathroom and that's all im asking for. Only downside?... location, not a single restaurant close by and at nite when your you are starving its disappointing. but other than that everything was good. 
23596 City view King room deluxe was smaller than I thought but overall cleanliness is very good and bed is very comfortable 
23597 Thermostat would not work at all. Room temp was 59 degrees. Turned air conditioner up, temp stayed the same. Turned heat on, temp stayed the same. Guest in adjoining room kept trying to open adjoining room door numerous times during the night. 
23598 Rates for the trip where very reasonable. The staff was knowledgeable and generous with insider information on the city. The rooms where very nice. It was a trip that will never be forgotten or recreated. 
23599 The Residence Inn was very comfortable, in a convenient location for my business, and had everything I would want for either a business or personal stay. The staff was outstandingly friendly and helpful. 
23600 it was comfy. the bar was nice during the evening. supremely cozy. 
23601 Make sure to prioritize this hotel when searching for your next vist to NYC Times Square. Travel Safe! 
23602 albergo molto elegante,camere spaziose e dotate di ogni comfort. molto apprezzata la ricca colazione. peccato solo la scarsa pulizia e servizio al quanto carente.in otto giorni solo per tre abbiamo avuto la biancheria per entrambi ed a nulla sono valsi i continui solleciti. il bagno era in condizioni pietose 
23603 Clean, clean, clean bedroom, sitting room and bathroom. Accommodating staff from the front desk, bell man, housekeeping to the restaurant. Easy walk to Rockefeller Center, Broadway Shows and Times Square. A really fun weekend. Daniela was especially helpful. 
23604 The hotel is well located. The rooms are small and little clean. the personal very good and very polite.I'd recommend the hotel to my friends 
23605 Amazing staffs. Not the most kids friendly hotel but the staffs and location made up for everything. Close to the subway, great selection of restaurants around, not to mention museums and Central Park are just around the corner. 
23606 hands down the best hotel in new york city. besides the waldorf astoria. great location and great view! 
23607 It is recently under construction (2012 summer). Location is not really good compare to other high end hotels in NYC. Keep checking the rate, and you could get a REALLY good deal. By the way, both Waldorf Astoria and Waldorf Tower are not for fashionista. 
23608 This area of Houston has really declined over the years, so i was extremely impressed with the quality and security of the recently renovated La Quinta. Rooms were very clean and service was responsive and friendly. I'd stay here again next time i visit. 
23609 We stayed here for our 5th anniversary. It was great - very nice staff, fun restaurants downstairs and easy cab / walking distance to so many attractions. 
23610 What can I say?? Everything at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York was perfect - the staff was so accommodating, helpful and courteous. The room was beautiful - the hotel lobby bar marvelous!!! I did not want to go home. I cannot wait to stay there again. 
23611 I have stayed at this hotel multiple times and I have been very satisfied with location, service, rooms and value. I highly recommend this hotel when visiting NYC for shopping and great food. 
23612 Stayed here with family age range 17 to 77, and everybody thought it was great. New hotel with nice facilities, and very comfortable beds. Small rooms, but that's to be expected. Dan the bellman will take care of you. 
23613 Ideal /stunning location .Gilt restaurant a must try at the hotel! 
23614 The room was very comfortable, however the room location was not ideal. The window over looks an empty space where air conditioner were. There were no city view from there. 
23615 A very good location. Central to all the main tourist attractions. Quite a dated hotel small soulless rooms and ignorant staff. you get what you pay for. I would only stay there again because of the location. 
23616 Sofitel always treats me well and the best part is that their advance rates are relatively affordable for the level of luxury and service you receive. 
23617 Nice place though rooms are small... but clean! No problem with the shared bathrooms. A lot of places to have drink or dinner around. Conveniently located near Metro. Walking distance from Central Park and Broadway. 
23618 I honestly can't rate the room because I now start my three hour wait for the one they promised me on the phone I could have now. Staff doesn't show any interest. 
23619 Perfectly located hotel with helpful staff to sort out any problems occurring, and I sincerely hope that anyone staying here has the pleasure of doing so on Edwin's watch. 
23620 Posizione ottima, fermata della metropolitana davanti all'hotel. Camere nuove e arredate con stile anche se non grandissime. Personale disponibile. 
23621 Hotel staff were exceptionally friendly and accommodating. Rooms were not large but clean and adequate. The location is perfect for theatre, restaurants and as a home base for all the other sites. 
23622 Stayed three nights at the Benjamin on business. Could not believe what a deal their rooms are for NYC. Very nicely appointed, clean and in a great location. The staff was super friendly. All around excellent stay. 
23623 My boyfriend and I met another couple there for brunch. The food and hospitality were amazing. The staff gave the right amount of space but still very accessible. It goes without saying that Mandarin is a pricey hotel! 
23624 Friendly staff, big spacious and very clean room.. nice breakfast available in the morning and perfect location for walking the city ! We loved our 4 night stay at the Salisbury and will definitely return. 
23625 The personnel is great, but rooms are small (but it's NY), noisy (with poor sound proofing) and poor window view. 
23626 Chelsea Star is in a very good location, has very nice staff, clean rooms,and the price for only 10 streets away from times square, is not the worst. I definitely recomend it! 
23627 Found the hotel very nice indeed. Nice room with huge comfy beds, Breakfast was very good too. Staff nice and helful. Not the best location - you have to take a cab to all the touristy places - maybe im just too lazy...... 
23628 Could not fault the hotel itself. 
23629 The Palace has a great location and the rooms are large and comfortable. Its a good place for business meetings. My real beef is the cost of any ancilliary charges. For example: american breakfast is $40. My view is that is gouging, and it tainted my experience. 
23630 I spent a week at the Fairmont Millennium Park Hotel in May 2012 for business and extended a few days for pleasure. We left the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. Great for business not so much for family. 
23631 I stayed here from 10-15 June and was pleasantly surprised by it. The staff were very friendly and helpful toward us, the room was great and the location was ideal! Would definately recommend it! 
23632 This is a small hotel on the East Side that has decor straight out of a 1980s era bad TV movie. However, it's clean and if you get a low rate you will likely enjoy the flashback! 
23633 this is an ok hotel. i paid $80 on hotwire and had to remind myself of how much (little) i had paid in order to stop myself from complaining. this place is not a 4-star hotel but for the location, and the price, can't be beat. 
23634 The staff was great, and the room was better. We stayed for two nights. Only two blocks from the # 1 subway train. We had a great view fo the Hudson River and Ellis Island. I would stay again. 
23635 This hotel was discusting, bugs, needles, horrible smell,no hot water,no airconditoning, charged a high rate,drug addicits,rude hotel staff, stolen money.. Hopefully you get the point this place is ran by idiots. 
23636 This is a first rate hotel. Somewhat expensive, but you pay for what you get! Superb service from aarival to departure with every detail attended to. Excellent food and concierge service second to none. Will be back! 
23637 El gran hotel, realmente una conbinacion de jujo, clase e historia, hacen de el Waldorf Astoria el mejor hotel de NY , estuvimos en marzo 2012 una semana y realmente nos sentiamos millonarios, muy bueno el servicio. Sonia Y Marcelo de los Toldos y Burzaco. 
23638 This was a beautiful hotel in a beautiful area. Subway is walking distance, everybody was friendly! The room was so clean, and had everything we needed. Thanks Maramara, I would recommend you to everyone! 
23639 Nice hotel, close to everything. The hotel was very quiet at night to sleep and loved looking at the New York skyline while lying in bed. The deli across the street was excellent... and not too expensive. 
23640 Had a fantastic time at teh Skyline, we stayed in a Junior suite, hotel very clean, staff were very helpful. great location. Will be staying here again. 
23641 stayed here during my sisters 21st with my family! had a brilliant trip, really helpful staff throught the hotel and the warm fresh cookies are a must have! would definitely return 
23642 Gorgeous hotel, super chic and cool. The staff are super friendly, courteous. The hotel is at a fabulous location with an amazing view of the Empire State Building. Really, it was the nicest hotel I have ever stayed at. I wanted to move in! 
23643 Had a very nice room on the second to top floor. Fantastic view, very very large space, with a separate livingroom and bedroom and 1.5 baths. Everything was in new shape. Would definitely stay there again. 
23644 Dirty. Bedbugs. Human fluids on the comforter (hey - that's not comforting), thin blanket, and sheets. Room smells like death. I stayed here because everything between downtown and ORD was booked. Next time, I'll upgrade and sleep in the bus station. 
23645 This hotel is great. Was recently redone. Lobby and rooms are immaculate. Service was great. Was there for 3 nights with wife and we both enjoyed the stay. Beds very comfortable. The location is in the middle of it all, Times Square. Definately recommend!! 
23646 Literally, will go there once and never again. Needs a major update (furniture, lighting, paint etc...) rid of the mildew smell throughout.. Perhaps an exorcism or two as well. 
23647 Rooms are tooo small to even breath; air conditioning was not working. Location was great. Breakfast in morning was great. 
23648 My car was broken into while parked 15 yds from front door of hotel. The hotel is in a dangerous area and security does not seem adequate. 
23649 Loved everything about this hotel... lovely room, wonderful staff and fun rooftop bar. Decor was really nice. Very adequate breakfast. Excellent location. Loved every minute of our stay here. Attention given to every detail. 
23650 Stayed at the Residence Inn for 2 nights. Very convenient location for walking to restaurants and sights. The staff was amazingly friendly. Free breakfast was great! The room was really nice. Just be warned all rooms have only a single queen bed and a pul out sofa bed. 
23651 Nos dieron un upgrade a habitacion en piso superior con inceible vista a San Patricio! Servicio de recepcion amable, habitaciones comodas y amplias, excelente ubicacion. Tarifa adecuada reservando con booking.com 
23652 Everyone is very friendly & helpful. Rooms are clean & bright. Nightly turndown service leaves delicious locally made chocolates for you! Great location to access the subway & Times Square. 
23653 Can't add much more to the bazillions of good reviews here. Good location for Broadway shows. Hope they don't get a swelled head and raise their rates as they are already not cheap, but about on par with similar hotels. 
23654 Perfect location for a hotel, just off Times Square. The price was good for Manhattan hotels. Services, breakfast food, etc. all fine by my standards. Would stay there again. 
23655 Real nice. This hotel has been updated recently, looks great. We bid for a hotel and got this on the weekend for fifty five dollars a night. Parking is fourteen with in and out privileges. 
23656 A friendly high quality hotel perfectly located in Manhatten Great staff attitude good rooms and meals Bar a little pricy Particuarly good doormen and great advice on local sites Very close to 5th and 6th ave and Central Park Very noce 
23657 Really enjoyed the Mayfair - staff friendly and helpful, rooms clean and commodious. Convenient to subway and short walk to theatres and restaurants. Tremendous value. Was slightly disappointed that the bistro was being rennovated, though. I know where to stay in Midtown now! 
23658 Le Parker Meridien is an excellent hotel! The facility is beautiful and the staff is friendly, professional, and dedicated. 
23659 I like the hotel the rooms are good and it is in a good location. 
23660 Perfect location, just around the corner of Times Square, near Central Park, Fifth, Sixth avenues, Broadway, just perfect! Clean rooms, friendly staff. Breakfast included. 
23661 Stayed 3 nights with 2 other family members. Convenient location. Shopped for food/breakfast items across street. Comfortable king bed, rollaway bed not so good. Housekeeping replaced rollaway 2nd night with deduction in rate for 1st night. Hotel should have free WiFi for guests when rate is over $300 per night. 
23662 a nice and quiet hotel; good beds and nice rooms. The roofterrace gives a nice view over a part of the city. A pity they don't have a small bar on the roof. Staff friendly, newspapers before the door of the room. A perfect place to discover New York. 
23663 Only 1 lift services the whole hotel, making mornings a bit slow. Great location, easy walk to buses, subway, Penn Station, Time Square etc. 
23664 Very convenient if you want to stay by airport. Rooms standard Hilton, dependable quality and cleanliness. Also convenient to L train. Andiamo's very nice for dinner, breakfast, kids' menu. Did not try pool/health club as there was an extra fee involved. 
23665 I stay here all the time. The rooms are great and so is the staff. Just got upgrated to a suite from the very nice guy at the reception, Sebastian, who happens to be from Germany as well. Amazing. Also check out the restaurant and the bar! 
23666 we have stayed at this days inn many times over the last 2 years and always get great service 
23667 the staff is great and breakfast is excellent. we feel safe and have never felt scared. TRY IT , YOU WILL LIKE IT 
23668 Classy public rooms, bedrooms fine but not great. Fair price for accomodation, had a Cosmo in the bar $26.29!!!!!!! Attended a wedding in the Gilt restaurant which was magnificent. 
23669 I stayed here during CMJ. The location can't be beat if you're in need of being in close proximity to clubs in the lower east side. The room was small, but clean, and the staff was exceptionally nice. 
23670 PARK SAVOY IS THE BEST! We stay there every trip to NYC from Bermuda since 2000 It's clean, close to Times Square and the service is excellent! 
23671 Hotel a due passi di numero da Time Square, zona teatri di Brodway e la 5th e a tre passi da Central Park. Ha tutto il necessario per un soggiorno comodo e confortevole. Pulito, con cambio giornaliero degli asciugamani. Staff gentile. Soddisfatta della scelta! 
23672 Excellent experience, conveniently located, clean, and professional. Would definitely stay again. 
23673 Stayed in a single from June 6-9. The room was small, but it was only neede for sleeping. No problem with shared bathroom. The place was clean and nicely decorated. Clean place. Great location. Can't beat the price. 
23674 in face.... I was here before the place opened. Stay in room 185 - massive bath, the views are awesome. Quite pricey, but views make it worth it - see my pic from the window. 
23675 We spend two nights here and were very pleased. The service was great and the rooms were very clean and inviting. The Don Shula restaurant downstairs was also first rate. 
23676 I frequently stay in the New York City for overnights on business. I'm always looking for a hotel that combines comfort, service and value. I loved the Barclay and will stay there from now on. 
23677 Staff very friendly and helpful. ............although i arrived in the morning, room was ready within a couple of hours. Wireless all over the hotel. 
23678 A wonderful hotel if not unexpected. Ramada in solid Amercian style. Good if not great continental breakfast. Rooms are considerably larger than most Nyc rooms. Great stay for 7 days in April 2012--loved our location. Very helpful staff. 
23679 Stay here and you'll be glad you did! The Staff, room, bed, view, location, are all outstanding! Don't worry about the noise from construction because it's not that bad besides anywhere you stay in this city your going to get a little noise. Try it and you'll love it!! 
23680 Stayed over a night in june 2010. Positive: location in the middle of Times Square but there are numbers of other better hotels nearby. Old hotel so old rooms not so comfortable beds. Everything costs incl leaving the luggage while waiting for check in. 
23681 It's all been said before, atmospheric, charming and very small rooms with no bathroom. But what really sets this place apart are the super-helpful staff, who went way beyond the call of duty. Genuinely friendly and keen to show of their hotel. And the location is perfect. 
23682 GREAT HOTEL FOR THE PRICE... A little far form everything, you need a car to move. Staff is very helpful and for parking you have 3 options, self parking is complimentary. If you join the loyalty program internet service is free. 
23683 Recently spent 4 nights at this hotel. Staff were very helpful and always available. Hotel is very clean with nice size rooms for NYC standards. Location was perfect for visiting Times Square, Macy's and other attractions. Roof top bar is great as well. Will return on my next visit. 
23684 We stayed here for a long weekend and it was a great base for exploring the city. Very close to the subway and within walking distance of everything. The hotel was clean, comfortable and well priced. Would recommend, great base for all there is to see in NYC. 
23685 Remodelado , cerca de tiendas , restaurantes. Elevadores pequenos. 
23686 It has a fantastic location, near a metro station. It has an impeccable room service, we feel safe, as throughout the city as well. Broadway is just around the corner. Easy to catch a taxi. The Manhattan at Times Square Hotel is fabulous. Congratulations Starwood Hotels and Resorts Staff 
23687 Recently stayed here while visiting New York - this hotel is ideal for touring New York as it is only 2 blocks from Time Square. The rooms are clean and air conditioned and the en-suites nicely tiled. The restaurant offered a good dinner menu and great service. 
23688 We had a lovely stay at Hotel Felix. Friendly staff, cozy room with all the amenities, beautiful view and great food at the hotel restaurant. Would recommend to couples looking for a romantic getaway. 
23689 The Wacker is a great hotel ideally situated in downtown Chicago with nice views, clean rooms and friendly staff. The rates were also decent. 
23690 Have stayed there a dozen times and it never ceases to amaze me that they continue to excell in every way. A truly first class experience on a very intimate and personal level. 
23691 Just a beautiful hotel. Very good food, tea and bar. The service is outstanding. 
23692 Hot, smelly, dirty and not even that cheap. Avoid like the plague 
23693 Stayed there with son/daughter-in-law and two grandchildren in early December, 2011 - great stay; close to mid-town events and walkable to Times Square/5th Avenue, Rock Center and many other places; good neighborhood! 
23694 Great Location, Great food in the hotel and a nice staff. The only negative is the traffice around the hotel, but you do not need a car because tou can walk to a ton of restaurants and shops. 
23695 great hotel, service, location, and value. staff was friendly and room was perfect. especially liked breakfast in the executive club overlooking the river and downtown. 
23696 We enjoyed this hotel very much. Room is well organized , with fridge, microwave,etc. The bed was very comfortable and full breakfast is provided. Very well located and staff is friendly. 
23697 Another pleasant stay- our fourth. Impeccably maintained, quiet and comfortable. 
23698 Great location; great rooms and fabulous service. We loved the hotel. Albert at the front desk was extremely knowledgable and helpful. 
23699 Questo hotel e ottimamente situato nel cuore di NY e di grande efetto scenografico e molto pratico. Lo consiglierei certamente e chiunque sia amante del bello e allo stesso tempo delle cose moderne e efficienti. 
23700 Hotel eccezionale, ma il problema della metro non e' da poco, infatti ogni 5 minuti si era scossi da un treno... Altra mia esperienza negativa e' che alle 16.00 la camera non era ancora disponibile e o dovuto attendere 30-60 min. 
23701 Perfect location for a short visit in New York. Accommendation was good in price 
23702 Good value and not a bad location. Rooms are small and very little day light but they are clean and the service is good. Recommend to budget travellers. There is something nice about the decor. 
23703 Clean rooms, helpful staff - you can't do better in NYC. 
23704 Went here for our anniversary. The rooms are small but after all this is NYC. The staff were amazing the hotel was spotless. You can't beat the price for NYC. Great location (walking distance from Penn Station). Will be staying here next time we visit NYC. 
23705 was fairly ok but there was a small from the kitchen thoughout the rooms even though ours was on the third floor (no elevator BTW). Furthermore wi fi connnection was only available at the lobby 
23706 Was booked here on a business trip. Worst hotel I have stayed in years. Tiny rooms and bathroom. No internet service when I was there. Room reeked of a putrid disinfectant smell. 
23707 Front desk was friendly and helpful. View was great. 29th floor two floor suite. Stayed with my wife and teenaged son. they upgraded us at check in due to needing an extra bed. 
23708 The staff was amazing. The rooms were well appointed. It is located in the middle of everything/place you could possibly want to do/see. The price is quite competitive considering the comp set and well worth every penny. 
23709 This Hotel has an AWESOME location, you step right out to Times Square, the musical Evita is also in the hotel. The rooms are spacey and the beds are very comfortable, their staff is very helpful. Breakfast is also great. They also have The View, which is a rotating restaurant. 
23710 The staff were friendly and helpful. The location was great for walking downtown. I did not like having to pay extra ($18 a day) to use the gym. 
23711 Great location near Central Park, Natural History Museum and subway. MUCH quieter than most mid-town hotels. Very clean. Prices vary widely - can be reasonable, can be expenisve. Very consistent and good service. 
23712 Really convenient hotel, centrally located, great deal available on Expedia. Room size amazing, had two interconnecting rooms which slept five of us all in beds (not sofa beds) Just what you need after a busy day sightseeing. 
23713 We had the pleasure of staying in the Renaissance the week of June 21, 2004. The staff was more than friendly and helpful, making our dinner reservations several times. We were right in the middle of all the "action" and couldn't have had a better time. 
23714 Overall the hotel is fine except for the traffic noises which were too much until 3am in the morning... I think it has something to do with the lane closure outside so check carefully unless you can sleep with some ear plugs. 
23715 excellent location ,with many great resturants and barnes noble book store around the corner. We stayed in October of 2012. The hotel staff were very good and met all our needs. The room was very nice and large. 
23716 Average stay. Even though nothing was bad, nothing really set it out from the crowd either. 
23717 We have stayed here three times and each time we have received excellent service from all members of staff. Everybody is very friendly and helpful. Also great location. Will definitely be back. 
23718 Very nice hotel in the skyline district. Rooms nicely updated and very clean. Beautiful large bathrooms. Staff very accommodating. Lobby has an entrance to the downtown tunnel with many shops, restaurants, and entrances to most downtown office buildings. 
23719 Business has brought me to Midtwon many times this year. I've stayed at several places, but have come to rely on the Hilton Manhattan East. Good location. Clean rooms. Nice bar. And good prices 
23720 Stayed here two nights on business. Room was large, clean, well-appointed, and quiet. Nice bathroom with new fixtures. Wireless internet, flat screen tv, small coffee maker. Front desk staff very helpful. Junior Suite for $100 a night was simply a steal. 
23721 In Chicago for business. Selected this hotel because it was close to my business. The staff was professional and accommodating. I ate at the restaurant downstairs. It too was excellent. The room was great. I will stay there again. 
23722 stayed here for a week and had great exp. nice rooms,nice staff, good location and good pirce as well. try them out a good place if you are in that area. 
23723 The hotel needs a serious refurbish, seems the interior hasn't been updated for ages. Vibrant outdoors while dull and uninviting indoors. Wouldn't want to stay here next time for sure... 
23724 Very convenient location. Layout of hotel is a little awkward. Rooms are on par with other mid-level hotels. Staff is courteous, but they are definitely thin at the front desk. I would recommend this hotel to anyone that wants to be in Times Square and not break the bank. 
23725 This hotel is mediocre at best. Pros: Location Quiet Rooms Cons: Hard to get help - TV was broken and it took them a day to come by and that was because i pestered them. The careline was always busy, I called housekeeping when i needed help. Wont go back. 
23726 We had the pleasure of staying here for our Anniversary. As always , AmnnMara Gayle helped to make our stay wonderful. Her expertise and attention to detail shines every time. We have just booked another stay and we are so looking forward to it! 
23727 While rooms tend to be on smalled side they are well appointed and very comfortable. The staff makes you feel welcome and they have a warm lobby area in which you can relax.On nice days the outside bar area is a treat with a great view. 
23728 Room was very spacious overlooking B'way yet QUIET. Location is great: near fine restaurants at varied price points. Not fancy but clean and sunny. Good proximity to theater, shopping, supermarkets (to stock the mini fridge). Zabars and Fairway across the street. Good public transportation too! 
23729 Got a real good deal on internet site, one of the nicest hotels I've been at for it's price and location. It within walking distance of a lot of attractions, and the room featured a kitchen and really nice TV. 
23730 right in the middle of times square,great location,clean and tidy ,would go back 
23731 I enjoyed staying at the Allerton. The location is fantastic! While my room wasn't the biggest, it was definitely sufficient, clean and confortable. I would recommend the Allerton and would stay there again. 
23732 Staff very friendly, great location. We stayed there hoping to find a place for us to stay in Houston as we travel there frequently. After our visit, we will stay here again 
23733 The best location ever!!!!! Right in the heart of Times Square!!!....Good size room with great views!! 
23734 The situation of Hotel Carter is very good, it is near the Times Squares and Broadway Ave. It is the second time that I reserve my holidays with Galahotels and I am very happy , satisfied and I recomend them.Thank you very much.See you in my next travel. 
23735 this hotel is excelent, great staff, clean, free wifi and modern... located in a nice area (i am done with the upper east side)... highly recommend 
23736 The rooftop lounge is open and comfortable with great views of midtown and the Hudson. Rooms on the upper floors have huge windows with wonderful views. Lobby is chic. Staff are very accommodating. Excellent restaurant on site. 
23737 stanze piccole e accoglienti, avevamo il bagno in comune, ma era sempre pulito e c'era anche la musica di sottofondo! l'ambiente in generale era accogliente e i receptionist molto disponibili 
23738 Best place to stay and be close to downtown. Blocks from the major shopping centers and best food. 
23739 Right in the heart of manhattan.Directly facing madison Square garden Minutes from empire state building,Times square etc .Tgi Fridays opp hotel hotel was rooms basic but you can upgrade if needed staff are a credit to owners .Can say enough good stuff 
23740 We had lovely stay here location is great room is lovely modern big for being new york. Definitely will be going back here staff were excellent especially kirk. Only stayed 4 nights wish it was longer. 
23741 Hotel and staff were great. Rooms on Dearborn St side get lots of traffic noise. Was so loud I thought the window was open. To top it off the bed springs were so creaky I couldn't roll over without waking myself up. 
23742 Stayed here before but hubby hadn't. We had a corner room with a view of Times Square. Room was quiet, cool and clean. Used the gym which was good, used the bar area which was fine. Location was straight onto Times Square. Would stay here again when staying in NYC. 
23743 I had a small room- really tiny with no view. The sound- proofing left something to be desired, as well. Location is excellent. Room service was good. For the price, however, I Can rate This hotel only average. 
23744 This hotel was perfect for me as hotels in NYC can often be insanely expensive. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The hotel was within walking distance to Times Square and Central Park. A definite must stay to those cost conscious visitors to Manhattan. 
23745 This small hotel is clean, roomy, well maintained, good staff and free breakfast. You can't beat it for the price in NYC. It is in Chinatown/Little Italy. 
23746 Stayed for two nights the hotel and enjoyed the experience. Friendly and helpful staff, nicely furnished room, and fantastic location. You can't beat it for the value. Will definitely stay there again. 
23747 Great location, friendly and extremely helpful staff. Great breakfast every morning to start the day. I will recommend this hotel to all my friends and work colleagues. Hoping to return to NYC next year, so would definitely choose this hotel again. Doormen very helpful and friendly, especially Richard! 
23748 We spent two days at the Belvedere and the hotel was very clean and staff polite. Our room on the 4th floor was otherwise good but the street noise was really disturbing during the nights. Also when it was cold outside it was really windy inside as well. 
23749 My experience with the Houston Doubletree hotel is more than a casual business, the staff treats me like an extended family. They are all professional and provide a service that I LOVE. Thanks and continue to be Great. - Carl Busby 
23750 Waldorf Astoria light, aber nicht billig (wie fast alle Hotels in NY) 
23751 Nice employees, but I had an absolutely horrible room - noisy, and odorous. The "bricks and mortar" part of the hotel needs work. The room rate was very low, so I guess that you get what you pay for. 
23752 Un poco descuidado y la atenci'on muy mala, sobretodo de los Bell Boy y de la persona del parking... mientras cargabamos las maletas para retirarnos nos trat'o muy mal, no entiende que es un servicio??? 
23753 First off, perfect location, right next to Times Sq. Rooms are reasonable small, but this was a good thing. They are done up really nicely, and are really comfortable. Bathrooms are excellent, brilliant showers. Only downside was the lack of a decent window... 
23754 Valerie was amazingly helpful. We had several family members and friends stay and the wedding couple had a suite which was amazing. We all enjoyed breakfast the next morning with vouchers provided and the food was great. The beds were wonderful and everyone helpful. 
23755 The front desk was very courteous and helpful. The room was very clean and spacious, with nice touches. The rates seemed reasonable until you pay for parking and the Internet. That is my only complaint. I would still go back, but know the extra charges. 
23756 No help with luggage. Very small lobby and no assistance from staff with anything. Crudo's restaurant has extremely rude people - Don't go there. The hotel is mediocre at its best. The room was not horrible but not great. For $300 night, I can do better and will next time. 
23757 will never forget the days we've spent in N.Y.Palace. Promise to be back. 
23758 I know well how pricy Manhattan is but 360 for a steamy room with no thermostat is a rip off. Cant imsgine being here in the summer. Clean at least...... And pretty quiet. Television works though channel selection is limited. Room service ends at ten o'clock 
23759 I would 100% recon my family and friends to stay that hotel....It's new fresh and quality of room are execellent... One night went to sister hotel Gansevoor in Meatpacking Market....what a food.... I love this hotel...will plan next year again...with family... 
23760 We really enjoyed this hotel. The location was great, the staff pleasant, the rooms very nice--Very decent size for New York. We will stay there again and would recommend it without hesitation. 
23761 Stayed for two nights at Easter and found the hotel to be ideal in terms of location, price and atmosphere. Room was very well designed and put together. Flat Screen TV, free WiFi and ipod docking station are nice touches! 
23762 Die Lage des Hotels ist sehr zentral, es ist jedoch renovierungsbeduerftig. Die Zimmer sind winzig und wirken schmuddelig. Man hat ausserdem keine Aussicht, ausser man erwischt ein Zimmer zur Strasse. Das Fruehstueck (Extra zu bezahlen) ist ganz okay. 
23763 Great Service, Great Location, Great Price Clean and free 24hr coffee The breakfast muffins are awesome! Cocktails on the terrace are a must! You can walk to restaurants, theatres and Central Park Would stay there again, definitely 
23764 Hotel carter location 250 west 43rd street- new york city date 12-5-2008 rented 2 rooms would not recomend this hotel to nobary hotel very duty, costmers services very poor, not even 4 free i would not stay there thanks 
23765 The hotel was great. Room service (Ali) was great. Great food. Henry at the front desk was great also. 
23766 situato in punto strategico di N.Y. vicinissimo a times square ma nello stesso tempo isolato dal caos della medesima,la sola pecca che trovo e' la colazione .....iper cara , e dopo cosumata devi scendere al bar a consumarne una vera.... 
23767 It is in the heart of NYC. Almost every room sees Empire State. Easy access to everywhere. Service, beds and breakfast perfect. You get the best for the value. Try booked.net I got a good offer including breakfast compared to NYC hotels. Best choice for NYC, don't search for others. 
23768 Fair enough, for the money. Great neighborhood, and good-sized room, with AC. Not spotless, and you might not want to wait ... and wait... for the elevator. But I've paid more money for a lot less room in NYC. 
23769 It is a beautiful hotel with an amazing room and very kind staff. You will be very happy coming back to the hotel (tired) and finding cookies or brownies waiting for you! It is not near Broadway or anyting, but the subway is 2 blocks away. 
23770 My husband and I stayed at this hotel in August 2011 for our "babymoon" and had a wonderful stay for 5 days. The staff were helpful, beds comfortable and the breakfast that was included exceeded our expectations. It was also conveniently close to everything. I would definitely stay again. 
23771 I was there for CGI and had a suite. It was nearly as perfect as it could be. The suite was positioned according to our wishes because of the meetings that needed to occur. Thank you, Sheraton, for doing such a good job! 
23772 What a nice surprise. Down pillows, hip furnishings, all the help you could ask for with bags and cabs, and even an iPod-compliant clock radio. There are a million hotels in NYC, and many call themselves 'boutiques.' 70 Park, a great location to anywhere, truly is. 
23773 Good value, except the wine list which is really expensive. Efficient business hotel. 
23774 Konum olarak cok iyi bir secim yapmisiz.Temiz bir otel. Odalar 3kisi kalindiginda buyuk degil, arka cephede kalindiginda fancoil cihazlarinin sesi cok cok rahatsiz ediyor. Lobisi buyuk degil.Ancak yine de memnun kaldik. 
23775 First time for this hotel. 4 days. I for work and my wife for shopping. Excellent basic hotel. Rooms not large but normal for NY. Nice location, modern, clean, quiet, everything worked, very cold A/C, good breakfast - nothing fancy, very friendly and helpful staff. No complaints. 
23776 The staff are awesome. Lovely people from start to finish. Great location and nice, clean rooms. What else can you ask for? 
23777 Clean, friendly, large room, very accomodating when we were stranded because od the hurricane. Very comfortable withe fantastic views and central location Highly recommended! 
23778 Clean, great location, friendly staff, reasonable priced. Highly recommended. 
23779 The check in was a little slow, but firmly and helpful staff. Concierge got NE a discount in a cab to town and gave me a coupon for reduced cover charge at Kinston Mines blues club Smoking room was smelly, more so than most Breakfast was good, but pricey 
23780 I had a great experience with this hotel. Everyone has been so nice and treated me awesome. I loved EDNA and CAROL. Keep up the good work!!! 
23781 Nice hotel. Excellent location, nice staff and small but clean rooms (nothing creeping, though everybody in NYC was talking about the bedbugs :). Better than we expected. 
23782 the rooms are small, and the service average. Room amenities are excellent. 
23783 We stayed two nights here, and it was great, Perfect, perfect Time Square location, great service, they even have door men... The bar tender Rudy, added the finishing touches to our NY experience, We would now call him our friend from brooklyn! The true boutique Hotel experience.. Rob Popham 
23784 i don't get how this is rated a 4-star hotel. i had an old, dusty room with an old bathroom, wallpaper literally peeling of some of the walls. Yes a new TV and bright new sheets but it feels like putting lipstick on a pig! yes definitely great location. 
23785 The Sofitel in NYC is very well located, close to Times Square, 5th Avenue, etc, in a relatively quiet street. The service is excellent and the price is affordable considering it is NYC. 
23786 We liked this hotel a lot. It's comfortable, clean, great bed...adequate amount of room, fair price for NY...and all around great recommendation. Friendly stafff, accomodating in every way. Would stay there again. 
23787 I'm not sure why this place gets negative reviews. This place has it all: great location, comfy rooms and fantastic service. A short walk to public transportation, great restaurants and entertainment options. Stay here. You will not be disappointed! 
23788 What a bargain. Great central location and our room with a king bed was enormous! Would definitely stay here again. 
23789 My husband and I stayed here last February. We had a great experience. This hotel is very clean, quiet and has a romantic feel. It is in the heart of Times Square. I would stay here again. 
23790 We stayed in the King suite, the room was absolutely fantastic, large and spacious, spanning the width of the entire hotel. You couldn't ask for a better view, a full 180+ degree vista of the Hudson. 
23791 A great hotel for the price in NYC - especially if coming with kids b/ the double rooms are huge and all rooms have a kitchen. Staff is extremely helpful as well. 
23792 Great little hotel on the trendy side. Staff very accomodating and friendly. Now that I have stayed at this Starwood brand, I will probably seek out other aLoft hotels in others cities that I travel to. 
23793 Wonderful hotel location for weekend of sightseeing and evening at the theater. Very clean hotel, friendly staff, firm bedding and enjoyed the NY bagel breakfast. Convenient parking garage. Would return. 
23794 Just back from a 2 night stay at San Carlos hotel in one bedroom suite ,great experience , staff friendly ,offered late check out free of charge,can't understand the moans about breakfast its included in rate it was a good bonus 
23795 Nice hotel, we had a delux queen so a big room for nyc. Staff ok, nothing toi write home about. Would stay again for the price ($229.00) 
23796 Just returned from 5 nights in a 2 bed apartment suite in this hotel. Excellent value for money, several websites quote an inclusive tax rate. Clean, excellent kitchen and comfortable bathroom, 2 great queen size bedrooms and sofa in lounge, excellent for groups or families travelling together. 
23797 Loved this little gem of a hotel. Art Deco design, clean, extremely pleasant and helpful staff. Great location. Bed comfortable. Small and intimate bar in the lobby. Quiet boutique hotel. Missing was a coffeemaker in the room. Will return. 
23798 The Intercontinental has some beautiful function rooms and a great location, but the rooms are very small and they charge extra for everything. Internet service was $17.95. In addition, the staff is less helpful than ideal. In addition, the common rooms were cold! 
23799 In the Houston area for business. Stayed twice at this property recently. May 2007 and August 2007. Close to Hobby Airport. Complimentary airport shuttle. Rooms are nice and large with adequate lighting and work space. Small fitness center. Nice small hot buffet breakfast. Clean property. Will definitely stay again. 
23800 This is a decent accommodation in Manhattan, not luxury, yet well positioned to walk to Times Square. Tiny rooms, clean. Common areas need better maintenance. Overall recommended, if priced right. Staff member very friendly and welcoming. 
23801 The room was pretty nice for the price. However, the staff was very attentive to our needs. In particular, one staff person, Josephina DeLuna was particulary helpful. Great hotel and I would visit again. 
23802 From the moment I arrived I felt welcomed especially after the reception person thanked me for returning. Everything works in the rooms and they are ALWAYS clean. I really really love staying in this hotel. 
23803 One of the cheaper hotels in Times Square. I visited on a study trip with my university. Had a few problems with getting new bath towels and had to change rooms twice. 
23804 Have found Affinia hotels in NYC to be a great deal. Clean, sophisticated boutique type hotels with comfy beds and cozy places to dine. Well situated wth great personal service. 
23805 Stayed 5 nights in the Wellington Hotel in NY, fantastic location, very near Times Square and Central Park, very clean hotel and staff were very friendly and helpful, would recomend this hotel. 
23806 Stayed here for 5 nights. Room was clean, good bedding package and towels. Best rate at the time in the Hobby area for a 3 star. 
23807 I stayed at the Affinia 50 for a "girls" weekend away and thought it was a great little find. The staff was friendly, the location was good, rooms clean and a relatively good size for NYC. I would definitely stay there again! 
23808 I found the service at this property outstanding. The front desk team, bellmen and managers were very attentive and accommodating to my needs. This was truly a wonderful New York experience. 
23809 Estuvimos alojados de viaje de novios,siete dias ,excelente todo,servicio,limpieza,personal,habitaciones,camas amplias ,toda la habitacion con domotica,estupendo,muy centrico al lado de central park,hotel plaza,metro,,,,, Un hotel para recomendar a todo el mundo con un cierto poder adquisitivo porque barato no es,,,, 
23810 Not cheap, but the location is great, rooms are very comfortable and service excellent. Probably trying a bit too hard to be trendy though - the lobby bar needs more seating and fewer disco lights! 
23811 Great location, nice rooms and much bigger than I thought they would be, clean comfy and quiet, everything you want in a hotel. Front desk staff pretty grumpy but otherwise nice. 
23812 This hotel is in the perfect location and is comfortable and welcoming. If I was to return to NYC I would stay here again. Only one small complaint, the air conditioning/heating in our room was pretty noisy! 
23813 Love NYC, love this hotel. We were one floor below the Presidential Suite and had the most fantastic views over Manhattan. 
23814 Wij waren tijdens onze vakantie in New York op zoek naar een plek waar we lekker konden uitrusten na een dag lang op pad te zijn geweest. Dit hotel voldeed perfect aan deze criteria. Grote kamer, voldoende uitgeruste keuken, goed bed en lekker rustig. 
23815 chose this from tripadvisor reviews and was not disappointed. GREAT location. small, quiet, clean and modern hotel. Just the basics, delivered well. 
23816 We recently stayed at this hotel, and found it to be very pleasant- clean, convenient, and a very congenial staff, particularly Marcela Majia, a front desk person. Marty and Dinah. 
23817 Upfsted rooms are a bit overdone but clean and spacious for NYC. Restaurant currently closed and restaurants close by are limited. A bit pricey but good location. 
23818 Een ietwat gedateerd hotel. We hadden een niet al te grote, heel rustige, kamer, maar naar volle tevredenheid. Enige nadeel was dat we geen buitenlucht konden zien vanuit de kamer en dus helmaal niet wisten wat voor weer het was.( trui mee/ regenjack aan??) 
23819 Everything about this hotel is first rate. If you're lucky enough to get a room with a Central Park view, the experience is sublime. We'll never stay anywhere else in New York City now that we've stayed at the Le Parker Meridien. 
23820 Appena arrivato ho provato i brivi, la muffa nel bagno,polvere da'ppertutto; davvero orrendo 
23821 two minutes on foot from times square, could'nt have asked for better. rooms are basic enough but spending approx 5 hours there,that was all we needed.great cafe and bar in the lobby area, just right at the end of a busy day.good value for money. 
23822 We hade a great stay at Fashion 26. Nice sized roomes, friendly staff, nice bar and good location, close to everything. 
23823 I usually dont give reviews but my company Pensicloa Express has stayed here and they have provided exceleent service to me and my crew members. It was a very delightful saty. I am coming back, would recommend to everyone. 
23824 hotel valido solo per la posizione strategica vicino a times square.. sporco, caldo e rumoroso... da prendere in considerazione solo se disperati... 
23825 Booked into Comfort Inn Manhattan primarily because of location and fact that they offered B & B.. Excellent location, helpful friendly reception, breakfast being included was bonus. Would stay there again 
23826 This is a standard central NY hotel. Good standards of service, cleanliness and quality but expensive. Excellent location. 
23827 Situato nel cuore di Time Square, nelle vicinanze della metro, questo tre stelle e' davvero un gioiellino, ottimi servizi, tra cui un wifi libero ben funzionante, buona anche la colazione e il rapporto qualita'/prezzo. 
23828 We had a lovely stay at The Benjamin. Our room was beautiful and spotless. I especially want to thank Khady Faye at the reception desk for her hospitality and generosity. We will definitely come back. 
23829 Beautiful old hotel. Small but well appointed room. Bathroom was very nice. It was very cold and snowy outside but warm and friendly inside. They were helpful and it was always a nice place to come back to. 
23830 A warm welcome, easy check-in (no extra fee for early check-in was a pleasant surprise), a clean, compact, and cool cabin, exceptional service, all contributed to a comfortable weekend stay! 
23831 The hotel experience was good, but the dining experience at the restaurant was out of this world! I recommend the Seafood Plateau and the signature Chicken dish - brilliant! The hotel rooms were well appointed and the service in the hotel overall very engaged and friendly. 
23832 Had a great experience at the Allerton Hotel Chicago. Rooms were superb, staff was courteous and location was perfect. Attended a small meeting where the food was extremely good. Would definitely recommend this hotel and will go back. 
23833 What a pleasant surprise to a priceline booking. Great hotel, location, staff, etc. We didn't get to try the Mercat restaurant, but the little cafe on the lower level had great drinks and outdoor seating. Definitely recommend and will be returning next time we are in Chicago. 
23834 Central location, mid Manhattan, two blocks from Central Park. Subway entrance just outside. Dated and small room, but clean enough. Don't forget earplugs, the traffic in NY is neverending... 
23835 Great location! Room was comfortable but small, but we were hardly in it except to sleep! Share bathroom was always clean and never had to wait! Would stay here again! 
23836 This was a very good hotel, just off Broadway. Super bedrooms, very clean. Hotel staff were exceptional, notably Mari on the front desk and Sari the bellman. Many different restaurants within walking distance and very close to subway at 79th Street to get to the centre within minutes. 
23837 Great place to stay in New York, with large rooms and a kitchenette which is handy with the kids. There two bedroom suits are perfect for families visiting New York. 
23838 Lounge has one great view of Times Square. Rooms are modern and very well designed and moderately spacious. Rooms look out on side streets. 
23839 this is one of the best hotels in NYC. great experience. prices accordingly... 
23840 Everything was excellent. We stayed for 6 nights. Breakfast was great, a lot of different kind of food. It started at 6 am, witch is good if you have early flight or intend to go on a trip. Everyone were very kind. We'll definitely coming back. 
23841 Very central hotel in New York - close to shopping, restaurant (Restaurant Row with good dinning possibilities) and Times Square. The hotel is a little worn, included breakfast is non existing, the service is okay but everything is compensated by good location. New York - a fantastic experience 
23842 We enjoyed a wonderful weekend at the Mercer! This was my 3rd visit in the last 8 months, this time for a romantic getaway with my husband. Service was excellent, atmosphere was relaxing, and the food was delicious. Completely worth the expense as the Mercer is consistently wonderful! 
23843 Hotellet ar belaget alldeles vid Hancock och har ett toppenlage. Nara till Magnificent Mile, centrum, ja det mesta man vill se i Chicago. Stora, rena rum, bra service. Flera frukostrestauranger i narheten. Prova garna ocksa The Cheescake Factory som ligger alldeles i narheten! 
23844 If you want to feel like you are living in New York this is a great neighborhood. Hotel is worn but clean and rooms are good size. We will stay again. 
23845 Bonne adresse pour sejourner a New York. Nous avions reserve la Chambre standard qui etait vraiment grande. Seul hic, le bruit de la circulation et encore on etait au dernier etage. 
23846 Just a few blocks from Times Square, yet away from the noise. The staff is very good and shows genuine care. Will go back there again.. 
23847 My husband and I stayed in a room with a king size bed. It was QUIET, comfortable and in a very good location. We walked everywhere from the hotel. We will be going back. 
23848 very good hotel , friendly personel, nice beds, big roomwe stayed over Xmas holidays , and got a $70 rate for a room that would in NY cost 140, it was a great bargain 
23849 I would recommend this hotel. No luxury, but a great deal for NYC standards, conveniently located, and quiet. Suites with a living room and a bedroom, microwave and refrigerator. One disadvantage was a lack of a restaurant in the hotel, but there are plenty around. 
23850 If you want it to experence new york at its best this is your place everything is within walking distance. ive allready booked my next vist! 
23851 Stayed on points; rooms were clean, large, and modern. Bed was sizable and comfortable. Hotel is centrally located. Staff was efficient and polite. Lobby is pretty spectacular looking. Elevators a bit odd--two banks side-by-side required separate button presses. Did not use fitness center or restaurants. All around good experience. 
23852 The location is excellent. I will look forward to staying again when the upgrades on the outside are finished as the scaffording on the outside was a little distracting. Of course, it can't be helped and did not affect the inside. 
23853 I was very impressed with the service during my recent stay at the W Hotel in Manhattan. The Whenever Whatever service is great, always willing and able to assist. But most impressive was Nadia Ahmed at front desk, very friendly, helpful and going the extra mile! 
23854 Very central location off Michigan Avenue, near shopping and restaurants and 5 min to nearest train station. 
23855 Although the rooms are a little dated, I suppose thats part of its charm. Staff were nice, place was clean, its got the history to boot. I went there with my fiancee and we really enjoyed our stay. No complaints. 
23856 Hands down the BEST property to stay at in NYC for your money. From an industry professional trust me this hotel is IT!! 
23857 This property is Chicago class and style at its best. The history and comfort make this place a destination hotel for business travellers. I have stayed here many times in the past and plan to be here many in the future. Rooms are comfortable and the staff professional. 
23858 It's basically a hotel room with an old bed where they've shoved a refrigerator and a dilapidated stove. It was kind of pricey, too, but it is the upper west side. 
23859 Although I was there for just one night, I would definitely return on my next trip to Chicago. The hotel rooms are very comfortable and the lobby bar has a good looking crowd. Free coffee and bagels in the lobby for breakfast. Great veiw of the Lake. 
23860 The staff was helpful and nice. The room was a very good size, much better then expected. The room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. The location was just perfect for everything! This was a great place to stay, will defiantly go back! 
23861 The service was great and very convenient 
23862 I would recommend sun suites extended stay to other friends near by as well. 
23863 I stayed here only for one night and my friend booked the room. The room is clean and the bed is comfortable. Not that noisy as other reviewers said. At least I had a good sleep. 
23864 We spend almost a week in the Roosevelt Hotel, the location is perfect just in front of the biggest metro station I have ever see Grand Station. Walking distance to Broadway and Time Square. The lobby is impresive and the service could not be better. 
23865 Large bland hotel but spacious rooms and friendly staff. Quiet and in an excellent location. Good conference facilities and excellent rates. All in all excellent value and a safe choice without being a memorable experience 
23866 Great location, 2 minutes from Grand Central Terminal, within short walking distance of Fifth Avenue, etc. Very traditional, guests and staff are mostly Japanese. Clean, comfortable, great jazz bar, service is unobtrusive, carried out quietly and efficiently. Would definitely return on another visit. 
23867 I had a sweet experience at Westin.. Pros & Cons: Pros: Great location Neat rooms Movie theater inside the hotel! Cons: A bit expensive Business lounge (for internet) closes at 10:00pm Cheap breakfast 
23868 Just a quick business trip (1 day), but the staff was friendly and helpful and the location great. Room was spacious with a good desk and comfortable bed and sitting area. Would definitely stay again. 
23869 Hotel was a grea price for such a good location, situated just off times square it's within walking distaneof everything, staff were extremely friendly and helpful, room was modern and the bathroom was a great size. Defiantly would stay again 
23870 Relly nice hotel, very comfortable and very clean room. Excellent location, right in the centre of Manhattan. Would recommend to anyone travelling to NYC. 
23871 The best place to stay in new york city. It is like being in your own home. Location , Location Location 
23872 This is a unique hotel with top flight amenities in a great neighborhood. It's not cheap, but it was worth every penny. 
23873 I have stayed at this hotel on several occasions over the past 2 years and have never had an unpleasant experience. I have found the staff here to go above and beyond my expectations time and time again. I won't look anywhere else! 
23874 The rooms were small,very dirty. The restaurant that was in hotel staff was very rude to us. Wouldn't go back there again. 
23875 Just of time square, Spacious rooms in need of revamp. Poor bathroom with problems water evacuation 
23876 Common space lacks any character and is very gloomy. One exception... modern, well equiped and airy fitness. Below par, unfriendly staff! 
23877 Dopo aver letto tante recensioni prima della partenza ora posso dare la mia. Albergo veramente bello!!! Personale molto gentile, camere grandi, pulite, con una vista impagabile ed un letto super comodo. Posizionato a 10 minuti a piedi dalla Central Station. Lo raccomando a tutti! 
23878 Hotel un po ' datato ma ottima la posizione, vicino a Times Square, staff gentilissimo, colazione abbondante in un contesto semplice ed informale. Le camera era grande e confortevole. Letto king size stupendo! 
23879 l albergo e carinissimo molto cool arredato in modo esemplare, aperitivo nella hall e in terrazza eccellenti ma le stanze sono piccolissime...per non parlare del bagno...non valgano quel prezzo.....................................................................................................!!!!!!!!!! 
23880 For this to be my first boutique style hotel i loved it 
23881 From the Front desk staff.to everything about the hotel so clean and quiet...great location will be back soon. 
23882 The hotel room was kind of small and not very fancy but the staff was friendly, the room was clean, the price was great, and the location is fantastic. I really enjoyed my stay there. 
23883 Stayed 5 nights at the NYMA hotel on W. 32nd St. in Manhattan, NY. The hotel rooms were kept very clean and the hotel staff were helpful and friendly. A nice breakfast was offered daily and the hotel is conveniently located three blocks from Penn Station. 
23884 The Westin is in a great location, convenient to theaters, shopping, and restaurants. The rooms are a nice size by NYC standards, and the staff was helpful. 
23885 I expected alot more from this hotel, but it was in a great location. Next to shopping, food, and subway. 
23886 I stayed here when it was a Red Roof Inn and it was great. It is even better now. It is clean and quiet and the location is great! 
23887 Great value for a clean well-located hotel. Friendly, helpful staff. The antique elevator was a fun experience. Very good location, close to restaurants, subway and attractions. We chose this hotel for the value, and it certainly exceeded our expectations. 
23888 I was with my family for 4 nights and enjoyed being at the hotel. The neighborhood is very nice, the suite room is big and clean, the people at the reservation and the reception are very helpful and kind. I recommend :-) 
23889 Most of the reviews were correct...this had to be the dirtiest hotel in the United States! The bathrooms were old, out-dated, dirty and just down-right disgusting. If you just want a place to lay down, cross the street and stay at Penn Station...it's cleaner. 
23890 Booked through American Express platinum paid for two days one night free,upgraded to suite,free breakfast, 100 dollar spa credit,minor problem with bed within five minutes was given a bottle of wine., great lunch for 24 dollars best lunch in NYC at Jean George 
23891 It was worth every penny. We had a great time. Love the small size desserts. That way I didn't feel too guilty 
23892 I complained to the staff that I could not sleep at night because of the noise that going on outside. They did not do anything about it. I found that very rude but the hotel itself was very nice. Hope you get better staff. 
23893 Very kind and friendly manager who showed us the room before booking. He made our stay very good. Clean room. Breakfast simply, but okay. I'd stay here again. 
23894 really and excellent experience. Good value at the price negotiated 
23895 This unpretentious but comfortable, good quality hotel is brilliantly located for manhattan visits. The beds are comfortable & the rooms clean and bigger than some in NYC! The staff are friendly and helpful, especially the door staff. We didn't eat there- but the bars look great. V busy. 
23896 ...the rooms are very nice with amazingly comfortable beds. 
23897 Normal places I stay were booked up. This place is pretty blah. Bathroom was remodeled but paint peeling in room. Bed was ok. Cab service out front was poor. Kinda like a maze to find your room. Would likely not stay here again 
23898 Great 3 night stay in a junior suite. Plenty of room for my daughter and I plus my brother and his two kids. Friendly staff and pool with a view! Very clean. My only small complaint is that there isnt a coffee maker in the room. 
23899 We took the train in from D.C. so the location to Penn Station was great. We walked the 3-4 blocks. Rooms are nice, and average size for NYC. Staff was helpful and friendly. Convenient to the Metro Subway so getting around was piece of cake. 
23900 I booked a room for my father as part of a weekend 75th birthday party. The hotel staff did a great job providing us a room with a great view. The staff were friendly and responsive. My father loved his stay. 
23901 I went into NYC for My Birthday on 7/14-7/15. WOW We got an excellent rate, and were warmly Greeted by Chris from the Management team. More to follow 
23902 The only complaint is the one, slow, small elevator that can take some time to get to you, especially if you are on the 8th floor (one floor below penthouse). Other than that, all the positive reviews here are accurate. 
23903 Slightly bland hotel, very big but very clean, nice rooms. Excellent location - couldn't better it. lots of places to eat in or get take out from nearby. Went to Juniors for breakfast (opp on side street) and Carlinis - excellent italian family style service/portions. 
23904 L'HOTEL E' STATO DAVVERO BUONO: SERVIZIO VELOCE E PRECISO, CAMERE BEN PULITE, POSIZIONE STRATEGICA A CINQUE MINUTI A PIEDI DA CENTRAL PARK E A POCHI MINUTI DALLA 5TH AVE. UNICA PECCA: LA CAMERA UN PO' PICCOLA. 
23905 Convenient hotel located right on Broadway and in easy walking distance to time square, the Rockefeller Center and Empire State Building. Nice rooms and excellent customer service by the front desk and the bell boy. Unfortunately we did not have time to visit the restaurant. 
23906 Excellent hotel just south of the Chicago Loop. Updated rooms with space and room to enjoy. Front desk hotel staff are excellent and were a total joy to interact with. On site food selections give a good variety for small budgets or large. 
23907 This should be one of the best hotels in NY, but unfortunately it was a bit disappointing. It took very long to check in and the service was not too good. Room was very nice, the bathroom however very outdated. 
23908 My wife and I stayed there for one night in mid March, room 464. In a prior review someone mentioned cockroaches in the ceiling... Well imagine discovering an inch-and-a half cockroach amidst your bed sheets, after you slept in that bed all night - Yuck. This place sucks! 
23909 Room was very clean and recently updated with a modern, bright, design. New flat screen TVs and comfortable beds. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Free breakfast had plenty of variety. Loved that the hotel is smoke free. Would definitely stay again! 
23910 The location is perfect, half a block away from times Square! The hotel is average, not bad, but just a nice normal place to sleep in NY. 
23911 Great location (walking distance to Times Square & Central Park) But the hotel is preety old and dirty as we had Cockroaches in our room ! Definitely not pleasant to find these 1.5inch long Cockroaches in your room. 
23912 As always I had an excellent stay for my overnight trip to the city. The service, linens, robe, etc was all great. Even the space, while small was very spacious and the furniture made it seem bigger than my condo! 
23913 This hotel was much better than expected, they have theire own ticket desk, and information to all the sites in Manhattan. So easy, so great! The room was large and luxurios. We could not had an better shopping weekend! 
23914 We really enjoyed our stay here...they upgraded our room and sent us wine and cheese! Great Service! 
23915 This hotel was amazing, the staff were very helpful and the decor and the quality of the room was second to none. The location was perfect and so is the price, this hotel gives you much more for your dollar then anywhere else. The service is excellent! 
23916 My trip was one night only- However this Holiday Inn had the nicest and newest rooms I have ever seen. Of course the service in TX is always warm and great! Good place to stay in town. 
23917 If you want to be in best location and have lots of room - this is the place to be! We had a pleasant stay. 
23918 The hotel was great. Room was spacious and clean. Nice big comfortable bed, fantastic shower. Very courteous staff. Location is phenomenal with much in walking distance, and the rest an easy metro ride, including to the airport. 
23919 Room was clean and big, good view (21st floor,corner-room). Staff was ok, but could be little more kind/friendly. First 2nights was little too cold and keycard did not work at two times (have to go reception and change). Good hotel, great location, maybe a little bit too expencive tought. 
23920 El hotel cumple con lo que ofrece, algo antiguo pero muy limpio, las habitaciones son amplias y comodas para ser New York. El desayuno por USD6 p/pax es muy razonable para lo que ofrecen. El personal es muy amable, servicial y atento, especialmente los Botones. 
23921 Great styling, all black&white, with a wonderful carpet and even sexy neon lights under the bed! The wifi unfortunately costs 10$/day. The breakfast was okay, orange juice, muffin, cornflakes and a croissant. 
23922 Had mixed feelings about this hotel at first but was very impressed. Stayed there for 7 nights, great room, perfect location. The staff were very friendly especially Saleem at reception, always so helpful. Will definitely stay there again! 
23923 Great place. Cool and chilled, fantastic location 200m from the subway and within walking distance of many attractions. Friendly staff, very comfortable bed (I'm 6ft 6!), small but cosy room and fabulous price. Highly recommended. 
23924 Ottima posizione a due passi da Times Square.Hotel moderno con una Hall accogliente.La camera assegnataci anche se piccola era dotata di tutti i confort, molto pulita e con un grande letto comodo con diversi cuscini.Ottiimo anche il bagno con arredi moderni e dotato di vari accessori.Personale gentile e professionale 
23925 This hotel was perfect- clean and convenient. I booked it last minute and it worked out so well!!! I paid less than the group that I met who were economizing and staying in Brooklyn!! Gladys at the reception desk was terrific!!! 
23926 Stayed at the Affinia Manhatten, An excellent friendly hotel in the perfect location to get to all the great sites. Directly opposite Madison Square Garden, one block away from Macy's and about 10 minutes walk from Times Square. I cannot wait to go back! 
23927 very nice stay, the staff was very friendly, rooms clean, bed was very comfortable.. this hotel is within walking distance of a lot of places. would definately stay again. 
23928 A great hotel with a perfect location. Staff was prompt and courteous. Room was large and very clean. Bed was like sleeping on a cloud. I honestly could not be happier with my stay and this will definitely be my first choice in the future. 
23929 hotel was clean, staff was considerate, maybe an earlier check-in would be nice. room was small but clean, and quiet for sleeping...thanks GEM 
23930 Without doubt the best hotel i have stayed in a city. Clean well furnished, great bed, great food and wonderful environment. Outdoor pool and gym. Coffee machine in room too!!! Could not find fault. Lovelly breakfast too. 
23931 I was worried about staying in Times Square NY because of the noise in the area. It was a very clean and quiet hotel. The staff were very helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel! 
23932 Fun location to explore Chinatown and Lower East Side. Traveling alone and never felt unsafe, stayed 2/26-2/28. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. I booked a loft room which was clean and comfortable and had an amazing view of the Manhattan Bridge. Very good value. 
23933 This really is an excellent hotel, brand new hotel, decorated rooms, really clean room and bathroom, excellent staff. The location is great, next to the metro and short walking distance to times square. 
23934 We loved it! The staff was wonderful and very attentive. The room was spatious, clean, and very comfortable. It was a fantastic stay! 
23935 Great location for this hotel. Better yet - the service and attitude of all the associates at the hotel. From the check-in to the housekeepers - everyone had a smile and all were focused on the guest. I would highly recommend this hotel based on location, value and service. 
23936 We spent five nights at the WJ and would stay there again in a heartbeat. Friendly staff, clean room, outstanding location, quiet yet close to everything. 
23937 I went there for a 4 day conference and loved it. I travel 50% of the time in my job, usually 3-4 star hotels. The location is great, there is a wonderful sushi bar in the lobby, the bartenders were friendly. I would definitely go there again. 
23938 Loved everything about this hotel. Just down the street from the Empire State Building, 5 minutes to Macys, superb view of Chrysler Building. Fantastic spacious suites. Can't wait to stay there again 
23939 Great location on 8th Avenue near Times Square and many Broadway theatres. Good, friendly service in general and good advice on NYC from hospitality desk. Our room (2 Queen beds) was spacious and comfortable. 
23940 This hotel was an absolute nightmare. Worn and old furnishings with poor housekeeping. When we complained to the General manager Joe C, he was arrogant and rude!! He just brushed us of like we were bothering him. Save your money and stay somewhere else. It's the pitts. 
23941 We stayed here during the Christmas season and was excellent, and understated elegance. The hotel is a nicer than normal Marriott, but I wish it was one block further towards 5th ave. Overall this was a nice hotel, but had small rooms. 
23942 Clean, breakfast was good, overall good value. Would stay there again. A little difficult to get to from the Parkway. 
23943 Very well placed (two bloks from Pen Station), 2km Times Square nice place, simple and clean. 
23944 Terrible stay. Loud, tiny room. Incredibly overpriced. 
23945 As always with Hampton Inns, clean simple and comfortable. Fantastic staff. In between Times square and Central Park and near a subway stop. Breakfast is the usual so-so at Hampton Inns but filling and adequate - and included 
23946 l'hotel e' molto pulito,la zona non e' delle migliori ma a 10' c'e Time Square e si puo percorrere questo tratto della Broadway tranquillamente anche di notte 
23947 We stayed at Affinia Gardens because we were traveling with our dog and needed an inexpensive place to stay for an early flight out of JFK. Affinia is perfect for families as it has small equipped kitchen and the location is central! 
23948 Made to order omelets, orange french toast...fresh juices! The buffet looked yummy! 
23949 in un albergo luccicoso.... elegante, pulito e comodo per muoversi a piedi evisitare la city 
23950 Good location but not cheap. Pet hate of charging an extra 14 dollars for wifi a day is rather ridiculous after forking out 1k over three days. Can't say I'd recommend as there are far nicer places around with character and better service. 
23951 Great location, close to times square but just far enough to not be busy right outside. Odd lobby system, you walk into an empty area and then must take an elevator 20 floors up to main lobby. Great room. 
23952 The room and bathroom had nice, new fixtures and furniture. High ceilings, wood paneling. Good location. Only downside was a noisy, hot radiator at the head of the bed. Was there during blizzard and hotel was very accommodating with letting us extend our stay and not changing rooms. 
23953 great hotel, the rooms are small but nice and clean, and very quiet. Many restaurants within walking distance. We will go back if we go back to NY 
23954 I loved accommodations, the location, the attractions and the city itself! We happen to visity over the 4th of July which included the Taste of Chicago event. What a treat! The hotel is around the corner from Magnificent Mile, so you are definitely in the heart of downtown! 
23955 This hotel beats many of the higher priced boutique hotels in NYC. The room was small, the bathroom was decent-sized. Decor was stylish, tiled bathroom, LCD TV and wireless internet.. This hotel did not have valet parking. We stayed new years eve and the staff was polite and helpful. 
23956 While, I do enjoy staying at OTA, the rates continue to escalate. I suggest you check a online discounter to compare rates. The staff is cordial and helpful and the bar at Serafina is quite nice. The superior room is nice, but size/layout will vary by floor. 
23957 Best thing about this hotel is the location. From our corner room we looked at the bright lights of Time Square. Hotel is a little 'tired' but offers good, clean accommodation. Would have no problem using again. 
23958 Paramount Hotel is central to Times Square. The rooms are extremely small. 
23959 The room was lovely. Spacious and very clean. Bathroom had a great walk-in shower. Reception were very helpful and I loved the Twitter wall in the lobby. The hotel is a few blocks from Times Square and a few more blocks from the skyline walkway to the meat packing district. 
23960 i stayed there with my daughter on a girlie shopping trip. The hotel was lovely. Very welcoming after a long flight from UK. Rooms very clean and big comfy beds. Staff very polite and extremely helpful. Very near Grand Central station. Will definately stay there again. 
23961 I too had a bad experience in February.......ice cold showers and elevators that were as slow as snails! 
23962 The rooms are large beautiful contemporary decor, great bathrooms! I love the shower and of course the robes are a great touch! The best part is we were just steps away from the best shopping, dining and great jazz! We'll definately be back. 
23963 We stayed at the Crestwood suites for one night and found a huge room including a kitchen and a seperate sitting area. The room was really big and very clean. Staff at the reception was really friendly. Nothing to complain about here. 
23964 very nice hotel and the stuff has very good manner .but everything cost. 
23965 I would not go back the hotel 
23966 Good quality price, rooms are clean enough, but could be cleaner. Brakfast is fairly priced and children below 5 years of age get it for free. Location is very good, close to Columbus Square and Times Square. 
23967 Very reasonable weekend rate on the Executive Level. The room was spacious with a wonderful view. Comfortable bed, robes provided. Nice sofa area. Breakfast in our room was excellent. Staff very attentive and check out quick and easy. 
23968 The best way to describe this property is grungy. Will never stay again. Found a cockroach in the bed. Very rundown. Not the Red Roof quality we are accustomed to in other areas. 
23969 Stayed here for a night with 2 children and hotel was wonderful. Great location, extremely clean and staff was exceptional - extremely friendly and helpful. Will be coming back often for our family trips into NYC. 
23970 I really liked the Holiday Inn in NYC - 5 minute walk to Columbus Circle, Rooftop Pool, and helpful staff... 
23971 Gramercy is an extremely exclusive and beautiful neighborhood. We wrote about the hotel and added it as a link to our blog. Here at Romio we love the Gramercy Hotel and believes it lives up to the hype. http://romioblog.com/2011/03/09/the-key-to-gramercy/ 
23972 The room I booked was the cheapest... and smallest. I must say, I got a GREAT deal!! Even though the room was small, it was designed very well so it didn't seem as small as it actually was. The lobby & bars were clean, the staff nice 
23973 Stayed here one night only. Got a great deal through Priceline. Had a late arrival (11:30pm). Staff was extremely friendly and helpful in providing insight for the area. Room very pleasant and bathroom spotless. Great location for shopping, food, etc. 
23974 Booked a newly refurbished room. We were upgraded upon arrival. Very spacey, comfortable bed, large bathroom. The air con was loud - not a problem for me, but would be for some. Only negative - the shower temperature was not constant. Apart from that, totally recommend. 
23975 The Palmer House is a beautiful,old and grand hotel. Every member of the staff was polite and attentive to our needs. The rooms are reminiscent of an old Northeast resort and ironically looked a bit like The Overlook from "The Shining" which we found fabulous! 
23976 The Algonquin was an outstanding hotel close to shopping, theater and restaurants. The staff was gracious and our room was beautiful. The lobby is lovely and the complimentary coffee station was a wonderful addition to our stay. We would definitely return to this classic, historic hotel. 
23977 From the minute I walked into the hotel, I felt welcome. The staff at the desk was very courteous and accommodating. Check-in process was smooth and quick. Would definitely recommend this hotel. 
23978 Incredibly friendly, competent staff. The view from our room was stupendous with a beautiful sunrise. The bathroom was beautiful. Bed very comfortable. 
23979 Walking distance from the terminal. Sufficient rooms and late night restaurant.
