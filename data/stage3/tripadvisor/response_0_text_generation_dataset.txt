[BEGIN] Unfriendly staff, nasty dirty. This a Hilton? Wallpaper peeling in lobby restroom. Restaurant closed. Understaffed at front desk. Stayed here a year ago & it was pretty nice...It's really gone downhill. Would not recomend. Also, car broken into. Rough neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobby is grand but the rooms and hallways are terrible. Bathrooms are so small you have to step out of hem to lather up. Paint peeling stains all over carpets in hallways. Very disappointing. Don't let the pictures on their website fool you. I felt dirty after leaving there.  [END]
[BEGIN] the location couldnt be better , really in the hearty of Times Square , the check in was slow - 30 minutes + staff were not helpful , slow to address problems ... not interested .. However the gym in the hotel was world class  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, this is NYC, but come on. We shouldn't expect roaches in our room in such a "boutique" hotel. When we complained of the "extra guest" in our room they simply replied "that's NYC." Aweful!  [END]
[BEGIN] me and my girlfriend stayed here. the rooms where small, the bathroom door was broken, the main door to the room was iffy. we woke up with bed bug bites. The Department of health needs to close this dump down.  [END]
[BEGIN] AVOID AVOID AVOID There was homeless people crashed in my hallway. 3 of them. When I complained to security they said they do rounds and that there were no homeless people and that I was lying. I have pictures of them, it was disgusting.  [END]
[BEGIN] the most dirty and awful hotel I have never been in. I would never repeat the experience, for sure. It is worth to look for an hotel not so close to the center, but clean and tidy; even for sleeping. I would never recommended it to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the worst hotel I've stayed in. The bed was worn out, the pillows smelled like feet, and the paint was peeling on the walls of the room. The staff was very rude. I wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Far better hotels in New York at half the cost - try Distrikt Hotel on 40th Street. If it wasn't for switching hotels mid-stay then my special trip to New York would have been a disaster!! Wi-fi at 25 dollars a night!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is probably the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. The rooms are appaling air con stuck to the window with tape, broken light bulbs rock band playing next door and the final indignity a drunk passed out on the step outside. Really poor and best avoided  [END]
[BEGIN] They put us in a basement room. When we complained they said " next time tell the you don't want the basement" really???  [END]
[BEGIN] Noisy , run down and unhelpful staff. The room was at the front of the hotel and the noise from traffic was constant. TV and facilities outdated and staff not very interested. Breakfast poor and expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude staff, walls and doors havin peelin paint. Walls os thin that when the guest in the next room couhs durin he niht we can hear. Furniture looks like was bought in a yard sale. I am glad I slept or tried to sleep only one niht at the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] we are just back from new york, stayed at this hotel for four long nights ,absolutely terribile experience. rooms were small no hot water no ventalation in bathrooms. Generally very run down in need of a good refrub. Staff not very plesant all in all a hotel to avoid.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like spending money on Internet and parking stay here. About an hour walk to anything good. If you don't stay on a high floor then you are missing out on the one good thing about the hotel ...... The view  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobby beautiful, rooms too small and not cleaned properly for price and airconditioners make room smell terrible would not recommend for people with breathing problems  [END]
[BEGIN] It was dirty, Loud and the staff was unfriendly. The bathroom smelled like it hasn't been cleaned at all for a long time. It has 4 stars it really only deserves 1 star. The location is great but you can get better for that price NEVER AGAIN  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst hotel ever. Service is terrible. Tells you to come down and get a heater. Doesnt look anything like the pictures. TV is about 10 inches wide. Rooms are freezing. my advice dont go there.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was horrendous. When I arrived, there was dries toothpaste spit in the sink. The hallways were loud. The lone computer used to print boarding passes wasn't working. The rooms look like they're falling apart. Go someplace else. Trust me...you'll save yourself a night of misery.  [END]
[BEGIN] we've booked this hotel for the 2nd time. But there won't be a 3rd. In 3 years, nothing changed and the rooms looked (and smelled) the same.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room smelled of hookers and strippers. Walked into our room and could only imagine what had taken place there before us. The abandoned chinese joint in front of the hotel looks as if asian zombies walk thru the parking lot at night looking to eat hooker brains. Creeeeeepy!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was horrible. It was dirty and had a terrible smell. The air conditioner was covered with spider webs. The carpet was filthy. There was a 1 inch gap between the top of the door and the frame of the door. Filthy, dirty smelly..that best describes this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is not renovated, its a dump. Been staying at hojo for 18 years never again hello holiday inn.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow, very very overpriced and service is horrendous. Tired and old. An hour for room service at 1:00 am? That's when you're at your hungriest. In NY,. that just doesn't work  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible service, dirty rooms, and even provided service for Ahmadinejad's thugs. Stay away. We were greeted well on arrival and found the facility itself to our liking. It was larger than it appears from the outside facade, richly decorated, and structurally well maintained.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera da incubo : pareti scrostate, moquette consunta, tende luide, vetri sporchissimi, bagno piccolissimo con vasca macchiata e tubi rugginosi. Condizionatore/riscaldatore vecchio, arruginito e mal funzionante. Porte delle camere e corridoi fatiscanti. Siamo scappati ...  [END]
[BEGIN] the pictures don't do justice the rooms are super small the services is less than frendly and in the event of snow storms and mother nature problems they get you good so check the weather and stay in brooklyn  [END]
[BEGIN] Shocking hotel Rude counter staff Tiny, borderline dirty rooms with even tinier, horruble bathrooms Out of the way location for almost anything in NYC Would never go back -- the reviews on the site below show my experience was not isolated, I only wish I read them before I booked!  [END]
[BEGIN] My room had bedbugs. The sheer number of bedbugs makes me think that this is a problem that the hotel is willfully ignoring. When I asked for a refund, I was told that a refund was not possible. That's probably all that needs to be said.  [END]
[BEGIN] Struttura vecchia, camere con arredamento vecchio e rovinato, piatto doccia nero per lo sporco, nessuna indicazione al check in sugli orari della colazione, ecc.. Due uniche note positive: la vicinanza con il centro congressi ed il prezzo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got here from the UK and was told the room I had pre-booked was no longer available. They sent me to another hotel, 12 blocks north and gave me $7 for a cab fare which cost me $9. Not impressed at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not even comparable to YHA. Far from it! Can't close the windows at night. Spider web in every corner of the room. Flooded bathroom and toilets. If you want to ruin your holiday, this will definitely fulfill it.  [END]
[BEGIN] My hotel stay was a total fiasco and all I will say is that I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I have been a Marriott Rewards member for many years and this was one of the worst stays that I have ever had.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the smallest room of my life. No kidding. Thank goodness I have a toilet. Not all rooms do. More like a prison. Cell.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms dirty..holes in bed linen an curtains...water spots on the wall..mildew all over..electrical wires spliced together..rude management  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't be fooled. I waited 3 days for hotel to fix wireless and it was never fixed. I Closet doors are falling. Fridge in Studio has rust all on the outside No parking after 10 Pm Rude staff and noisy rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't go there... The rooms are disgusting, the personnel, bad-tempered!!! When we were there, they found a dead body in a room, so we decided to leave one day early, but they refused to give us our money back!  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff is incompetent. The rooms are dark and dreary...some with no windows. the carpets reek of smoke and dust. The accommodations were bleak. i wouldn't recommend this hotel to my worst enemy. No one deserves to pay $200 a night for a miserable hotel experience. Stay away...trust me...!  [END]
[BEGIN] Run down and tacky, couldnt believe that this place has been renovated in the past 30 years.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went to the bar at the Waldorf for drinks after the Opera and no one even looked at us for 10 minutes! The bar had horrible service and was not even busy..... I will never go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] That was a worst hotel i ever seen before! Bugs, small dirty room, no elevator, strange smell...Never stay here! It's horrible!... and do not trust the pictures on the website, they are lie!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst sheraton property i have ever seen. The price is outrageous and customer service is really bad. Worst place i have ever stayed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although centrally located close to Grad Central, the Radisson Lexington was a great disappointment. Not only very small hoteroom and tiny bathroom in screaming need of renovation, but the room and bathroom were not clean. This is extremly low value for a great amount of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is the location great? YES Is it a cool Place to have a drink? YES Is the room smaller than my dorm in 10th grade? YES Is it way overpriced for NYC? YES There are so many other great hotels in NYC for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Logo que chegamos ,,precisamos pedir p/trocar a roupa de cama que estava suja, e resto de comida no quarto,uma batata.Reclamamos a primeira vez e recebemos um bonus para o cafe da manha.Minha filha teve nove picadas no corpo constadata hoje por dermatologista como provavelmente sendo PULGA.  [END]
[BEGIN] only good location and nothing else....:-) toilets are horrible!  [END]
[BEGIN] Only can get a live person on the phone from 9-5 central time. Call and see. Unreasonable cancellation policy. Ask for it in writing. Multiple billing errors. Billed in 08 and 09 for a stay that never happened. Just reported them to American Express for the latest issue.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food is terrible. Tried the breakfast buffet, lunch and room service - not one good meal in 3 days. Prices are very expensive for the quality  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is scary, it is like being in the movie "four rooms". It's like going back into the 60's and very retro looking. My friend got stuck in the room and couldn't get out cause the key went around and around, it was scary!!!!! Rooms were ugly and dirty!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Like a very large youth hostel. Pleasant desk staff, clean bed. But...door did not shut properly, huge gap under door, dirty carpets, falling ceiling in ancient bathroom, no curtains to block sun, battered walls and furniture. In short, a disaster.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor service, dirty rooms. The only reason to contemplate staying at this hotel is the location. It's close to a range of sites and the railway station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms small, noisy, elevators small and worst of all, my daughter develop a rash on arms, shoulders, back and stomach. We thought bed bugs, still don't know what it was, but will never stay at this hotel again nor any from the Ascend.  [END]
[BEGIN] we had bad experience in this hotel , and we do not recommend it , service is average , broken fridge all stay ,bad area ,bad view, bad management ,finally and most important they cheated us on the final bill , never to use it again  [END]
[BEGIN] Classy hotel. Great New York experience. We have stayed here before. Like most NY hotels rates change. If you can get a good rate the hotel is a bargain,but sometimes it can be really pricey and you might want to look at comparables.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful doesn't do it justice. Small, smelly rooms, nasty area. Never, ever, again...  [END]
[BEGIN] Made a mistake on my booking and charged me the full rate without giving me a discounted rate for another night. Will never stay here again or at any other SPG hotel for that matter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked a room a month in a advance with two double beds. Once we got there they said they only had rooms with king beds left and all they could say was "sorry." What's the point of a reservation?  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a quick note not to stay at this hotel! Overpriced, small rooms, and extremely poor service! Save your money and stay somewhere else!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's dirty, dark and in desperate need of maintenance. But on the other hand you wouldn't expect anything else from those rates at that location. The beds are ridiculously uncomfortable and the room is far from clean. Keep your expectations downs is probably my best advice...  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was terrible, dirty, totally diferent of ALL the pictures I saw in the internet, I couldn't Believe when the taxi stopped in front of that! The location was the only good thing on that!  [END]
[BEGIN] More of a business hotel than a tourist one. We payed extra for a suite and when booking requested a room on a high floor, we were given one on the lowest (3rd) floor. Nice customer service I don't think.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel vecchio, muffa dappertutto, finestre che lasciavano entrare il freddo, un disastro totale. Non vale i soldi che chiedono, decisamente.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was expecting to stay in an Hotel but we faced with a Condo, with no reception, no service at all, and the room was cleanless. I would never reccommend this place, it is awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I paid $550 for this hotel in Hotels.com and thought it would be at least a reasonable hotel at that price. It is a complete dump. The rooms are worth around $100. I don't care if the location is reasonably good, this place is a pit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Apart from location, this hotel was not good. It smelled awful, people smoked in their rooms which permeated into ours and to top it all off, a mouse joined us in our room on the 11th floor. Wouldn't recommend this at all.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Wasn't expecting much here, but I did want hot water. None provided, nothing that they cared to do about it. Skip this uninspired dump and find another place to flop where you can take a shower.  [END]
[BEGIN] After we received our "final" bill and left the Empire, they assessed another $60 charge on our credit card. Called accounting and sent email to ask for justification; no response. Have asked our credit card company to withhold payment.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was tiny, run down and dirty. The staff was rude and it was close to nothing that was open late night. It was better than Motel 6 but not much. oh and the elevator broke down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst service ever. Room door doesn't close by itself - needs oiling. Maintenance never showed up. Maid left room door open after cleaning. Internet dysfunctional. Room not clean. No duvet covers, just a sheet and a duvet used by thousands of guests (and their stains are clearly visible). STAY AWAY!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty, horrible and infested in bed bugs. Never ever would i stay here again it would be cleaner to sleep on the streets of NYC for a night than stay here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Jan was far too generous. I'll never go back. The hotel was seedy, noisy and unpleasant. I couldn't believe it was a Hilton. Oh. Wait. The Dulles Hilton is just like that except smaller. Maybe it's a trend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff hospitality 3/10 Room cleanliness 6/10 Room condition 5/5 Location 8/10 Business lounge 8/10 Hotel cleanliness 6/10 The worst part is the service and hospitality of the staff, which unfortunately to me are the most vital parts of a hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mortifying, but true: Room 2409 is infested with bed bugs. Let's hope the management is taking care of it. Yuck.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cant believe the front desk has the nerve to accept money for this dump. I would rather sleep under a bridge. Checked in for a week and stayed 12 hours. Filthy dump  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was small and very careless. The roof have stains and the bathroom was dirty. I have to shower with my flip-flops!!!. DONT STAY IN THIS HOTEL.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is over priced and the staff was rude and unprofessional. Service is virtually non existant. Beware.  [END]
[BEGIN] They said it was updated in 2010, but other than new pictures on the wall, I'm not sure what was updated. You could hear everything from every nearby room and it smelled awful. The location is somewhat convenient, but I would never stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms, old fashioned, dirty, bleak, would not recommend this place  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is beautiful, but the service is horrible. If you have any problems, they have great difficulty in meeting you. Especially in the lobby bar. The girl in the bar said to my face that would not serve me!! absurd!!  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 nigths and nobody went to clean my ugly room. Frontdesk staff not friendly also the manager sunday sept 16 he never came out to fix my situation. Rate $259.00 very expensive for anything. Rooms need remodelations.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude, un helpful staff, dark dingy small rooms with poor facilities. Spoilt whole trip and should have stayed in the Marriott across the road.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worse. Hotel. Ever. Avoid the other reviews. This hotel is the worst in Manhattan. Loud. Stinky. No room service or mini-bar. Terrible service. Stay anyplace else than here. This hotel will ruin your vacation. One star is too much. This place is a negative star.  [END]
[BEGIN] very old hotel needed up dating, you get what you pay for. hotel internal pictures misleading.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at this hotel in the spring. The hotel did not meet expectations, and when I tried to leave early, management was rude to my family. Hotel would not honor its cancellation policy. Worst hotel experience in 30 years of travel.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have seen better rooms that charge by the hour!! Worn out carpet, cracked walls and ceiling, no ice machine or concession machines available. Just about the worst experience I have ever had in Chicago.  [END]
[BEGIN] We are still thawing out....TURN ON THE HEAT! Whatever you do, don't drop your anything behind the furniture...the crud & dust will nauseate you. Guy at the front desk spends his whole time yakking on the phone.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room is too tiny , no minibar , A/c too noisy and the bed is 200cm long X140cm wide for couple? the price absolutely not worth it! my room was about 290 per night  [END]
[BEGIN] stark heruntergekommen. Hat seine bestem Zeiten hinter sich. Das Bad war eine reine Zumutung. Herunterfallender Putz und Schimmel in der Dusche. Hat zwar eine Super Lage, ist aber ansonsten sein Geld nicht wert.  [END]
[BEGIN] All flash no substance. The rooms are falling apart, cracks in the floors and ceilings. Was told I would be notified when my room was ready, and there was no follow through. Not worth the money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible attitude, terrible service, rooms are like new York city closets and non impressive. You have to know somebody to get the courtesy car take you any where.  [END]
[BEGIN] - Reserved through ...- Arrived at 12:30 a.m.; Checked out at 12:45 a.m.- Dirty, Dirty, Dirty!- Mildew in bathroom- Bed extremely dirty- Floors/carpets dirty- walls needed paint job- Hallways dirty- It was a dumpster!- I wouldn't even think twice about booking an unknown hotel on-line anymore!  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible from start to finish. Just horrible. If Elvis were alive today, he would perform "In The Ghetto" live via satellite from this locale. Good luck!  [END]
[BEGIN] I would have had better service at a MOTEL 6. I will never book here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Unless this place has dramatically changed since we stayed in 2004 NEVER STAY HERE. As well as happy memories of New York we bought back with us a whole crowd of bed bugs which took 12 months to get rid of. This is place is a dump  [END]
[BEGIN] We used RCI points, so our stay for a week was about $85. It was not worth the savings. I would easily spend $500 a night for a better place. There weren't enough elevators to for the number of guests they had. There are no amenities at this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed one night. Room was infested with bed bugs. Suffered bites on ankles and arms. Left early next morning and booked a room at the Hilton.  [END]
[BEGIN] What more is there to say I stayed a week and got many bites.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed with my family over Labor Day weekend and my wife was attacked by bed bugs. She was up scratching and in pain for the next week. I contacted the hotel but they never replied. Evidently, this must be a common occurence. Stay Away !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobby is deceiving. It's very busy and trendy. The first room that they put me in was occupied and dirty. The second room was smaller than my college dorm room, had stains on the carpet and had no view. The food however, was fabulous, no complaints there.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have had a roam for 4 person. It was a disaster, not clean and very, very, very olt roam. We have aske for a new roam, but it was the same low quality. We moved to a goog Hotel !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Strange approach by the staff starting with chech-in and ending with no possibility for a bath after check-out and after a day meeting and before flying out.To expensiv compared to the price and only the location and view can justify the chose.  [END]
[BEGIN] Customer service is horrible So do not stay at this place  [END]
[BEGIN] orrible, dirty and dark  [END]
[BEGIN] bad management.... i am not talking about the house maids they service was good but the high level management are mean....they try to charge for everything...  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel s----!!!!!!!!!!! bed bugs overun the place. seman stained sheets that are simply turned over for future use. torn and dirty shades. this is a poor excuse for a hotel!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfriendly staff (Anthony) the heat was not working and they did not know how to fix it, no handicapped rooms, I was freezing and they did know what to do, the carpet are all stained and dirty and the door room was scratched and dirty  [END]
[BEGIN] Goed hotel, een paar honderd meters van Central park. Je kunt er rustig kunt slapen, geen lawaai van straat verkeer. Er is een koelkastje op de kamer. Dineren en ontbijten kun je direkt om de hoek of laten bezorgen via de hotelservice. Aan te bevelen!  [END]
[BEGIN] Room so tiny, air conditionning not working, not clean. Bring desinfectant !!!!! Disgusting !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't go !!!!!!!!!!!! Look at our 120$ room!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay away. Poor customer experience. Hostile and threatening security. Security team bossed around hotel manager. No kidding. Yes it's across street from Penn station, but locale is not worth it. Trust me, stay away, as they have no customer service appreciation, stall...  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like a very basic hotel that has no life to it, then this is the hotel for you. The hotel is big with no charm, and very impersonal service. Too cold for my taste  [END]
[BEGIN] It was one of the worst experiences ever. The room was dirty, noisy and dark. The staff was rude. It definitely does not worth the price, Too expensive for what we get. Will never ever come back to this pigsty.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for one day because I woke the next morning with bite marks. The bathroom had mold.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there for 5 nights. The only good thing was the location and the clock at reception. Everyone that works there are rude people, no sense of client-service. From the doorman to the waiter. The floor (17 floor) smelled like an asstray... Worst hotel ever.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in Room 1133 Oct 21 &22. I have two rashes which I thought were mosquito bites. I think they may be bed bugs! My stay was not pleasant, old room, poor service. I would not stay there any more or recommend this hotel to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst rooms i've ever seen - smelly, dirty, tub chipped and cracked. I did not want to touch anything. Hotel is extremely understaffed and the staff it does have is rude and unhelpful. We relocated to a Sheraton.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were smelling bad. Bed sheets had holes and bathroom shower was not working. Worst motel.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was the worst hotel I've ever been. Noisy, smelly, dirty, small. And I even could choose the best of three rooms, and still it was terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Please, just stay away from this Hotel, its like a HORROR movie in reallife, its so bad that its just not for real Barack Obama, please shut it down! ;) We went for a new Hotel, The Pod, excellent, small rooms but great value for money  [END]
[BEGIN] I strongly recommend NOT staying at this hotel. There are plenty of other hotels in the area that actually care about their customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed over a weekend in November. To confirm the information in previous reviews: The rooms are tiny. Bed was however confortable. Hotel lobby is noisy, crowded and service is unpleasant (doormen are the exception to this) Hotel room was very clean. (Positive note) Extremely expensive. Would not stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible Hotel. Worst Rooms and Staff. Nothing was working propetly. Internet was rare and Phone would go down any time. Hotel Staff is not cooperative at all. Breakfast sucked. They had breads that were expired days ago. Pathetic Rooms. Entire Hotel was dirty and Stincky.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible service. Dirty rooms. Totally ruined our NYC holiday. Customer services never replied and couldn't give a damn.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place has the worst service available in NY. The staff are unhelpful and rude, the elevators break down regularly (22 floors of stairs is a lot), room service delivery is measured in hours and the wifi is not only slow but overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super dirty and doors looked like coffins (just creepy). Hard beds. Poor concierge recommendations and way too expensive for what you get. Location was good. Would never recommend this hotel to anyone nor stay there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] es el peor hotel que he visto en mi vida, encontramos cigarrilos,bichos entre las sabanas, jamas lo limpian, es una pesadilla de hotel no se lo recomiendo a nadie!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] All was fine until I noticed that the badly painted chairs (brownish color) had ruined my favorite business suit. thanks alot.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in in the US. It was dark, dirty and completely unkept. It took a long time to check in and the room was really small. I would not recommend this to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] How can you book a hotel in advance, regardless of reviews, if they refuse to take reservations? This may be a great deal, but it's reduced to an as-available basis on the day you want to stay there. How stupid is that?  [END]
[BEGIN] My first review on trip advisor. Just wanted to warn about this hotel. I was woken up at 4AM with bedbug bites and observed the bedbugs in my bed. Room was also rather dingy and dirty. Not a great place to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I booked one bed here but when I reached here on 25th night I saw there is a notice to vacate at the front and do not enter notice. when I called them, they told a couple of rooms are not in good shape. What a Sham!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay somewhere else, unless you can afford a suite.. was very fustruated while satying at the Waldorf.. food horrible. This hotel should be considred 3 star.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is conveniently located in Lincoln park, but besides that, there was nothing positive about my experience at this hotel. The room was incredibly small and not very clean. The bed was super uncomfortable. Stay somewhere else!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nastiest place I have ever stayed. The hallways and the room stunk bad. Couldn't get fresh towels. Wouldnt stay again if they paid me to- they outta bulldoze that stink hole.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very simple do not stay there, it is a total kip.. Checked in Checked out in 10 mins would not stay there. Found a gorgous hotel on 31st st Wolcott hotel.........There is so much better in New York just take the time to look honestly......................  [END]
[BEGIN] A terrible, terrible hotel - even if it is cheap. We stayed during Sept 2003. Dirty, old, battered, peeling, cracked, saggy, dank, smelly, stained, with toilets that frequently overflowed (3 times in 6 days). Overall it's just depressing. Don't stay at Hotel Pennsylvania.  [END]
[BEGIN] had a very poor stay..room not clean, noise in halls, fire alarm for no reason, and poor breakfast....no help from managment when i ask for discount because of bad sevice..don't go...shawn m. sulphur,la.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beware of booking at this hotel. They have an incredibly stringent 72 HOUR cancellation notice, no restaurant in the hotel, and a 4pm check-in, all of which I have never run into at any other hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] IT IS DISGUSTING, it looked like a place that a hooker would use for the hour. the room was dirty, no remote for tv, no cable, no pictures on the walls, the comforters were thread bare. one lightbulb in the ceiling. it smelled.do not go here!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms too hot, mice in the first room I was in. Staff gave me wrong info about my room multiple times. Was told I had to move twice and then was told I didn't have to move at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was small, the service was slow ... rooms need a lot of renovation ... and BAR was way too exp.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there for one week. After a long line at ceck in...first room they gave me was not cleaned yet (!) in the second room a couple has just cecked in right before me (!!) third room toilet did not flush (!!!)  [END]
[BEGIN] I would not recommend this hotel. The biggest problem with this hotel is the luke warm "hot" water. Hotel staff would not admit there was a problem. I was shivering while showering. I asked other customers at the hotel if they also had cold showers and they did.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst hotel. Room smelt of ciggerates and paint, repair work and maintaince work going on. drilling was heard. Very awful substandard hotel. refused to stay here so checked out the same day. Did not even sleep here.  [END]
[BEGIN] My fiance and I had the worst experience at this hotel. The service was apalling and the room was not even close to as depicted on all the adverts. My fiance ended up with bug bites. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] I telephoned today to inquire on this place and the gentleman explained that is has been converted to apartments that require a 1yr lease.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not stay here. The service stinks and they don't care. We were there for one night- the tv did not work and they could not have cared less. The front desk was rude to my wife. This place is terrible = do not stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Found a nest of bed bugs in room. Hotel reaction was quick, they moved my room and cleaned clothes, but it was a disgusting experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] L'hotel est dans un etat limite par manque d'entretien. Les chambres ne sont disponibles qu'a partir de 15h00. La chambre etait propre mais il n'y avait pas de draps sur le lit, juste un couvre-lit. Les chambres ne sont pas bien insonorisees et on entend les bruits de la circulation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not go by the brand name.. they are worse than a service apartment/hostel or dormitory..The room was toooooo small.. It was a horrible experience.. Not a value for money deal.. Should not be even the last choice of hotel to stay  [END]
[BEGIN] more than one mice in my room......scary,small,gross and gross.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't check into a hotel where you are buzzed in to the lobby and the desk clerk sits behind bulletproof glass; in only gets worse from there.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great, and then you walk inside. This is a hostel, not a hotel. The " concierge" is always "away". The best part of the whole experience was the instructions found on the door on how to have fun! $$ too!  [END]
[BEGIN] What an awful hotel. Small, dark, marginally functioning rooms, turn of the century elevators, all centered around an over crowded lobby bar and front desk manned by a rude staff. Save your money. Stay home and hit yourself over the head with a hammer instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cigarette smell in non-smoking room. Unprofessional front desk.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are dirty and outdated. Definately not a 4 star hotel. The furniture in the room was stained and filthy. The carpets were also dirty.The parking was $15 and hard to get in and out of property due to traffic.The rooms facing hi-way are very noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very old, ugly poor condition and smells bad. Cannot believe itis called "hyatt"  [END]
[BEGIN] no soap, flat out lied on their website about how close they were to certain areas (no times square is not minutes away on foot) and whats worse, i managed to pick up bed bugs while staying there and it's gonna cost me a bunch to call in an exterminator.  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay at the skyline was absolutely horrible. The main desk service was unhelpful, rude and insulting to me and my group. Our particular room were equally bad. I will definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at Pod hotel for a weekend workshop in the city and came home with bedbugs! I had to have the entire house exterminated - how awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hallway smelled liked weed, I'm all for the oldies but this was gross. The beds were terrible the bathtub was all peeling and falling apart. I love old things but this place smelled like mufa.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst hotel we've ever been, seriously! Really rude staff (they even tried to cheat and keep the margin), ugly bathroom (but private, tough) and an extremely small and nasty room. Don't ruin your vacation by choosing this hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] I travel almost 100 days a year for business and this hotel was the worst I ever stayed at. The room was very dirty with mold throughout the bathroom. There was old plug adaptors and I just wanted to leave. The hotel needs major renovation and cleaning.  [END]
[BEGIN] I read reviews and they were mixed, but I didn't think this place would be this bad. Area NOT safe....Rooms smelly ...I do not recommend. I am a single prof. female and I felt very unsafe here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very expensive, but not very clean, and staff are very rude to their customers. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. by: Linda Evans Photos: 24  [END]
[BEGIN] excelente ubicacion del hotel. A un paso de todo. La habiatacion es un desastre, el lobby tambien. Necesita una refaccion urgente. el bano del ano 1920 sin restyling. solo para los q busquen ubicacion. por el resto, no duden en ir a otro hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are VERY small, just one foot around the bed. Bathrooms have a 24 inch pocket door entry...your knees will touch the wall when you use the cammode. Dark hallways. Very poor entrance. Not good even at a low price!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a very bad experience in the hotel, in particular with thair manager on duty (Robert Grippo). For instance, the hotel did not honor the reservation rate, even though it was re-confirmed at checkin. Afterwards, Mr Grippo handled the situation with no professionalism.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is filthy and has bed bugs. They are also overpriced. Avoid at all costs !!! The bed bugs are not worth it !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] the dept of housing , not to mention a few other authorities, should come here to check things out. in seriious need of inspecition  [END]
[BEGIN] The only good thing about the place was that the bed was comfy. Shame as the building is great and a refurb would make the hotel FAB! Location is perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was rude, the rooms were disgusting and dingy and while the prices were relatively cheap (in this very expensive city), they were not worth the room. The staff gives New Yorkers a bad reputation. But NY is still a wonderful city, just stay somewhere else!  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was disgusting from Dec. 9 through Dec. 15. We found blood splatters on the bedspreads, walls, sheets and mattresses. The place was filthy! Stains all over. Elevator stopped on level M and we stared back at a cement wall! I would NEVER stay in this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient to IC medical center. Old, run down, equipment does not work.Should have been torn down years ago.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, so small, with no view. Room service : 1st day, 1 hour and 20 minutes to get a coffee. 2nd day, 35 minutes to get a cold expresso at ... $18.40. There are so many options in NYC, including other W hotels, stay away from this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was not clean and generally unappealing but was in a great location, Not my first choice but OK for a nights sleep in a pinch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Once we arrived they want to charge $120+ per night extra to deliver what they promised via phone 2 x.s. Don't fall there bait and switch tactics.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was NOT as represented on their web site. Staff is very uncoperative. I will never recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor service - staff with a bad attitude. Computer check in is not acceptable. Waiting on line to be greeted by a computer. Restaurant is too expensive for what you get and staff is far from friendly. Had to beg for bread which was stale and thrown at me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right from the check in I experienced rudeness and a condescending attitude. Room was shabby and need of serious upgrades. Carpet was dingy. Old furniture and towels were YMCA rejects. Got the impression that the hotel did not have the funds to keep it up. Stay somewhere else!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel sale, etat des chambres est douteux, personnel desagreable, chambres minuscules. Hotel bien situe mais a quel prix ! Rapport qualite prix non justifie. A eviter ou verifier l avancee de certaines chambres en processus de renovation  [END]
[BEGIN] It's the worst hotel I stayed in my life.Dirty, no hair dryer, no internet in the room. The alarm is beeping all the time. The bathroom is leaking. The worst thing is there are bugs in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] People,people, people, i seriously thought i was on candid camera when i entered my room. I mean sure it's a $70 room but thinking about it i should of saved my money and slept in central park. Please don't book there, you'll do yourself a favor.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was dirty. Mold in two rooms, hair in the shower, dirty comforters, a/c did not work. I'm a member of the La Quita member program and booked thru the reservation service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bathroom was dirt, towels were like sandpaper, shampoo and soap were lousy, bed was noisy, fixtures in the bathroom were falling apart. Lousy Give your business to another establishment...... Love the thompson's starwoods, even Hilton over this place  [END]
[BEGIN] Our dental team was kept waiting in the lobby while the front desk emailed forms to be completed and faxed back. This is for a room that was reserved, confirmed and paid for prior to their arrival.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a dump. Dirty, run-down rooms. Un-friendly, un-helpful staff. Luckily I stayed here on business before some friends and I were to come back a week later for fun. We were able to change hotels to one a couple of blocks down the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] ugly rooms thin walls between rooms nothing in room not even a normal desk closet or coffee makers about 1/2 hour wait for elevators wont ever stay again in this garbage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked this hotel for convenience as it is attached tonthe airport but will not be back. They charge for EVERYTHING! One would think the hotel gym would be free for hotel guests...untrue $9, Internet $17 parking $45 and the list goes on.  [END]
[BEGIN] ecomiendo no ir al hotel etsuve alojada desde el 19 de noviembre al 26 de noviembre inclusive y anoche nos han robado una valija entera con todas nuestras pertenencias. nadie se hizo cargo y encima nos trataron pesimo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clothes and jewlry stolen from room. Fairmont security not very responsive. I filed a police report with Chicago PD. As a women whio frequently travel on business, I didn't feel safe staying in this hotel. The hotel even charged me $30.00 to call the police department.  [END]
[BEGIN] lobby fatiscente : divani bucati; avevamo appuntamento con amici e ci siamo vergognati di riceverli camere piccoliossime con scarafaggi !!! condizionatore rumoroso bagno microscopico e sporco di notte urla in corridoio  [END]
[BEGIN] They confirm your reservation, you book everything else including expensive flights and then they write you an email, (don't even have the guts to call you ) and turn you down. What decent hotel does that?  [END]
[BEGIN] Three words best describe this fleapit "what a dump". It is old. the room was tiny. it was manky. no hot water and the breakfast was disgusting. Avoid this like the plauge.  [END]
[BEGIN] This has been the single worst hotel experience, period. Was finally given a room at 7p.....one bed when reserved two...room below standard, bed spread soaking wet bleach. Was told that my. Check-in was delayed because I was grouped with flight attendants who departed at 6p.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for five days, and when I returned home I had a bedbugs with me. Check out the bedbug registry. This place is infested. Beware.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friend had bites all over her body. It was obvious that the hotel has plenty of experience dealing with bed bugs. They gave us a refund but that doesn't compensate for the hassle and annoyance  [END]
[BEGIN] both my client and I got bitten by bed bugs after staying there for one night. my client called them to inform and they just answered they would take care of it. will never stay there again in my life! it felt dirty and unpolished.  [END]
[BEGIN] Upon checking in room was dirty and old. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Days Inn right down the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only good thing about this hotel is the location. Paid extra for the city view room which we did not get. The room was not overly clean. Found the staff unhelpful and long waits for the uninterested concierge. Would never stay here again, very dissapointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, rude staff, room smelled of urine, thin walls. Every morning was awaken by the loud housekeepers out in the hall. Kiosk's not working properly. Had a great view of the courtyard (as the staff called it) cement roof of another building. Run down hotel, other than the lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived at 1am and endured a painfully slow check-in process. Room is dirty, threadbare, and lacks basics, in room WiFi. Amenities in my room were open/half used. This hotel is a blight on the Intercontinental brand.  [END]
[BEGIN] small rooms, dirty, feathers everywhere, hissing radiators, sink doesn't drain, some rooms have no closets, elevators smelled moldy  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at this hotel regularly for business trips. NO LONGER. I just discovered bed bugs when I stayed this month (July 2009). DO NOT STAY IN THIS HOTEL - BED BUGS!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel booked two rooms for me and my wife, when I asked for one. Why would I book two rooms? Also, the location is not that good. A gas station close by has bullet proof glass for the cashier. I wonder why?  [END]
[BEGIN] Will never go again. I'm embarrassed that I took my guests there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel manager said: O yeah, we are charging you another $150.- for the kingsize beds and the 4 people. A terrible rip off, while the reservation was already made and paid. He just charged the credit card!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My first visit there was the first week of April 2012, came back the third week and service was so terrible it discounted the first stay completely and then some.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a place for a romantic weekend. Hotel geared for singles, like a dorm atmosphere. Noisy, cold and dirty. Water in bathroom was warm, not hot! Bathrobe was stained and old.  [END]

[BEGIN] Worst hotel ever! A shabby place. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was dirty and stinky. Not worth $10 a night. We ended up leaving and paying for somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] the place is great near to soho, little italy... BUT our room was not clean and the bathroom also.. it was terrible... never again for this money..  [END]
[BEGIN] The customer service is terrible at this hotel. From arrogant customer diservice to negligence of service requests to being cheap on replacing the soap in your room. I'd rather stay at a budget Hampton Inn. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Air conditioning was out for the two days I stayed in this hellhole. WIFI also was not available either night with numerous excuses given. Could't sleep because of the heat amd couldn't work with no WIFI. Manager never returned call one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hiltons are usually expennsive if not ridiculously overpriced but our recent stay at the NY Hilton (std King bed room $492 plus, plus, plus was now even minus a room coffee maker. RUKMe!!!! LIVE AND LEARN. Time to get rid of the Hilton Honors account!  [END]
[BEGIN] I travel to NY often for business and usually stay midtown at any number of hotels. First time staying at Intercontinental, wow, what a disappointment. Old, tired, poor service. Old TVs in my suite, even the batteries in the remotes were old. Won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Es el peor hostel en el que he estado con diferencia, las ratas te abrian la puerta de recepcion, con eso digo todo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Front desk not helpful. Room poorly maintained--plumbing , and water temperature varies. Internet must pay extra. Although cheaper, value is not there. Would not recommend. Computer (business center) is too slow and thus requires constantly feeding dollars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do NOT STAY Here! This is the biggest rip off in NYC!!!!!!! Reservation was cancelled, but they didn't record it. They were happy to charge me anyway and refused to waive fee. With all of the hotels in NYC you can find one that treats clients with common courtesy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't even begin to describe how shabby and run down the accommodations were. We checked out. Save yourself look elsewhere! It is clear that no money is put back into this operation......  [END]
[BEGIN] Omg run unless you are used to living with roaches and run down, old EVERYTHING! This is place hotel furniture goes before the landfill. Very gracious about a quick refund and that was appreciated so 5 on service!  [END]
[BEGIN] Air conditioner in room did not function properly. Staff was unresponsive to requests to fix the problem. Carpets in rooms were shabby and rooms were not cleaned properly  [END]
[BEGIN] stay away, watch your credit card charges from the Peacock Alley Rest. save all receipts no exhaust fans in bathrooms. You cant survive on your past reputation in today's market. Small rooms  [END]

[BEGIN] this worst hotel i have ever stay at the rooms where like a shoe box the bathroom was even smaller ,just don,t stay there....  [END]
[BEGIN] A nice looking lobby fronts an oh so average hotel with expensive location. Go elsewhere and avoid the empty promises of this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobby of this hotel is great and the Irish Pub restarant was very good. The room were very old, dark & dreary. The clerks were not helpful in trying to find us another room. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was on business and did not want to spend $400 per night so ended up here for $299. Rooms were dark, small and misersable. The roller blinds were amusing and the bedding adequate. The lifts were useless. I would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not only is the hotel still under construction, but there are construction projects to the left, right and front of the hotel. Then behind it is a noisy backyard of tenement buildings, complete with clotheslines and hanging dirty mops. Construction workers start yammering and banging outside at 7 am.  [END]
[BEGIN] I woud not stay at this hotel fot free. Sheets were old and worn out, blanket was gross, furniture old and worn out, bathroom gross, carpet filthy... Stay away.  [END]

[BEGIN] La camera standard era talmente piccola da non riuscire ad aprire la valigia. Giusto 30cm attorno al letto , giusto necessario per scendere. Il personale educato ma assolutamente menefreghista. La zona e' comoda Il bagno pulito ma piccolissimo Tutto troppo piccolo per 200 euro a notte la camera !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] rude staff and owner....over charge me on my credit card,, rooms have mold... phone didnt work and they suggested I get I fix it... owner screams at you when you ask him a simple question.. extremely bad value....  [END]
[BEGIN] Cold coffee for three days in the ececutive lounge...no staff most of the day. No paper towels in the mens rooms...air blowers like you find on the highway fast food place. Thirty five dollars + tax and tip for bacon and eggs. This hotel is off of the stay list.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dated. Dirty with stains on floor. Room was smoked in and all my belongings stunk of cigarette smoke. Don't plan on coming back. I have stayed in 4 star hotels and this is not 4 star worthy.  [END]

[BEGIN] Very noisy hotel!!!!!Next to E.R.,lots of sirens!!!!!!Tiny bathroom,not very clean!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for it. You stay in a box without windows. You have to wait to use the share stinky bathroom. I wonder why it is called a hotel. I did not enjoy the experience even with the low price.  [END]

[BEGIN] The service was terrible! The front desk staff was awful!! The hotel was not very clean. I would pay a little extra and stay somewhere else!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything you've heard about this place is true and then some.Rude staff,deplorable condition of rooms,looks like it hasnt been renovated since the Hoover administration was in office.Good location is the only good thing to be said about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really terrible. I realize NYC is expense, but you can surely do better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrable place to stay for the price and is not as the advertise. It is a dive. Room is small, old, wore out carpet and beds. Also has bed bugs, For the price of $200 a night stay somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny mini horribly small and dirty rooms with dirty hallways. Wouldn't go back ever!! The only good thing is its location, but our overall experience deserves a failing grade for sure.  [END]

[BEGIN] Don't go to this hotel. The staff isn't very helpful. The charges for the minibar are way too high. They even charge you $25 if you use the minibar for your own drinks!!! What a service!  [END]
[BEGIN] After we got in the room, room did not clean yet. So we asked another room. Room was so tiny and dirty, no views. Washroom also. All of facilities are old and dirty. Only one good thing is close to time square  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in this hotel during the Hurricane Irene period. Can you imagine they charged me ~US$20 per minute for making international calls back home to India and Singapore. They are cheats. Will never ever go back to this hotel.  [END]

[BEGIN] Over priced!... the room 768.. was very small...too dark.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 3 nights and had a difficult time getting an elevator. We had to walk down the stairs from the 15th floor and ended up on the side of the building. There were always people waiting for the elevators. The ammenities weren't nice enough to justify the inconvenience.  [END]

[BEGIN] if you value your health don't stay here. The carpet was wet and the air conditioner leaked water into the room. lots of mold. i changed rooms and it was just as bad. breakfast was a jar of peanut butter and a box of corn flakes.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel chain is a ripoff. They overbook and then send you somewhere else (while this was happening to us, they sent other families elsewhere - which is ONE reason why it took so very long for them to sort it out).  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty rooms. Poor Service. Seriously over-priced.  [END]

[BEGIN] Too small terrible service. Penny at front desk is rude and disrespectful to guests.  [END]

[BEGIN] everything about it was horrendous. apart from the fact it was very central, that was the only good part. I didn't feel safe here at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Strikers will wake you up by screaming & chanting. Hotel is suing strikers, strikers are suing hotel, not a pleasant place to stay. Hotel will basically offer you a danish and juice for putting up with all of the noise. PATHETIC!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is not clean, especially in the room and by the elevators. We have no free WiFi in the room, no fridge in the room, no safe. The bathroom needs an urgent makeover. We will not come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered a chocolate birthday cake. When I picked it up, they gave me a coconut one. Some letters on the top of cake were not readable. I was also charged 18 % tips even I carried the cake out. I am not satisfied with their service.  [END]
[BEGIN] this was the worst hotel i have ever been to in my whole life the beds were broken the place was small and very dirty i would not even give it a rating paint coming off of the walls  [END]
[BEGIN] ridiculous room layout, bedroom is in bathroom, very rude service from front desk and phone operator, at $450 a night many other better choices in the city!  [END]

[BEGIN] Filthy room. Unbearably filthy. Actually broke down into tears when I realized the rude staff could not/would not change our room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Why don't they invest some of the profit into rooms? Our room had old ripped carpet, lamps with holes in the shades, mold in the bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] The carpet was sticky! Eeew! The dirtiest window ever. The VIP check-in was closed (100 people in line!). Stained walls, even in the upgraded Penn 5000 rooms. Filthy curtains. Awful bed.  [END]

[BEGIN] Bed bugs?! When I complained to the front desk they sent up an inspector who said it was fine but I was covered in bites!  [END]
[BEGIN] Mangament Sucks. People are rude. Worst stay ever. Too expensive. MANY MANY other hotels in area 50-100 dollars cheaper. What's going on?  [END]
[BEGIN] HORRIBLE!!!!! Personal cold! rooms like horror movies! ants in the room, bath rusty, crumbling walls, broken lights........ do not go!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This a hotel that, despite the location which is really central, is not worth a penny. Absolutely awful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed in many fancy places And this one is clearly not one of them I am in room 510 and it is pretty disappointing.....  [END]
[BEGIN] No heat in the room! No service! No help! Never again! Pay for interent? Who pays for that anymore?  [END]

[BEGIN] If you go to New York don't book with YourStay. They are not the owner of the place..... When I arrive there I did't find no room and no apartment. Don't Stay with YourStay. If you want check in google for more review.  [END]
[BEGIN] I travel all over for business, this is one of the worse hotels I have stayed in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Inside and out. Thin walls, doors and windows. Sounds like there was a busy fire station next door on one side an a transfer station on the other. Awful night's sleep. Doors slam loudly by default and there were many late night guests on my hallway  [END]
[BEGIN] We all know one pays too much for too litle when it comes to lodging at NYC. But this hotel was ridiculous! Over priced, Awkwardly decrepit. Asked to change room. Both looked alike!!! If you want to stay in a dump pay for one!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great place to stay if you are visiting the NY parole office or nudie bar next door. The street is full of garbage and lowlifes. Please don't let this be your view of NYC NYC is a great place this is a dump.  [END]
[BEGIN] DO NOT COME HERE!!! It was nasty, horrible and staff was VERY VERY VERY RUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would not cme back even if it was free! Horrible experience!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't even think about it! I checked in and had to check out. It was so bad, I couldn't even stay there! The place is filthy, falling apart, and disgusting!  [END]
[BEGIN] The economy was not worth the discomfort. I complained about the bed bugs and they switched my room: I got several more bites before I checked out. No consideration/refund was offered.  [END]
[BEGIN] So the location is first class, service and friendliness is first class, rooms cleaned every 2nd day... generous with towels when I asked.. sheets clean... The place is seriously in need of upgradeing, but would come again for the good things it offers!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Our stay in New York was wonderful the hotel location was excellent. Hotel was very dated but clean We felt the staff thought they were to good to help us and there were plenty of them  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have mold sensitivity, asthma or don't like waking up with a sore throat and headacke this is not the hotel you want to stay. Poor ventilation = high humidity = mold. They need to get serious about this problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price you pay you think that you can leave your luggage for few hours. We party of 40 people checked out at 7 am wanted to leave luggage for 3 hours. they told us they can't do it. REally sucky service for $420 per room.  [END]
[BEGIN] ..ok che siamo di fronte al Madison Square Garden..ma tutti quei soldi per dormire in una camera pessima, la porta di ingresso che non si chiude bene, il bagno sporco e ristrutturato male, scarafaggi che fanno capolino da ogni dove...per carita'!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] From the broken window that wouldn't close to the front desk that would not answer the phone--this place is NOT the place to stay--even on a budget!  [END]
[BEGIN] Disgusting in every sense of the word. From obnoxious check in personnel, to sewer like bathrooms and rooms. Stay as far away as possible. They should condemn this place and send the management to prison.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is the pits. Cockroaches in rooms, filthy and surly unhelpful staff. DO NOT STAY AT THE CARTER IF YOU VALUE YOUR HEALTH. It should be closed down as a hazard to health. It is a big scam.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at the Lucerne hotel for four nights under two separate reservation numbers. The front desk made an error and did not merge the two reservation numbers. The Lucerne Hotel double charged our credit card as a no show and would not reverse the charges. They stole our money.  [END]
[BEGIN] DO NOT SYAY HERE - Ever We paid through our Travel agent $430 per night for 3 people. The rooms are disgusting. Please look at the photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] The stuff does not know how to treat customers. Disrespectful, unhelpful, by phone they tell you something and when you arrive there they tell you another. The worst service i ever had. I thought Sheraton was other thing..  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is stuck way back in time. We didn't feel comfortable at all... Floor layout was confusing, everything felt old and musty. Only one elevator was working in the tower we were in. Very out dated. We'll never stay here ever again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely unfriendly receptionist! Staff only intetested in tip despite unfriendly and non service oriented apperance! Wifi very expensive. Try to avoid this Hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is terrible. It is full of roaches. They are all over. The location is great and the room is ok but full of roaches. Stay away from this place. Very old fashioned and dirty hallways.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had booked two nights at the hotel but when we arrived there was apparently no more room! On inquiry we were told that they apparently with the travel agency we booked no longer work together? Don't book this hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is beyond shabby and the only reason I stayed at this hotel is because I was sick and barely able to function. It is bad bad bad. I would not be surprised if the walls were crawling with rats and the room had bed bugs. It's that bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny room with a view of industrial air conditioner. Room was right next to elevator with constant traffic outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Holes in furniture, broken buttons on tv, no kettle or coffee in room, no ice achines, spider web of extension cords under desk,missing handles on furniture, and more......l  [END]
[BEGIN] i've got some bridges in iowa to sell you.avoid this place at ALL costs. it is a terrible, festering sore that exploits the "sight-unseen" component of internet booking to the fullest.  [END]
[BEGIN] warning dont stay here! this is why: *bed bugs (see pic) *non english speaking staff *cockroaches *changing prices when chacking in *warm, dusty rooms with no air  [END]
[BEGIN] I couldn't believe a hotel in this state was allowed to trade!! Just awful - dirty and dated rooms. The only redeeming feature is the hotel's central location but it's still not worth putting yourself through the horror of it all!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there 4 nights and the last morning a rat ran under the door and around the room. Came back from working one evening and the door was ajar. Another evening the key would not work. Filthy, filthy, filthy. The management did nothing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was mediocre at best, and the bathroom was TINY. Everything seemed run down, and you could hear EVERYTHING in every room nearby. The photos of this place are extremely deceiving.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband & i stayed there for 2 days (Aug 07). The hotel lift was old & slow, the cabinet & bathroom doors were spoilt, bathroom look eerie, bathtub even had stains. And there were cockroach in the room.....  [END]
[BEGIN] Horribly rude and disinterested staff, inattentive management, and vastly overpriced for the product received. Would not stay there again even if they invited me for free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny rooms, bad facilities. First the electricity didn't work. now the air conditioning doesn't work and we woke up to a cold morning. They consider room for barely one person as if they fit for 2. Don't stay  [END]
[BEGIN] location - great, front desk - okay, no elevator - expected, bedroom filthy -horrid, since I was booked for the week and no extra funds, I bought cleaning supplies and cleaned it myself, apparently maids do not like to climb steps! I was on 5th floor.  [END]
[BEGIN] the only thing good about this hotel was the staff- its old and out dated, stink, dusty, and the rooms are very small - I would not recommend my dog to stary there  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there on Oct 2 and woke up to over 20 bed bug bites. They comped the room but damn these bites itch. It was in room 304. Otherwise its a 3 star hotel. Staff was gracious and nice about the situation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very noisy as 24 hour building site operating across the road on the world trade centre site- stay here only if you don't wish to sleep. Staff very unhelpful. Computers and phone system continually down. Far from everything and not many dinig options close by. give this hotel amiss.  [END]
[BEGIN] Couldn't really fault the hotel. Our room was spotless and the location fantastic. We would definitely stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Certain staff members were rude. Loud in evening. They don't do daily trash/room clean ups. It smells.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room 789. Gross, filthy. This is not a $99 a night room. It's more like a $5 a night junkie/hooker motel. Run as far and as fast as you can away from this hell hole. Your better off sleeping in the subway!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a dormitory room. Bed very low on the floor., and very uncomfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are small, cold, tacky. We payed $$$$$ for a suite and they messed up. The manager said "we are fully committed" did nothing for us. Awful service! Plus on top of that the parking people damaged our car. STAY AWAY  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst hotel in the world, a disgrace, water was off and staff didnt care,room not serviced and construction going on outside room, rooms tiny, dirty looking bed sheets, phone in room not working,Very bad value for your money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room dirty; floor apparently under construction; filthy windows; disgusting bathroom. BAD,BAD, BAD!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have send a package to the hotel but never received. I have the post office confirmation that the package was delivered at the hotel 9 days ago and so for nothing. The staff doesn't seem to care about it. No a trust worthy hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dont stay here if you like clean bathrooms, without bugs, hot waer, ripped beds and unhelpful staff. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I requested that the travel agent not book me at this hotel again. The shuttle driver took forever to pick us up and it seriously smelled like a wet dog in the hallway and in the room. There were hairs in the bathroom which creeped me out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Request a king bed with hotel stay and they reserved a queen room. Hotel staff not knowledgeable of hilton rewards or hilton services. If you don't travel with conditioner, don't expect this hotel to provide this common hotel service. Over priced, didn't gedt my monies worth.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been in many FS hotels around the world and in most of them i had a great time. The rooms are big but the furniture is outdated and comparable to a 3 star hotel. Absolutely NOT WORTH THE MONEY SPENT. FS must renovate and beautify the depressing rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel super buen Ubicado!! no hay hotel en Times Square con mejor ubicacion! pero al parecer relizar limpieza cada mes , a la persona con la que iba la atacaron unas Chinches y al parecer la contagiaron de algo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not stay in this hotel, i returned home with bed bug bites! Hotel manager is rude and should be fired (Shafiq). Hotel use to be called Red Roof, seriously pay more to stay in a hotel that you are safe and clean in.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed at this hotel over 10 times in 2 years. The staff are great, the loation is great, the restuarant is excellent... you can't go wrong- and what a great price too!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had the worst experience at the W Times Square. I wouldnt know where to start complaining o I better leave that. In NY you have plenty of hotels - but dont book this one. Marvin  [END]
[BEGIN] We loved Manhattan but felt that for the full price we were paying for the room it was extortionate and the service poor. We felt like a number rather than a valued guest. Complaints fell on deaf ears.  [END]
[BEGIN] Filthy kitchen, bedbugs in many rooms, & Horrible customer service. I suggest staying at the much better Intercontinental hotel next door  [END]
[BEGIN] I saw 2 matresses on two seperate floors removed as well as the bedding. Several of our friends and their kids had bites all throughout the week. Terrible experience and the hotel was dirty! Never ever waste your money on this hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] better to sleep on the street you do not have a lobby and extra charges for everything if been there once you will never come back there  [END]
[BEGIN] Dont stay here unless you want your car burglarized.  [END]
[BEGIN] checked in ,wih a confirmed room and confirmed corpoate rate- but the hotel was overbooked, so they tried to jack the rate ....be careful, check you bill ! rooms are dark and in need of maintenance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel Pennsylvania on 7th Avenue, opposite Penn station, is the filthiest hotel I've ever visited. Hotestly, I doubt the have cleaned it since it was built long time ago.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have stayed at this hotel since the Pre-opening. Service has gone from excellent to non existent. Prices have more than doubled. Do not stay here unless you like over paying for terrible service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't go there: front desk acts very unprofessional, their valet parking is a joke (it takes 1 1/2 hours to have your car parked one block away), and they like to overcharge your mini bar usage. Over-hyped and over-priced, I am not impressed at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] dirty, disgusting rooms in desperate need of renovation. Unclean bedsheets, mushrooms on the wall, dust, pubic hairs. After having our room changed for 3 times, and encountering a cockroach in room nr. 4 we decided to leave. despite the great location, this is absolutely not worth any money...  [END]
[BEGIN] how on earth did restaurant insieme get one star from Michelin? soulless food and a waitress who dared to bring warm white wine to the table of a restaurant where one ends up with a 100$ per person bill. Stay away from it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The price for the room was over $700 and it did not include breakfast. The staff is stif, and not friendly. The one good thing is the location; central park is beautiful.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel is ok, but what is unacceptable is that there were cockroaches in my room and other insects. Totally unacceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The major construction project on the back side of the hotel starts right at 6am. Very loud and very annoying. Surly staff and barely sanitary. The staff's answer to deal with the construction was "buy ear plugs.". Really helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought since eastobook.com seemed reputable, I had found a treasure. Wrong, wrong wrong. Dangerous, dishonest place. Gave me the creeps. Did not stay. I know I would have regretted staying. The building is condemned. Some of the rooms are also condemned. I can't understand why/how it is still operating.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was calling them to figure out the rate and vacancy. The guy speaking to me spoke Chinese for a while and then English for another while. And he even rudely hang up my phone when I didn't hear him clearly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Their phone reservation system is aweful -- no one answers. The hallways and rooms could be the filmset for the movie "Taxi". The rooms are very out of date, dirty, and smell bad. Stay away, unless you can't afford better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not stay in this hotel. Don't be fool by the cheap prices. The customer service is terrible. They say they do not take credit cards, but they will charge your account if they believe they have the right to do so. Do not give your credit card number!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is the best thing about this hotel. It's close to Central Park and Theatre District and Columbus Circle. The problem is the rooms - stained carpet, sagging beds, no amenities such as glasses in room, coffee maker, or any amenities.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small room, tiny bathroom - no shelf to put toothbrush on etc. No coffee making facility. No assistance with luggage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ongelofelijk slecht hotel in alle opzichten. Onvriendelijk personeel, vieze kamers, ouderwetse inrichting, afbladderende verf, lawaaierige airco, geen wifi op kamer, betalen voor bewaren van je bagage, lange wachttijden bij inchecken. Bijna elke week moet ik een hotel bezoeken voor mijn werk en dit is de slechtste ervaring in vele jaren.  [END]
[BEGIN] try to find somewhere else.This hotel is like a drive in motel .Needs a refurb  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is a total disaster, no hot water, no toilets (or damaged/dirty), looks like a slums, no cleaning... it's like a 3rd world....  [END]
[BEGIN] Price to high. Management could care less if you were dissatisfied and they are unwilling to help with your complaint  [END]
[BEGIN] The service is terrible. The hotel manage couldn't provide the room type that I have prebooked (non-smoking room). She didn't apologize and said that either I took the smoking room/handicap room or leave it. My business is not important to them.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a horrible stay. The hotel was full of filth. Service was non existent. The staff seemed to be interested only in the "more important" guests. The hotel was full of shady looking characters. Your money would be better spent elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] There are MAJOR constructions in this hotel. The constructions start at 7h am every morning. I do not recommend it. It's dangerous and full of dirt. The staff was very good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] When I tried to check in with a confirmed reservation they denied me a room and forced me to wait several hours to sort out their mistake. The manager is very unhelpful and I suspect dishonest. I would not stay at this hotel despite its convenient location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thought I was paying for 4 star hotel. Rooms ordinary. Antique box tv. Peter on front desk not helpful. Called Alfredo Useless fake politeness. Told breakfast included then charged over 230 dollars for buffet continental breakfast, refuse to resolve issue. Family unfreindly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worst place I have ever stayed in!!!! Could not shower water temp was only SCORCHING HOT!!!! Elevators took 40 minutes if you were lucky! We were on the 11th floor and had to lug our luggage up and down!!!! Staff very unfriendly and basically did not care  [END]
[BEGIN] They tried to charge me $300 for smoking in the room,neither my wife or I smoke,the bed was uncomfortable also,what a rip off  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is horrible! The entire management, from the front desk to the general manager, are unprofessional, unhelpful, belligerent, antagonistic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Upon checkin they forced me to pay to use their 'Business Center' to print out the reservation email which I already had on my iPhone. I had prepaid for the room via an agent and the hotel charged my card again and refused to refund.  [END]
[BEGIN] All of the hotel staffs including the reservation manager are not willing to listen to their customers complaint about their hotel including the way they do business with their own vendors. Stay out of this hotel. You will be regretted!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] motel 6- 2900 West Sam Houston Parkway South, Houston, TX 77042 i booked an room from 07/12 -07/15 but i had to leave by night 2 drug infested with reek of marijuana in air!!! now i cant get my money back $42.11 n you think?  [END]
[BEGIN] While the location is great, the hotel is awful! The room was dark, dated and had an odor. The air conditioning didn't work- despite the fact that I complained twice. Bathroom fixtures were coming off the wall. Hallways are dark and creepy. Elevators are small and slow.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was awakened at 3:30 AM with water leaking from the ceiling and dripping on me and the bed. Management staff was very unresponsive to the problem. The ceiling had several poor patch jobs and was peeling in other spots. I'd stay away from this hotel brand.  [END]
[BEGIN] This independently owned Sheraton refused to refund us after we had to cancel our trip due to Hurricane Irene. Poor leadership and bad customer service describe my experience with this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] My meeting was a disaster. Internet repeatedly failed. Cell phones don't work well in meeting rooms. Temperature of room was either too hot or too cold. Management was unaccountable. The food made us queasy... The place has become dirtier since my last visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Habitacion vieja sin renovar RUIDO infernal de la calle y de los aparatos de la habitacion " aire acondicionado" secador y otros aparatos sin funcionar "suite junior" 250 $ la noche por 15 noches Personal de recepcion hotel con muy poca atencion y sin dar ninguna facilidad  [END]
[BEGIN] ridiculuosly small old bathrooms slow hot elevators hot hallways security people bothering you while your having cocktails and just laughing ??????????  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible place....almost $400 dollars a night for a room that made it impossible to take two steps without bumping into a wall, table or your significant other....Oh...and a great view to a...wall...made me think I was a character in The Shawshank Redemption....Silly decoration and terrible customer service...avoid.  [END]
[BEGIN] The elevators smelled like raw sewage. The appearance of the hallways and rooms is very tired and worn. Everything looked, felt, and smelled dirty. I would definitely not recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to NYC. I am still disgusted by the thought of staying there.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1. VERY rude crew 2. not that clean 3. HORRIBLE bed  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible, las habitaciones son un ASCO. El bano horrible, sucio. La cama colchon duro, almohadas duras, mal olientes, las paredes abombadas con humedad, el techo se cae, paredes sucias. Me parece una falta de respeto hacia el huesped, ofrecer una habitacion tan horrible, por un valor tan alto.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible hotel Stuff unfriendly (especially the lady in the afternoon shift in the front desk), bathroom not clean, 3 days later I'm still scratching from fleas bits. Bedding were dirty, a/c made such a horrible noise. The only good thing was the location  [END]
[BEGIN] No restaurant in the evening Hugh noise from AC No minibar No curtains to get room dark Flimmering television Not value for money  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not going to say much other than this was perhaps the worst hotel I've ever stayed in. Rude staff, incredibly gross rooms (the mattresses are ON THE FLOOR). Just beat up, old, and not even worthy of one star. Location is good if you are tourist. That's about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible customer service, overbooked on rooms, flat out lying. Lots of better more reliable hotels nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have lived and stayed in NY for the last 35 years and have not hjave this experinece almost fourhundred dollars for a one room one person stay Even thoug I changed room after compains it still was a room that was very shabby toweks threthbare lights not workimg etcetc....  [END]
[BEGIN] Consider this hotel only if you like - no hot water; stained and ripped carpet; a toilet that clogs; rust on the shower head; soiled upholstery on fabric. Seriously, I will never stay at this location again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The price is too high comparing to the quality of the room! People at front desk are so rude! Everything in this hotel is poor quality!! Terrible terrible terrible terrible I will never come back!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Left cereal and granola bars on top of the desk (computer desk). The next morning the wrappers had been shredded and the bars chewed. RATS! Bathroom and floors dirty and much dust.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have to tell you that my room does not have an air-conditioner! Just only a fan we have!! Plus, the bathroom was so dirty. Pay more money and go elsewhere ... !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Worse than your college dorm. I stay in NYC frequently and am completely disappointed in the room. Furniture is really beaten up. Walls thin. Good location but much better choices. Not at all the Weston brand.  [END]
[BEGIN] SOY DE LEON GTO MEX HE VIAJADOA TODOS LOS CONTINENTES Y POR EL PRECIO QUE ME COBRARON QUE DE MUY SATISFECHO A COMPARACION DE OTROS HOTELES DE LA MISMA UBICACION EL HOTEL ESTA MUY BIEN ADEMAS DE LIMPIO Y BIEN UBICADO TODO PERO TODO MUY BIEN  [END]
[BEGIN] Please go somewhere else the rooms are the worse i have ever seen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great conciege, but staff in bar/restaurant give new meaning to obnoxious. Rooms are small, but okay. Good location if spending most of your time down town.  [END]
[BEGIN] the rooms dirty, for check in you have to wait for hours, only rooms upon 7th floor are suitable - you have to look first how your room looks like and then have to upgrade it its not suitable .....lots of complains also from other guests...  [END]
[BEGIN] Sleeping in the street during a blizzard would be better than staying at this hell-hole. The place should be imploded. Enough said.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is disgusting dirty moldy stinking hotel that is in need of a overhaul the bathrooms are the worst so disappointed even the staff are not friendly one bit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room we had was dirty,smelly,and the bath leaked all over the floor.We swapped rooms but it was smaller only the shower was better. The luggage handlers were great but thats all,i wouldnt let my cat sleep there.  [END]
[BEGIN] can't get worst So dirty and unfriendly place Iwouldn't return there even if it's free  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is terrible. Front desk clerks have attitude.  [END]
[BEGIN] Checked out of this place as soon as I saw the room. Tiny small rooms that were dreary as he**. Seems people go there to commit suicide, because if I stayed there for a night I would've done the same. Went to Dumont which was night and day different!  [END]
[BEGIN] This Hotel was not what it sounds.....we reluctantly stayed one night and then moved! Just a few things: unknown stains on the pullout couch, burnt curtians, mold under the pullout mattress, musty smells and very dark rooms (just to list a few). I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wear a mask and sleep in your clothes Better yet leave--go somewhere else for your health Truly despicable  [END]
[BEGIN] Motel badly needs refurbishment including new windows and air conditioning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad location: ghetto-like area, very run down and far from the shopping areas Very small rooms Unprofessional staff Outrageous phone rates (I have received a 400$ phone bill for less than 40' of conversation) Avoid this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is good, but that's all. No cooling on warm fall or winter days, have to open the screen less window. Dirty, nasty, circle of hell.  [END]
[BEGIN] I woke up with red welts on my back. They moved me to a new room and offered me free breakfast. That it! I have never experienced this before and sincerely hope it never happens to me again.  [END]
[BEGIN] After arriving in New York City for a first time visit. We found an apartment building in shambles with not apartments available to be livable. We are awaiting a suppossed reimbursement. Do not Use WooGo.  [END]
[BEGIN] El peor hotel que he visitado. El cuarto sucio, el lavamanos tapado (y no habia personal para arreglarlo), el encargado de la recepcion fue grocero. Nos hospedamos durante dos noches y nunca limpiaron el cuarto ni recogieron la basura. La unica persona agradable fue el caballero de la puerta principal.  [END]
[BEGIN] The carpet in the room was wet because the shower was leaking into it !The staff were extremely pretentious.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never stay in this hotel. I booked through online. They jacked up the price when I checked in. The front desk pople are not nice. Will not recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are dirty with some red stains I guess blood on the the walls and cigarette butts on the stairs. The restrooms were noting but dirty and the whole experience was discontentment, I was over charged and was given different room and above all treated with extreme aggression.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only thing we can say good about this hotel is the view & location was awesome. However the staff was rude and completely unprofessional. The place really needs a makeover. I would never go back to this Hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] First room with a large steam leackage. Second room a frigidaire! And always asand Indian cousine smell as background.... Only location is good for this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very basic and the walls are very thin. Rooms are small and very basic. Breakfast not the best and staff are little too relaxed as in they don't pick up the phone. Not a nice place for a chic city  [END]
[BEGIN] J ai pas bien compris les deux avis mais pour un hotel d aeroport pres d IAH, je crois n avoir jamais vu un tel rapport qualite prix.. J en ai fait plusieurs dans les environs pour des prix equivalents ou superieurs mais dans sa categorie, celui ci se distingue..  [END]
[BEGIN] OK hotel, except pathetic security. My less than month old new $40,000 vehicle was vandalized during my stay. It was parked in front of the hotel between the hotel and the freeway access road. Where was their security?  [END]
[BEGIN] In two words: stay away. This property is in need of a MAJOR update and cleaning. It's dirty, noisy and not worth the outrageous rates they charge. The only good thing one can say about this hotel is its proximity to Wrigley Field.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty rooms, aircon unit ancient and clogged with 15 year of human detritus! Gross! Lumpy beds, duvets and pillows all bunched and lumpy due to age. Peeling wallpapers, nasty soaps, shampoos etc DO NOT STAY HERE!!!! Whole place needs gutting and fully refurbishment. VILE VILE VILE!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I will never in my life stay at this place again. I've stayed at much nicer looking , more courteous staff, and top of the line hotels that make this hotel look like DIRT!! It was definately not worth an almost $3,000.00 stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for two nights and my daughter was infected with tons of Bed Bug bites. I've been trying to complain to their head of Secuirty with no answer or returned phone calls.  [END]
[BEGIN] No, no - second time. The view is wonderfull - WALL  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very old and the rooms are as small as a broom closet. The TV is on a wall that can't be seen from the bed. The elevators are even smaller, bring your Xanax! The building is old and ugly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good points: location & price. The rest is terrible (!). Do not expect anything. Only sleep there and then get out asap. There is a really nice breakfast location just next to the closest MacDonald's btw.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is a joke! For $380 a night we got a musty-smelling room that was the size of a broom closet, one bar of soap for both the sink and the shower, and cheesy plastic cups. I have was stunned at the poor accomodations and low-budget amenities.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nasty hotel, no wash clothes, mold in shower, carpet needs shampooing, whole hotel smell, dresser in room 806 broke, no AC. Room 814 very nasty, I have Asthma had to change rooms, that's how I end up in Rm 806. Their restaurant was dirty and nasty.  [END]
[BEGIN] perfect location in NY, but the hotel in itself is very poor. Dated decor, unfriendly personnel, useless and grumpy concierge, VERY noisy air con, broken telly, no room service, broken down lift, the list goes on. Again, the location is perfect,but I would not recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is very cheap, but it is in a very bad part of Houston, there are many crack dealers that live here and prostitutes. Its not safe at all. Please do yourself a favor and stay out of this area and the Red Carpet Inn behind it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Romanian guy at the front desk was incredibly rude, the rooms filthy and roaches running freely. Bathrooms were smelly and filthy as well. Stay away from this creepy dive. They prey on foreigners who are vulnerable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was infested with beds bugs and my fiance and I received over 80 bites after just being in the bed for 4 hours. This hotel has no pest control measures in place and I caution anyone that plans to stay at this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's obvious the place has history - just go to the second floor and walk around unlit banquet rooms furnished with weathered leather, dark walnuts and smoke stained carpets. Might be a great place for a murder/mystery deal - but for you family and/or business travelers - not a chance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty.... microscopic SMALL rooms maybe 50 square feet. 4 stars never maybe 1 if even. No air conditioning. Worse than any hotel I have ever stayed in. I wouldn't stay here again for free.  [END]
[BEGIN] This has to be a total disaster. I would never stay there again. The rooms were really small and there were virtually no amenities. I woudl NEVER stay there again. It was a total rip off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got up next morning with no electricity, no water and no apologies from any staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room is tiny and smell like mold. Most of all, the toilet is broken. I'm very upset with the choice I have made. 4 Star is over rated for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well, we used to love this hotel, but we were just overcharged $226 on our bill, and an employee stole from our minibar and we are being charged for it. When we called to talk to a manager we were only given extremely rude workers and told to wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Warning, the hotel is undergoing renovation and there is constant construction noise (drilling, hammering, etc.) during the day on many of the floors. Given the vacancy rates in Houston these days, it is better to choose a different hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't waste your time - gross! We never unpacked - moved into the LaQuinta @ Grand Parkway!  [END]
[BEGIN] ...almeno fino alla fine dei lavori della nuova stazione metro in costruzione proprio davanti all'hotel! Il rumore assordante e continuo di giorno ma soprattutto di notte hanno reso la nostra permanenza in questa struttura un vero supplizio. La mia personale recensione e' quindi pessima a prescindere da tutto il resto.  [END]
[BEGIN] Estuvimos a fines de junio y principios de Julio... Lo unico bueno es la ubicacaion, pesima atencios y habitaciones viejas  [END]
[BEGIN] The matresses are hard as the floor. Very uncomfortable to sleep. The pipes squeaked all night. The hotel hallways are very scary and looks like the Tower of Terror at Disneyland. I left after one night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible property with poor maintenance. Had no other options due to fashion week. Rooms smelled, stained linens. Would not recomend for anyone. We were in town for business and stayed away from facility as long as possilbe. TD  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a "luxury" building that is neglected by the landlord, They have a boiler truck out front instead of heat and some tenants were without heat for 2-3 days at a time this winter. They complained but nothing was done about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Breakfast bar are nice, but the room are so dirty, hairs are every where on the bed, pillows, and blanket, so nasty. I didn't think they clean the room before give it to us, I'm very disappointed, not worth the money. I will not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] worse hotel i have come across... staff were rude room was small and super overpriced! you can get much better hotels else where. Think 100 times before you book this Tuna Can!  [END]
[BEGIN] The only good thing about this hotel is the location, right opposite Madison Square Gardens. The room was dirty, smelly and noisy. The staff were very unfriendly. I would not recommend anyone to stay in this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] A warning! We just spent three nights at Le Parker Meridien on W 57th St. in NYC and we found the service terrible. The maid service was non-existant on one day, and the concierge service was terrible. The management was totally ineffectual and unapologetic.  [END]
[BEGIN] the dirtiest smelliest hotel in the world found a large cockroach running around the bathroom on the 1st night.our teenagers in the next room were moved 5 floors away with out a explanation to a worse room DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for one night. We didn't like it at all because Terrible Maintenance, Poor Services. Sink drain, bath tub drain blocked, water was leaking from the piping all night. My friend's room next door was the same. Cub and others also very cheap ones ,its not Logo with.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was mediocre. The rates I reserved was not the same when we checked out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel close to airport, if you want to stay just one night it's OK Hotel is stuck in between motorway and railway ! nothing to do around just sleep and rest yourself. Breakfast is very poor Room was clean and the room not too noisy despite the horrible location  [END]
[BEGIN] This by far has the worst customer service, for the price we paid... I expected a much nicer front desk. Were not accomodating at all! Willnever stay here again...I'll stay at the Hilton.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was possibly the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. Horrible and unfriendly customer service, room condition was beyond awful, and the wi-fi sucked. Don't book your reservation at this hotel!!! SO NOT WORTH IT.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a mistake to trust AAA's recommendation. I would rate this place worst than "Terrible" if I could. This hotel should be demolished and the owner put in jail for ripping off people. The worst of the worst.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bathroom tiles had mold. Furniture was threadbare. Sheets had holes. Towels were stained.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not up to Starwood standards. Very poor housekeeping standards, my room was either missing towels, pillow cases each day of the stay. The property needs a major updating, it looks stuck in the '70's. There are many other properties close by, try one of those instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] D is for disgusting, which this place is. U is for unique, which is the unpleasant odor throughout the place. M is for my God, not even the bugs want to stay here. P is for please cancel your reservation. NOW!  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked this hotel from the net and judged it on the web page pictures and text. Do not be fooled. A "standard room" in this hotel is dreadful. DO NOT STAY HERE....I WILL NOT AGAIN.  [END]
[BEGIN] I know this hotel collects internet fee for $9 bucks per day. However, you will be charged for $18 bucks if you access internet with your laptop and cellphone. That's ridiculous.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are looking for a hotel with bed bugs, slow service, and no vacuum on the property, this is the place for you. Don't walk but run from this place!  [END]
[BEGIN] Walking distance to Times Square, across the street from Penn Station. Nice lobby. It goes downhill from there. The rooms are filthy, with paint peeling from the walls and ceiling. You don't want to walk on the carpets with bare feet. It is a real scuzzy place!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed at. This building is supposed to be destroyed to be replaced by a sky-scapper, and the hotel is clearly not making any efforts to keep this hotel in a decent shape.  [END]
[BEGIN] I concur with most of the negative reviews. Very expensive, yet very shabby. Bathroom is tiny, dirty and smelled of mildew. Desk had sticky stuff on it. Linens were worn. Slip cover on chair worn and dirty. Light in entranceway burned out. Decidedly downscale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible,Horrible,Horrible. Not sure what was going on but there seem to be some kind of strike. All types of people chatting something, couldn't even walk through the lobby. I guess staff don't get treating so well, I cant image how the staff will treat there guest  [END]
[BEGIN] Wanted to love this hotel!! Room temp won't go below 74, not okay. The bed feels like a lumpy pile of hay. So disappointed!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] rubbish, massively over-priced hotel in a gloomy street with tiny rooms and staff who are so "cool" and busy primping themselves in the mirror that they can't actually do their jobs properly: avoid at all costs  [END]
[BEGIN] title says it all. Staff was rude on check in and out, TV barely worked, when the door for the next room closed it shook my entire room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Over-rated hotel and everything associated with the rooftop bar is low class. Wouldn't want you to experience what we experienced.  [END]
[BEGIN] At that price, you'd like to not be treated like the dirt. I understand the trendy cooler than human W attitude but unless my bed is made, my bathroom clean, the door opened, my bags carried and the towels not frayed, stfu.  [END]
[BEGIN] una reception maleducata al 90%, una stanza con una moquette sporca, non sempre pulita, con insetti simili a scarafaggi nei cassetti, senza sala d'aspetto, con computer che costavano un dollaro per 4 minuti, ma ne succhiava anche venti dopo pochissimi minuti.  [END]
[BEGIN] i stayed at the edison for 3 days for a business trip in September 2009. I came back with scabies & bed bugs. i have been going through hell! PLEASE DO NOT STAY HERE! you will regret it!  [END]
[BEGIN] This must rate as one of the worst hotel experiences of my life. Horrible rude staff at every level: from receptionist to backroom officers. No interest in their customers. Extremely expensive for very underwhelming facilities.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fleas in the room, asked to be moved and new room old and smelly. Definitely NOT a 4 star hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Be warned, we stayed for three days and came home covered in bites. Disgusting! Our doctor said "bed bugs".  [END]
[BEGIN] Avoid at all costs. Very noisy. Minature rooms. Closed window was as if it was standing wide open in the middle of a crowded bar. Amazing people return. I will not.  [END]
[BEGIN] The agents were not helpful, friendly, or caring. The check in was not welcoming at all. The room smelled bad, and the concierge was interested in his computer more than he was of the people in front of him.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a good room go to another hotel, the bathroom had lots of mildew on the ceiling, plus the room was not very clean. This hotel belongs in a third world country, not in NY!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was the size of small closet. Rude and poorly trained staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: -Location -Price ($50 on Priceline) Cons: -Dirty rooms -Poor customer service You be the judge. I'd stay here only if you get a good deal on Priceline; otherwise, don't waste your money. Rooms were filthy and staff couldn't care less.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very noisy..The train pass by every seconds..Plus there no way we could take hot shower because there no water coming up from the sink or bath tub..It was a night mare staying at this hotel...  [END]
[BEGIN] Would not recommend this hotel to anyone, receptionists are extremely rude and rooms are dilapidated and in substantial need of updating and repair. Tap in bath fell off in my hand. Leg of sink fell off, sink leaked when used. Window to room didn't shut properly etc  [END]
[BEGIN] I checked in late night and manager and front desk was very friendly...But rooms are very old...not clean..i mean it is obvious that they tried to clean but furniture cannot be clean enough after a certain age and those were very old...rate was acceptable for NYC...  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was full of cockroaches. The airconditioner barely worked. The staff was unfriendly. The bathroom was dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] no pool, small rooms NO AMENETIES, 100$ PARKING FOR 1 NIGHT. ARE YOU KIDDING ME???? plus the room was for 500$. really there is nothing worth in that hotel..  [END]
[BEGIN] Awful hotel rooms to small gym a joke and drinks very expensive and dark and dingy big fan of morgans but never again here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location poor hotel The room was dirty, the customer service was poor both before and during the stay i would not recommend this hotel for anyone it relies on its brand and history rather than its actions  [END]
[BEGIN] Girlfriends on 1st trip to the city...great location, friendly staff, great breakfast, clean rooms, will definitely stay here on next trip!  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is a dump. I love Chicago and wanted to stay downtown, but I won't stay here again. The plaster and wall paper are coming down, the bed's lumpy. The room was nothing like clean. Go elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrible hotel. I couln't stay and had to fin another hotel in the middle of the night. The room was dirty with bugs in the bed and bathroom. Simply terrible and when talking to the manager I received a bad attitude. Do not stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have a little bit more money, take a real hotel. This "hotel" offers: no service, no help with the bags, no advice on restaurants, no good working air conditioning, no decent pillows and a very tiny room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Es un hotel horrible... llenos de chinches en las camas. Las habitaciones no tienen nada que ver con lo que hay en la foto, cualquier parecido con la realidad es pura coincidencia. En fin...no os lo recomiendo Buscaros otro hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] stay away, slightly better than a park bench. This place is dirty, staff does not speak english, no reason to stay there if you have any other options - next time, might prefer the park bench.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used Hotels Tonight for the first & possibly last time after this room. At check-in the front desk agent was rude and overall miserable. I waked up to the room only to find it without a window! Zero ventilation, mold, very bad... stay away. Brian  [END]
[BEGIN] Be warned about this place, none of the photos on any of the hotel websites look anything like the dark dingy rooms and corridors we ended up in. Falsely advertised and not recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] My room had a bad smell that got better if I left the AC on--but then I froze. The choice was to endure the bad smell or freeze. The breakfast was very minimal and the jelly/jam appeared to be old (dried up). The front desk person at night was grouchy.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff is some of the rudest people I have ever incountered in the hotel business. I travel a lot for work and have never come across such lazy and rude people. Save your money and go somewhere else. Hotels are not supposed to treat their guest this way.  [END]
[BEGIN] if i wasn't so tired from the drive i would have run once i opened my door to my room. no latches, spots on the carpet, the maids are rude and they don't speak any english. the ceiling looked as though it would fall through. the furniture was old. Gross.  [END]
[BEGIN] My a/c did not work for the 2 and 1/2 days we were there, I was over charged for the room and there were long blackhairs in my bed.  [END]
[BEGIN] super loud- you'll need earplugs. amazingly small rooms, had to jump from one bed to get to the other bed and supposedly we paid extra to get a 'better/bigger' room. Lots of better hotels in NYC, don't bother here.  [END]
[BEGIN] do NOT go there until the adjacent construction is complete. Jack hammers started at 7am...on the 16th floor...ripples in the bedside glass...Bose noise canceling headsets and earplugs no help. No warning upon checkin it was happening. No apology from hotel staff. BAD SERVICE - BAD stay  [END]
[BEGIN] DON'T EVEN CONSIDER THIS PLACE -- Everything others have posted is flattering, to say the least -- I am surprised the rats even stick around!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor hotel/unenjoyable stay. I found the Reception staff in particular rude, unpleasant and generally unhelpful. Not up to required standard. There must be better places to stay while in Houston.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had to change hotels because the carpet in our room smelled old from the humidity. We had to leave after one night due to smell.  [END]
[BEGIN] EVERYONE, Don't listen to other comments, the hotel is INFESTED with BED BUGS. If you choose to stay, be prepared to have a hell of a night with bugs biting you and having to deal with the bites all day, that could be infectious. NOT RECOMMENDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Old room, front desk personnel did not know how to extend my stay, iron was dirty and almost ruined my clothes, bed was uncomfortable as were the pillows, door did not seal properly, and the floor has low spots that feel like I am going to fall through.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 3 nights, in November didn't realise that we would be sharing with unwelcome guests and paid in blood  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at this Motel because my empolyer set it up. The smell made me sick. Dogs and Cats pee all over the carpets and they are never cleaned. The staff was pleasent. Thats about all I can say that is NICE!!! Very sad:( Location was great, lots of Restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] The dirty front windows should have been a clue. The only thing I can say good is that they do have a big breakfast that is included in the cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] Checked in, took off my shoes and found not one, not two, but THREE DEAD COCKROACHES throughout the room. Absolutely disgusting. The front desk guy checked me out and wouldn't even book me another hotel. STAY AWAY!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff told us to park around back- car was broken into and everything was stolen. WORST part of The area according to the police. HIGH CRIME area, Staff was Willfully neglectful- offered no help whatsoever, Rude- lazy and uncaring. Not family friendly, Bring protection if you stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] When I was at The Belnord it seemed adequate, even though we had no storage space. However, I got home a few days ago and am covered in bed bug bites from head to toe. Do not stay here unless you like bed bugs!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Similar to other reviews, no rooms available when purchased under the Living Social deal. Only a few during a whole month, during the week. I don't think so. Seems the deal showed the hotel's true colors. Waiting to hear if Living Social will refund my money.  [END]
[BEGIN] pour info sachez qu'un coup de fil de 30 secondes pour la France vous couteras 21 dollars,et pas d'infos sur ces tarifs dans la chambre,le personel vous indique que c'est comme ca et peut importe,j'ai fait beaucoup d'hotel a NY et celui la ne me revera plus c'est sur...  [END]
[BEGIN] All the doors banged shut, the plumbing was very noisey , the walls were paper thin and the noise could be heard from many floors. Good location large rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to know what hell is like, then stay in this hotel. Smelly, noisy, bathrooms leaking water, unfriendly personnel, bad and small beds and pillows. If you are lucky they will put you away from the elevators.  [END]
[BEGIN] The website photos are obivously fake, the rooms are vile, the "facilities" offered in bathroom and WC are hardly what one would expect for what they charge. The worst place I have ever stayed in. Avoid this dump at all costs!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Es un hotel muy bien situado el lobby esta lindo, pero las habitaciones son chicas y el clset tenia hongospor la humedad.. si hongos como algodon!! no pude dormir bien despues de eso, si fuera limpio seria una buena opcion pero no esta limpio.  [END]
[BEGIN] Both of my laptops were stolen and a new wireless hard drive. There was no forced entry, so either the maid left the door open or she did the deed herself. I am attaching the police report so Trip Advisor knows this is the real deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] this was a worse hotel i ever ben the room that my boyfriend and i stay over the wekend we were very diapponmet how the rom look it was not worth to stay the walls look bad some people were rude too i do not avised people to stay there  [END]
[BEGIN] The website is very misleading. Glossy pictures and a nice flash reservations system, are not a true representation of this hotel. The rooms are the worst I have stayed in. They are tiny, dirty and not really fit to keep a dog in. We'll be asking for a refund.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty, dingy and overpriced. I feel sorry for all the tourists they lure to the hotel. You can stay somewhere much nicer for half the price. I will say that the staff tried their best given the conditions.  [END]
[BEGIN] One minute walk from Times Square, good price, but the building is really run down.Old and outdated furniture, we stayed here twice. First room was bad, but second time was even worse. Mold on the ceiling, nothing but a bed and an old bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] No vending machines, limited hours for the restaurant and room service. Go to the grocery store before heading up to your room because if you get hungry in the middle of the night, you won't get any help in the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff actually lies to you. If you request something they say yes and then do nothing about it. All the staff if uptight and obnoxious. The hotel is dirty and there were creatures walking around in the night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never again. Room smelled so bad. No more complimentary coffee in the morning. They have the guts to charge for wifi for rooms at $400 a night!! And no more wifi in lobby. Flatotel went cheap cheap cheap. Good bye forever.  [END]
[BEGIN] we paid a little extra to get an executive king room... was not worth it at all  [END]
[BEGIN] my husband and i have just came back from there it was terrible , dirty , paper and paint peeling from walls and ceiling,plus holes in walls,carpets filthy and threadbare,i did not sleep whilst there as would not sleep in the bed  [END]
[BEGIN] A $240 room rate and they want $13 bucks for wifi? Per day? Breakfast buffet cancelled so you pay $12 for 2 pieces of cold toast and jelly that someone else had previously used. Seriously? It looks nice, but you;re just a number. Go somewhere that cares about your experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the Hudson Hotel in December, 2004, along with several co workers. It was dark, gloomy, and dreadful. Plumbing problems, too--lack of hot water! When we told the front desk, they did give a 25% discount but it seemed like too little, too late. Very, very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like moth-ball scented rooms with mice? Stay here! My roommate could reach both ends of the room with her hand and foot when she stretched sideways. Pay the extra $20 for a better place!  [END]
[BEGIN] I paid for a Times square view right off there website and they told me that that room was only available at check in.  [END]
[BEGIN] The stuff is unfriendly and unhelpul. The rooms and the bathrooms are nothing special and the rates are high for what they offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked 3 nights and stayed for 30 minutes. The hallways smelled like homeless people and the room smelled like an ashtray. The guy at the front desk was obviously high, everything about this place sucked. Don't even consider staying here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty, loud, smelly, smallest bathtub I have ever seen it is about one foot tall, no closet, no drapes, and peeling wallpaper. Complained and they did not care.  [END]
[BEGIN] Old, dirty, crowded, rooms are in such bad conditions, broken lamps, furniture, and no words for the wc and shower, avoid this hotel even the location is perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] I currently found a lower rate through expedia for a the same rate room through bestwestern but they refused to match the price. The customer service has not been helpful. It's very unfortunate they've lost a customer for life, for a simple price match.  [END]
[BEGIN] No Room service,Does not even have a sign to find the hotel.Overpriced.Charges you for poor internet service.Don't stay here.I have never stayed in a hotel as overpriced as this one. I do not mind paying for good service and good amenities.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not stay here. The employees steal from your rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms in this hotel are tiny. Plus, you cannot have your own drinks at the mini bar, they would charge you for removing existing stuff. In addition, I did not get SPG points because I booked through Expedia (contrary to what the staff stated).  [END]
[BEGIN] Dreadful, small dark unfriendly staff! I realise this is New York but this was awfuk window looked onto a concrete wall, didnt open. room so tiny I coudlnt open my case!  [END]
[BEGIN] booked in to the hotel for four nights. There was no one to sort out the sheets and no one to take messages. Not a place to stay unless you had to.  [END]
[BEGIN] No internet (even at lobby), crappy and small room, nothing is good about this hotel.. Its called boutique hotel in expedia undisclosed hotels booking..please stay away from this hotel..  [END]
[BEGIN] As you say, you get what you pay for, but even chain Motels are better than this! I would NEVER advise any friend of mine to stay here as I would be to embaressed. Excellant location, but oh dear what a dump! Dreadful!  [END]
[BEGIN] The showers are full of mildew. Service is bad. The rooms are unbelievably small. The walls are paper thin. The decor is awful and nauseating. Way, way, way over priced!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Old and dirty!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Que horror de hotel que verguenza es para denunciar al hotel y a las agencias que lo ofrecen peor que una mala pesion peor aun.. ni se os ocurra ir.. estoy indignadisima.  [END]
[BEGIN] DO NOT STAY HERE if you need to guarantee your reservation. We got to the Hotel at 11pm - had a reservation and they said they were overbooked and had no rooms. It turned into a very UGLY experience. PLEASE BEWARE and STAY AWAY!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The location of the hotel is the one saving grace for the Affinia 50. We found the rooms to be dark, noisy and dated with poor customer service. I would not recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Atendimento horroroso, o hotel estava cheio e falaram que nossa reserva havia sido cancelada. Tivemos que voltar no outro dia e fizemos checkin sem problemas. Fomos mal atendidos pela recepcionista e pelo gerente.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chambres sales salle de bain degradee jamais nettoyee pendant le sejour hotel vieillot a besoin d'une renovation nous etions quatre d'age differents et nous somme d'accord sur le commentaire. valable pour une clientele jeune et pour un tres court sejour  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for 2 weeks over easter very dissapointed when we arrived nothing like what it shows on the website, got moved once still YUK staff very rude asked to see manager and ended up in club room which was OK still nothing special!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Find another hotel. Room was dirty smelled and the sink wouldn't drain. Paid For the night before to have a room ready when I arrived. Was told when I arrived they were very busy and it was hard to find an available room  [END]
[BEGIN] This Hotel is the worst i have ever experienced. very tinny rooms broken furniture and dirty. i would never go there.  [END]
[BEGIN] non fate certo una bella figura a tenere nella vs lista alberghi cosi,toglietelo !  [END]
[BEGIN] Uncaring Staff and a HUGH RAT outside front door, a terrible experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Te hacen hacer un deposito con tu tarjeta de credito del 20%, (es obligatorio dicen) y luego no lo descuentan del pago contado que tienes que hacer una vez que llegas. Es mentira lo del los 22 dolares, termina siendo 28,45 por dia!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] 90+ degree days - little or no A/C. Used condom found in the bathroom, which was dirty in additon to this -- shabby furniture (pull out couch broken) breakfast room understaffed and not very clean - overall this place is a dump  [END]
[BEGIN] Camere piccolissime e pulizia carente....molto carente. unica nota positiva la posizione:a due passi da Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms dirty and small. No customer service. Inaccurately charge your credit card and you have to fight like the dickens to get your refund. BEWARD - very poorly run.  [END]
[BEGIN] Price quoted was not price charged, poor value, poor room compared to Crowne plaza in uk  [END]
[BEGIN] Ho soggiornato qui per il mio viaggio di nozze. Camere piccoline mia cugina ha avuto addirittura problemi con il water che portava indietro acqua e rifiuti invece di scaricare. Non lo consiglio affatto a parte per la posizione centralissima ma credo ce ne siano di migliori in zona  [END]
[BEGIN] A hotel decorated like we are still in the Nineties. Clearing living off past glories. Rooms still have TVs you would not buy off eBay and an AV system that continually broke. Avoid - lots better value in close range.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were waiting to check in when a young couple rushed in front of us and demanded a refund due to bedbugs in their room. Needless to say we stayed elsewhere. There are several nice hotels in the immediate area. Beware of this one!  [END]
[BEGIN] Look at the pictures. The rooms looked terrible upon arrival, and had not been cleaned for a long, long time. Some of the room doors had marks after break in and the whole place felt very, very unsafe. It is not all about location and price. Stay away !!  [END]
[BEGIN] The bedbugs were not as bad as the staff's non-reaction and overall terrible attitudes. We could live with tired old rooms for $250 but seriously EVERY aspect of the staff there was terrible. Yes, we have several of our group get bug bites. STAY away , what a terrible place.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have recently stayed for a night at the Travel Inn Hotel on W 42nd Street & 10th Ave. We felt that it is over priced and has very poor service.  [END]
[BEGIN] the star rating on this hotel in inflated. exaggerating the star rating is the latest thing with on line travel sites. the hotel is dark and dirty. it has bed bugs. it is a 2 star property on it's best day  [END]
[BEGIN] I arrive the beds were dirty and the room was very tiny not even if I paid 30 dollars I paid 200 dollars for a small double. The bathroom does not work well either I do not suggest not well managed  [END]
[BEGIN] * Rodent infested * Telephone in room didn't work * Room not made on a daily basis * Ceiling leaked * Bathroom door didn't shut properly * Built up hair clogged shower drain * Wall socket powerpoints were ancient & plugs would fall out of them  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has rooms that are seriously in need of repair--wallpaper coming off the walls, ventilation system that doesn't work, etc. No minibar or many other features one would expect of even a "three star" hotel, which this certainly is not.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel needs an extreme makeover. It was incredibly disappointing. The location has a great deal of potential.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are incredible small, unclean and damaged. The toilettes were disgusting! My friend locked the door and couldn't open it after, so it took here 1/2 an hour to get free! The people were not very friendly. The Location was the only part I liked about this stay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Smells like Cigarette smoke and bug spray. This is a flea bag motel. If you are looking for a quaint and comfortable hotel... LOOK ELSEWHERE. The health department should close this place down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent 1 day here, rooms are dirty, staff is rude, and beds have bed bugs. Don't stay here, you will regret it.  [END]
[BEGIN] el hotel es bonito pero la atencion en el concierge es terrible. nos quisieron cobrar una limo cuando pedimos un sedan (dos veces) y el precio muy elevado. la comida terrible... para el que habla frances le gustaria pero prefiero recomendar " el hilton nuevo "  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked a room for Thanksgiving Day 2010. Arrived at their 17 West 32nd Street location only to find an abandoned building. Besides the untold inconvenience, it makes me wonder if the reservation website is a scam to rip off credit card numbers.  [END]
[BEGIN] #1 hotel for bedbugs. The only thing that can improve this hotel is for it to be torn down. Dirty, dirty dirty. Nothing at all good to say about it. This hotel will ruin your stay in NYC. Paying more is worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was dirty, whole bulding smelled like smoke, appliances were no working, HOTEL NEEDS MAJOR REMODELING!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was horrible the staff had an attitude. I couldn't believe how bad the services are. I don't recommend this hotel to anyone...  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely unfriendly, even hostile personnel. I even wonder WHY they keep them there. Do NOT recommend to anyone! There are better hotels in the same price range just 2 blocks away in every direction. Follow the advice not to be dissappointed later. Good luck!  [END]
[BEGIN] Another horrible hotel that should never have been called a hotel room. There was no room. Worst amenities in the world. could not use the bath until you closed the door. Torn shower curtain and frayed carpeting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Treated as second class citizen when booking through Hotwire. DON'T risk it !  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was about the size of a prison cell. The bed was too short for my friend who is 6 foot 2. For 200 dollars a night you don't even get an ensuite bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] Teeny tiny room with a bed right inside the door. Kept hitting my head in the tv located right next to what appeared to be dressing table.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel vecchio e con gravi carenze strutturali stanze piccole e mal curate nell'aspetto e nelle comodita. Personale reception sgarbato e scortese. Mancaza totale di una sua personalita se non quella dovuta al suo nome.  [END]
[BEGIN] They promised a room with one (adult sized) bed and gave us two "twins" that are smaller than standard children's beds. They would not let us out of our reservation or change rooms. And they were unprofessional to us and our travel agent. TERRIBLE, RUDE service. DO NOT STAY HERE.  [END]
[BEGIN] One and a quarter hours just to be checked in. The first night's rooms were on the 5th floor and were awful! After compaining we were moved to the 10th floor, at 11:30pm we supervised the cleaning of our own room!  [END]
[BEGIN] Scary how disgusting a hotel this is ! Wouldn't recommend this hotel to an axe murderer! Actually think I saw quite a few staying in this flop house.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our rooms were a real let down, dirty sheets, and curtains, thick dust on and around the room. I wouldn't recommend this to anybody!  [END]
[BEGIN] I live across the street from the Allerton. It's not a hotel, it's a homeless shelter. Why it has a website and all is beyond me..  [END]
[BEGIN] One short item: After coming back to my room after being out all day, the door was not locked. Needless to say, not a good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not be deceived by the website. This hotel was aweful. Looks like never renovated. Thought we were entering an Alfred Hitchcock movie. Moved to 4 different rooms. Wanted to relocate, but child was there with a school group, so really had to stay. Bought flip flops for shower.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed a few days and found the" superior room" shabby with a bath tub with a large chip (5 inches radius). Well past it's prime!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I find it interesting that the common social economic group this hotel wants to diffrentiate is the 30 somehting group. It was not welcoming to our group of griends in the lobbly and I found it quite odd. I believe it's or the "see and be seen crownd".  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff were not only unhelpful, but they stole/lost something, then lied about it. Management was belligerent and definitely didn't put the guest first. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL. For the cost, the accomodations were lacking, but most importantly, service was abysmal.  [END]
[BEGIN] The inside reality of this hotel does not match the outside perception of these previous reviews. This hotel has really gone downhill since my last stay 4 years ago.The staff at the Paramount has become very seedy and unwellcomming. I will not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its says it all  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at this hotel over christmas and could not believe the state of the place. The locks dont work the showers have no hot water in actual fact if it was being used as a hotel in Ireland i think it would be condemmed. Martin Dublin  [END]
[BEGIN] Just think New York should have a standard before got there, but wrong, totally wrong! Come home now with bed bugs bite, maybe even take home the bed bugs! Watch youtube and search Hotel Carter in New York you will see how awful it is! Warning-bed bugs!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The headline says it all. Roaches in the rooms! NEVER will I stay here again and I didn't even get my room credited. That's poor customer service. Avoid at all costs.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a dump of a hotel and the elevator broke down the other night and a human being was on it. It is totally dangerous  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location...decent but overpriced rooms. Checked in and was told one rate....got bill for TWICE as much. I would stay away from this place with more trustworthy choices nearby!  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not consider the Hudson if you are over 20 years old and over four feet tall. Night vision would be useful - it's so dark. Oh, yes don't forget to bring your earplugs!  [END]
[BEGIN] Left the hotel covered with bedbug bites after a weekend stay. Also, wasn't told when I made the reservation that my room was a 5th floor walk up!! Cannot get anyone from the hotel to return my calls. Absolutely dreadful experience --- beware!  [END]
[BEGIN] bastante malo el hotel sucio y un trato bastante malo solo es buena la ubicacion  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was nice and tried to accomodate us, but the bottom line is that this place is a dump. The rooms are dingy. They use WAY too much scented air freshener or carpet fresh or something. We won't ever be staying there again for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] So bad I wanted to leave but was too tired. I travel a lot. I've stayed in some bad hotels but this was the worst. Don't stay here no matter how cheap the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would not stay again due to being biten alive by bed bugs. I thought it was fleas at first but i couldn't see anything so i knew it was bed bugs. I have only just come home so i just hope I havn't brought them with me.  [END]
[BEGIN] This New York hotel is the most disgusting, time waster experience. If you want to spend over 60 min. wating to get checked in, sleep on a bed that does not give any confort of clean and you like unsannitary smells this is the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Please, try to avoid this horrible hotel. Elevators are a disaster, the staff is so rude and un polite. If you look for clearness don't look the floor of the bathroom after 2 days. I will never come back. Try New Yorker, is by far better than this "hotel"  [END]
[BEGIN] staff that couldnt care less, trainstation ambience, crumbeling rooms with old torn carpets, cracked flaking tub, etc. no bedbugs and the room was at least clean. bag service is 4$ per bag. dont go there  [END]
[BEGIN] My family stayed here to attend my graduation. We were 10 minutes late checking out and were charged a $115 dollar fee that the Manager refused to take off. Really poor way to treat the guest.  [END]
[BEGIN] First room was tiny, musty, bathroom had mould, when I complained I was offered another room at double the cost. Very disappointing experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude and unfriendly staff, my room was only cleaned once in a whole week. Microscopic rooms, no mini bars, old smelly AC. It is really overpriced comparing to other offers.  [END]
[BEGIN] this NYMA really has problem, my friends check in by used their VISA card n when they back to their country, the bank statement shown some online shopping transaction records. My friends never shop anything online in the States. So everyone, be careful!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Starwood chain is nuts to rank this as a 4 star hotel. The room was visibly dirty - a large water stain on the ceiling, mold in the bathroom, and the mattress was visibly concave. I would NEVER stay here or suggest it to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are handicapped, don't stay here. No valet parking, long walk to park, very dis-couraging. Nice view of the city, I enjoyed the food. Small Rooms need updating, dusty room, the most I have ever seen in a hotel, ever. I will look elsewhere when returning to Chicago.  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay here was an unfortunate start to my family cruise vacation. Poor service, dirty rooms, especially the bathrooms! And overall poor experience!  [END]
[BEGIN] We check in and check right out, after looking at two different room, the hotel sucks dirty carpet, 1970's furniture not a fresh smell, need too be remodel!!!. The front desk clerk said too me always check the rating most time tells the truth.The hotel is in a great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] If your stuck on a lay over in Houston stay someone else!! The rooms are dirty, needs updating and bug infested. The food is just off and on the verge of going bad. We got sick!! There is a reason the rooms are so darn cheap!! Stay somewhere else!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is old, outdated- no refrigerator or microwave in the room. The location is awful and the hotel restaurant is awful. There were bugs in the hotel. I would not stay here ever again even if I were being paid to. GROSS!  [END]
[BEGIN] Super hotel! Was mn vierde keer in NY dit was het beste hotel tot nu toe! Ik was met mijn 2 jongens van 7 en 17 jaar. De kamer was zeer ruim voor New Yorkse begrippen en mooi ingericht en schoon. Ook de badkamer was ruim en mooi.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can't begin to guess felipeplaza's standards. This may be the worst hotel I've ever experienced. Filthy, broken, smelly, overpriced. Disgusting at any price -- outrageous for what we paid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not worth the money.After one night we checked out.No water for 3-4 hrs.Room was 7by8.No were to put suitcases except in front of door.How does this hotel pass health & safety codes?  [END]
[BEGIN] For $150-ish after taxes, this was the worst hotel I've ever stayed in for that kind of money. I have stayed in worse, but usually in the $30 a night range, years back. Paint was pealing. Room blah, blah, blah! An embarrassment for the Ramada chain!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was the worst hotel I ever stayed in, the paint was peeling from the walls, curtains had big stains. I had to sleep in my clothes. Don't go there! I booked through priceline.  [END]
[BEGIN] Situato a 5 minuti da Time Square,posizione centralissima. Camera piccola,mancanza di armadio,bagno al limite dello spazio 1mt x 1mt ,pulizia pessima,problemi con la chiusura della porta.Da consigliare solo a chi vuole spendere pochissimo rispetto alla posizione centrale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty room and bathroom, nasty people and bad service... old and stinky  [END]
[BEGIN] Attendant totally lazy and provided false info in order not to move or do anything. Rooms have moss which is unhealthy. only good thing about it is location. noisy outside due to construction but they promised a quiet room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing has been done to update the hotel. It is dirty and the bathrooms were disgusting. The location is fabulous! Carpet was disgusting. Housekeeping does not do a good job, they must not have vacuum cleaners.  [END]
[BEGIN] Front desk personel was EXTREMELY rude and ruined my entire stay. Check-in person, Helen, was rude from the moment I arrived. Because of this person, who the hotel insists on employing, I will never stay there again and insist that no personel from my company ever book a room there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Terrrible! I can't find the words to discribe this..."hotel" very SMALL rooms, airconditioning did not worked, power went out, no elevators, dark, and for the price you pay, you can find something better.  [END]
[BEGIN] NOT as represented; horrible rooms; extremely rude staff; unsafe environment; don't even consider staying here!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] As not knowing this hotel, i booked a cheap single room, which can easily be compared with a prison cabin: Tiny, dirty horrible.After 2 nights changed into an expensive double-room, which was pretty and clean. No accomodations rude frontdesk-service after all. I recommend better not go! P.M.  [END]
[BEGIN] Foul smelling... even for a non smoking room. Upon further inspection there was mold growing on the mattresses. There was also hair all over the sheets.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband & I have stayed before & I loved every moment we shared at the hotel including the restaurants. This time, the rooms were dirty, the service was slow, the food was marginal and the drinks were poor. We were very disappointed. We will not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prices are very high but there are few services. No newspaper, No Platinum services, tiny rooms, no checkout folio. Restaurant is not run by the hotel and is extortionately priced for very little. Luckily, there are hosts of excellent restaurants nearby and it is beside Carnegie Hall.  [END]
[BEGIN] stay somewhere else if you can afford it. Rooms are tiny,dirty,poorly lighted and noisy. There is supposed to be security on site but people still worked on their car at 2:00am or partied all night.  [END]
[BEGIN] I cancelled my reservation there as my trip plans changed and they charged my card anyway. When I called to straighten out they asked me for the cancellation number. Since I didn't had it they mantained the charge saying I didn't cancel.  [END]
[BEGIN] One problem after another. From the arrogant Revenue Manager, screwed up reservation, unable to check me in at 5pm. No apologies. Dirty room. Meeting room unstaffed. Took over 3 hours to get my toliet unblocked. Unsecured areas all over. Complained and it NEVER gets fixed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wifi not available Elevator broken Unsafe stairs Rude and unresponsive staff No value for a $250/night hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] the rooms are in the model by the hour standards, got double room, with very bad small, and dirty bed...  [END]
[BEGIN] Aside from the title the rooms were cramped and my view is the side of a building. Plus who wants to go downstairs and be in the middle of grand central station. This is probably the most overpriced and over rated hotel in New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] The smallest closest we have ever encountered. rude checkin staff & the noisiest housekeeping staff who yell at each other without any regard for guest in their own rooms. stay elsewhere unless your budget is tight & you need manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent and chic hotel. It wad located in a great area for new years eve because of the great restaurants and bars near by. Mr. Calderon was friendly and informative over the phone when making reservation. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] The good - Location The bad - Leaking toilet, filthy bath, bed bugs, filthy carpet, blocked sink, It stinks, key card that doesn't work half the time, the imbecile called Saeed at the front desk. All this for $120/night This is easily the worst hotel I've ever stayed in.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is a "swingers dream" and dirty to boot. Dark surroundings and rude front desk help. I will not stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got jewelry stolen from the room!!!!!!! Bad customer service  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was aweful. I checked into a non-smoking room and once I got in it was smoky and the bathroom was moldy. i checked out right then and went to the Holiday Inn down the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] We wanted to stay just one night in the hotel, and got a cheap price, but it wasn't worth it. After just two hours in the bed, my husband had eight bed bug bites! The place was totally infested. It's gross. Be careful!  [END]
[BEGIN] The restaurant was wildly overpriced for horrible food and service  [END]
[BEGIN] The night clerk language was abusive and we had to leave after we were threatened. Be aware that there is double parking in the lot and that you will be awakened if you need to move your car. I would never stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just avoid it. This must be one of the worst holes you could find yourself in. Unless you're in for the down and dirty New York experience, complete with your typical deli around the corner and the porn shop next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed for 5 bites with my daughter while she was moving to NY for college. Location is great for Columbia students....but.....wait for it - but bed bugs!! Stolen bag!! Poor, canned responses from staff....no help for the very real problems that we experienced. Ahhhhh.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is really a bad hotel. Small rooms and bathrooms, bad breakfast, not really clean, unfriendly staff. Good location (very close to 5th av and all the most luxurious stores and departmentstores) but not a place I would recomend  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at Whitehall this past weekend- great location, but that's all I can say positive. Room was small and dirty, staff indifferent, toilet broken all weekend (and I did report it), no amenities (e.g. newspaper, coffee maker). Would certainly not stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dit was mijn 2e verblijf in het Allerton. Het is een uitstekend hotel. Kamers netjes, modern en geweldige douche etc etc. Kamer voor 1 persoon is niet groot, maar groot genoeg. De ligging is fantastisch, midden op de Magnificent Mile. Een aanrader!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was OK, BUT now we find they have charged us twice, and they do not want to refund!! DO NOT GO THERE!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was misrepresented completely in the brochure. Walls, carpets, etc were dirty. Room badly needed painting. Curtains were too short to block out morning light. Bathtub needed reglazing. Walls were paper thin-heard everything going on in the next room (and their bathroom!) Disgusting hotel-would steer clear of it completely.  [END]
[BEGIN] I need to contact Hotwire as this is NOT a 3 star hotel. NO hot water, old, small dingy rooms. STAY away!  [END]
