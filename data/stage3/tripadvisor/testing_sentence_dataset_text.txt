23980 Room smelled of smoke, second night the bed had not been made and the dirty towels weere not removed. It is also dull, the room lighting is poor and the horrible brown colour scheme looks old a dirty. It is also very noisy. For the price it is truly terrible. 
23981 I stayed at this property for 3 nights over the 9-11 weekend. The property is a good location, close to subway locations and theatre district, and staff was nice. I will stay here again. 
23982 The location is truly impressive, room was clean and upscale! All the staff was ready to give us good suggestions. Gilty restaurant is a real food and sensorial experience! Wi fi connection is very useful but sometimes doesn't work into the room 
23983 Love this place. Perfect location to see Broadway shows, have dinner, and go shopping. Hotel is trendy, comfortable, and the staff is great. 
23984 I was there for two night for a business trip. Great location, good room and very nice staff. Even with the littel time we spent there I got to know some of the staff who were all great. Will definitely stay there again any time I to to New York. 
23985 Really good experience. The hotel was able to upgrade my room from one king to two double beds at check in. We then had a wonderful time in Chicago with suggestions from the W staff. Great ambiance and service. 
23986 Een prima hotel, mooie ruime kamer met 2 twijfelaars. Minpuntje: geen bad. Ligging is op 28th street, net buiten het drukste gedeelte, op loopafstand van het Empire State building en Madison Square garden. 
23987 Property needs a deep clean and updating. The hallways and rooms are musty. The lobby carpet is very worn and dirty. 
23988 Una bella sorpresa: stanza non grandissima ma sicuramente grande per gli standard newyorkesi. Colazione varia e abbondante. Camera pulita e soprattutto senza rumore! Albergo vicinissimo alla subway e a time square. Collegamento per JFK via subway comodissimo. 
23989 Stayed for three nights and got the WTC view. It was amazing, the contruction was not noisy at all, I had a pleasant stay and would stay again. Oh and the subway was right outside the door which was perfect 
23990 The room was immaculate and the bed was amazing. The service was impeccable - from check-in to bell captain to bartender at the Blue Bar. I will take the charm and history of the Algonquin any day of the week and twice on Sundy. 
23991 Top hotel that has it all, location, restaurant, rooftopbar and pool 
23992 We stayed for 5 nights at Fitzpatrick's Hotel, Manhattan. The staff were excellent and always helpful. I would highly recommend this hotel. Located just 3 blocks away from the subway, it is very centrally located. I would certainly return and stay there. 
23993 I guess the elevator is running faster as I didn't have to wait a lot for it like in my previous visits. We do get free water, but no breakfast. free wifi around and computer and printer. Friendly, good for working and shooping 
23994 We arrived at this hotel very tired because the trip and Drita was very helpfull to give us a early check in. That was difficult because the hotel was completely booked. She is really good and the hotel is very good located. 
23995 We stayed there for a weekend trip to the city. Nice, clean and stylish rooms, great location and atmosphere. Mike at the front desk is the heart and soul of the 414. We'll be back! 
23996 a very fine hotel - pleasant rooms & people - no complaints at all!!! 
23997 Room very small and old,carpets need to be replaced. Bathroom- taps not working NO HOT WATER!! Shuttle service very very poor!! 
23998 Having a hard time locating the hotel, found the staff patient on the phone. When we got there they were very helpful, even let us check in early. Will stay there again if back in Houston. 
23999 I've stayed at the W-Lakeshore 3 times now and have not had a bad experience yet. The rooms are very nicely appointed and the staff very helpful. Rooms are a bit tight but neat. 
24000 hotel was ok my wife didnt like it very much room was small and so so on being clean shower pressure was good beds were avarage good thing it was next to the ball park in room coffee was community coffee brand which wasnt very good. hotel was ok 
24001 A good room though bathroom is small but perfectly functional. I echo the comments about the breakfast room. Coffe was good though. Staff were helpful and happy to store my bag till mind afternoon. 
24002 We went for our second hoyneymoon to this hotel and everything was as espected. The hotel was very clean. The service was excellent. The location was also great! We would go again and it's highly recommended. 
24003 My husband and I were first timers in NY. Varzan at the front desk was amazing, nothing was too much trouble and we loved our executive suite with 2 bathrooms and two cupboards for all that shopping! We'll definitely be back :) 
24004 If you want to be in the heart of Times Square well..here it is..right at your door! I stayed there with my family Sept 11 week 2011. I enjoyed everything about this place. Nice clean rooms. I plan to stay there again on my next trip!!! 
24005 Great location in the heart of NY. Nice, clean, convenient hotel. You can have breakfast downstairs - very convenient. 
24006 Stayed for a weekend night and loved this hotel. Its elegant, trendy and sophisticated all at the same time. Best Concierge in the city, his name is Andrew. If you want some great hospitality make sure you stay here. Loved it!!! 
24007 Cost over $2500 for 2 nights in a suite with a crappy view. No restaurant. Room service only. Couldn't cancel due to snow storm but couldn't check in early either. Upon checkout, took 3 hours to get our car. Go to NYC often but will Never Again stay here. 
24008 I generally stay at the Radisson Blue across the street from the Fairmont and couldn't get in. I was excited to try the Fairmont but must say I found it extremely disappointing. The room was a nice size but nothing else came close to the competition across the street. 
24009 small rooms are actually nicely designed - no problems. Staff on the other hand is too cool for school with "helpful" security speaking gruffly and desk clerks wishing they were somewhere else. 
24010 bij het inchecken 2 personen waarvan er 1 naar huis ging; dus zeer lange wachttijden 3 dagen geen warm water op de kamer vanwege werkzaamheden kamers oud en gedateerd schimmel in de badkamer ligt wel zeer centraal 
24011 The staff is very friendly and helpful. Tim, Tia, Sheena, Mary, Diane, Will and Dora are my favorite people here. I feel like I have a new extened family. They are funny, friendly, and polite and always ready to assits with any problems or concerns. 
24012 Great staff who always meets any need! My view from the 31st floor was amazing! Loved my upgraded room! Each time I come back you just get better! 
24013 We liked our room on the 9th floor, which had a great view, was spacious and clean. Attention in the hotel was also good and very friendly. It is slightly remote, about 10 to 15 minutes walk to the closest metro station, and about 20 minutes to Central Park. 
24014 The front desk staff is fantastik, rooms are clean and adequate. Restaurant attached (not owned) by hotel is only fair but there are plenty of restaurants in the area. Would definitely recommend this hotel. 
24015 The Morningside Inn was a good place for our family to stay while seeing the NY sights - near the metro, a grocery store, and enough room for us to get a good night's sleep. Not a luxery suite, but very adquate for us. 
24016 Estupenda relacion calidad/precio. Super localizacion y servicio. Habitaciones comodas y con todo tipo de amenidades. Volveria manana! 
24017 We found this to be a good base to explore NYC, one of the less expensive hotels , but perectly ok for our needs 
24018 I have stayed at the Ritz on Central Park twice, both times have been a fabulous experience. Friendly staff, very helpful and attentive. Great room, comfy bed and love the Frederick Fekkai toiletries! 
24019 Upscale, great rooms, linens, etc. Staff was very professional and courteous. Room was made up promptly each day. Conference facilities were outstanding as well. Parking for 4 nights cost $220! That was a surprise. 
24020 I've stayed in a lot of Hampton Inn's and this one must be one of their older hotels. Not bad just not quite as nice as many of their others. Friendly staff. No happy hour like I've experienced in some of the others. Very close to Hobby. 
24021 You cannot get more bang for your buck in Chicago. The hotel is perfectly located in the center of town, is very classy, has great views, a pool and hot tub, really good service and an amazing (included!) breakfast. 
24022 We stayed here for 4 nights and had a wonderful experience. If you like the west village/meatpacking area this hotel is in THE IDEAL location. Moreover, the service there cannot be beat. 
24023 My husband and I had a mini honeymoon here and were very pleased with the hotel, the room, and the friendly staff. I would stay here again. The thoughtfulness of the champagne and strawberries was appreciated. 
24024 Other than the problem with the running toilet, I have no complailnts. I realize that when we arrilved the maintenance staff had gone for the day and nothing could be done to correct the problem. The room wasd clean and comfortable, and we will return. 
24025 Comfortable hotel with funky vibe, had availability (thankfully) when just about every other hotel in NYC was full. Room was clean and tiny -- cozy but would have been tight with 2 people. Front desk was a bit chaotic. Fun common areas, hip clientele. Would come back. 
24026 Great hotel, great service, great location. Call client care, their there. All staff were more than helpful. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
24027 Hotel fabuloso con una localizacion perfecta. Habitaciones modernas, muy limpias, amplias y un servicio excelente. Sin duda calidad precio es el mejor en el que he estado en la ciudad de Nueva York. El buffet de desayuno aunque un poco caro es fabuloso. 
24028 Lovely, well maintained hotel in the West Loop. Very close to the city's cutting-edge West Randolf restaurants and the "L Train". Pet friendly. Valet parking. Spacious rooms. Friendly and accommodating staff. Good value for the price of the room. I would recommend this to friends and will definitely return. 
24029 Location between 45th & 46th on Broadway could not be more centrally located. Within easy walking distance of theatres,restaurants and many other attractions make this a most beneficial resting place. Rooms are spacious with all of the expected amenities. Elevator system is worth writing home about! 
24030 I stayed there for 11 nights and really enjoyed a comfortable, large, and quiet room in very good condition and the friendly and attentive staff. The location is almost unbeatable, subway stations next door and many many points of interest within walking distance! 
24031 The hotel is an average hotel in Manhattan. It's clean and in an incredible location. A little bit old and expensive, but The location makes everything Ok. I expected a bigger breakfast too. But in general a very good service! 
24032 La ubicacion es excelente, la presentacion general regular, la habitacion podria ser mejor, pero la limpiaron y es comoda sin pretensiones, lo recomiendo sobre todo por la ubicacion a precio razonable para la zona. 
24033 Four adults (including myself) and 12 High School kids stayed here for three nights. The service was superb, they didn't mind kids, the breakfast very nice, and the location wonderful. I can't say enough good things about this hotel. I would love to stay there again. 
24034 We stayed at the Affinia Dumont for one week. The hotel is very clean, centrally located and has a wonderful restaurant, Barking Dog, next to it. The staff, in particular, Don, were great and gave us tips regarding other restaurants and shopping. We will stay at this hotel again. 
24035 Pros Beautiful Spacious suites (bedroom & bathroom) Customer Service Privacy Location close to shops and restaurant Cons Parking Cost ($18 self, $20 valet) Kitchen sink too small Had to go through the bedroom to get to the bathroom Great space for small get together. 
24036 Hard to get accomodation so tried the Omni. The room rate was great, facilities are about right - Next time I come back I'll be staying there again and again. Very happy experience indeed 
24037 We have stayed here for many years including when it was the Rhiga Royal. The location is great for going to the theater, shopping and restaurant. Comfortable beds. Sofas and very contemporary. 
24038 I really liked this hotel!! It is in a great location...close to Times Square & the 42nd. Street / Port Authority Train stop. The rooms were very nice & the concierge was extremely helpful! I would definitely stay at this hotel again! :) 
24039 The rooms were spacious especially for NYC. We were impressed. The staff was very friendly, the beds were comfortable, most important everything was clean. Great location in Chinatown, close to Little Italy- plenty of great food in the area. We traveled with 3 boys ages 7, 10 and 12. 
24040 We helped restore power there on Long Island.We stayed here upon returning to the west coast.The rooms comfortable,clean,staff wonderful,however, the bathroom had "signs of aging"...mildew, rust...paint peeling. 
24041 Standard Hampton Inn hotel. Nothing fancy, but in nice shape. Even with the freeway right beside the hotel, my room was very quiet and comfortable. The exercise room was quite hot and small. 
24042 Very rundown for a Wingate - dated and worn. Elevator makes truly scary noises. At 8:30 am, the breakfast buffet was a disaster. Most food was out. No effort made to clean or refill. Never again. 
24043 Great Location; about 2 blocks to Michigan Ave shopping. Rooms are nice size and the staff is very friendly. The Concierge is great with good suggestions. A Big plus, I will stay here again. 
24044 Fortuanately a snowstorm caused major cancellations so we got to stay a block away from my sons apartment. Our 14th floor suite was large, very clean, warm, and quiet. The staff was cordial and breakfast & dinner room service was great. Will stay there again. 
24045 Awesome hotel, close to everything....central park, the met, fantastic shopping. three in house restaurants, lovely rooms with very comfortable beds and huge bathrooms.......loved staying here 
24046 It was a very nice experience. Very Good and calm atmosphere 
24047 We love to stay in Holiday inn 
24048 Stayed here for one night. the personnel are really nice. the hotel is old but not in a bad condition. the elevator does need renovation. the room was not that big but was modern and nice. the bathroom was very fresh so overall a good stay. will be back. 
24049 Se lo recomiendo a cualquiera por su excelente ubicacion a pocas cuadras de Times Square! El hotel es antiguo y muy fino decorado. El hall principal es hermoso, tiene varios lugares para comer. Vale la pena conocerlo, sin dudas volveria en mi proximo viaje a la gran manzana! 
24050 Awesome little hotel. Lots of cafe's around to grab food or drink. Room was gorgeous, clean, and spacious. Bathroom was unbelievable. Marble everywhere. Staff was very friendly. Continental breakfast was nicest I've ever seen. Def recommend. 
24051 we've been staying here for years. we love this place. great location. friendly staff. we've never done much cooking, just breakfast and the kitchen's great for that. bed's are comfy. only problem this last time was the early morning trucks and all the construction noise. 
24052 Good rooms, well kept building. about half the rates for all other hotels facing (or near ) Michigan Ave. About five minute walk to all big stores, Millenium Park (the Bean) Navy Pier, Museums and schools. 
24053 Excellent location and service! We had a great stay. I highly reccomend the burger stand just next doar! 
24054 Friendly staff Best of Manhattan Neighborhood to stay. Free all day complimentary hot drinks and fruits. sufficient breakfast Clean Helpful fron desk and front off staff. Good security (we even forgot to lock our room twice and nothing was stolen!) Would recommend this to a friend and family 
24055 Stayed for 7 nights in Fitzpatricks grand central. Best hotel in New York. staff great. Ailish from Cavan/Monaghan, David from Ireland and Jennifer the best hotel staff ever.All of the staff were great. Rooms spotless, could not have been better. just felt so at home. We will definitely be back... 
24056 This is a nice hotel with a friendly and professional staff. Stayed at this hotel because of the price and room size. I was not disappointed. This hotel had a very inviting atmosphere. I would definitely stay here again. 
24057 Loved the location of this hotel and the staff where great! Very friendly and helpful. The rooms are a great size, much bigger than I have experienced elsewhere in NYC, the only down fall was that the deco was tidy but dated. 
24058 Meet the expected. Excelent queen room. Good value and clean. The breakfast is very simple, but justifies the price. 
24059 Gym, pool and eating area met my expectations. Would recommend to travelers. Friendly staff that held all of our show baggage without problems. I would return and recommend to visitors going to the McCormick Center. 
24060 Our six night stay at the Kitano was entirely agreeable. A very clean, quiet, and well run establishment. Assuming one can get a fairly reasonable rate, I see no reason to stay anywhere else. 
24061 Buona posizione, prezzo contenuto. Camera rumorosa e non molto pulita. Corridoi puzzolenti. 
24062 a fabulous experience==So gorgeous, and full of history. It features a lovely drink and hor d'oerve every evening, at half price, and I returned every evening for it The ambience cannot be beat. So elegant and gracious. 
24063 This is one of those classic, old, lots of character hotels. Similiar to the St. Francis on Union Square in San Francisco. Great location across the street from the park and musuems. About 1.5 blocks from the train. Great pool and gym. 
24064 Our dry cleaning was lost for reasons unknown. I would like to congratulate Steve Lamour the front desk manager for the efficient way this matter was handled. Within 14 days of returning to England a full refund was credited to my Card. Well done 
24065 We love to stay at this comfort inn midtown west hotel. The staff is very nice and friendly. Do not listen to the other comments. Manager is always there whenever we went to use his computer to check our email. We'll keep coming back 
24066 We stayed at Hilton last weekend for 3 nights and really liked it. No bed bugs, that was the 1st thing we asked about and checked ourselves! Very nice contemporary hotel, in a great location! I would stay there again! 
24067 Perfect tourist location, near all the popular attractions in NYC. Rooms are standard City size, clean and bug free. Room rate was reasonable especially for the location. Breakfast was great, really enjoyed the fresh pressed coffee that was available. 
24068 A little shabby in the common areas (lobby, elevator...) but my room was lovely. The neighborhood is great because it is near all the posh hotels and a beautiful park. Some of the staff were friendly and some were, well, typical Chicagoans! 
24069 I stayed at the Marriott Marquis while at a conference in May 2008. The location was excellent and the rooms were great. I have stayed at severaI hotels in NY; this one was the best. I would definitely stay here again. 
24070 The rooms are very comfortable and extremely clean. I travel the world and stay on 4 and 5* hotels all of the time.. and I would be very happy to stay here again. The front desk staff were polite and efficient, and the hotel itself is in an excellent location. 
24071 It had everything we were looking for - location, parking, free breakfast, sincerely helpful and friendly associates and clean rooms. Pretty hard to find all these things in New York and still be able to afford staying there. We will definitely be back. 
24072 Hotel was clean, the staff was attentive and pleasant. The location was perfect - close enough to get everywhere. The bathroom shower could stand to provide more room but hey, it's NYC! Would stay here again. 
24073 We stayed for 5 nights. It was a pleasant stay. We got a room with view over Manhattan. 10 minutes walk to grand central. Staff was very friendly. Unfortunatly the internet wasn't free. 
24074 eine super Lage 12 West 44th Street 8 min zum Times Square, 10 min Centralpark, 5min 5th Evenue... Die Zimmer sind zwar sehr sehr klein aber wer ist den in New York schon am Zimmer?? Die Lage ist wirklich ausschlaggebend und die ist einfach super. Preisleistung passt einfach 
24075 Newly renovated. Great location for the theatre district. Many reasonably priced resturants in the area. Staff was excellent. Parking is at a reduced cost. Plan to stay there again in December. 
24076 The entry to the hotel is busy like a stock exchange. However, the rooms above are something to look for your stay in the hustle bustle of New York. The room service, and the quality of food served in the hotel are fantastic 
24077 This hotel is a gem that has low street appeal and can be missed---which would be unfortunate it is a great place to stay. 
24078 Massive place but staff are great Well located for bars and grand central 
24079 Stayed at this hotel in sept 2011 , very Art Deco , Excellent view of Time Square, lovely friendly staff, would defo go back 
24080 This is an old building, but very well-care. The room was small, as usual in hotels, but comfy. Very clean, specially the bathroom - an important item for me. The breakfast was nice too, with fruits, bagels, yogurt, pancakes, cereals, coffee, milk, tea, juice etc. I certainly recommend. 
24081 we were worried aftre reading reviews having already booked this hotel. These fears proved groundless, the rooms were spotless all linen was clean and everything worked o.k. the location is great the ideal hotel for a few days sightseeing. 
24082 Wonderful location and decent hotel that is showing the effects of way too many tour groups overrunning the facilities. Elevators and computers periodically failed. Long waits for the elevators when they were running. Facilities are worn and the rooms look pretty sad. The beds were comfortable at least. 
24083 LOved this hotel. Great lobby area. The staff were very helpful. Great comfy beds and stylish rooms. The bathrooms were also very nice. It was an excellent location. Coffee/ tea in room or lobby would be nice. 
24084 Very nice and well decorated. Clean and nice towels, sheets. The bathroom was great- huge tub and separate shower. The shuttle to local spots was super too. The front desk staff not that helpful but overall would recommend hotel. 
24085 exteremely friendly and helpful front lobby staff, as always a good breakfast as the staff continued to maintain it until closing 
24086 Houston can be an expensive city for hotels.....The CrownePlaza is mediocre. An **old** property that has,nominally, been updated. Be sure to ask for a room that does **not** overlook the freeway. 
24087 This hotel is perfect for a manhatten trip. Great location, wonderful rooms and the most comfortable beds. It does not have all the amenities in the world but when you are in Manhatten who really needs swimming pools and spas. Will go back for sure. 
24088 We brought my nephew into NYC for the first time and only had three days. It was the perfect location and they gave us a room on one of the highest floors. Great service, clean rooms and they were large for NYC. 
24089 We have stayed 10 days in the hotel. Our experience was very positive. The room was nice and clean, the reception people very efficient and helpfull, location excellent - near several underground stations and within walking distance to many attractions. Had a very pleasant time. 
24090 This new hotel was conveniently located with Midtown, Chelsea, Meatpacking and SoHo districts nearby. Rooms were clean, quiet and of good size. And the airconditioning was great on those hot humid nights! 
24091 Awesome service, very affordable for this level of hotel I thoroughly enjoyed my visit. 
24092 Hotel is located less than a block from the Metro and Central Park. Great location but rooms are small and standard is ok. Expensive WiFi and unhelpful staff who didn't even try to smile or be helpful. 
24093 Just out our window was the Empire State Building, a beacon to guide us back each night. The staff was friendly, the rooms impeccably clean and comfortable. The elevators were quiet, smooth and available. The decor was attractive, fresh and inviting. The location is convenient for traveling around the city. 
24094 Would highly recommend the Barclay - location, price, service, quality of the rooms, etc. I also thought it was a terrific bargain. I would definitely stay there again. 
24095 Would recommend to everybody going in Sightseeing in New, close to Grand Central / Subway / and Bus stop 
24096 Kind service, decent room, fun tech gadgets. Location very convenient to sights, restaurants, activities: walk to MSG, Times Square, etc. 
24097 We thoroughly enjoyed our weekend at the Chandler. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful and the room was immaculately clean and very comfortable. The location places it within walking distance of Times Square and Penn Station. I was extremely pleased with the service received for the price we paid. 
24098 camera comoda non molto grande ma vivibile in due, non farsi dare camere dopo il 25 esimo piano poiche aereatore bagno funziona in continuazione provocando tanto rumore sempre,vicino negozio per la colazione e vicino supermercato .tra la 5a e la6a .metro e autobus per ovunque 
24099 Second time here. The beds are great, the staff was very friendly and helpful. The hotel shows its age a bit but by and large a really nice spot. Great view of Clear Lake from the room and Close to business in the area. Decent value 
24100 My wife and I received excellent service and attention from the entire staff at this property. The location and proximity to Times Square is a big plus as is the cleanliness of the rooms and complimentary breakfast. You cannot go wrong with this hotel. 
24101 My family of 4 stayed at the Edison Hotel on Times Square in New York City for 6 days in July 2004. We loved our stay there. It is centrally located to everything about Broadway and Times Square and the room was great. 
24102 sehr freundliches, hilfsbereites Personal, besonders an der Rezeption 
24103 The hotel was in a good location. The room was clean but very small and in the basement! The best I can say about the room, besdies being clean, was that the water in the shower was hot and had good water pressure. The breakfast buffet was adequate. 
24104 We got a price of $169.00 from travelzoo and was upgraded to the 48th floor by just asking. We could see the corner of times square from our room. It was a small room but clean and comfortable. It was in an excellent location and enjoye our stay. 
24105 Nice room and amenities. Very warm staff. The noise was awful all day , but unbeareable at night with the garbage trucks working all night in front of the rooms located at the front. never return to this place. 
24106 Me and my family were in new York for the Halloween period and we weren't disappointed! Doubletree suites were excellent and the fact that we had an incredible view of time square was also brilliant. Brilliant place to go!!! 
24107 Danny took great care of us again. We loved our marble bathroom and enjoyed our studio apartment room. I would return again and recommend this place for any couple looking for a unique boutique hotel. 
24108 Great location just a block from Penn Station. Our room was clean and small. We elected to have a shared bathroom, which was fine. The staff was great - told us where to find food and fun things to do. I would come again! 
24109 DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL! It is filthy and the rooms have mold on the ceilings! It smells and the staff is NOT HELPFUL! I will never recommend this hotel or stay here ever again!!!! 
24110 We booked a suite package through Luxury Escapes that included brkfstr, late checkout and upgrade. We received a suite with a furnished terrace that was large, clean and comfortable. The brkfst would have been over &60pp. I will stay here again instead of the Four Seasons, Trumop or St Regis. 
24111 Rooms are small and uncomfortable. Noisy and slow elevators. Room we had wasnt cleanest for sure. Consider somewhere else if you are paying full price. 
24112 Great property, great location, terrific staff. Chris (conceirge) above and beyond the best. Good rooms, quiet, good restaurant (have the sweetpotato fries) and the way a hotel experience should be from check-in to check out! 
24113 Honestly one of the best hotel experiences I've had. Staff was great, location was great, room was great. -Totally usable gym, which was a first for me in a hotel. -Fantastic customer service from the front desk, to the housekeeping. 
24114 The room would be just right if you are traveling alone and you get a room with twin beds. Otherwise there is nowhere to put your stuff. The hotel is located in a nice neighborhood and it is clean. Shopping, dining and sight-seeing are convenient. 
24115 Staff argues with customers. Dirty room...found trash from previous guests. Bed Bugs Faulty showers. Poor draining in sinks, toilets, showers. Poor or NO internet connectivity for a high price. Only a couple of the elevators function. Thin walls...let's say there are no secrets. Dirty bedding...old uncomfortable mattress. 
24116 LOCATION!! What a great experience staying at this property. Close to the theatre district, restaurants, and times square! The staff was friendly, helpful and met all expectations! Great clean rooms and the conceriege service is TOP notch!!! 
24117 Great room with microwave. Small lobby, cute fitness center. Everything was just fine. No complaints. 
24118 This is a residential building. The "hotel rooms" are ILLEGAL. I felt like a squatter. No services. Just awful. 
24119 Absolutely a DREAM destination! Very clean, trendy, yet quiet and peaceful! Staff is extremely friendly and accommodating! Jennifer at the front desk was extremely helpful with information to improve my stay and experience. 
24120 We enjoyed the location, walking distance to theaters, nicely appointed suites and (at least on upper floors) quiet sleep considering we were in the heart of NYC. I would change only one thing: flimsy mattress on pull out sofabed. 
24121 My stay here was flawless. Price: I booked this on hotwire for under $200. I am an SPG gold card holder and got upgraded to the most fantastic room. Room: Perfectly clean and huge my NYC standards. Nice bathroom and good facilities. Service: Excellent 
24122 It was my second visit to this hotel, and I like it even more than the first time. It has everything I need, and it offers excellent service, great rooms, perfect location. I'm sure I'll keep coming back to this hotel and I highly recommend it. 
24123 Hotel Lobby/Amenities- Helpful, Nice, Clean Elevators- SLOW, Need Patience Rooms- Small, Clean, Average, Small Windows, Construction noise from across the street Service- Great Value- $160+tax a night, not bad for location Restaurant- Nothing special, pricey 
24124 Rooms were extremely small, but well maintained. Staff was very accomodating. Location was great. Walking distance to numerous attractions. 
24125 Loved this hotel; room was nice size! Location was great for walking to all areas of interest: Grand Central Station, The Rock, Times Square, Central Park, 5th Avenue. Would definitely stay here again! 
24126 Stayed here as part of a tour. Excellent value. Clean, friendly staff, excellent breakfast included in the price, tea and coffee all day. Lovely location, quiet and more residential. Complaints dealt with well. Would stay here again. 
24127 Think this was my 5th trip to this hotel. Exceptional value and brilliant location if you like midtown, the park and The Met Opera. Love the bar too 
24128 Rooms are clean. Sometime too much noice on the corridor in the evening. One unpleasant experience: we put some food in the hotel refrigerator. The hotel personnel throwed this just away!! It was clearly not enough to put the food outside the fridge; 
24129 We stayed at the W for 4 nights. The rooms are very clean, not very big, but comfortable. In addition, the staff is very friendly The hotel's location is perfect for tourists ... it is located in the heart of Manhattan. 
24130 A very nice hotel with friendly owner who let us have our room until four pm as we had a late flight. "I don't want to treat anyone like a foreigner," he said! 
24131 We overlooked the WTC construction site, at which construction DOES go on even on weekends and at night. It was a bit loud but not overwhelmingly so. The hotel staff is okay; rooms were okay. Nothing to write home about. It IS across the street from Century 21, though. 
24132 The staff is incredibly helpful and kind, their recommendations for dinning were spot-on as well for sites to visit. This is one vacation I will never forget and already planning to come again. 
24133 We stayed one night at the Hilton Garden Inn while in Chicago for a concert at the House of Blues. The staff and service was wonderful! The rooms are very nice, updated, and clean. I would definitely stay again!! 
24134 Have just returned from a 4 night stay at this hotel with my son 
24135 Great room , clean , good size. excellent location, friendly staff.No complaints whatsoever. 
24136 Comfortable, Clean and Convenient. Stay in room522 for 6 nights and got really good services from waitress Vicky and Nana. They are thoughful and polite! 
24137 I stayed at the W on business and had a great experience. Rooms are small, okay...really small, but it's a terrific location with a cool lobby. If you like swanky modern upscale hotels you'll love the W. If you don't, there's always the Waldorf Astoria across the street. 
24138 I really don't understand the complaints about this hotel. My wife and I enjoyed our stay in this hotel. Very good. Friendly staff. Clean rooms. We were in New York to celebrate my wifes 40th birthday. It was a huge success!!! 
24139 This hotel was a really great surprise with regard to the hip decor, courteous, helpful staff, and super convenient Times Square location. The only negative was the parking which was located in a garage down the street. 
24140 Hotel is near Times Square so you can walk to everything! Staff is very friendly! Rooms are small but only 6 rooms per floor...so not alot of noise at all! Hot cookies when you arrive too! Loved it! 
24141 Wonderful time great service loved the room. good location. Would recomend 
24142 Amazing location! Just a few streets from Times Square and Broadway. Lovely big, clean rooms and huge beds which were SO comfy. Hotel felt quite luxurious for our budget, it was only slightly more than a 2 star hotel round the corner and definately worth the money. 
24143 I will stay at this hotel everytime I am in Houston. Just be careful, the hot water is really hot! 
24144 Friendly, helpful, a great place to stay when away from home. 
24145 Very friendly staff, clean room, comfy bed...I have no complaints. All in all a good value plus it's located near 45 and in close proximity to stores and restaurants. Surrounding neighborhood isn't the best, but I definitely felt safe. I would stay here again. 
24146 This hotel is nearer to the loop - 20 min drive and nearer to the airport. It has free parking, the rooms are good. Brkfast is not free. 
24147 Ideal location, reasonable price, friedly staff and the room was always cleaned well for us. just what we needed Thanks 
24148 Nice pool good view up the island towards midtown. Blue ribbon sushi, always good to know. Reccomended for a good cocktail and either the terrace or rooftop. Good location cant beat the lower east side nice staff. 
24149 Great view, Great location, Great ambience, Great City 
24150 Stayed for 4 nights, staff was great, room was clean and a very quiet location. Restaurant staff was excellent and so was the food. 
24151 I want to thank Victor for his willingness to resolve those inconveniences in order to make our stay at la Quinta,Manhattan, a unforgettable one. In general, I'd give them 100% satisfaction on customer service, room and the continental breakfast. I just missed the Pool. Thanks, la Quinta. William 
24152 affinia manhattan is zeer centraal gelegen en ligt op loopafstand van penn station, met goede treinverbindingen naar de airport. je zit echt midden in de city. de appartementenformule bevalt ons prima. we gingen voor de tweede keer naar dit hotel en gaan de volgende keer zeker weer. 
24153 great value, great staff.. HOWEVER, car got broken into at night in front of the hotel in the parking lot and cost me $2.5k. Management refunded me $250 of $500 bill. To little. Ruined my trip to Houston. Never again. 
24154 The extremely friendly and helpful staff at this conveniently located hotel made for a very pleasurable stay with my wife and 3 year old daughter. Highly recommended. 
24155 We were very happy with this property. The hotel was very clean, the staff was very helpful & and the price was very reasonable since it was a Friday night. 
24156 During our stay we had a great, spacious room with a view on Broadway. Fantastic bathroom en good beds. Great hotel staff. We had a very pleasant week. 
24157 Great central location with good access to restaurants and shopping, BUT ,very small rooms, post rationalised as eco-friendly! thus relatively expensive 
24158 very nice the attention and hospitality, very clean, quiet place and big room, 2 king bed just $55.00 plus tax, tax in houston is 17%, bus stop is just in the door, very easy to move to the city. 
24159 great location, free wifi and Internet connection, avarage service, SMALL ROOMS with poor bathrooms, there are about 20 rooms and only 3 bathrooms available so you may wait to get to the washroom, the walls are very thin so you can hear your neighbours talking/laughing etc 
24160 At every turn, staff added value to our stay. Extremely helpful, warm and sincere in hospitality. The hotel was clean, comfortable and well appointed. Great location off Times Square, but quiet. When in NYC, this is where we will always stay. 
24161 After staying in LA and Las Vegas this hotels rooms were very small compared. The upside was that it had a fridge. It was quite close to the subway so easily accesible to town. I would recommend taking the stairs as the lifts are a bit dodgy and very slow! 
24162 Friendly staff, clean & good size room. On Grand and Bowery in Chinatown. Loved it! 
24163 Camera ok, pulizia camera ok. Pessimo breakfast: stanza per la colazione piccola, brutta e sempre affollata, non c'erano abbastanza tavoli per le persone che devono aspettare. Inoltre, sempre le stesse cose da mangiare per tutta la settimana. Solo due ascensori per 29 piani, sempre ad aspettare. Scale fatiscenti 
24164 Small room and big, comfortable bed was perfect for my short stay in NYC...centrally located in Times Square put me in the middle of tons of great places to eat. Flew out the next morning. Staff was friendly and quick to offer service. Give it a try. 
24165 Had read other reviews and was a bit nervous but I have nothing but positive things to report regarding my stay at the Empire. Hotel has a great "vibe", is in a great location, and the staff was courteous, efficient and helpful. We'll be back again! 
24166 the staff is very friendly and eager to please,the maintance crew is speedy and the grounds are very cleani would highly recommend this hotel to my family and friends 
24167 Got this hotel through a "best offer" and for the price it was ok, but a better choice is the Hilton Garden Inn. Room in this hotel was ok, beds a bit small (full instead of queen) and some signs of wear and tear. 
24168 Stayed here for a couple of days of sightseeing and the music festival Lollapalooza. The hotel is right off of Mag Mile - which means great shopping, and it wasn't too far from Grant park. The rooms had everything we needed, but nothing more, just the way we like it, 
24169 Simply perfect. I would recommend this to everyone in 
24170 We were very disappointed in the rooms. They were tired, the furniture was broken and the air conditioner was so noisy it kept us up 
24171 We were surprised that this was a Starwood hotel as it is not of the caliber of most of their properties. The beds were comfortable. 
24172 A good hotel, well situated, nice comfortable rooms but classic decoration 
24173 I use this for business travel a lot. Staff could not be more helpful. Close to the Waldorf -- but half the price. Fast wifi, everything in the room works. The pricing is very good. 
24174 We visited from Greece and spent six days in this magnificent hotel.It was our first visit to the city. Great hotel , very polite and helpful staff .Very clean hotel also. A real oasis in the madness of Times Square! 
24175 Perfect location, great price, decent breakfast. Room was very clean, has coffee machine, brand new tv, good tv channels, good lamps. 
24176 Altho this hotel is convienent, it needs some TLC. The rooms are outdated, beds are old hallway is disgusting. If I had my choice I wouldn't stay here again. But then again when in NY when do you need to be in your room? 
24177 Relativ ruppiger Empfang. Foehn musste extra bestellt werden. Kleines Zimmer. Ausstattung minimal. Aufzuege sind langsam. Als wir nachts heimkamen war ein Polizeieinsatz am laufen dazu Geschrei die ganze Nacht. Seltsamer Laden. 
24178 My roommate and I took advantage of the 80th Anniversary special this hotel offered. While the rooms were small, they are clean. Best of all is the fabulous breakfast we had vouchers for and enjoyed every a.m. Great location, good to be out of the Times Square craziness! 
24179 Small lobby, very pleasant front staff, slow elevators. The first room had no desk or chair, the hotel quickly transferred me to a larger room. great value for the location and clean well furnished room. 
24180 very clean and comfortable. easy walking distance to times square and madison square garden. great for an overnight stay when you go to a show. very clean rooms. staff very friendly. 
24181 Kamers zijn niet groot maar wel compleet, de lokatie is niet ver van time square Lopend was het allemaal goed te doen, geen onveilig gevoel. Aardige en behulpzame service in het hotel. Ontbijtruimte klein, maar als iedereen beetje rekening houd met elkaar, dus niet te lang blijven zitten, geen probleem. 
24182 We were in town from waukegan for the U2 concert the rooms and service were definitely superior to hotels ive visited in Peoria and the Washington DC areas it was just awesome!!!!! 
24183 This hotel is terrible.my room had 18in between the bed n the wall. Paint peeling, exposed wires. The L outside my window all night. They offer an upgrade but then were sold out of all upgrades because u can only upgrade if staying 1night.awful..... 
24184 Excellent hotel - delighted with our 2 bathroomed suite. Like all of the other New Yorkers I met in our 3 day blitz, staff were unhelpful and abrupt. Seems to be the expected way to be there. 
24185 A great place to base your NYC experience from. A block from Central Park, the hotel was convenient and a great deal. Have stayed here many times and would continue to enjoy the experience. 
24186 Situated centrally. Easy to get to times square and right around the corner from Macy's. Clean, spacious rooms. 
24187 I have stayed at Brookhollow twice and they are always very helpful. The rooms (including the upgrades received) are spacious and clean. Aurelia Gaskin was extremely helpful. 
24188 Good rooms with plenty of space for NYC. Fabulous location. Hall and stairwells bit shabby, elevators antique and slow. Overall worth it though 
24189 This was my 4th stay at The Kimberly and it is always wonderful when staff recognizes you as a return guest, thank you all! This was my first time experiencing the new roof top lounge, just fabulous! The front desk and Concierge staff was terrific as always. 
24190 We stayed there for 2 nights and enjoyed every second of it. The stuff were welcoming efficient and simply caring 
24191 Marcus the manager on duty and Clive the bellman went out of there way to make sure we will have an unforgettable stay. 
24192 Fantastic location and extremely friendly staff. Easy wallk to Lexington subway. Overall an excellent experience! 
24193 Hotel nello standard per le grandi citta' americane. Posizione ottima per molti punti di interesse. Facilmente raggiungibile con metro dal JFK (linea E direttamente a pochi isolati oppure linea E poi linea R e si arriva di fianco all'ingresso dell'hotel. Stazione metro di quattro linee appena fuori dall'hotel. 
24194 Just returned from the Fairmont and have only good things to say about my stay. The staff was helpful, the room was large, well appointed with an amazing view and the location was perfect for exploring Chicago i.e. its a block or 2 from Michigan Ave. and the el 
24195 I reserved only a few days in advance and got a great rate, less than $150 for one of the small rooms. Nonetheless, it was well appointed, quiet, clean, and comfortable. There were even a few luxuries. I could not have asked for more. 
24196 A decent hotel at a fair price in Chinatown. I was quite surprised how large, clean, modern and quiet the room was. 
24197 Thin walls. very noisy, adjacent door to next room with kids playing with the door handle, back door frame ducked taped, intercom going off early morning and finally staff was alittle rude. 
24198 very good place,close to time square,clean rooms ,only very expensive rates for wifi .Friendly staff 
24199 The Bentley Hotel: - good value for the money - friendly service - big and clean rooms (at least we had) - location not the best one but ok - elevators slow sometimes. I definitely would stay here again! 
24200 The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Houston is located in the heart of downtown. It is an easy walk to many restaurants, GRB Convention Center, Toyota Center and Minute Maid Park. Check-in and check-out was very easy and the staff was very courteous. 
24201 Classically Sofitel! Pros : usual high-level Sofitel quality (service, rooms and bathrooms), good fitness center, fresh fruits always on disposal... Quiet rooms. Cons : not directly located on Times Square ; expensive ; internet is not provided for free ... 
24202 Great administration. The manager and the front desk employees are always disposed to help. Nice Stay. 
24203 This hotel has a great location, is large but not anonymous, everything taken care of. 
24204 Pleasant 2 night stay. Nice rooms, comfortable beds. Rooms include a safe, really appreciate that. Wifi available. Good location for getting around and visiting Chicago sites. Shopping very walkable and nearby. Access to trains easy 2 block walk. Starbucks very close, just on the corner across the street. Would return. 
24205 If that's what you want...look no further. No frills place but they do offer free parking which is great in NYC. Walking distance to Times Square and subway etc. 
24206 Stayed at the Fitzpatrick Hotel for a week and returned on Sat. Had a great experience and will go back aagin. We were very lucky and were upgraded to a suite. Met some lovely staff including Chris, Christina and Leo. 
24207 We always try to stay at the Crowne Plaza when in NYC. The location is perfect and the staff goes out of its way to make your stay incredible. Ask for a corner room---you'll get a view of either Time Square and/or the Hudson River and the cruise ships. 
24208 Great new hotel between Broadway and 6th. Have stayed here a few times and have always had a good experience. I would definitely stay here again. 
24209 Good hotel near Madison Square Garden, Penn Station and all kind of places. Greate room, greate people that work in the hotel. It could be small for more than 4 people with lot of baggae. 
24210 The Wellington has an amazing atmosphere, the staff is friendly and timely with service. Always willing to help or answer any questions. John C was an amazing help and thanks to him our romantic getaway was worryfree and comfortable. 
24211 Got a tremendous deal from a hotel booking website so I can't complain too much. The location is great. Walking distance to everything. Rooms are small, hotel is older, walls are thin. You can't beat theocation though. 
24212 Our room was a pleasant surprise upon arrival. A very nice, what looked to be a recently renovated, clean and comfortable room. Cleaned promptly every morning by Enisa. Loved the location. Our first trip to New York. A fabulous place to visit. We would stay at the Manhattan again. 
24213 Kan erg kort zijn toplocatie voor bijna niets.......Long Live Carter Hotel!! 
24214 Was told by an employee at the thermostat in the rooms are DUMMIES and that if a guest calls to complain that staff is to tell them that the temperature can be controlled remotely. Their home office does not want guests to know that the thermostats are dummies. 
24215 While the space is tight the room was clean, comfortable and nicely appointed. We love the convenient location for theater and shopping on Fifth Avenue. The staff is friendly and helpful. There is a starbucks coffee and maker in the room which is a nice treat in the morning. 
24216 Solid hotel in New York, and I'm a repeat guest. Friendly, clean, and quiet (as quiet as it gets in NYC). 
24217 There are hundreds of hotels in Manhattan but I always go back to the W New York on Lexington and 49th because of the staff, particularly Mario at the front desk. He is professional yet friendly, always remembers my name and makes sure I get terrific service. 
24218 rustig maar toch midden in het centrum. Je kan heel veel lopend doen vanaf deze locatie. Vriendelijk personeel, nog wat onervaren, maar zeker klantgericht. Aanrader! 
24219 Hotels area was good. Not far from the Tenement Museum, China Town and Little Italy. Rooms were small but clean. Breakfast was good. Price was expensive, although what would you expect in NYC. Try getting it the room at a lower price if possible. 
24220 Always try to stay here when I'm in NYC. Wonderful rooms. Great location. The only complaint is that it's often sold out (at least for the Oracle rate) 
24221 Location is excellent. That is the only positive about this hotel. As long as you go in knowing that the rooms are very small, not that clean, tiny bathroom smells moldy, no extras what so ever, you will be fine. Maybe a step above a youth hostel. 
24222 The desk gave me the key to someone elses room, it was 11pm and on reflection i was lucky i didnt get shot - the room ocupants screamed I had a minor heart attack and then back to the desk to try again. 
24223 We were pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Lovely large room, with great outlook onto streets below, and very comfortable bed. Very clean, with great bathroom. Excellent location for exploring New York. Hotel provided breakfast which included, bagels, muffins, fresh fruit, yogurt, cereals, fruit juice etc. 
24224 Our room was very nice and the king-size bed was truly comfortable. The staff was courteous and professional and we had no problems checking in or out. The location was perfect for what we wanted to see and do. We would definitely stay there again. 
24225 We loved it here. Great location, shopping, and excellent service for such a large hotel. Really enjoyed the restaurant up top. Thank you! 
24226 I spent a week here, and didn't want to leave. Beautiful decoration, great service & the location is deluxe. I could go on & on... 
24227 The only problem that we encounterd at this hotel was some minor elevator maintenance. Every other aspect of our stay was perfect. Very helpful staff, great location, good value, clean rooms, private bathrooms, and comfortable beds. 
24228 We stayed here in March and fell in love. The rooms are HUGE and very modern. Great location for midtown entertainment (close to broadways, times square and central park). 
24229 This is a great hotel for families. We were there for seven days over July 4th and had a great time. The staff was helpful and very friendly to our three and four year olds. I would reccomend this hotel to everyone. 
24230 Stayed for one night. Very comfy little hotel. Great area, walking distance to all the tourist attractions and subway lines. Wifi in the room. Breakfast included in the room was very delicious. Fitness centre on the basement level. Would stay again. 
24231 El hotel esta cerca de las principales atracciones y. lugares de interes. las habitaciones son amplias y modernas aunque un poco ruidosas. No hay wifi gratis ni nevera en la habitacion. El desayuno un poco escaso. 
24232 I went with my boyfriend and the minute we walked in we couldnt stop gushing over the hotel. Everything was perfect!!! I highly Recommend this hotel for couples. Cant wait to go back :) 
24233 OK for the discounted price but NOT a 5 star as advertised. The rat pack would have felt at home here. And nothing's changed since. Clean but very dated. And the parking IS a problem. 
24234 The best in L.A. Excellent service, immaculate rooms, central location. 
24235 Great location if you want to explore downtown Chicago. Pretty close to all the main spots. Very clean hotel and friendly staff. The rooms are not very big, but a big walk-in shower is always a plus! I would definately return there. 
24236 Big bathroom with nice fixtures, but they dripped. Okay sized room with big closet, but dirty carpet. The staff was super helpful but I had to drag my suitcase up the stairs alone and the halls were dark and really, the place needs more updating. 
24237 Personale cortese ed efficiente, camere pulite, computer con internet e stampante a disposizione. Tutto bello tranne la camera di dimensioni microscopiche con la FINESTRA SIGILLATA. Siamo stati 4 giorni senza poter respirare, alla fine tenevamo aperta la porta del corridoio per cambiare l'aria. 
24238 From reading the reviews I expected a somewhat unpleasant room but convenient location. I shortened <!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC 
24239 BEWARE !!!...No security what so ever - no gaurds,no cameras, desk closed at night. Had all 4 wheels and tires stolen from my vehicle parked in front of the hotel!! Was not warned of lack of security and hotel offered no compensation. 
24240 Stayed here right before Christmas. Were very happy with our room, the staff, and it was in a fantastic location. Will definitely stay there again. 
24241 Very good Westin experience. great location.. walking distance to tons of night life. Easy for everything. Good executive lounge. Service at the hotel was excellent. no complaints here. Would surely stay again. 
24242 I loved staying here through the combination of luxury hotel with some industrial architecture was great, service was good and my room was very comfortable, esp compared to other hotels in NY i have stayed in 
24243 No complains at all. Adequate size room, decent price, great roof top bar and very good breakfast. Excellent location and very polite and helpful staff. Soundproof at night, so good night sleep. Parking across the street at a very decent rate. Great location 
24244 The Sofitel New York is a wonderful, romantic gem. We stayed in a junior suite (roughly 650 sq ft) and it was luxurious beyond fault. And it was priced around what many other Mid-town hotels charge for a room alone. For me, this is the place to stay in Mid-town. 
24245 The rooms are small, but very clean, confortable and modern. The location is excellent. The best cost benefit of new york that I found. 
24246 Small room, dirty towels and poor service. I will never book it again (and also the chain). I booked it for New Years Eve. Also very expensive for this quality. 
24247 LIked everything about the Thompson LES. Do wish they had a coffee maker in the room. 
24248 Every Year I'm coming to the same hotel for a few days. My room was impeccable, everybody was very helpful and efficient, specially Jose Marmolejos. On July I'm going again expecting to have the same nice experience. I will share with the site my experience. Maria Florence Oliverio 
24249 No complaints about our stay at The Hotel at Times Square. For the price I don't think you can beat it in NYC. Room was clean and large by NY standards, price reasonable, staff friendly, great location near Times Square and transportation. 
24250 It was a bargain to stay at the Manhattan Broadway Hotel. Staff was great, rooms clean, great shower, but like everyone said it was all about LOCATION!! LOCATION!!! LOCATION!!! Marcos Shibuta 
24251 From arrival to departing the stay was excelent. Staff very professional and eager to please. Very good vibe in the hotel. Pefect location. Room was comfortable. Bars, Restaurant, Room Service and roof top were all very good. I would stay again and recommend to others. 
24252 2nd time at this little gem. Location great, decor fab, customer service needs a little attention but not enough to put me off. 
24253 This hotel was everything I imagine and more. Perfect location. My room over looked the park and the service was fabulous. If your looking for a unique experience, you have found it at the Gramercy Park Hotel. 
24254 Great location. Great room with diamond membership - 42nd floor. room was very clean. view of the hudson river and chrysler building. front desk was very hospitable. 
24255 Hotel molto curato ed in una posizione molto comoda per visitare tutte le attrazioni principali. Empire State Building a tre minuti. Metro praticamente li. Reception molto gentile ed albergo molto pulito, difficile da trovare a New York. 
24256 Overall, we had a very enjoyable stay in Fall 02. The staff was very courteous and we had a comfortable albeit somewhat smaller than average room but consistent with rate. The location provides easy access to Michigan Ave. We would definitely stay again. 
24257 This was the worst hotel. No lift, we had to also carry luggage to 3 floor! , The bed was hard to sleep, unpleasant staff. Luckily we were there for only 20 hours, no more this hotel 
24258 The Palace's mid-town location is perfect for visiting Fifth Avenue and Rockefeller Center and offers relatively easy-access to Broadway (10-15 min walk.) Their package which includes parking and breakfast is great and they've always let us check in early. Also, concierge very helpful making "special" dinner reservations. 
24259 Ok not the greatest hotel in the world but charming all the same. Great building and you really know you are in New York. Art every where and I loved the staircase. 
24260 We sat for drinks and we had to turn back 3 bottles of champagne back. That was not the issue the issue was the way it was handled by the sommelier which felt insulted even though he knew that his product was not but to snuff. 
24261 Impeccable service! Make sure you ask for the pet goldfish when you check in. 
24262 The Wheeler Mansion is a beautiful hotel, and the staff was very friendly and helpful. The owner is a very nice woman. The rooms were well-appointed and comfortable. Recommended! 
24263 I enjoyed my stay at Athens Hotel Suites very much: very neat and perfectly clean rooms, absolutely perfect location, very friendly, helpful and lovely stuff, good breakfasts, I couldn't ask for more! Highly recomended, I'm sure going to go back there next time I'm in Houston. 
24264 A very nice new hotel. Larg room, very clean, nice people 
24265 Lovely hotel in an amazing location and great value for money. Extremely friendly and helpful staff. Rooms are very basic and quite small but with so much to see and do in New York you don't spend much time in your room! 
24266 EL SITIO DEL HOTEL ES PERFECTO PARA EL VISITANTE, NUNCA HIECIERON ASEO DURANTE LA ESTADIA EL CONTROL DE INGRESO A LAS HABITACIONES PARECE NO ESTAR CONTROLADO, LAS CAMAS SON DEFICIENTES, LA TENCION DE LOS RECEPCIONISTAS ES MUY DESPOTA NO SON NADA AMABLES, ESTA ES MI OPINION 
24267 If you're looking for a boutique hotel in the Theater District, Muse is a interesting and fun choice. Not over the top with frills but a very solid selection. The decor is unique. You must check out the bathrooms on the first floor. 
24268 Perfect hotel for one night. Pretty old layout. The bathroom is old but clean. Wireless cost about 12$ per day but worked very well in my room. 
24269 Price was right and the service was great. The rooms were clean and comfortable and the pillows were actually nice. 
24270 Like many others have stated this worked great b/c of the relatively low price, location, and cleanliness. Will stay here again. 
24271 the classic hotel whit a service excellent, sailence ,quite. location excellent near museums and shopping 
24272 This was like traveling back in time, older hotel,desk clerk issuing real key,delicious deli next door,so friendly,inexpensive. I would return for sure. 
24273 I've stayed in this hotel twice now and both times we had a fantastic time. The room were great with iPod dock, tv, safe etc. location is amazing 2 minutes from Times Square. Don't hesitate to book. We stayed in a deluxe room 
24274 La camera davvero molto bella con letto piu' che confortevole a 2 piazze ampie, moquette molto pulita, l'unica pecca era il lavandino del bagno davvero troppo piccolo. Personale gentile e disponibile ma con esclusiva conoscenza della lingua inglese...... 
24275 Large room by NYC standards, but DO NOT eat in the restaurant. Food service was extremely overpriced, food quality poor and definitely not 'customer service friendly'. Discussed with management and their offer to compensate for all of the problems we experienced was to comp us 'next time'. 
24276 It not bad for this price, of course not Hilton, but the sheets are clean, the towels are changed every day, the staff is polite, and the location is really wonterful 
24277 Nice, new clean hotel with great rooms and some of the best bathrooms I've ever seen. The lobby is rather small but was not congested when ever I walked through it. 
24278 We had a good stay in your hotel. The only thing that was not good was the space in your "breakfast" room. There is very little space and only 4 tables, witch in my opinion is not enough! I have no more remarks! 
24279 Super location and great service.Beautiful Frette bedlinen and really nice china in the rooms.Gorgeous bath amenities ! Beds are really comfortable and even though it is a large hotel ,service is very efficient.Location is good and 5th Avenue is just a short stroll.Would definitely stay here again! 
24280 Beetje duur, maar dan heb je wel een prima hotel op een nog betere locatie! Voor een kort snel bezoek aan NY is dit dan ook een ideaal hotel, Times Square, Cental Park, Broad Way, 5th Avenue, Empire State Building, allemaal op loop afstand! 
24281 questo albergo e senzaltro vecchio e un po trasandato ma la sua posizione in times square e comodissima. noi siamo stati 6 giorni senza problemi ma non guardavamo il comfort. il fatto che era cosi vicina al centro piu che paga la scelta 
24282 Lovely hotel in a fantastic location. Rooms were a good size and clean, however, the lifts were a nightmare! The View Restaurant was fantastic and the view incredible - and certainly not an experience to be missed! 
24283 Stayed in Nov 2011 with Wife and Teenaged Daughter. We were on a sight seeing / shopping trip. The hotel is perfect for such a trip to NY. Rooms large and spacious. Staff very friendly. Overal Highly recommended 
24284 Booked through Purely America.co.uk - superb price for 3 rooms. Check-in staff fantastic when we arrived (Christmas Day), rooms were immaculate and kept as such throughout. Great views, friendly staff, reasonable prices at the bar and restaurant. Would happily return & recommend. 
24285 What was once a great NYC hotel is now just a ordinay hotel that is on campaign to make a big profit.No deluxe extras now(candy on the pillow,night turndown) and a bathroom with a broken faucet.This is not worth the money and is living on past reputation. 
24286 Great hotel in Manhattan - just down the road from the Empire State building and Macy's. The room was large with two comfortable queen size beds. Great having a kitchen area for preparing drinks and the odd snack. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Highly recommend! 
24287 Comfortable, friendly hotel. Room was clean and bed was very nice. Decent little pool. When I left something in the room, the staff mailed it to me very quickly. The neighborhood is not the best. However, the hotel itself seems safe. 
24288 This hotel is so glamorous and beautiful! The staff is amazing and breakfast was amazing. Although expensive, they have deals that you can ask about. They offer hotel rooms at a discount with breakfast and appetizer passes! 
24289 This hotel was not only impeccably clean, but the staff was so helpful and courteous! I would 100% stay here again on my next trip to New York. The room was cozy and clean and the location was in a very accessible part of Times Square. Excellent! 
24290 Affinia is very conveniently located in NYC. I stayed here over a weekend in June. The rooms are spacious, by New York City standards. They are well designed and have a modern feel to it. 
24291 ottima posizione, stanze pulite anche se relativamente piccole, (cmq in linea con gli alberghi di ny) e grande servizio: tutti gentili e molto disponibili da consigliare 
24292 The Milford for the price is not bad the rooms are small and even on the 22nd floor the street noise was pretty loud ;However the location is great and within easy walking distance to Times Square and Subways. Stayed March 3rd thru March 6th and would stay again. 
24293 It is a great hotel, just steps away from Fifth Avenue, Bryant Park. Great service, elegant, comfortable, clean. Of course I will stay in this hotel again on my next visit to NY 
24294 I spent three days with colleagues in this hotel (was not my first choice) but I would recommend it. The location is great, room service pretty fast and all extra needs (transportation booking, etc) addressed very fast. 
24295 The hotel is not new but it is well maintained. I can't complain about the location, only a couple of blocks to Magnificent Mile, Restaurants, and other sights are within walking distance. The rooms are clean, and quite. The staff are friendly and helpful. 
24296 My 2 sisters stayed here for my birthday weekend. It is, like all Midtown decent hotels, expensive. We loved the location and easy access to the subway and to Broadway. No bedbugs! Service was 100% amazing! Kudos to Michael, our porter the night we arrived!!!! 
24297 Walking distance to many of NYC famous lanndmarks. Great service and extra touches: complimentary fruit tray & bottled water, turn down service and so on. Very quiet and large room (considering NYC) with nice views of the chrysler building. 
24298 I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. I have stayed here twice and the check-in both times was quick and easy. The hotel is very clean and elegant. Beds are very comfortable and my room both times was very quiet. The room is spacious. 
24299 In the heart of Times Square! Great views from the rooms. Very helpful staff re: tourist information. 
24300 Really cool hotel, especially the design and the different bars/food spots inside. Perfect for taking a date for the weekend. The staff was always accommodating and friendly but not annoying, a rare thing to come by and that alone would make me go back. Awesome beds. 
24301 The staff was friendly. The hotel and restaurant were beautiful. The rooms were modern and comfy. The location was ideal for Union Station and sightseeing. 
24302 The Comfort Inn Midtown was a great place. Although the room was small, it had everything we needed. The Continental breakfast was great too. The staff was quite friendly and the hotel was clean. Well worth the money. The high speed wireless internet sucked though. Did not function properly. 
24303 I stayed for 3 nights November 2002. Location is superb. It is a small boutique type of hotel. I had no problems and staff were couteous. There was some water leaking problem in the Piano/Bar area. Not a nice thing but did not imapct my stay in any way. 
24304 I stayed here once and meet the general manager who couldnt be nicer! Rooms are very large and clean. Location is great lots of places in the area for dinner and some shopping. I hope my travels bring me back to Houston again real soon. 
24305 Very nice hotel. Great location. Kid friendly. Little grocery store on the corner for cereal and milk for kiddies, beer for mom and dad! Clean, nice size room. Small, slow elevators but with all the other good things, it's managable. Will come back. 
24306 This was a very nice hotel. The rooms are large for a NY hotel. The linens are fabulous. The lobby was pretty. The view was nice. One of the elevators was out of service but we didn't have to wait too long on any given day. 
24307 Typical large hotel. Average service on check-in and check-out: nothing outstanding. Rooms getting a bit tired. Standard of daily room service not really up to expected standards at hotel of this type. Location, location, location - top position for the short term visitor to the city. 
24308 Stayed here in March 2012 for March Break with my kids, and we loved the UES location and amenities--great room size, beds, etc., decent gym. Staff were very efficient and courteous. Slept well every night--very quiet room on a higher floor, very clean. Would definitely stay here again! 
24309 My husband and I stayed at this La Quinta to vist family in the Houston area and we had an amazing stay. Everything was clean the front desk was so helpful and nice! We will be staying here again for our next vist! 
24310 This is one awesome hotel. I came here on business had a great stay, would recommend it highly 
24311 Staff was outstanding in service. Rooms is unique. View is fantastic overlooking downtown, New Jersey, Uptown Manhattan. 
24312 I visit the city quite often and this is probably the best hotel I've stayed in. Clean, quiet, comfortable, yet still close to the action and affordable. I will definately be back! 
24313 Nice hotel, room clean and comfortable. Food really nice, booked the per theatre meal and the taste was exceptional, service was ok too, would not hesitate to return 
24314 Concierge service was great, made us feel really safe too. 
24315 The title says it all. Staff was helpful with knowledge of the city, rooms were clean, comfy, and reasonably priced. 
24316 HOTEL A TRE STELLE MA CON TUTTI I SERVIZI DI UN 5 STELLE. OTTIMA POSIZIONE, VICINO ALLA METRO E AI LUOGHI DELLO SHOPPING E DELL'INTRATTENIMENTO. OTTIMO STAFF, HOTEL CONFORTEVOLE E PULITO. OTTIMO RAPPORTO QUALITA' PREZZO. 
24317 Het hotel heeft een perfecte ligging, het is 10 minuten lopen naar Times Square en ligt recht tegenover Pennsylvania Station. De kamers waren schoon, alleen wel wat achterhaald en het hotel was gehorig. Service in het hotel was goed 
24318 Rooms are beautiful and comfy, staff is helpful and attentive. A little south for my liking but overall always a great stay. 
24319 The hotel was modern and clean and in a great location. My only complaint is that the rooms were too small for a family. I would recommend this hotel for a business traveler or a couple, but not for families. The food was also very good, but pricey. 
24320 We stayed at the hotel end of July 04 and were really pleased. The rooms are big and clean. The staff is very friendly. We can recommend the hotel to those who look for a quiet, but good location near Times Square. 
24321 The staff was excellent and very helpful!!!! I thought the rooms were a bit small. What I really liked was the free bottled water on each floor and we could refill as much as we wanted. 
24322 Had an ant problem on both nights that I stayed, however the staff was great! 
24323 In keeping with the Four Seasons experience, the service was excellent and they had the best club sandwich I've eaten. The pecan pie was also excellent. The location is convenient for business during the day, but lacks options at night. 
24324 We booked this hotel on Jetsetter, which was a great deal. We enjoyed our stay here. The location is great, walking distance to the city center. Very close to fifth ave. Friendly staff, nice, clean room. 
24325 Very close to everything. No problem with the staff or rooms. Even got a late check out. Im quite pleased I didnt take into account some negative comments posted. Would do again. 
24326 This was our 40th wedding anniversary celebration, with the accommodations and midtown location very good. Room service seemed quite expensive, and we had to utilize the lobby for free internet access. 
24327 Fantastic spot, Close to everything. Stayed 2 days. Better ThanksHilton higher brands. Very Good value for money. Stayed in a corner room, very nice view. Selected as gesto of the day had a complimentary breakfast. Great! 
24328 Ho soggiornato con un collega in questo hotel dal 30 luglio al 4 agosto 2011.posizione perfetta,vicina al empire state bulding e a time square,silenzioso,camere pulite e personale molto cortese.vicino all hotel c e un ottimo pub e la fermata della metro.lo consiglio a chiunque voglia visitare la stupenda nyc! 
24329 Very clean room and wonderful service. Small room but good price. Pool in basement. Great location that is easy to find. Would stay again on next visit to Chicago. I recommend without reservation. Great service began the moment I pulled up. 
24330 Thought the location was excellent, practically underneath The Empire State Building. Plenty of bars and restaurants on the doorstep. Rooms were clean, warm and comfortable. LOVED the art-deco bathroom. Helpful, friendly staff. An oasis in the middle of a briiliant city. 
24331 This small, comfortable hotel was very pleasant to stay in for business in NY. The room was very small but well-appointed; the staff was very friendly and helpful and the breakfast buffet was fast and easy. 
24332 An amazing hotel a minute's walk away from Times Square - a lovely atmosphere in the lobby, restaurant and in the (cozy but very clean and comfortable) rooms. The service was always friendly and efficient and I just couldn't believe how close it was to the action! 
24333 rooms were clean, but small. Bathroom was also small. Bed came with a choice of pillows. No traffic noise from outside. Staff was friendly and helpful. 
24334 While I have stayed in the majority of hotels in New York, this must be my favourite. Sofitel has proven to be a name I can trust and I will return very soon. A big thank you to the concierge staff for helping to locate my suitcase. 
24335 Loved the location and the rooms were clean. After reading a few reviews I was worried about the elavators, but both have now been renovated and we had no wait at all. Would recommend for the price, quite a find 
24336 Everything was good...nice atmosphere. Pool was great. Walking distance to c-store. 
24337 Definitely not a place I would rush back to. The carpets in the hallways are old and filthy. Clearly they have not paid a lot of attention to upkeep in certain areas of the hotel. However, the room itself was clean- 
24338 The hotel is a Chicago GEM!!! This old hotel has all kinds of charm. The staff made the weekend very enjoyable. The rooms are small but quaint. Easy walk to almost everything. Quick cab ride to Navy Pier. Great fun. Worth the money. 
24339 I've stayed at this hotel on a number of busines trips to NY. Great location near Central Park and Times Square. Carolyn at the front desk provides excellent customer service, greeting me my name - how often does that happen these days? 
24340 I love this hotel. It was my first time staying there. The interior was clean and well-appointed. The room that I stayed in was spacious from what I hear about NYC hotels. No complaints! 
24341 Had a great overnight stay here. The junior suite was more spacious than I would have expected for NYC. Bed was very comfortable. Service was good. I would return! Make sure you get a burger at the Burger Joint in the lobby. One of the best burgers I've ever had! 
24342 An old amazing hotel. The service is great, very big rooms, awesome views and perfect location. I totally recommend it 
24343 If you are lucky enough like our family was, you too might be able to get a discount. Just find the cockroaches!!!! We received $50.00 off a two-night stay. 
24344 Thank you to the staff at the St. Regis Houston Hotel. We had a wonderful business trip. Our room were incredible, the service was immaculate and the staff and front desk was friendly and courteous. 
24345 as a female solo traveler, i never felt unsafe in the neighborhood. i found the room comfy and clean and very pretty. i wrote letters in the cafe and was a little sad when i left. i just booked my next stay. 
24346 Had a great stay. Beautiful room, looking over Times Square. Lots of theatre & shopping around. Staff very courteous & helpful. Here on a business conference and really enjoyed the stay. The beds were UNREAL. Probably the BEST bed I have EVER slept in. 
24347 By far the nicest hotel we've ever stayed in - its Waldorf Astoria NY, nothing further needs to be said !! 
24348 I can't have good words for this hotel. Rooms are so small that we didn't even know where to put our luggage. The only good thing about is the location, in the centre of Manhattan. Dirty, smelly and noisy. 
24349 DO NOT VALET PARK YOUR CAR AT THIS HOTEL. The hotel room itself was fine, but the valet caused damage to my brand new car. Terrible experience. 
24350 This is a hotel past its prime - dowdy furnishings seemed almost dirty and the breakfast was appalling - tired offerings of scrambled eggs, plain white bread and mushy cereals or pancakes. No orange juice, sliced unripe melon and pineapple......... you can do better at the Starbucks down the road! 
24351 We stayed there mid-August for 5 nights. Just for a couple, the room is very big, with a good king bed. We can make shopping and eat in a walking distance. 
24352 Granted, the room was somewhat small (as are most NY hotel rooms), but it was clean, comfortable and equipped with a bathroom and an effective AC unit. Hotel staff was friendly and the hotel lies on a quiet street, yet only blocks from Times Square. 
24353 A really beautiful hotel in close proximity to the shopping area. The hotel was lovely decorated everywhere. The rooms were clean and the sheets crisp. The staff were very helpful from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. We would definitely stay there again. 
24354 You get what you pay for here. We weren't expecting much and we got exactly that. The rooms were too small, no a/c, no room service, mediocre breakfast and our room also looked into a brick wall. We left and went to Doubletree. I will give them a clean bathroom. 
24355 What can i say, this place is right where you want to be! Next to the church of scientology and minutes walk to Times Square. Its expensive though, and the rooms are very small - but comfortable and you have everything you need. 
24356 small but good hotel, very clean, european style furniture, breakfast included in the hotel room, close to financial district and Wall Street, also close to many subway stops (lines 2,3, 4,5, j,z ), no shops but many restaurants nearby, quite area 
24357 Good hotel Located only 500 meters from the south entrance of central park and broadway and app 2 km from the Empire State Building. Only negative comment was that usage of the Fitness facilities cost 19$ for 1 hour usage. 
24358 Stayed here on my first stay in NY. Great location and phenomenal price. Best value. Close to everything. Staff was great and rooms were comfortable. We had an evolution room with a city view of the Empire State Building. Will definately stay here again. 
24359 Attractive design, good location in a real neighbourghood, big bed. But the room was so small - I know that is a feature of staying in NYC, but 4inches between 2 sides of the bed and the walls: I kept banging my foot on it 
24360 W just keeps getting better and this one may be the best yet. Every one who works here is freindly and makes you feel like they care about you, it is fun we loved it and location is great. 
24361 What a majestic hotel with history throughout! I was there on a business trip and was amazed at the hotel's grander, the historic peacock doors designed by Tiffany, and the hand painted ceiling. More importantly, the rooms were perfect, the staff great, and the quietness throughout. 
24362 While on business in NYC I usually stay at another brand. However, I found this hotel to be quite exquisite and centrally located. 
24363 We stayed here for two nights with our basketball team. It was a very pleasant stay. I highly reccomend this hotel. 
24364 This hotel is wonderful!! It is right by the Galleria mall and many restaurants. The rooms are spacious and the fitness center is comprehensive. All of the staff were extremely friendly and helped to make my stay even better. You can't go wrong with this hotel choice in Houston. 
24365 The location met my requirement for meeting with clients. It was close to many eating establishments. I felt it was overpriced for the quality of the facility. I will look around for a better price before staying there again. 
24366 sober, maar netjes, ligt zeer centraal in Manhattan. Alle belangrijke atracties zijn zonder problemen te belopen, evenals metro etc. Keurige bediening. Voor de prijs en de plek een prima hotel.!! Dit was voor ond de tweede keer dat wij gebruikmaakten van het hotel. 
24367 This hotel was in a fantastic location right in the middle of Greenwich Village... The staff was nice, the bar was cool, and the hotel was walking distance of great nightlife and restaurants. You definitely are paying for location, the room was tiny (but clean) and non-descript... 
24368 The Staff of this hotel are extremely helpful and pleasant. The hotel is in a great location close to subway stations and Times Square. We really enjoyed our stay here! 
24369 As usual we had a wonderful experience at the New Yorker and the price was right. It's well located for our business needs and the staff is friendly and helpful. We always stay at the New Yorker when visiting New York. 
24370 This hotel was conveniently located by CVS and Times Square. It was clean, modern, and efficient. Great for a girls trip or a romatic weekend. I will use this hotel again. 
24371 We enjoyed our stay in this hotel. It was very clean, the staff were extremely friendly and the queen beds were great. The view of the river was incredible. The only drawback that we had to this hotel was there was not a refrigerator / microwave. 
24372 I come every year. The hotel is excellent, perfectly situated and the staff is great. Also very nice restaurants in the hotel and nearby 
24373 We had a week in this hotel and couldn't fault it at all. Great central park location, rooms were very clean, food was lovely. Just round the corner from fifth avenue, and close to the tube. Would be happy to recommend this hotel to others. 
24374 Rooms were small but very nicely furnished - large comfortable bed, flat screen etc. Staff helpful and friendly. Good location for shopping and restaurants. 
24375 This hotel worked out perfect for our weekend stay. The Red Line is right outside the hotel which is so convenient if you are taking in a ballgame at Wrigley. The hotel was clean, staff nice and the attached Weber Grill was perfect for a quick cocktail or yummy breakfast. 
24376 The Hudson was clean but very unfriendly and the bedrooms small and dull. I also found this hotel hard to find. Near the theatre but on the whole I was dissappointed. 
24377 A great location and although it was right on Times Square, it was quiet in our room. Staff was very helpful. 
24378 Centrally Located on Rush St near the Mag Mile .You can walk to everything.Corner Room was clean and comfortable.Nice amenities including DVD player.Staff was friendly .Overall expirence worthy of a 4star rating 
24379 We have frequented numerous hotels in the Manhattan area. The Hilton never disappoints. The prices were a little steep. That aside, they were very attentive to our needs during our stay. 
24380 We got a great rate, and we weren't disappointed in the motel. It's in Murray Hill on 31st Street and Lexington, so it's an awesome walk to Times Square if you like to walk and sightsee at the same time. 
24381 I had a wonderful stay at the marriot marque. I was suprised because the noise leval was amazing even before when we went to las vegas, the noise you could hear inside the hotel room. 
24382 Refreshing. Excellent executive lounge and again a superb gym. Love their presidents club where they provide sporting kit. Wonderful touch. 
24383 Pros - Location by Times Square - Spacey rooms Cons - Very noicy AC - Expensive Wifi - Slow elevators Tips - Amy's bread around the corner at 7th Ave - excellent for breakfast 
24384 overall it was a good place to stay but the staff seemed totally disinterested in their guests. 
24385 An excellent property, located in the heart of Times Square. Convenient to theaters, restaurants, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station, and Macy's. Friendly staff, modern rooms, and part of the Starwood loyalty program. Willie Tongo was especially helpful in resolving a reservation snafu (that I created). 
24386 Very modern, and a nice size room. A bit pricey, but its in NYC in a pretty decent location. Request a street view for a better view, the backside is an ugly view of a rooftop and back of another building. 
24387 Perfect location to Times Sq, Central Park, etc. Near a NYC Sightseeing bus stop. Clean and well appointed rooms. Helpful staff and a very good Italian restaurant on site. 
24388 I was there with a group of friends. Excelent location and very friendly staff. Steps away from a subway station. 
24389 This is the only place we stay when in Houston: great value, great location, great facilities, warm cookies! 
24390 The property was recently revonated and luckily had a sink in the room as the baths are shared. It's a budget property but you can usually find comps with your own potty. The elevator smells like bug spray and it's very noisy. 
24391 Whenever I travel to NYC this is the hotel I'll stay in. I have a lot of relatives in the area, so I go there often. in my opinion unbeatable price/quality in the heart of the city. 
24392 Our room was at the back of the hotel so we were subjected to loud voices from a bar at night. There was also loud music in the lobby at night. We were exhausted after running all around the city so it was irritation we didn't need. 
24393 This hotel was great!! The staff was very friendly and lots of help, the hotel was clean, nice location, and very up to date!! 
24394 The entire staff was very professional and accommating.Leo Linton was especially helpful when he went out of his way to help me with a problem I had with a parking coupon. 
24395 A great hotel, the crew of the hotel is very help. the room is little small, but very fancy clean and nice bath stuff. near the times square. 
24396 I've stayed at Morgans hotels in San Francisco and London, so I want to try the "original." This one has the same cool vibe, clean rooms with slightly funky/modern furniture and fixtures. A great hotel for a quiet stay during a business trip. 
24397 Traveled there for a two night stay with my wife. Rooms are small but clean an comfortable.. The location was superb since we came to sight see in time square. everything was within walking distance... Empire state building Rockefeller center shopping and restaurants was very close by...would Surely return! 
24398 Fabulous Hotel, Great Location, Excellent service, Delicious Breakfast! ***If you got a car, just cross the street from the hotel there is a parking : 12 hours for 12$! Which is way cheaper than sofitel parking! 
24399 I love this place. Will go back again. It beats the Trump Intl Hotel and Tower around the corner where the 'rents usually stayed in years past. 
24400 Price is fair and the room is pretty clean and comfortable 
24401 Went here for 5 nights and had a great time. The location is fantastic, just 10 minute walk to times square. Everyday new towels and roomcleaning. The showers are clean and perfect. I would visit the pod again 
24402 Stayed for several days with grandkids. Fantastic expeerience. Front desk upgraded us to a larger available room. Fantastic city and park views, 2 bathrooms, excellent in room dining service, and the pool on roof which got visited every day - great morning aquasize class; singing Bellman (really funny with grands). 
24403 This is a nice and clean hotel for a decent price very close to times square. Thanks to Catherina who took very good care of all my needs, I will definitely come back. 
24404 Not as good as you'd expect; convinient rooms & location but service must be improved, completely 
24405 Friendly efficient staff, convenient and reasonable rate parking, right across from Gershwin theatre. Breakfast good but crowded. Rooms are good size, clean , comfortable. Would be sure to stay again if back into NYC 
24406 Traveled with three friends to see two Yankees-Cubs games. First trip to Chicago and the Marriott staff made it a real treat, from early check-in to securing tickets for a Saturday game. Great location, easy access to subway, great proximity to some fine restaurants. I highly recommend this property. 
24407 Wonderful hotel. Rooms are beautifully finished and extremely comfortable without being fussy or uncomfortably trendy. Service is amazing. Staff in all departments are polite and gracious. Hotel is in the perfect business and leisure location. Will be my hotel of choice in New York from now on! 
24408 we like a lot the hotel. we will come back. clean and big room, very quiet. we slept excellent!!! 
24409 We recently stayed at the Comfort Inn on 46th. It is very close to time square and many broadway shows and many restaurants. The location is great. The rooms were small but very clean. The breakfast was an added plus. 
24410 well-suited for business travel and families. clean, a bit light on decor. staff greeted me by name regularly over my stay, nice touch and can't say that's ever happened in new york. the onsite restaurant, Rare, is excellent. great value for NYC. 
24411 The staff was great and the room was updated and clean. Ideal location for Madison Square Garden and the Empire State Building. 
24412 No wi-fi, dark room, noisy neibors(Chinese refugee and hyspanic-)- My digital camera was stolen by the cleaning made, but the front woman staff hysterically tried to deny the fact, and call 911(Oh my god!) I definitely refuse choosing the 'agry' 'the refugee-stay'hotel in my lifetime. 
24413 Tiny room smelling of stale smoke. A/C unit wouldn't cool, only fan. Bathroom ceiling leaked severely when it rained. While the location is excellent, the lack of quality for the price makes it feel like a ripoff. 
24414 We have choosen this hotel bec of the Paris experience but it was far waya from our expectations 
24415 Very tiny Hotel , 4 star experience 
24416 With the sam e price u can find a better alternative in NY 
24417 Friendly staff and good location is a plus. 
24418 Extremely pricey for what you got: scratched furniture, walls needing painting, bulky TV sets, no coffee pot in room, no ice bucket, had to ask for shampoo and conditioner, uninformed and uninterested front desk people, doorman missing most of the time, so so room cleanliness, charge for internet 
24419 Staff is great. Breakfast is excellent. Rooms are comfortable. Internet spotty at best and sometimes non-existent. Not enough Elevators, but that can not be helped now. The prices keep going up and the level of service keeps going down. The two night "social" is amusing. Won't do that again.... 
24420 SI VOUS ALLEZ A NEW YORK N'HESITER PAS CET HOTEL EST AU CENTRE DE TOUT LA VUE EST MAGNIFIQUE ET LE SERVICE AU TOP N'HESITER PAS A SOLICITER LE CONCERGE POUR N IPORTE QUOI IL EST AU TOP EST SUPER SYMPA 
24421 Stayed 4 nights in the Sofitel in May 04. Booked a suite, got the best deal from their website. Staff, room and view were excellent. I simply can't complain and would certainly choose the Sofitel again. 
24422 We stay for a couple of nights, super clean, friendly and helpful staff,zero noise. Overall pleasant stay 
24423 Very affordable and a great location downtown. But between the smell and cock roaches I wouldn't stay here again. Luckily by reading the other reviews we were somewhat prepared and knowing we would be running around and not sleeping much it seemed like a good idea. 
24424 I have been coming to this hotel for about 10 years for an annual meeting in November. It is convenient, always has great service, and the room is spacious and clean. As an added bonus I had a corner room on the eighth floor and the view was great. 
24425 I'm not at all sure you get what you pay for here. The location is literally on the airport rail system. The lobby and restaurants are really nice. But what a disappointment when you get to your 2star room 
24426 This place was great. In the heart of NYC, great clean rooms, awesome service, wonderful sleep... We loved it! 
24427 Golden age of Hollywood feel with attentive service and all the things you love about a Hilton Hotel! The beds were opulent, the decor awesome. Parking was very expensive. Save the money and take the train or a shuttle to downtown. 
24428 DAS HOTEL LIEGT IM BESTEN LAGE IM HERZEN MANNHATANS. MANN KANN SOGAR ZU FUSS VIELE SEHENWUERDIGKETEN BESUCHEN. IST SEHR GROSS UND MIT WENIGE MUEHE KOENNTE VIEL BESSER SEIN. EMPFEHLENSWERT FUER DIE JENIGE, DIE DAS HOTEL NUR ZUM SCHLAFFEN BENUTZEN. 
24429 Went to NYC for a recent weekend getaway.......This hotel was perfect; Right in the middle of midtown; Great Prices, Nice Restaurant! I would definitely stay there again 
24430 Hotel was located centrally .Concierge called Brooke was exceptional and knew all the best restaurants and bars .Gregorys across the road was the best place for breakfast,clean and tidy.Missed tea in the room in the morning only downside .Ask for a quiet room .Brilliant all round 
24431 This hotel is in a great, safe location. Staff is friendly. Rooms are a bit small (even by NY standards) but they are clean and have nice bathrooms. The price is excellent given the central location. I would definitely stay here again. 
24432 The best staff in NYC, they truly care about the service and helping everyone with there needs. The Hotel is clean and the location is fantastic!! 
24433 Ottima posizione, tutto vicino e facilmente raggiungibile: Central Park, Bryant Park, Time Square, ecc. Albergo di buon livello. Camere piccole e un po rumorose se vicino agli ascensori. Pulizia non impeccabile. Ottimo se usato solo per dormire. 
24434 Ubicado en uno de los puntos centricos mas accesibles de la ciudad. La higene y arreglo de las habitaciones es muy buena. El personal es muy cordial. Quedamos muy satisfechos con la eleccion de este hotel. 
24435 Traveled to New York for St. Patrick's Day. Wanted a hotel that was clean and affordable. This hotel is in the heart of China Town. Had a great view of the Empire State Building from our hotel. Very cute boutique hotel. Would stay here again. 
24436 I visit NY a few times yearly. I always stay at OTA. The hospitality is consistently excellent. My visits get better each time. 
24437 Lost our reservation on the day of our son's wedding. Implied it was my fault but I am sure I knew the date of my son's wedding! Could not help us locate another hotel room- did nothing to fix the problem and the manager, kathy, hung up on me. 
24438 Great location. Walking distance to most attractions. The loft rooms on the 15th floor are fantastic. Million dollar views of the Hudson !! Great, helpful staff! 
24439 Great location on Michigan avenue, yet old and tired. Heat in room is so loud, hard to sleep. Needs a Shot in the arm. The staff is good though! 
24440 No se ajusta el precio con el servicio contratado, no podiamos desayunar, porque no habia espacio para desayunar. los dos primeros dias desayunamos de pie, el resto de dias nos tuvimos que coger el desayuno y desayunar en la habitacion. la calefaccion no funcionaba. 
24441 Zeer fijne ligging, groot en toch gezellig , gaan zeker terug ! Voor alle info kan je er terecht , zelfs tickets kan je er bestellen. Het ontbijt is ook echt super, wat duurder dan buiten het hotel maar zijn geld wel waard 
24442 Do not be fooled by this hotels website, this hotel is very old fashioned, dirty and falling apart which is such a shame as it is in a great location. 
24443 The hotel is conveniently located a block from the Clark/Divison red line. The rates are reasonable and the staff are friendly. The front desk seemed overwhelmed during both checkin and checkout, that process could be improved. 
24444 The title suns it up. Service is exactly what is expected in an upscale hotel. Rooms are roomy, beds comfortable, and views are nice. As in most hotels, room service is pricey. 25 bucks for a large pot of coffee - ouch! Free Internet in lobby. 
24445 + direkt an subway + gratis wifi + midtown ist idealer ausgangspunkt (3 avenues bis zum empire state building, 8 strassen und eine avenue bis zum times square) + zimmergroesse und kategorie fuer NYC adequat + im angesclossenem tick tock diner gibt es gutes amerikanisches fruehstueck 
24446 At checkin the agent was cordial and very attentive, and escorted us to our accomodations. As usual at the Towers, the appointments of the suite were beautiful. The bedrooms are exceptionally comfortable, especially the Pillows! The food at the Bull & Bear is superb. 
24447 I had a Wonderful time in newyork and at the hotel. The staff was amazing and great help.I am actually gonna be coming back in nov and Im hoping to stay the manhatten again. 
24448 Location can't be beat, walking distance to Times Square/theatre district. The hotel was clean and room was nicely furnished. Staff at front desk are professional and accommodating (Geovanna is especially informative and friendly). Definitely will stay there again! A moderately priced hotel in the middle of Times Square! 
24449 Spacious rooms and bathrooms. Helfpful staff. Delicious breakfast. Great location. Good room service. Definitely recommend this hotel. 
24450 muy comodo.buena atencion. excelente ubicacion. muy buen precio. recomendable! 
24451 On a recent trip to Houston, Tx. I stayed at the Best Western Windsor Suites! The staff was very helpful and friendly! The rooms were nicely kept and very spacious. The hotel grounds were well maintained as well! All in all I would return and stay with them again. 
24452 Stayed for a long weekend and found the beds and linens superior. Rooms were large. Elevators fast. Staff very helpful. A great choice. 
24453 Deb ligging van hotel is uitstekend. Nabij belangrijke bezienswaardigheden maar ook op 100m afstand van een grote metro/treinstation (Penn Station). Onze kamer was proper, maar erg klein. Hadden een ander beeld toen we geboekt hebben. 
24454 All aspects of this hotel are outstanding. Beautiful rooms, extremely helpful and polite staff, great location. 
24455 I love this place for long stays in the city. Great location and spacious rooms for working. Some things like the rugs are dated and need replacing, however overall a great value. Best breakfast deal included. 
24456 We stayed at the Belvedere while in the city. Awesome location and very friendly staff. The room was very clean and comfortable. Everything we needed was available. I highly recommend this hotel! 
24457 Muy buena opcion para quien va a NY y quiere estar cerca de todo. Las habitaciones son amplias y muy limpias. El sector donde esta ubicado es tranquilo y se puede andar a pie hasta muy tarde sin problemas. Lo recomiendo!! 
24458 This hotel is well located and easily accessible through public transportation. There's free wireless everywhere and the staff are nice and helpfull. Clean and neat place. The rooms are not big, but you're in Manhattan... You shoudn't be spending a lot of time there, anyway! 
24459 The W on Lexington Ave is a great location no matter what you are looking to do in NYC. Service is great and it is very clean. The rooms were great and the beds were extremely comfortable. Great place to stay! 
24460 I was in Chicago on business recently and stayed at this property for a great rate. It is near everything and is a very nice, well maintained property. Make sure you get a corner room (xx02), because the the view is amazing!!! 
24461 My room was very clean and kept that way during my 5 night stay. The staff was always very friendly and helpful. Breakfast was excellent. I will definetly stay here again when visiting Houston. 
24462 Cool design, modernity, simplicity and efficiency are the strenght characteristics of Yotel 
24463 The best things about the Ohio House Motel are its location and its price. It was easy to get anywhere from there and the parking was included in the very low rate. 
24464 Well positioned small hotel excellent staff felt very well looked after ...for the entire stay (10 days) thank you and look forward to returning soon 
24465 Kleine kamers maar wel schoon; ontbijt niet mijn smaak maar het is er wel. Airco maakt veel lawaai. Douche ook klein maar wel elke dag schone handdoeken. Koffie en thee elke dag aangevuld. Locatie is prima! 
24466 Nice feeling and very positive personnel, perfect location Moma / Broadway behind the corner. Internet not included, that should be included room rates. Good otherwise.! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 
24467 Hotel is located near to some good bars and places to eat. Room was good and staff very helpful. Did not have the chance to try out the pool as we only stayed 2 days. 
24468 GREAT location!! the rooms are BIG...LOTS OF CLOSET SPACE....small kitchen included...nice with kids!!!! New mattress..the pull-out for my 9 year was so nice!!!!! Ask Ralph, doorman, for good restaurant recommendations!!! The staff very friendly. The diner next door has great food!!!! 
24469 Nova York, cidade monumental. Gosto especialmente desta cadeia internacional de hoteis. 
24470 Perfect location. Took train from airport and hotel was a block from our stop. Our City Pass tours picked up from the Palmer House too! Beautiful lobby and brand new Target across the street for any last minute items you forgot :) 
24471 Struttura e camere vecchie non molto curate con moquette ma diciamo che solo per dormirci era sufficiente. I bagni in comune erano sempre puliti. Asciugamani puliti ogni giorno in camera. Nelle camere il piccolo lavandino veniva pulito ogni giorno. Struttura adatta a dei ragazzi giovani. 
24472 From the time we arrived to the time we left, the service at this hotel was outstanding. Rooms were big for NYC, clean and safe from the city sounds. Definitely will be going back. 
24473 The standard room was quite small, but cozy. Everything was clean and the staff were all extremely friendly and professional. If you're going to see a show on Broadway the location definately cannot be beat. We are sure to stay here again and would strongly recommend it to others. 
24474 wonderful experience with pro staff and soft smiles,no complaints at all and everything needed was completely satisfied.Also very convenient location for all purpose.Hope to stay there every time. 
24475 Just a note to say that Nerma @ the front desk went above and beyond to assist me. Great stuff. SP Philadelphia 
24476 Old furniture. Old furniture. Old furniture. Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture.Old furniture. 
24477 The location is fantastic but the hotel seems empty---ghost town. Food is over priced but there are better choices within walking distance. overall disappointing. 
24478 Stayed @ Renaissance and absolutely loved it! The cocktail bar has the best view and the location of the hotel is fab The food isnt good but everything else is! 
24479 We stayed at Herald Square Hotel last September (8 nights). That was our second time in New York City. First time we stayed at Herald Square Hotel, too. What to say - excellent! We'll be back! 
24480 Friendly staff,great location,lobby in need of a reno.,room was ok,nothing special,probably a three star hotel 
24481 This hotel is perfectly located a short walk from Times Square and subway stations. The staff was very friendly as well. Overall great stay. Lots of great pubs and restaurants within a short walk as well. 
24482 Ottima posizione nel cuore di NY, personale gentile e disponibile, ottima colazione, molto pulito e silenzioso. Da raccomandare. 
24483 Location is good. Room reminds me of a college dormitory. Repairs to the marble in the shower didn't match. Plus the Tv didn't work. Although the guy made a good effort to fix it, still not TV. Overall, a big yawn. 
24484 Had really good rooms on a top floor, the rooms were spacious which is a luxury in NYC. It is located right on time squareand is easy access to everything, the staff are nice, the rooms are clean and the service is excellent. wierd looking statues in the reception though........!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
24485 hotel a quattro passi da Central Park e da Time Square non male 
24486 Helpful and nice staff, clean, contemporary... Good service, needs breakfast buffet. Electrical cabinet is still roaring as stated in other previous reviews. 
24487 Rooms are small but clean. Staff is not very friendly especially the management. Breakfast is very basic. But for the price it is all worth it. The location is amazing and their prices cannot be beat for downtown NY 
24488 We stayed here during christmas time, and loved it! The rooms are pretty small but it's easy to make do with what you have. The Location was the best part about it, being close to anything you want. Although I loved this hotel, I do prefer to stay uptown. 
24489 Best location between Times Square and Central Park. Nice, old but cleane Hotel with a lot of good atmosphere. 
24490 Super location right underneath the ESB, near Macy's the Garden and Penn Station. Great value for money, clean rooms, comfortable beds, nice bathroom. Staff nice. Breakfast is buffet style and sets you up for the day. Highly recommended. 
24491 Stayed here for 2 nights & everything was excellent. Staff was friendly. Stayed in a suite That was beautiful. Will never stay anywhere else whenever we are visiting NYC. 
24492 Good in all items: comfort, cleanliness, service, gentle staff, wonderful beds and pillows, practical kitchen, 1st class bathroom. In only do not give a 10 because the wifi is not free (considering the high rate of the hotel). 
24493 I order borsht, or matzo brie, or potato pancakes, or kasha varnishkas. I go straight to heaven. Yum! Plentiful and inexpensive. The servers are very friendly and welcoming. 
24494 I stayed there last week on business. Once again, the Mandarin surpassed my expectations. I had a great room overseeing Central Park. The only negative comment I have is that the ironing board and its cover could be replaced. 
24495 The hotel is really nice as regards facilities. Rooms are very well appointed, the small pool on the top floor is a plus, the bikes available for clients very cool and the restaurants of a good quality; too bad the service verges more on the carless kind of attitude. 
24496 Stayed here for two nights. Very reasonably priced. Close to great food. Subway is close by and easy access to downtown. Rooms are small but very clean and well kept. Staff was very friendly and attentive. 
24497 Checked in to this hotel after having stayed in Drury Inn San Antonio,lovely hotel fantastic rooms and very helpful staff,the free drinks and 5.30pm kickback is great,check it out you will love it. Great shopping mall's near by 
24498 I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria dozens of times over the last year and always had a pleasent experience. The food is good, the staff is very helpful and the location is perfect. 
24499 I stayed this hotel to take pictures of Manhattan. My goal was perfectly achieved. I was assigned the very top room(Manhattan side) The view from my room was beyond my imagination. Gorgeous! This hotel is kind of expensive but is worth the price. 
24500 Fantastic Hotel. Stunning grandure but not snobby. Very helpful staff. Rooms very well kept and cleaned everyday. Brilliant central location. Reasonable prices for a Manhattan hotel. I would recommend this place to anyone and will definately return asap! 
24501 Absolutely stunning hotel. We arrived late at night and were upgraded. We have very much been spoilt and nothing I fear will live up to this hotel with my children again ! Will certainly stay here again on our next visit to NY. 
24502 My girlfriend and I stayed at Ink48 and attended a concert in NYC in March 2011. The hotel staff was friendly and attentive, bringing extra towels and coffee when requested. The hotel had a hip, young atmosphere. We felt like VIPs without the CEO pricetag. 
24503 Love this hotel. Stayed there with my husband during our first trip to NY. I love how it was within walking distance to everything, but yet it was quiet and seemed off the beaten path. We will definitely stay there during our next trip. 
24504 From the stylish lobby to the elevator lobbies (with shoe shine machines--free of charge!) to the rooms, I really enjoyed my stay here. Quiet (you would have no idea you were just blocks from Times Sq.) and clean rooms appeared recently renovated. Nice bathrooms. Clean and well-lit halls. Friendly staff. 
24505 Just got back from houston last night from a wonderful weekend in Houston. The staff at the Hyatt was the best. Anything you needed they made it happen. The hotel is very nice. Has everything you would need. Great location, food, and very comfortable bedding. 
24506 Loved my stay at the Intercontinental Chicago: The room in the historic tower was wonderful, the history of the building is intriguing, and the location is hard to beat. What really stood out was the customer service ... always smiling, always friendly, always helpful. Very impressed. 
24507 Sometimes a hotel has a high average review due to the volume of people stayng there and their average tourist tastes. This is the case with the Westin MI Ave. Very crowded tourist hotel with below average service and rooms. PARKING WAS $49 per day! 
24508 I live in New York City and was looking for a romantic, leisurely getaway from our home for one night and found it here. The room was immaculate and huge (thanks to an upgrade). The staff was very courteous and efficient. 
24509 Great service and friendliness from all the staff throughout the property: front desk, restaurant, room service, doorman, etc. Recently renovated, good location a few blocks from Grand Central station. Definitely stay here again. 
24510 Loved this hotel location brilliant bar over pricey but we were on a special trip, sheets and bed were gorgeous. Only down side was static shocks we kept getting ... Funny but made you wary of touching anything! 
24511 Not perfect, but nice for the price. Continental breakfast and wifi + a wired internet PC in the lobby is nice. Be ready to climb stairs. Very helpful staff. 
24512 Just got back from a 4 day stay and wanted to confirm that the reviews on this hotel were all great for a reason - the location is great, the hotel clean and quiet, the staff very helpful. Don't hesitate to book if you are looking. Thanks Hampton inn! 
24513 Clean, new, could be great. Stayed during "soft opening", no restaurant, no hotel info binder. Rooms were small, bathroom small, small vanity, but shower was excellent. Front desk personnel very friendly and helpful. Definitely not a 4 star yet. 
24514 Unico punto forte la posizione. Camere disponibili solo dalle 16 in poi. Fino alle 16 non si possono usare neanche i bagni dell'albergo. Nella nostra stanza trovato per terra calzino usato di un precedente utilizzatore. Poco cordiali. 
24515 Very overrated hotel. Staff were USELESS, rude and so dumb! Doormen were great. Location was the only good thing, rooms we're very rundown (wallpaper falling off, ripped bed sheets etc) we had to move rooms coz of the idiots that work there and both rooms were overdue for a makeover. 
24516 Overall a clean and quiet space in the middle of the hectic city. I had a problem with my room and Glenda, a front desk representative, went out of her way to find me a room that met my expectations. 
24517 great location, friendly staff has its own diner so great to start the day without leaving the hotel for breakfast. Taxis and buses are cheaper than here, the Americans are very friendly. I fell in love with New York 
24518 the hotel is perfectly located to enjoy a holiday in New York. the service is accurate and the rooms are comfortable and clean. I recommend everyone to stay in this beautiful hotel 
24519 I love this hotel, with one draw back... no valet parking. The location is awesome, there is so much to do in the area, nightclubs, shopping etc. 
24520 This place charges you with hidden fees. We were charged for parking at the hotel we paid to stay at. We left and came back and they tried to charge us to park again. Check your bill is all I have to say. 
24521 I brooked a room in this hotel not knowing what to really expect. Now I can say just AWESOME ....The staff was great...the whole place was just electric...I would stay here again and again. It made my trip a pleasure having a great place to stay. 
24522 We stayed there 3 nights while on a tour of New York. Great place. No complaints. Be sure to visit "The View". 
24523 Oh my God. Great location! Great Staff! Comfortable rooms! Any of your needs met IMMEDIATELY! The hotel is beautiful! To the Benjamin Hotel New York....see you in 2010! I can't wait! 
24524 This was our first time at the London. Great location with a large, modern, clean and extremely quiet room... possibly the quietest room I've experienced. 
24525 The elevator and rooms are very old. You dont wanna spend the money for 4 star hotel here. I feel it feels worth than Holiday Inn. 
24526 Great Loaction and helpful staff after initial snag of not finding my reservation due to mix up with BA. Excellent rooms to make up for the blip though. Perfect for shopping and base for sight seeing no taxi more than $12 to be fair perfect. 
24527 I stay at the Dream regular on business. The penthouse night club is amazing and Marble Lane serves a great rib eye. Plus located in the Meat Packing District where other great clubs are. I highly recommend the Dream 
24528 Very Friendly and helpful staff. Check-in was quick and easy I really appreciated the shuttle service to the malls..Tony was very sweet and always so helpful! Hotel was clean and breakfast was great! I would definitely stay there again! 
24529 The Paramount is a terrific boutique hotel. The staff is what really makes all the difference and sets it apart. From the front desk, to the bar/restaurant, to NYC's friendliest doorman, Brian, you feel welcome and "at home" upon arrival. 
24530 Este hotel tiene todo, es muy comodo tiene unas vistas increibles , esta cerca de todo 
24531 I was most impressed by "Damans" at the main check in and check out area.. A perfect "10"... 
24532 the staff at carefree inn made our stay feel like home... our rooms were clean an the service was great..we will be staying at carefree inn the next time we are in houston 
24533 We stayed at the St Regis for a short break over my son's eleventh birthday. The hotel is both elegant and relaxed and the room was spacious and comfortable. Service is very pleasant and helpful. We had a really great time 
24534 Good location and clean. Staff typical for NYC (rude and in love with themselves). Good deal, but no way is this a 3 1/2 star hotel... time for Priceline to reconsider. 
24535 Dieses Hotel ist sehr gut gelegen in der Naehe des Grand Central Terminal und des Crysler Buildings und bietet eine atemberaubende Aussicht ueber New York! Das Personal ist sehr freundlich und aufmerksam, leider sind die Zimmer schon etwas abgewohnt. Dafuer ist allerdings der Preis angemessen und absolut akzeptabel fuer Manhattan! 
24536 Fabulous location and great atmosphere for a lovelly boutique hotel in Times Square No noise in the bedrooms. Nice breakfast included in the price and a glass of wine and cheese early afternoon to finish off a good day shopping. You don't get that included in the price anywhere else. 
24537 CTA pass is a must. Definitely accomodate ample time to get to places, but it makes it super easy. Know where you're going and how you're getting there before you embark for the day, hotel is in a nice quiet part of the immediate downtown. 
24538 Vicky Martin was a wonderful host from day one to day three. I truly believe she cared about me, my time, and my needs. Thank you for great service. I had a wonderful stay, and I look forward to returning to Crowne Plaza again soon. 
24539 I enjoyed my stay at this hotel. Spaceous rooms. Convenient location connected to the Galleria. Clean place. The only negative is the dated fitness room. Cheerful staff. Comfortable beds. Could have used a mini bar perhaps. Liked the free water. 
24540 Awesome Hotel, Pool, Outdoor Lounge, and Workout Facility! 
24541 Nice hotel with small rooms that have everything we needed (including a microwave and refrig). Make sure you ask for a room with a private bathroom. If you want a quiet room, please specify that too. The staff was so helpful, we really felt at home. 
24542 Excellent experience. Great location, close to everything. Staff and hotel extremely accommodating. Clean rooms, nice ammenities, Can't wait to return! 
24543 The W Times Square never fails me. Great hotel, great staff, great location. I look forward to my next stay! 
24544 Ottima posizione in Manhattan, vicino ad attrazioni turistiche e ad una delle pricipali stazioni della metropolitana; camera spartana e piccola ma pulita; sistemazione tutto sommato buona e sufficientemente confortevole. 
24545 Our room was huge and the hotel was well localized 
24546 Great location and close to most broadway shows. Robert and Vicky went out of thier way to make my stay very enjoyable..They acted in a professional manner at all times! I will make Crowne Plaza the hotel I stay at the next time im in New York. 
24547 Excellent location on Michigan Av. The room was clean, had a very comfortable bed and was quiet and all of those are important. However, compared to similiar priced hotels, the room was dull and lacked some small luxuries. I also found the restaurant slightly expensive for what was served. 
24548 Again, what a great hotel! We had stayed here during our wedding and loved it so much, we came back for our first anniversary. The city view is fantastic and everything is right outside the front door of the hotel! 
24549 Moved here from other W hotel. Very nice hotel gear location. Rooms are a bit dark and could be cleaner. Great bar at top. Great restaurant and pool. Nightmare checking in- but I guess it was busy. Make sure you close curtains as condos across road look right in 
24550 Excellent location! This place is interesting and fun, with the Marquis Theater right downstairs playing Evita while we were there! The elevator system is very efficient for such a huge hotel. Also, our room was a good size and very comfortable. Would definitely stay there again. 
24551 Didn't like paying $30 for a refrigerator. would have liked a parking discount. Used the same lot that the hotel uses for valet parking. Would have liked a bar open later in the evening. 
24552 I stayed at the public for work in December and knew I would be back. They did not disappoint. Amazing restaurant and space. Great price and value. The bar has a great vibe with a good crowd and mix of folks. I would highly rommend it 
24553 I thought this hotel was better than many Hampton Inns (and I have stayed in a lot). I like Hampton as a rule, as it is dependable, clean and comfortable and at a good price. This one met and exceeded my usual expectations. 
24554 My husband and I celebrated our anniversary in the city and the location was great! close to michigan ave shopping. the rooms were spotless and the amenities were fabulous. It also had one of the most comfortable beds i have ever slept in!! A+ stay. 
24555 Stayed here with my daughter for a "girls weekend", and we thoroughly enjoyed the Cassa. The staff was professional, friendly and accommodating. The rooms were large by NYC standards, clean, and very comfortable and the location is excellent. I would definitely stay here again. 
24556 Very central to stores and times square. Some great (cheap) restaraunts and breakfast locations all within five minutes walk of the hotel. Very comfortable room and great service from the staff. Only minus was the keyboards (3) at the public pc area. All the keyboards were badly worn. 
24557 Whilst an older motel, the location, price and free parking made this a good value stay in Chicago. Within walking distance to many places downtown. Room was clean and adequate. Would stay again. The front counter people were pleasant and helpful. 
24558 Stayed here for a couple of days. Hotel is close to Times Square. It is a little to the side, and not in the nicest neighborhood, but the hotel is new and very nice. Close to restaurants and the subway. I would definitely return. 
24559 Stayed here for 5 nights while touring NYC with my daughter. The staff were friendly & helpful. The conceirge was very knowledgeable. Breakfast was very busy but food was great. Great location. Only a very short walk to Times Square, Subway, Hudson River. 
24560 Outstanding stay again in one of NY'sbest kept secrets. The Andaz is a perfect location for work and play. The food is out of this world, great hidden bar downstairs in the cellar. The staff actually remembers your name, unheard of in NY. Can't wait to visit again 
24561 we just left mondrian soho new york after a great week, the staff were so helpful and friendly, the room was really nice too and the location excellent 
24562 nettes Hotel, zentral gelegen,Einkaufsmeile, Broadway, Central Park, nahe an Subway, Zimmer klein aber O.K., kein kleiderschrank,schwierig Bekleidung aus dem Koffer unterzubringen. sehr freundliches Personal. 
24563 really cool hotel in the heart of meat packing - lovely rooms, bar, pool, gym, restaurant and staff. Natalie at the concierge desk was particularly helpful - arranging nicks tickets, great restaurants etc 
24564 I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! The staff are very friendly, the rooms are very clean, it is a place the I personal enjoy to stay there Thank you!!!! 
24565 Very good quality/cost ratio. Some guests are noisy, but this is not total responsibility of the Hotel. The bathrooms are typically free: this is not absolutely a problem. Ideal accommodation for a few days of stay. 
24566 Stayed at this hotel on October 21st. The staff was wonderful and very helpful. They made some great recommendations for dinner and breakfast. I would stay there again. 
24567 Happy to have gotten lucky with this hotel. The staff were very helpful and the hotel was chic without being pretentious. Good value for the money and located in a fun neighborhood. Nice rooftop lounge as well. 
24568 stayed over the thanksgiving weekend. Hotel was extremely clean and in a fantastic location. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Would stay here again. 
24569 This hotel was perfect fro our trip. Centrally located. Clean. Relaxing lobby area. Rooms were small but perfect for what we wanted, Doormen were really helpful and friendly. The hotel bar was good fun and service was good. 
24570 Although the rooms in this hotel are rather small, the main reason for remembering The Paramount is the friendliness of the staff. You almost feel like coming home. The trendy lobby with it's pop music gives a grea feeling as well. 
24571 The entire staff was the BEST. There was no request, no large or too small, that could not have been handled efficiently and cheerfully by this staff. Was this just another Hampton Inn? No, because the personal level of attention was phenomenal for a hotel in this price category. 
24572 A lovely old fashioned hotel with modern facilities. Our room was spacious and extremely comfortable. Very convenient for all the sights, especially shopping. Only continental breakfast offered but superb restaurants nearby. We will be back!! 
24573 Las habitaciones son antiguas, almohadas duras, desayuno mediocre y un desastroso servicio en el front desk. Lo unico bueno de este hotel es su ubicacion, pero no vale la pena, hay muchos hotel bien ubicados de mejor calidad. No se me ocurria regresar a este hotel. 
24574 We stayed here for a wedding. Despite the reduced wedding rate, the price was high and service average. The location, near Penn Station, is excellent. The restaurant breakfast is poor, however. The room was large and had a kitchen. 
24575 Relatively quiet, clean with a pleasant and helpful staff. Great location for upper west side and great prices within 48 hours of stay. 
24576 Very nice for business trip to the Chicago convention center. Easy access to public transit 
24577 This was our 4th time to stay at the Affinia 50 and we are still raving about it. The beds are so comfortable, the staff friendly. helpful and knowledgeable. I cannot find anything to be critical about. We are already looking forward to our return. 
24578 A beautiful hotel with great service! This was our 4th or 5th stay at the Michelangelo 
24579 Ben met een vriendin 5 dagen naar New York geweest. Veel shoppen, weinig cultuur. Zeer tevreden over het hotel. Nette kamer, goede ligging. Precies tussen Central Park en Time Square in, 5th ave op paar minuten lopen. Zeer goede prijs/kwaliteit verhouding. 
24580 It was within walking distance to all the major tourist attractions. A bit disapointed with the view over Central Park though, the pictures on the website are better then we got. But a nice hotel, with friendly staff :) 
24581 very clean, professional staff...good location too...rooms and amenities where good for the price given 
24582 Lives this hotel and extremely comfortable for the business traveller Great bartenders downstairs and a very welcoming front desk staff Will definitely be back! Definitely a must stay if you don't need to be in downtown houston 
24583 We stayed here overnight between flights. Very good value. Staff was very friendly. If you are a Priority Club Premier member, they give you a full breakfast in the restaurant. Airport Shuttle in the morning was crowded. 
24584 Stayed there many times, consistently good, was given room upgrade without requesting. 
24585 Very clean and modern looking. Last minute business trip and the staff was so helpful with planning site seeing and mapping my paths. Small room, but perfect for business travel. Stored my luggage safely all day and let me in drop off more stuff to add. Extremely reasonable rate. 
24586 Good value and location. Our room off the street was very quiet. Helpful staff. Room was spacious but the bathroom was very small. Would stay here again. 
24587 We had the most wonderful time at The Barclay! The hotel staff, both at Reception, Restaurant and Concierge were very helpful and friendly. The hotel has a great location, centrally located to everywhere you may want to go in NYC. We met Stanley Tucci! 
24588 The rooms are small but clean. There was some problem with the internet wifi when I was there, so I hardly used it. 
24589 The hotel is in an excellent location ... staff was very accomodating. Rooms were very clean, and even though it is a butique hotel, it has all the amenities of the big boys. Tom at the front desk really took care of us! 
24590 I attended a conference being held at the Hilton for three days, and I enjoyed my stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. The shuttle service was a welcome bonus, and the property and rooms were clean. 
24591 couldnt fault this hotel,service from all staff was top ,room we had was out of this world,open curtains and we looked right on to chrysler building and empire state building,was very easy to get to .would highly recomened a stay here..will def stay here next visit 
24592 The hotel was clean, the front desk was gracious and I could see the empire state bldg from my window. Yes, rooms on the small side, but you're sleeping! Will be staying here in future 
24593 We arrived on New Years Eve and all we can say is that the service was excellant right up until we left. Perfect location and would book again here without a doubt. 
24594 good hotel if your on a budget , very great service at the front desk. Old hotel with some renovation but clean. ac was very noisy and the shower was changing from hot and cold water 
24595 Good location, next to the subway station. 
24596 Lo hacen sentir a uno en casa, todo el personal es muy atento. Sencillo pero muy agradable 
24597 A very good hotel in a terrific location and great for getting out amongst everything. Helpful staff although a few more computers in the lobby would be helpful - the 3 that are there are always occupied. 
24598 Ate dinner at concierge level tonight...wow! Excellent food and great, friendly service. Ed, the chef, does a wonderful job. 
24599 Had to stay here because my flight was cancelled from Houston. Good hotel with large rooms. Free WiFi and good burgers 
24600 Great hotel close to subway stations, restaurants and Empire state building. Small rooms but clean and comfortable (amazing bed!). You don't hear anything from the next rooms or even outside. restaurant in lobby but also great breakfast places (malibu diner) close by. 
24601 I had a blast celebrating my 30th trip around the sun in downtown Chicago. I had a sweet room with an amazing view over the river. Great location, and a very helpful staff. 
24602 This hotel is really close to all attactions. It might be a little pricey but well worth the money. 
24603 My wife always wanted to stay in Waldorf Astoria. It lived it's expectations!! marvelous place!! we will be back! 
24604 Es un hotel normal, perfecto para gente que quiera quedarse en el centro y usa el hotel solo para dormir. Tiene cerca estaciones de metro, y se puede ir a muchos sitios andando desde el hotel. Ademas esta recien reformado y la relacion calidad/precio es muy buena! 
24605 not to impressed by this hotel. the room was much smaller than i expected and the comforter had a bad smell to it. The evening reception and breakfast was great although i hope they will start offering flavored cream for coffee. I wouldnt choose to stay here again. 
24606 Stayed here last summer - good sized room with amazing view, okay location (10 mins to central station), dinner excellent, swimming pool lovely surprise. conceirge helpful, snifffer dogs interesting! Got bumped up to superior room which was a nice surprise. Would stay here again. 
24607 Can't think of anything bad to say, location, room condition, service, restaurant all exceeded our expectations. Front desk staff always greeted us when walking through the lobby, you don't see that a lot with your average Hilton Garden Inn. 
24608 Special thanks to Melisa at the front desk. She was very courteous and helpful, always had a smile for us. Will definitely go back to this Hotel because of location, but overall because of the service we got at our stay. 
24609 Blocks from Ground Zero, Good Breakfast at Roy's, and I need to say this: ORDER the Hash Browns, they're delicious, we went there on 2009 and it's a great marriott hotel, big corner suites, nice lobby and it's near trinity church and Rector St. Subway 
24610 We needed a get away... New York City for the weekend. I couldn't imagine staying anywhere else. Clean and contemporary. Two blocks or so from a horse drawn carriage ride through Central Park, a short walk to Times Square and Fifth Avenue shopping. 
24611 We have always stayed in big hotels with great reputation but we decided to take a chance with this boutique hotel. We are definitely hooked on this hotel. We cannot think of anything we would change and look forward to staying at these type of hotels in the future. 
24612 Big and bold ! Great room with a lovely view of central park. Nice to have a kitchenette which is useful for drinks etc. Big floor to celing windows, huge bed, very nice furnishings, polite staff always ready to help. 
24613 Stayed here for two nights after a long haul trip. We were immediately upgraded to a suite. We have nothing but praise for the quality, location and service of this hotel.. 
24614 A haven of calm just yards from Times Square & 2 blocks from Grand Central. The room was lovely and the whole place seems to exude an 'old world' charm. Very friendly and accomodating staff. We'll definitely be back when we're next in New York. 
24615 Right at the heart of the action 
24616 Suites are excellent 
24617 We had a double aspect with views over both ends of Times Sq. Next door to Subway. Plenty of shops and restaurants near by - recommend Edison Cafe for breakfast and Virgil's for dinner ( BBQ ) ...massive portions ! 
24618 this was great value and great area to see nyc from 
24619 Room was very comfortable but dated. Staff was exemplary! Overall a very good stay in a great midtown location. Easy walk to Rockefeller Center, Central Park, the shops on 5th, and the Theatre district. Metro station a few blocks away. Recommend! 
24620 Took a trip there with some friends had a blast the rooms were pretty clean and house keeping was very thoughtful. although we had a problem with the water leaking from the shower hot/cold knob. we all had a great time and would stay there again 
24621 This was a great hotel for the price - staff were very attentive, room was clean and as advertised - location was PERFECT, directly above the Wall Street station - an Express stop on the red line, and one block from an Express stop on the green line. 
24622 Exquisite room and first class service. the staff are very hospitable and polite. love the market on the ground floor-very convenient. Excellent location to all the great tourist attractions. Highly recommended and will surely stay there next time. 
24623 the breakfast was exceptional and reasonably priced. they offer you an amusingly wide variety of pillows, and the quality of everything was top shelf 
24624 Had a great 4 night stay in this hotel... rooms were a little on the small side... hotel clean and tidy.....located just above times square.... centrally located for all sights in New York..... would stay here again. 
24625 Superb hotel. Lovely public areas and small but smart rooms. Great staff who go out of their way to help. Wine reception a lovely touch. Perfectly located in mid town to get anywhere else in manhattan easily. Highly recommend. Only downside is the overly soft bed! 
24626 I would not recommend ANYTHING about this hotel and hope that Marriott reconsiders having the Marriott name on it. Food was terrible; staff not particularly responsive; frumpy and dated. Drive the extra miles and stay in one of the other NICE Marriotts in Houston. 
24627 Great experience at 70 Park Ave. I've stayed here on several occasions and have never been disappointed. The staff are friendly and attentive. My only complaint is that the rooms feel a bit cramped- that aside I would definitely recommend staying here. 
24628 Very cool hotel in primo location. Good value for money and staff very helpful. Can't fault the room at all: big comfy bed though street noise a bit intrusive, but then...this is NYC! 
24629 Lots of NYC hotels have tiny rooms. Not this one! Plush, excellent service, nice gym. Good Midtown location. Not cheap, but we got a very competitive deal. 
24630 Attentive staff to guide you through your stay whether new to NYC or returning guest. Personal touches in terms of housekeeping ensuring you didn't go without any toiletries. Commited to ensuring your stay is memorable and will go above and beyond to deliver. 
24631 A very nice place with everything you need in a city like NYC. A quiet place, cozy with nice bed and a good breakfast. Very comfortable indeed I really recomend the hotel! 
24632 Door man was very friendly and very helpful. Lobby was very small as we're the elevators. Rooms were excellent. Bed was very comfortable and the hotel is very centrally located to everything. Excellent stay. Would definitely stay again. 
24633 It's a nice and clean hotel close to everything. Will definitely return when next time we visit NYC again! Highly recommended! 
24634 I emailed hotel mgmt prior to my stay and never got a response. I asked for towels to be sent to my room and four hours later they had Not arrived. Most importantly, my WAKEUP CALL never came and I missed my morning meeting. Unacceptable. 
24635 I have to say the Yotel far exceeded my expectations. I expected cramped quarters, the rooms are by design, small, yet so well layed out that it feels much larger. The amentieis are awesome, staff was busy yet friendly. I've found a new home in New York City. 
24636 We like staying at the Wyndham at this location. This stay ouroom was very tight, so we will be more careful in the future. 
24637 What is there to say? Very Very attentive staff, great location, great linens, spotless rooms... it goes on and on... the NYC Palace was a fantastic hotel pick and I doubt I will ever stay anywhere else on my return visits to NYC! Don't hesitate! 
24638 staff very nice.have stayed there 4 times since last year. prices are a bit high but they always welcome me and my girlfriend. 
24639 Booked connecting rooms for us and family. Staff was great, very helpful and cheery. The room was clean and quiet even though the hotel was sold out for the weekend. The location can't be beat for being so close to everything you want to see and do for Christmas season. 
24640 Pres de Times Square. Chambre pas tres spacieuse mais tres tres propre. Bon prix pour une chambre a Times Square. 
24641 Have just spent an amazing 2 weeks staying at this hotel. the staff couldnt do enough for us. The hotel is spotlessly clean and tidy. Beautifully decorated. We will deffinately stay at this hotel again when we next visit chicago. We could not find one negative thing about this hotel. 
24642 Room was dirty and outdated....ended up getting charged extra when we got there to accidate myself..husband and son (did not say anything when we booked that we would need to)...service horrible..difficult to find someone at the front desk. 
24643 Would love to come again! It was amazing and great staff. 
24644 Great hotel! we stayed for a week starting june 6th. Helpful staff, rooms clean and very spacious. Very central to everything in New York. I hope to get back to stay there again. 
24645 Attended a wedding dinner with several relatives. The suites are perfect for 3 +, clean and nice bed linens; bathrooms a bit tired. All in all great value and location. 
24646 Dirty rooms, bug and blood smeared on the sheets. The only positive thing is the location. 
24647 About half a block away from all the rush, but close enough to Grand Central to still be very convenient. Quiet, safe and convenient. Was a good price, too. 
24648 I stayed there on a trip from DC and it was a great hotel! Pricey but what can one expect in NY 
24649 All employees are really friendly. Front desk gave alot of help. Great location in NYC. The room is very clean. Love the bed....... 
24650 Boa localizacao, proximo a Times square e a uma das principais estacoes de metro - Penn Station. Bom cafe da manha e otima cordialidade dos staffs do hotel. Ficaria novamente em uma nova oportunidade. 
24651 REALMENTE ESTUVIMOS MUY AGUSTO,SE CUMPLIERON TODAS NUESTRAS EXPECTATIVAS. LAS UBICACION ES PERFECTA,EL METRO ESTA SALIENDO DEL HOTEL, ENFRENTE ESTA UN RESTAURANTE DELICIOSO Y CON EXCELENTE ATENCION, HAY MUCHISIMOS RESTAURANTES TIPO DHELI AL REDEDOR Y ABIERTOS 24 HRS REGRESO SIN PENSARLO 
24652 Decided on a last minute trip to NYC. Found Candlewood thru Trip Advisor. great experience great location. Room was beautiful with a unbelievable view. The young lady at the front desk on weekends was such a great help. She gave us several helpful recommendations. Valet parking also worked out great. 
24653 We have stayed there four times and love it! a bottle of champagne was delivered to our room when we arrived as a welcome back gesture. Staff so friendly. Will be back 
24654 The hotel is in a great location but its room was so nasty. So understaffed and they simply don't really care about your needs. Please find some other hotels nearby!!! 
24655 This hotel is not fancy but it was clean, had a deli attached to it, and was located a block off of Times Square. It was an easy walk to shopping, tour busses, and the theatre. 
24656 We greatly enjoyed our stay here. The rate was only $89 for a Saturday night. It is a new building and was clean and comfortable. The free breakfast was pretty good and had fresh fruit and waffles. The drive to the car rental return building was straightforward and close. 
24657 Nice central location close to times square and a lovely foyer but thats where it ends. Rooms are very old and need updating. They are clean but this hotel lacks amenities that you would find in many other hotels.The staff are rude to say the least. 
24658 Loved! this hotel. It is reasonably priced. Has lovely kitchenettes. Is across from a grocery store with everything you could possibly want -- 3 floors worth. And is in a nice part of town. Easy access to subway. Quiet. 
24659 Nice Hotel, nice Lobby, nice bed, nice ..... everything 
24660 Without a doubt the friendliest hotel in the area. The staff was knowledgeable and courteous - very willing to make us feel at home. From the front desk to housekeeping, we received good service with a smile. 
24661 Needs big time renovation. Very disappointing stay at Grand Club room. Smelly rooms, tiny bath rooms, outdated lounge set up. Said renovations are coming next year. Can't come soon enough. Should've stayed at the Starwoods. 
24662 Great location. One block from subway and nearby Lexington ave for dinning and drinks. All who works there pleasant and helpful. Good size room and up to date. Whole bldg clean. We will go back, thanks guys. Mike & Alina McCann 
24663 We waited 80 minutes in the check in line. Nobody cared. They didn't have enough staff, and didn't even have an efficient process. The hallways were poorly lit and depressing to the point it was actually intimidating. Functional room but nothing good about it. Don't stay here! 
24664 Very spacious, clean rooms. Great staff! Good breakfast. Wonderful location! 
24665 Nice spacious room, including microwave oven..... A great base to explore New York. Very laid back and staff always friendly and cheerful. Would happily stay here again. 
24666 My experiences at the Parker have always been good. It's not over done it's not under done, it's just right. If you need a good spot for Christmas shopping or theaters this is it. There are several excellent restaurants nearby and the hotels own lobby watering spot is a treat. 
24667 fantastic location, in the heart of manhattan with everything you need around you & more. very comfortable, clean, tidy & all staff were very helpful at all times, would definately go back again. 
24668 Overall very good hotel. Rooms are small but adequate. 
24669 I would like to acknowledge the support we received from all the hotel staff. All were friendly and efficient. The reception is very good, the hotel is very good and well located. When I return to NY, I'll be there again 
24670 L' Hotel mi ha soddisfatto, molto pulito, camere abbastanza spaziose e metro vicinissimo. La vista dalla finestra della nostra camera era impagabile, avevamo di fronte l' Empire State completamente illuminato fino alla mezzanotte. 
24671 Gute Lage und zweckmaessige, relativ kleine, gut ausgestattete Zimmer. 
24672 Not the biggest rooms, but quite simply excellent service that made our visit so worthwhile. And they were superb with my 10 year old daughter as well. Thoroughly recommended. 
24673 Stayed at the W in Times square for the weekend. Room was so hot that I had to open the window in January. Thermostat did not work. Open winnow made the room very noisy in Times Square. Hair in bathroom, dirty desk area. Would choose another hotel next time. 
24674 Cheap, easy access to TSqaure & Bus tour. But watch out for the hidden dirt! 
24675 I stayed here with my husband in July. The service was great, rooms were spectacular, and location was great! I will definitely be back here again! I recommend this hotel to anyone who will be staying in Midtown. 
24676 We stayed here in the summer of 2012 and were very happy with the rooms. The rooms were roomy and the beds very comfortable. The service was excellent even though we were there at a very busy time. Very clean and comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. 
24677 Rooms are clean, big enough and well equipped. Location is good. Service is good except a small lost issue with the reception. In summary I would stay again. 
24678 the hotel rooms are spacious, but not so clean. and their buffet sucks! all they had were toast and cereal, and their drink was cheap orange juice like tampico or something. that's worst buffet i have ever seen! 
24679 wonderful view of NYC, nice spa services, extra friendly staffs, you really get what you pay for. 
24680 the service we recieved here was first class.the staff are friendly and helpful,the rooms were cleaned every day.having the kitchen saved us a fortune on breakfasts.the location was close to grand central station for underground trains anywhere in New York ,we will be back 
24681 Rooms are small and beds are very uncomfortable.. People are nice and beakfast was great.. 
24682 Very clean and well kept property. Good choice if you're looking for a place to stay on the East side of Houston. 
24683 Wow i had so much fun, there was some great staff at the desk. i think the girl's name was Naadie, so genuine,pretty smile, helped me with my printing, suggestions about restaurants and aloyt more. u all should check out this hotel. 
24684 Great location - around the corner from Time Square. Within walking distance of almost everything a tourist would want to see. 
24685 Stayed for 5 nites in a Deluxe Room with King Bed. Great location, wonderful to have breakfast and wine/snack in later afternoon. Staff were friendly, clean and warm environment. Wonderful location however can be noisy throughout the nite depending on activity on the street. John and the staff outstanding. 
24686 As always, the Westin is consistent. This is a great business hotel and very quiet and efficient. Only problem is the VERY slow elevator service so be prepared to leave 10 minutes ahead of time. 
24687 We got three rooms for a group traveling together. Quiet hotel, comfortable rooms, perfect location. We would not hesitate to stay here again. Great attached restaurant as well. 
24688 Stayed Sept.8th on the 8th floor in a Queen room. Clean, simple hotel with a small bar with food/room service. Knowledgeable doormen and so close to subway makes getting around the city easy. Only paid $209, so felt I got good value for midtown. 
24689 Stayed back in 1996. Our room was infested with cockroaches, i killed twenty two on the first and the last night. My advice is simple aviod this place at all costs. 
24690 Great location, nice modern and clean... So close to times square it's the perfect spot. Little bistro beside entrance is perfect spot for breakfast or dinner. Will stay here again for sure. Easy walk to Grand Central... 
24691 This hotel has always been first class with first class service...They go the extra steps to please their guests...nice area...and make my trip to new york SPECIAL... thank you Intercontinental Barclay staff 
24692 After trouble at the front desk initially, it also took three times to get my key working. The phone in the room was broken and worst of all, there was some old jerky on the floor! 
24693 i stayed here with my mum and friend it was a gr8 place staff was so helpful and friendly i would stay here time and time again it was cleaned everyday breakfast was gr8 keep up the good work people 
24694 We love this hotel; the rooms are clean and cozy, modern but not overdone. Its got a reasonable large, but quiet lobby, two elevator banks so you don't wait a long time, nice views and a great location. One of the best values in the Starwood chain in NYC 
24695 For a three night stay I paid 1050 usd. This included a grotty cell like room. No breakfast no internet A 30min queue just to check in Extremely Rude staff A dirty bathroom Seems this hotel thinks location alone is good anough NEVER AGAIN 
24696 Room was nice. We requested two beds and the room they first sent us to only had one, the did honor the request and give us a different room. It is farther from the subway than stated - 3 avenues and NYC avenues are much longer than a standard block. 
24697 Service war gut Zimmer war top inklusive Badezimmer Lage des Hotels war Klasse 5 Minuten zum Times Square 
24698 Just spent a weekend at the Plaza Athenee in New York and can't say a bad thing about the place. Our room was lovely and clean. The service was prompt and friendly. I would definitely stay there again! 
24699 definitely a good and clean hotel at an average price where everyone can stay during a trip to new york city. it is near the metro station, empire state building, times square so you don't have to worry about transportation. 
24700 This hotel is located in the flower district which is actually kind of fun- in a New York way. the rooms are bigger than many, AC works well. Clean and comfortable. Breakfast up to par for a "free: breakfast 
24701 I do not hesitate to recommend it. 
24702 My daughter and I stayed here for one week; everything was great from being met at curbside with help with our bags to our room upgrade. Location was excellent to everything and the coffee shop and gift shop attached were perfect. I will stay here again. 
24703 Excellent Hotel in close proximity of interesting sights and subway stations. Very friendly staff and clean rooms. Rooms are quite small (for the high price) so might be difficult for a long term stay. Located in a fairly quiet side street with nice restaurants around. 
24704 For the price, perfect; helpful staff, minimalist. Right above splash, easy transportation. Nice continental breakfast 
24705 Great stay in this hotel, even got an upgraded room cause it was my birthday! Good location but still a good walk from most things! Beds r great, and view from top floor was amazing! Would def go back! 
24706 I got an excellent deal for this place on Hotwire. No complaints at all. The walk to the subway is about 3 blocks away (Grand Central Station), and if you happen to get a room on the upper floors, the view is divine. 
24707 Albergo datato!! La posizione abbastanza centrale e' l'unica nota positiva di questo albergo......le camere hanno letti a una piazza e mezza per 2 persone il bagno e' veramente pessimo muffa ovunque e wc ......no comment!!!!! Per la fascia di prezzo si trova di meglio. 
24708 Everything was perfect. I have nothing but great memories of my stay. The view, the service, the bed, the bath, the food, the location. 
24709 Very close to milleniumpark and comunications. The hotel is old and the rooms are not renovated for a very long time.. But everything was clean and the frontdesk was good. A little expensive for the standard of rooms. 
24710 Hotel is good but not the value of money. there are many more Hotel in New york which are very cheap but offers the same facilities. Not recommended. 
24711 excellent hotel, the location of the hotel is great 
24712 Only thing I hated were the elevators are too small & take too long to get to your floor.....ugh.... Like that Times Square is right around the corner, plus there's a small dance/pub 4 doors down!!! 
24713 We used to stay here when the hotel first opened. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. The rooms were clean, but tired looking. Furniture has stains. Lobby had a strange gas smell. Restaurant was okay. 
24714 My boyfriend and I stayed here during fashion week and the US Open. It was a great stay. Extremely economical,clean, and hospitable. Great location,right near great shopping and the subway so you can get wherever you need to. 
24715 We enjoyed all the attractions that the location had to offer. We were just footsteps away from Millennium Park, Chicago Theater, and The Mag Mile. Our room was very spacious. We would definitely stay here again. 
24716 amazing location RIGHT in times square. the hotel had a NYC vibe to it, it was very dated, we had issues with the shower several times. Had a neat vibe to it but I would not stay again, it was rather loud throughout the night because of the location. 
24717 Brought two of my managers to NYC with me for a business trip. Stayed at the hotel 2 nights. Friendly staff with good restaurant recommendations. Location was close to subway. All three rooms were pleasant and the cost was very reasonable. Would stay here again. 
24718 I booked very late in the day around an OTC conference but the staff and hotel were very good at short notice and the value was excellent. 
24719 The Hilton, of course, was very comfortable. Plush bedding and towels, immaculately kept rooms. The only negative was the in room coffee - not a fan! But I just got back under the the comfy bed and got over it. :) 
24720 Staff is oustanding! Location is very close to Times Square. Rooms are clean but very small. I would stay again if rates were good. 
24721 Breakfast area was crowded, we stayed several nights and that was still the same every day. Variety of items could be a little bit better in this price range. But we had a pleasant stay, super location. 
24722 Excellent hotel, close to the Michali Fine Art Gallery. I came to buy art and found it walking distance to the gallery..made and excellent investment and had a delightful stay. 
24723 en general el hotel esta bien, pero deben hacerle arreglos a los aires acondicionados de las habitaciones, suenan mucho y no enfrian mucho deberian de poner wi fi gratis como en la mayoria de los lugares; el wi fi cuesta 14 $ el dia 
24724 Good quality and valve for money. The hot tub looked like it needed a little cleaning but overall good experience. Usual breakfast items, waffles lacked flavor. Room was clean and well maintained. The bed was very comfortable, slept well. 
24725 Alles waa top aan dit hotel, medewerkers vriendelijk en hulpzaam. Locatie Top en de kamers waren geweldig ruim,schoon en netjes. Als ik weer eens in New York ben zoek ik niet meer verder boek meteen Belleclaire!! 
24726 Me and a girlfriend had fab 5 nights location was walking distance from Times Sq, and only 3 blocks from Empire State building, it is an old building but location cantbe faulted 
24727 Nice clean hotel, good staff, No problems! 5 - 10 minutes walk to Times Square and Cenral park and 5 minutes to the Carnegie Deli! Great place to stay! 
24728 Front desk...not much Bell boys .....helpful Room......best attribute, large and well kept Bathroom"........small and I mean small Location.........great 
24729 I was in Chicago to attend a conference at the Millenium Park Hotel. This hotel was excellent. The suite, the breakfast and the evening reception were more than we expected as well as the fitness center and the pool. 
24730 Exceptional friendly service at this midtown hotel. Cosy, quiet clean room with very comfy bed, though tiny bathroom the only downside. 
24731 No frills place, with small, but clean rooms. They only have wireless in the rooms, so you'll need to go to the lobby if you don't have that. Unlimited free bottled water is nice. 
24732 We stayed here for 4 days in July. The staff was great, great location. very close to the subway. The room was spotless and for the price we paid could not be happier..Ane we got a free breakfast every morning. I wuold stay here again without any qualms. 
24733 Inn of Chicago was alright but it needs some fixing up.I came here on a business trip and I wish I had gone to a different hotel.I will not be going back. 
24734 Just checked in here. Stayed here last year when it was the Fashion 26 run by Wyndham. Wifi was free, now it is $14.95 per day???? in this day and age that is not only absurd it is plain greed. 
24735 This hotel is really beautiful!!.. The rooms are big enough and very comfortable!!.. Also the location is great... The service is excellent!.. And if you decide to have breakfast there it is delicious!!.. They bar is nice too in the night!!.. Definitely this hotel has 5 solid stars!! 
24736 Fantastic location by Rush Street. Great bar named The Whiskey in the lobby. Perfect place to stay if you are visiting Chicago to shop Michigan Ave or catch a game at Wrigley. 
24737 We loved it!!!! I was a little nervous after reading some if the reviews and seeing some of the pics, now I didn't get on my hands and knees and inspect every inch of the place..I had a city to see!!!! 
24738 Posizione ottima e ben collegata (a pochi passi da Columbus circle). Hotel accogliente, stile molto accattivante, pulito e prezzi piuttosto convenienti. Molto divertente anche per passarci una serata (aperitivo o disco). Unica pecca le dimensioni delle stanze, non grandissime. 
24739 What can one say this place is smack dab in the middle of TS...this was awesome and the staff was great...a must as it was out first time in NY and this was awesome.... 
24740 We enjoyed our stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The location was great! We would love to come back again! 
24741 Staff helpful when i was unhappy with initial room right across from elevator- got moved, but new room had no view so teenage son less happy! Had 5 nights here, Concierges very helpful, attached restaurant pricey, esp as our room rate didn't include breakfast. overall, would stay again. 
24742 wonderfull hotel !! Excellent location just off times square..... Very clean and very comfortable beds.... Rooms very modern in design and feel with famous signature heavenly beds and showers... Hotel is worthy of star rating.... Would deff stay here again. 
24743 Stayed here 2-6september. The price for manhattan was great. The room was small but very comfortable. The location close to penn station and subway was just what I needed. I found the staff very helpful and the 24 hr diner just the job. Can't think I'll stay anywhere else..... 
24744 Convenient to everything; staff was hospitable and responsive; room was right for a short stay by myself: comfortable bed, clean, quiet enough (not on the street side!). Equipment worked, supplies were adequate. 
24745 We stayed over Xmas / New Year - not a single complaint !! Great mid town hotel - makes the rest of manhattan easily accessible. 
24746 I just got back from staying one week at the mid-town comfort inn, great two star hotel rooms are nice and clean. Close by everything in New York. I will stay here again. Thanks to tripadvisor. 
24747 I was more then happy with my stay. I highly recommend this hotel. You guys got it right. Five stars all the way! Murray's bagel for breakfast, and an organic grocery store next door. Tons of awesome restos. Great things come in small packages! See you in the summer. 
24748 Perfect location for business... Very close to main companies, everything you need to relax after a working day. I had 1 dinner and 2 breakfast, service and food were good and waiters are very kind. My room was very well cleaned and maintained with attention to detail. 
24749 che dire ilo viaggio e stato e stato stupendo l'albergo ottimo al centro satvamo vicino la stazione centrale a due passi dA dutto l'america e stupenda a marzo ci ritorniamo ma stavolta andiamo in florida ad orlando 
24750 the hotel is very near all hospital facilities. Near Rice shopping centre. there is a shuttle bus i was surprised that the room don't have a locker for valuables... the service was friendly the breakfast good. the 19 room had a lovely view of Houston 
24751 Did not like it at all. I would not recommend this hotel, the pictures look better than the actual room. 
24752 I stayed here for business - about 10 days. The streets outside are very busy, but the hotel is large, nice and has a great pool/open green area within the building grounds. The food is great as well. 
24753 I don't get the negative reviews. Everything about this hotel was simply lovely. It is elegant, comfortable, well-located and super first class. Fabulous bathrooms. Comfortable beds. Clean. Attentive service, from the doormen to the housekeeping staff. Everything you need is already in the room. A terrifice experience all the way. 
24754 Well, the hotel was close to all the major attractions and streets. The service was poor, but the hotel was clean and convenient. 
24755 Great location. Friendly staff. Expensive restaurant. Rooms small and dark. Would not go back. Better hotels for same money. 
24756 Press is without the best Rooftop Bar with the Best View in New York City 
24757 Excellent location. Small new York style room. Friendly very helpful staff. No free wifi. :(. I would stay here again. Close to park great shopping theatre and in a neighborhood where real people live. Nice. Recommend. 
24758 My stay here was AWESOME! I loved staying here. I had never stayed here before and wasn't familiar with the surroundings, but I am glad i stayed here and no where else. The front desk clerk, Mie, really made me feel welcomed and was very helpful. I love her personality. 
24759 Hal en receptie zijn netjes en goed onderhouden. Dat geldt niet voor onze kamer die duidelijk wat achterstallig onderhoud kende (klemmende deuren, kapotte schakelaars). Hotel is sterk gericht op spaanstaligen wat wel weer een leuke sfeer geeft. Op slechts 1 blok van Empire state. 
24760 Good location. Clean rooms. Wonderful mattress.We took a cooking class at ICE and had a great night before. They kept luggage while we w at class. 
24761 Guided to this hotel by the high percentage of positive reports on TripAdvisor. I was not disappointed. Quality, comfort and attention to detail, No need to look further it is the Sofitel from now on. 
24762 sujo,,muito sujo,,,aparebcia medonha,,,nunca se hospede nesse hotel 
24763 Although the rooms are very small, this was the best hotel and hotel experience I've ever had. Rooms very clean, staff very friendly and helpful. Best rate and great location! The was an excellent place. Great location for work and then we spent the weekend and that was great too! 
24764 The Hotel was very comfortable... I only stayed for one night but what I did experience was very enjoyable... 
24765 Walking distance to Reliant for HLS&R 2012. Average property for Marriott, I am a Marriott rewards member and am used to much better accomodiations. 
24766 I specifically chose this hotel because of its "bug free" status! Although the property is small, the rooms are very clean and extremely comfortable. The young ladies at the front desk could not be more pleasant and helpful. I will return to this hotel. 
24767 The photos of the hotel look much better than the actual place itself. The rooms are very,very small. Location is quite good and only about 15-20mins walk to central park. I wouldn't go back to this hotel even as a last resort. 
24768 We stayed in a suite with two 6 month olds and three adults. The rooms were small, but very comfortable. The bathroom was huge! This location was convenient to restaurants and shopping. The babies loved the Hard Rock Cafe! I would stay here again. 
24769 Room was comfortable. Internet is wired only, a disadvantage for me. Restaurant was marginal and bar expensive and sparse. But the location is great for eating elsewhere. Value stay. 
24770 It's place is just cool. Acoustic guitar in every room. Great service, clean, and a great bar/restaurant scene in the lobby. Furniture was very nice and stylish. You definitely want a larger room, their junior rooms are pretty tiny. 
24771 Stayed here with friends for 2 nights. It's an old dingy hotel with mold in the shower. The only thing going for this hotel is the location. 
24772 Cracking views over the East River and its location a lttle away from the madding crowd but still with good transport links were the highlights. Forget the hotel breakfasts though, part of the fun was eating with the locals in nearby delis and diners. 
24773 Very convenient location, very friendly staff who kindly upgraded us to a bigger bed. Rooms larger than many NYC midtown hotels -- would absolutely stay there again. Some street noise at night , but well within normal range for midtown NYC. 
24774 Ottimo hotel per visitare NY, la mia camera era enorme con cucina attrezzata. 
24775 I had a nice clean and comfortable room. The service was wonderfull. Feeling like home, I definetly will return. 
24776 Great stay with good service. Located close to the airport with shuttle service back and forth. 
24777 Stay at the Westin Chicago River North was great. You have to stop by the fitness center to see Sam, great guy, knows his stuff. You'll get a great workout in. 
24778 Great location, wonderful rooms, fabulous service. 
24779 En principio ninguna sugerencia. El trato fue excelente. La comida fue buenisima. La situacion del hotel es perfecto, esta a 5 minutos andando del Time Square. 
24780 This hotel has a great price for New York City. It has a good location, aproximately 12 blocks from Times Square, and near the subway and Penn Station. It is clean and the staff is extremely friendly. 
24781 STRUTTURA FUNZIONALE E PULITA. PERSONALE GENTILE E DISPONIBILE. LA POSIZIONE E' STUPENDA: CENTRALISSIMA E A DUE PASSI DA 4 LINEE METRO. IN EFFETTI E' UN PO' CARO SE PARAGONATO AGLI STANDARD ITALIANI, MA PARAGONATO A QUELLI DI NY SI PUO' DEFINIRE QUANTOMENO EQUO. 
24782 We stayed at the Swissotel for a Chicago Family Weekend Getaway! The experience was AWESOME from the moment we pulled up until the moment we checked out. The kids loved the pool and the restaurants. Thank you Swissotel! 
24783 A great location and fantastic roof terrace were the highlights (many breakfasts and bottles of wine up there!) Rooms were small but clean and functional!! Good showers. 
24784 El hotel esta en una ubicacion perfecta, cerca de todo, los cuartos son grandes, en new york no siempre es asi, la atencion muy buena y las camas muy bien, super recomendable. No probe los restaurantes por lo que no puedo opinar sobre la comida. 
24785 Nice room, great service, location ideal. Felt like luxury as you would expect, room amd bathroom very nice, bottled water at bedtime. Shipped packages home for us. Very pleased. House car was useful and much improved oiver a cab 
24786 No esperaba tanto de un hotel de cadena Hampton Inn. En todos los aspectos quede positivamente impresionada. El aspecto y limpieza del hotel son extraordinarios. El desayuno buffet realmente es un buffet completo con alimentos frios y calientes. Espero volver muy pronto. 
24787 Great location but rooms are small and they have a smell that does not go away. Gym is small with minimal weights but adequate treadmills Over all it's a good stay when it is a bargain price 
24788 It is a gem. Clean, pleasant, very quiet and excellent location ! Enjoyed everything and highly recommend it. 
24789 i got the best treatment and cheap prise from chatheren at the frontdisk 
24790 This is a great hotel. Perfect location for tourists between 5th avenue and times square. reception staff were very helpful. rooms were small but modern and very clean. loved the molten brown toiletries.would definitely recommend this hotel to tourists 
24791 After flying back from Europe, we stayed at this hotel. We were beyond tired. Front desk was very nice, the bellman was a doll. The room was so comfy- the bed was sink right into and location couldnt of been anymore perfect! I would stay there again. 
24792 After a long haul flight and short drive along FM 1960 (thereby avoiding tolls) found this hotel a great place for a good nights sleep. Clean, quiet and a very friendly reception. 
24793 Stayed here for a weekend, great location! Hotel is a bit dated, but clean. Bathroom had been renovated recently so I expect the rest of the hotel will be upgraded. Would definitely stay here again. Hotel is close to a couple different subway lines. 
24794 nice location but room is not very good. the the price is still very high. if you have another choice, this one is not recommended 
24795 The Shelburne is an excellent hotel. Great self contained facilities. Close to Grand Central Station. 
24796 Very convenient to main hub of entertainment. Excellent staff with very clean rooms. Although quite small rooms it is my understanding this is typical NY city. Rooms confortable and staff gladly held all bags after checkout until we were ready to leave NY. 
24797 We had a wonderful weekend getaway in Manhattan. The staff was helpful and very attentive. We enjoyed the complimentary soft drinks during the day and wine in the evening. The room was very high tech with a beautiful bathroom. All in all a great weekend. 
24798 The staff at The Whitehall Hotel were very welcoming and extremely helpful in getting us settled into our rooms. We were able to enjoy Chicago immediately. Particular thanks to Jewel for the major role she played in welcoming us and for the terrific service she provided our party of eighteen. 
24799 I recently stayed at the Iroquois and couldn't have been more pleased. The service was great, the rooms were very nice and very clean. Location is great. The restaurant (Triomphe) was superb. I would HIGHLY recommend staying here for anyone visiting NY. 
24800 Prima Hotel 5 minuten lopen van Time Square. Bij volgende bezoek aan New York zou ik zo weer in dit Hotel boeken. Prima ontbijtgelegenheid onder in het hotel. Klein minpuntje, Het zwembad was nog niet open. 
24801 Stayed here for a business conference. Staff isn't very friendly. Rooms are clean but very small. Location is great! 
24802 cool clubowned and run by the brits in great location.hang out in the drawing room with like mind creatives.food excellent,service -on it and general atmos very friendly and made to feel at home.Check out the rooftop pool. No fat cat stuffy bankers in pinstripes allowed here! 
24803 I was in NYC on business and enjoyed my stay at the Sofitel immensely. The high speed internet and large comfortable room made my business a pleasure. One small criticism, a number of the apples in the fitness center were bruised. I had to pick carefully, but I survived. Alas! 
24804 Die Lage ist unschlagbar gut... in wenigen Minuten ist man direkt am Broadway und an der 5th Ave. Auch den Central Park kann man gut zu Fuss erreichen. Die Luft auf den Etagen und im Fahrstuhl war sehr drueckend. Die Zimmer waren sehr sauber. 
24805 Good location next door to the galleria mall. Old hotel that needs an urgent refurbishment and updating. Ok price. Mediocre breakfast. 
24806 On my first trip to NYC, 3 of us stayed at the Metro..we had a 2 bedroom suite, with a small kitchen area..it was great, clean, roomy and the staff was excellent...the location was centrally located. Bagels, rolls and coffee provided in the morning...would stay here again.. 
24807 Good location if you're doing business near the Galleria. The room layout wasn't that great, with the coffee pot in an awkward location. The service at the restaurant for breakfast was unacceptably slow. No wireless service in the rooms. I expected better. 
24808 A great W hotel in Chicago. Better than the Lakeshore Drive one. Rooms are new and fresh. Service was really good. Great concierge who was very helpful in finding restuarants and bookings. 
24809 As Bette Davis would say, "What a dump!" The Four Seasons hotel chain needs to either remove its name from this location or put some good money into renovations. Skip this hotel and stay elsewhere. Bad, bad, bad 
24810 Stayed at the Drake with my work colleagues and we had an excellent experience. We got upgraded to an executive suite 
24811 The service was excellent and we got an excellent deal via Expedia when booking. The location is perfect for shopping and lake shore drive. 
24812 Ho pagato per una camera cosiddetta DE LUXE per trovarmi una camera vecchia e fatiscente con vista su un bel muro ad un metro di distanza. Siccome non e' cosi' economico, meglio andare da un'altra parte!!! 
24813 New York at Christmas is THE best. The Warwick was a great base for work, shopping and meeting firends. The room was up to date and graciously comfortable. The staff were most courteous and genuinely helpful. 
24814 Good midtown location, very helpful staff. Clean, modern, but not austere room, very good bed, quiet. Will return here again. 
24815 stayed in june for a holiday in new york. hotel is situated at the end of manhatton by the ground zero overlooking the river. beautiful location. service was poor. in room dining menu was limited. food was average. would not stay for a second time. 
24816 Got a room at a very good price. The room was big and spacious and the location very good, at least for us as first timers in New York. Very comfortable beds and nice decor. The staff was helpful. 
24817 Have stayed here for Business and for Family weekend. Kids loved the pool and the ornate lobby. The location was perfect to see the sites near and around the loop including museum campus and millennium park. 
24818 Location was great. Helpful staff. They now are selling units as timeshares - got VERY sick of the "time share sharks" continually harassing us. Would go back IF I COULD GET A DEAL - for full price, it is not worth it. 
24819 When we arrived we were expecting the rooms may be quite small, but ours was very generous in size! Great amount of space, nice clean room and AMAZING location. Would highly recommend. 
24820 It was very good. I hadn't expected it to be so good. Both my friend and I are satisfied in the room. I think I'll definitely stay for my next trip if I go back to the area. We will definitely recommend the hotel to family and friends. 
24821 This is a great hotel, and the location is perfect, minutes away from Central Park and Times Square. The quality of the rooms and the restaurant are second to none. Very helpful staff, with nothing being to much trouble. Would love to stay here again! 
24822 Exellent hotel on Central Park South.,specially the famous Harry's Bar 
24823 Its so close to the fabulous stores of Fifth and Madison Avenues; near the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle and right across from Central Park, the location is absolutely super! 
24824 I think the subject says it all... It's cheap for a reason, but definitely not a bad spot. 
24825 Flight cancelled. Hilton had rooms for $389. Of course, no discounted rooms even for Hilton Honors. Would not honor airline discounr slips but had the higher price rooms available. Take a cab and save hig dollars 
24826 Three of us stayed in a studio with two double beds. The room was spacious with comfortable beds and a full kitchen. The hotel is in an excellent location, and we will definitely return. 
24827 Had the pleasure of staying at the Houstonian for a business meeting in September. The rooms are fabulously comfortable and the staff quite helpful and accomodating. Dinner at the Manor House was first rate. I highly recommend this property. 
24828 Enjoyable Motel in a good location near where I was working, fast food restarant nearby. shopping center across street 
24829 We stayed there over July 4th and had a great time. We didn't know where to see fireworks. The hotel had a bus that took us there! A special thanks to Renee for this. She was nice and made sure everyone was there to get back. 
24830 The check in was efficient and the room was larger than expected. Housekeeping was good. The hotel bar was closed and there was construction going on outside early Sunday morning but that"s NYC. I would return no problem. 
24831 We had a great stary at the Bedford form 4 nights. It's was clean, everything work the way it should, no bed bugs and its so close to so much ie: grand central station, empire state building, a pleasant walk to times square. Really looking forward to going back 
24832 Kleines, individuelles Hotel Naehe Grand Central Station, nett eingerichtete Zimmer, fuer New York sehr gross, Fenster lassen sich oeffnen (nicht selbstverstaendlich in New York), nettes hilfreiches Personal (Shuttle Service zum Flughafen moeglich), Crosstown Bus Linie 27 und Line 50 in unmittelbarer Naehe 
24833 Great location - I did not stay at this hotel but I did get a tour and WOW! This is a beautiful property. Great location on the river like it's partners Westin & Sheraton Hotels. Wonderful work out area and again, wonderful bedding. Views are killer & staff is great. 
24834 For the price of the stay not having free wifi, just in the lobby and nor a breakfast place make me think twice. 
24835 The staff went out of their way to make me feel welcome. The rooms were spacious and well equipped. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Athens Hotel Suites. 
24836 Great place to stay 
24837 Staff makes you feel you were in the Ritz Carlton! Location great for Broadway and Times square. Rooms and beds were large. Double queen beds! 
24838 Had a great business trip with my regional director. Great location and clean hotel. Staff was friendly and polite. Will stay here again. 
24839 6 Columbus is a wonderful boutique hotel on a great location,midtown, a few yards away of central park and a subway station,so every part of town is in reach. staff of hotel is friendly and helpful,blue ribbon their sushi restaurant has outstanding food my next stay will be definitely 6Columbus 
24840 Easy to reach location, close to the airport and the city. Nice atrium area. 
24841 Staff is very nice and accommodating. The rooms are small and dated. The carpet is in need of a good cleaning. Turned my kids' feet black and my socks black just after a few minutes of walking around. Probably would not stay here again or recommend. 
24842 Very good location for theaters. Can easily walk to Times Square but avoid the smell and noise. Very nice rooms, great shower head. I found the service to be very good. High rooms are better as they are more quiet. Go for the Sky view rooms. Nice, new hotel. 
24843 The only negative thing I have is that the phone did not work and was never fixed in the 5 days i was there. Oh yeah, the kleenex dispenser was not filled after i emptied it nor was the ice bucket cleaned everyday. 
24844 Stayed there over 20 times as it is the company hotel. REally love it. 
24845 very clean, friendly and helpful staff, nice buffet breakfast. We would go back! 
24846 We had a wonderful weekend. Our Jr. Suite was excellent, very clean and comfortable bed. Dinner was great at Bistro Alex and the band at Monnalisa's was great. With all of the shops and movie theatres around, this atmosphere is great for a getaway weekend. 
24847 The W hotel is well located, has an exciting lobby feel and is staffed with engaged and wonderful people. The concierge, TK Karadzovski, assisted my group with last minute reservations and recommended a very wonderful restaurant that had a great combination of food, service and ambiance. I will definitely return. 
24848 great location, very tiny rooms, (if you aren't careful, you can roll off the bed), its not really a true double bed. parking is exorbitant and there is no in and out. you have to have a bellhop escort you to your room. doorman, cleaning staff were nice. 
24849 Right off of Times Square - close to everything!!! Love the smell of apples in the Lobby - absolutely loved this 
24850 This hotel had large rooms, excellent facilities, with great friendly staff - & couldn't be in a better position, right at the top of Times Square. The view from the restaurant is amazing - not to be missed. 
24851 The location was perfect for the theater. Room was quiet and clean. Service was great. There is a high turn around and they know how to deal with it. Quickest breakfast in town in the lobby cafe. Do not hesitate to stay here. 
24852 Grat location - nice clean hotel - no problems! Would stay there again. 
24853 Muy recomendable! en zona muy segura y de facil acceso. Muy lindas las habitaciones, no son muy grandes pero muy limpias y agradables. El personal es muy servicial. 
24854 La proprete des chambres et surtout de la salle de bain laisse a desirer Trouver des poils dans une salle de bain pour un palace cela laisse perplexe Sinon le lobby et lemplacement sont top On a du changer de chambre car la premiere etait tres limite 
24855 Yes the rooms are not that great, but then it's cheap and one of the best locations in town. If the hotel is the most important part of your stay then go elsewhere. If it's just a bed for the night then this hotel is superb. I'd stay there again. 
24856 Fantastic hotel with good sized rooms, really helpful staff and a fantastic location. 
24857 Hotel rooms are nice and very quiet, the restaurant food was fantastic. However, I will not use this hotel again - there are just three elevators for over 40 floors, and you will wait, and wait and wait. Over twenty minutes each time - pretty disappointing 
24858 Well, most everything is pretty decent in the hotel. Food, smell, cleanliness, etc. However; I had a room literally next to 6 freeways! See photos. I could not sleep. Terrible for noise. Avoid location, if possible. 
24859 Superb balance of Location, Location, Location and the nice feeling you get from the hotel and staff who are very helpful, service was excellent, will stay there again on my next trip to New York. 
24860 The title says it all. I stay here very often for business (10-12 times per year for the past 3 years) and have had a positive experience EVERY time. 
24861 One of the best hotel I have stay in NY, great room nice view friendly staff. Keep the good job!!!!!! 
24862 The hotel was clean and modern, and the staff were very friendly. It was right in the middle of Time Square, an excellent place to be. In the heart of Broadway theatre district, and central enough to see all the tourist attractions without travelling too far. Highly recommended. 
24863 Great location, staff was professional. Got in too early to get into room but staff stored our bags for us so we could start sightseeing. Easy walk to Broadway for shows 
24864 Very quiet and clean hotel close to the Medical Center. very attentive staff. 
24865 had a great time at this hotel in times square ny,this hotel was clean staff was friendly, location couldnt be better ,concerige sevice was fantastic,would stay here next time we come 
24866 Impressed by staff and location. Felt at home immediately. Would bring my husband and family back. I enjoyed my stay even after arriving at 9pm I managed to stay in the rooftop lounge to relax and enjoy the great food! 
24867 Hotel met goede prijs-kwaliteit verhouding. Kamer was klein, en sanitair aan vernieuwing toe. Hier staat tegenover dat het mooi ingericht was, erg netjes en schoon, vriendelijk personeel en een metrostation voor de deur! 
24868 Everything about this hotel was lovely, clean rooms and friendly staff. The only drawback was that there is no restsurant in the hotel itself. There is however a diner next door which serves lovely food and delivers up to your hotel room for free. 
24869 It was terrible! Dirty sheets, dirty carpet. I booked my hotel at priceline, big mistake. I paid almost 700 hundred dlls for this...... Honestly I am a very patient person, take little to please me but this was really bad. I do not recommeded it. 
24870 We like the Larchmont for price and location. Quiet and lovely street. Near NYU and Cooper Union. Rooms are big and roomy and can even fit a cot. Comfy bathrobe and slippers for all guest to shuffle to shared bath and WC. 
24871 We always winced a bit when walking back to the hotel after dark - walking by the NY Probation Department fortress NEXT door! did not help. Hotel was very nice inside, staff were good. Location was good. 
24872 This hotel is a must for travellers who want a smack bang central location in Times Square. This place is class. The rooms are fantastic with spectacular views of Times Square. Good value too. Definitely going back to this hotel.... 
24873 A small hotel with everything! Really well placed for sight seeing on foot but quiet enough to g.et a good night sleep after sightseeing all day.Friendly staff very clean and excellent if on a budget.Would stay there again! 
24874 Not terrible, but you could find something in a better area for the same price. Also, the floors were dirty, both in the room and the corridors, and the air conditioning was loud. 
24875 Siamo stati in viaggio di nozze in questo hotel, soggiorno molto comodo abbiamo trovato l'arredamento moderno, una stanza matrimoniale molto pulita e personale preparato e gentile. Wii fii gratuito in lobby interessante... La posizione centrale vicino alla stazione e alla fermata del autobus facilita gli spostamenti. Consigliato 
24876 We satyed to celebrate our anniversary. All of the staff did a great job. The hotel was very nice. The front desk was very welcoming Erica especially. All of the Valet team did excellent! Maktar was such a sweetheart. This place was perfect. We look forward to another stay. 
24877 I only stayed one night at this hotel. The rooms were a little tired but comfortable. I stayed in the South Tower so it was quite a walk from the main lobby. It was also uncomfortable navigating the escalator with luggage. I really don't think I would stay here again. 
24878 Stayed there 2-3 weeks last summer, nice rooms, good service and houskeeping. It had also free internet, the breakfast was okay. 
24879 Our second stay at the Hilton Garden Inn and we don't have a single complaint. New, clean, great location near Macys and several subway lines, fairly priced. A couple of delis right around corner great for breakfast and snacks. You can't go wrong here! 
24880 Nicely renovated... Clean rooms. Not much of a view nd the elevator got stuck so only two lifts working. Great location, no view from the room but Nicole value and convenient. 
24881 Rooms were huge and well appointed. Minor problems were quickly attended to. Televisions in living room and bedroom were large and the unit had cable and wi-fi service. Nice people made this a very pleasant stay. One block away from the NYC Marathon was an unexpected extra. 
24882 The room was gorgeous, beautifully decorated, the service was excellent, the view from the window remarkable, the localization excellent. I do recommend staying at the Sherry Netherland Hotel if you go to New York. 
24883 Ok pour Famille Suite Junior avec 2 lit + sofa. Service minimum mais petit dj inclus 
24884 Excellent location, With time square on your door step. Tremondus budget hotel in manhattan. The CARTER HOTEL is ideally suited for the city's top attractions. Ideal to suit travellers on a budget. We where that happy that we have booked for next year already. 
24885 A great place to stay. We had a suite with 2 queen beds. It was hard to find a hotel in New York that has queen beds. The hotel was very nice, clean, and quiet. 
24886 2 blocks from Penn Station, this hotel is perfectly located for the travellor who likes to do some exploring by foot. We had a great time her the staff were incredibly friendly and the service was great. love the cookie on arrival too! Will stay here again for sure 
24887 Really needs a facelift. Anyone can just walk in and get on the elevator. Lots of LOUD guests 
24888 We loved it as much as our boys (8 & 6). Great room and amenities. 
24889 Excellent location, the service is amazing and the rooms are quite a night experience! Highly recommended! 
24890 Peersonal muy amable , y cooperador. Muy limpio y confortable.Dormi bien. 
24891 You may find whatever you need in the simpliest way. Very close to Times Square. Not very expensive. Includes everything at a 5 star hotel. 
24892 Pasamos una noche en este hotel de excelente ubicacion frente a la Penn Station en Manhattan. La habitacion doble muy confortable, cama amplia y comoda con gran variedad de almohadas, agradable decoracion y precio adecuado 
24893 Excelente opcion. Cerca de estacion de metro y del central Park. Lo recomiendo 
24894 Gorgeous, well laid-out room. Very quiet inside rooms - you don't hear neighbors. Only 2 downsides: club music constantly plays in lobby & elevators; and bed, although beautiful, was way too soft. Would give 5 stars if the bed was as good as everything else. 
24895 Dit moderne hotel is smaakvol ingericht, ligt in een heel prettige buurt. Vanuit locatie zijn zowel Central Park, Soho, Financial District goed te belopen. Goede bedden en internetservice. Kortom: top hotel! 
24896 Rooms were nice. Comfortable. The bar and restaurant were blaring music until 3:30am! Kept us up despite the white noise machine in the room and the compmentary earplugs 
24897 The staff here is friendly, helpful and eager to please. I stay here often and always feel at home. The location is fantastic and close to many wonderful places. The price is perfect. I always recommend to my friends. 
24898 Love the location right on the park, and this is an authentic, old school NY hotel. Great service and nice rooms. 
24899 The only negative aspect is the tiny room. Perfect location, Clean, breakfast included, reasonable price and good staff. Perfect for a single or a couple without kids. Walking distance from all major attractions. 
24900 Okay its the third time i've stayed in this hotel and it just seems to get better. Checked in with no hassle and staff helped us with the names of local eateries and bus reservations to Woodbury Common. And the evening conceirge (Tony) is HOT! 
24901 die Lage ist ideal, im hinteren Hausteil ruhig. Die Zimmer sind aber nicht mehr auf dem neuesten Stand. 
24902 My experience at Park Central Hotel in New York was cool, treated us great, service was the best. The Ellen receptionist received us very friendly and guided us in the best way, he was always very nice to us and very effcient, helped us across our stay. 
24903 located in the heart of Beverly hills. close to The Grove Mall. plenty of tropical flowers around the whole hotel. beatiful garden area. standard Four Seasons room setting. Very good experience in LA this time! 
24904 For those of you who are SPG members this hotel is a true Whatever Whenever experience. The staff went above and beyond to make our trip enjoyable.Patrick went out of he's way to insure my girlfriends birthday was very memorable. Hat's off to the W and it's staff !! 
24905 We stayed here in October 2010 and didn't have any real complaints about the place other than it could use some updated furnishings and some paint. The location is hard to beat but don't expect any good city views from your window. 
24906 Fancy feeling like a queen for a week? My wonderful partner took me to this fabulous hotel for my birthday. It was beautiful, immaculate and luxurious. Would recommend to anyone! 
24907 First time staying there in May for Tribeca Film Festival. Great location, nice staff, great location, clean room. Highly recommend 
24908 Vibe of hotel is great. Love the chairs outside looking over the lake. Bars, upstairs and downstairs are both very W -- which is cool and trendy. Rooms are clean and updated. Highly recommend the hotel. My fave in the city (at this point). 
24909 Design hotel in a very nice area, close to the subway station. Staff at the reception is very helpful and kind. Price is generally ok, and compared to the rest of Manhattan is good. Room a bit small, but nice. 
24910 Hotel is in a great location to the airport, with average rooms andq average service. 
24911 Very well located. Friendly service, very nice clean quiet rooms. Beds are very comfortable. Very nice bar area without loud music where you can sit and relax. Breakfast was overpriced for the food served, but I guess this is expected for a hotel. I would definitely stay again. 
24912 We scored a room for only $100 on priceline. Right by Grand Central. It's an older property, but the location and price are so right for NYC. 
24913 We stayed in Oct and it was great. Spacious and what a plus to have a kitchen! Staff was very helpful and close to my daughter. We have tried many places but I think we finally found our home away from home. My daughter liked it! 
24914 Great location in NYC! If you need to be near Time Square this is the place! 
24915 I have stayed here several times and the service continues to be very good. Reserved an Astor suite with a connecting room. Butler is very attentive to all needs. Valet was very professional and punctual. I dont have any negatives. Very good stay. 
24916 Spent the week-end february 4th to 6th. Nice hotel, very clean, friendly staff, very helpful. I was on the 21st floor. Great view. Hotel was steps from chinatown and various subway entries. 
24917 Awsome Hotel in a great part of Chicago with lots to do! 
24918 Club Quarters in the Loop was just fine for a single traveler. I paid $ 75 thru priceline. clean and convenient to the trains. 
24919 We've stayed at this hotel twice, and have enjoyed the property each time. It is hard to imagine a better value in NYC - and the Upper West Side location is perfect. 
24920 It's a good place and right next to a 14th St. subway (connection to JFK). Only trouble we had - internet/WiFi from our room (#207) was weak .. but worked every now and then. I could handle my tasks at home (South Africa) .. 
24921 Pricelined two rooms over airshow week end. We loved the next door location of Millenium Park and the across the street location of CVS as one if us forgot socks! Rooms were clean and beds were wonderful. Bathrooms were generous and spa like 
24922 This is an older hotel that has been refurbished. Staff works hard to provide outstanding service. Rooms were nice but small compared to more modern hotels. Very close to Field Museum, Shed Aquarium, etc. Good for couples! Glad my kids stayed at home. 
24923 Nice hotel in the middle of Manhattan. Romantic atmosphere due to the soft lights. Nice bar located at the ground floor. 
24924 I love being spontaneous and the unexpected, hence I love visiting NY. I also like something to ground me. The Soho Grand is what I use for that. I always make sure I stay there. 
24925 la concerjeria no es del hotel...nos pidieron 120 dolares para el trasporte al aeropuerto y el trasporte NUNCA LLEGO....el hotel dijo que no teneia nada que ver con el concerje...PERDIMOS LOS 120 DOLARES!!!! NOS TOCO TOMAR DOS TAXIS...Tenemos ese dinero perdido. 
24926 Best NY hotel i've stayed in so far. Good value for money, close to subway, shops, bars. Nice Neighborhood feel to the area. Felt safe at all time of day. 
24927 Excellent price and service. Rooms are small but comfortable, staff is excellent and facility is excellent also. only gripe would be no room service but thats all! 
24928 Pictures are very deceiving compared to the real room, Room itself was not very well taken care of. 
24929 We had a great visit to the Hilton NY (Ave of Americas) The front desk staff was very pleasant and accommodating. The housekeepers were thorough! We look forward to staying with the Hilton NY again! 
24930 Hotel moderno, bien comunicado, con buenas habitaciones... Muy recomendable 
24931 stayed at the hotel in september.brill location.10min walk from times square.everything within walking distance.was expecting a small room when we arrived but it was huge for ny.will defo stay at it again as i am going back next year.the restaurant is amazing-best food i tasted in ny.friendly staff and quiet. 
24932 Great hotel. The bartender Errol was awesome! (Definitely made the dining experience entertaining) Errol was friendly and he made the hotel stay that much better! Affordable and the beds were comfy. Great location too. 
24933 Pros: Nice location, very close to top attractions Nice breakfast Friendly staff Cons: Small rooms Found a cockroach Nice to have drinking water at front desk 
24934 for any situation... good place for it, very clean... also friendly and recommended 
24935 Great location, great view, great room. I would definately stay here again. The staff was very nice and the experience was pleasant. It is very close to Times Square! 
24936 Centrally located....within walking distance of most things. Friendly and personalble staff....clean and comfortable rooms! BUT check you exit bill. Just a reminder. 
24937 The reception staff were always nice and helpfull but the bartenders were so impolite toward customers that I went there once and for all. The rooms need a refresh and the whole Hotel is a bit decadent. 
24938 Consistently good service and the value of the London suite is excellent. Great midtown location - close to shops and museums. 
24939 Wonderful hotel - chic and comfortable in Manhattan. Away from the hustle and bustle, but just a cab ride away from everything. Loved the decor and the bed was cozy and comfortable. 
24940 Love this small hotel. Nice people, clean rooms, walking distance of Times Square, 5th avenue, Central Park, ... I recommend this for your stay in NYC !!! 
24941 would stop there any time 5 star food was very good and so ware the drinks very close to 5th avenue, best place to be if you want to stay some were nice safe and classy look no furtherer 
24942 Stayed at hotel for two week stretches 4 or 5 times on business and was impressed with the staff, cleanliness and attention to customer service that was extended. Director of sales was EXTREMELY professional and technically sound. My needs were met and my expectations were exceeded. Great Job! 
24943 Andrew at front desk was super friendly and helpful. I arrived early but was accommodated with ease. I requested extra towels during my stay and they were brought within 5 minutes. Beautiful hotel with a great location, and very friendly, efficient staff. Would stay again! 
24944 Fresh cookies and smiles to greet you. Location is great and the view of the Galleria is unbeatable. Great restaurants all around you, many within walking distance. Had some issues on my bill and the manager made quick work fixing it, no questions asked. Parking is a little steep though. 
24945 Good hotel, perfect location...the pictures speak for themselves. The service, however, was bad. The front desk agents are kids, kids w/o proper customer service training. As far as the hotel...see the pics! 
24946 Excellent hotel - we were on the 42nd floor in a corner room facing SW. Bed, lines, facilities were all clean and pristine. Wish we could have stayed longer - 
24947 This is a nice hotel. Staff were friendly and accommodating. Room was spacious and comfortable. Room service was decent. This hotel is in a good location for shopping and eating out. I would stay here again. 
24948 We have stayed in dozens of hotels in NYC, and this one ranks right at the top. Classic. And, classy. Large room. Wonderful service. Excellent location. The "King Cole" bar is...unique. Pricey, but, actually, we had a wonderful deal which made it very reasonable. Highly recommend it.... 
24949 Good starting point for Sightseeing in NYC. Standard room, clean but shared bathrooms. Receptionists have their own style to be friendly... 
24950 This hotel has good location and distinguishable concept. Desing is everywhere and enables quite small rooms to be comfortable. Perfect foe young couples and design lovers. Complimentary breakfast is poor - just coffee and muffins. For pay You can get more. Air condition was too loud. 
24951 This is a really fashion hotel. It's situated only 10-15 min. walking to Times Square. The atmosphere is really young. Views, free muffins buffet and terrace are really amazing. Tiny rooms but enough for a young couple. Friendly stuff. 
24952 We stayed for 6 nights. The hotel was great, clean, good breakfast. Central location. We would definetly recommend. The hotel will keep your bags after you check out and arrange transport to the airport 
24953 Nice, clean hotel located in a great part of town near some great restaurants. 
24954 This hotel is fantastic - impressive reception, helpful staff, superb views across the Manhatton skyline, close to the river and fairly central (only about a 10 minute walk) to the Times Square. 
24955 The staff was very friendly, check-in was a breeze, excellent location, close to theatre district, rooms very clean, close to subway. I will always book this hotel when we visit NYC. Loved it! 
24956 I stayed at ZaZa the past two years for the Offshore Technology Confernece. They lost my car both years and dented it this year. You would think that when they charge $27.00 per day for valet parking that they would not lose your car! 
24957 Value for money suit hotel on the 54th. Breakfast is good. try to avoid the ten dollar bottle of water they serve. service quality used to be better. restaurant over priced and below gordon ramsey standards. 
24958 Good location to sightsee without lots of travelling time, rooms were ok, nothing special but good for the price and location, Would stay again. 
24959 Wat een lekker hotel! Grote, schone kamers met heerlijke bedden en fijne badkamer. Gratis ontbijtbuffetje met lekkere broodjes, vruchtensap, koffie en thee. Vriendelijk personeel etc. Vlakbij de metro (1 blok lopen), aan Broadway in Midtown, wat wil je nog meer. Volgende keer weer dit hotel 
24960 Very cute. Very clean. The breakfast included at this hotel was good and practical. It's a 5 minutes walk from Times Square, which is close enough without being noisy. Would definitely stay there again. 
24961 I found the reservation specialist at the hotel very helpful and courteous. She gave tips on the surrounding area restaurants and shopping. She explained the differences in the rooms and rates. The hotel was very charming and the location you just can't beat. 
24962 es bueno y esta limpio y el mas barato que encontre. El unico problema es que son banos compartidos pero nunca encontre ninguna sorpresa en los banos. queda a dos cuadras de broadway y cerca de una estacion de tren 
24963 Hotel location perfect! Close to everything, Times Square, major high end department stores. Room was fine. Washroom a bit small but what do you expect, it's NY? Towels did have a weird smell. Brought my own from home anyway. Otherwise, would stay there again. 
24964 We found this hotel absolutely brilliant. Central location for the Rock, Empire State, Central Park, Times Square. Staff very helpfull. Room well appointed, clean and roomy. Bed turn down service with soft music playing when returning back after an evening out just made the day. 
24965 Across the road from Penn Station, this hotel is ideally located. The post office is only a block away. The room, although very small, was always kept clean. Dined at the Tick Tock and found it very convenient. Will surely return when in New York. 
24966 Everyone was excellent concierge Domenic rebooked my flight a real life saver 
24967 Fantastic Hotel!!! Everthing in this hotels is fantastic: Location, staff, rooms and the service. Very nice staff, always willing to help and advisee!! 
24968 This is an amazing place! So beautiful and so incredible. Gorgeous room with amzing service. Can not wait to go back!!! 
24969 Just got back last nite from New York. Absolutely loved the hotel, including the location, roomy room, very comfortable, staff awesome. Walked pretty much everywhere from our hotel. All our theatre tickets were within walking distance. Great to catch a cab. Lights, camera, action right outside the hotel!! 
24970 Small clean rooms, helpful staff in reception, excellent wifi. Easy to reach and start exploring NY by subway. Nice breakfast places close, at Amsterdam Avenue. Thanks and see You again, already sent You other guests :-) ! 
24971 By far the most uncomfortable bed. Not what you would expect for $459 a night by NYc city prices a bargain. Will definitely stick to the Ritz next time. 
24972 Stayed during the holidays and I found the hotel to be just perfect for us. The rooms are beautiful and all the staff was very helpful. Love the restaurant, the food was excellent. We will go back to the hotel very soon. 
24973 I stayed here for two weeks while in New York for a business trip. Check-in was efficient, the rooms are spacious and it's great to have a small kitchen. Cleaning was done every day and we efficient, no complaints. The only downside was the internet service, which was poor. 
24974 Great base for a trip to NY,rooms quiet small,funky place 
24975 I was impressed with my stay at TRYP. The staff was knowledgable and very friendly. fthe rooms are great. I would definiely recommend to other people. And it's a block from Penn Station. 
24976 The room was small and smelled. The view was nonexistent. The shower dribbled COLD water. The minibar was exorbitant. The staff couldn't have cared less. Easily the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. 
24977 The hotel is very nice and the location is perfect! It is attached to the Galleria Mall in Houston with lots of upscale stores. 
24978 for the 400 dollars the room was really small, the heating couldnt be adjusted, the hotel was in the middle of alterations and a huge wait for the lifts. 
24979 The lobby was small. I've seen better at a motel. The concergie dropped one of my bags which resulted in damage to a few of my items. The rooms were average and not worth the price. 
24980 Booked on Priceline. Recieved a clean room with two beds. Nice coffee maker in the room. Free parking and internet. 
24981 Lush with elegance and history, the Waldorf Astoria Hotel proves a magnificent stay for any visitor or local. 
24982 Perfect gelegen, subway om de hoek, boven treinstation, 5th ave op 5 minuten lopen; binnen 10 minuten op Times Square Gerenoveerde kamers Trendy restaurant (wel duur) Snelle en adequate service in het hotellobby 
24983 Arrived by limo with Champagne in hand! What a hotel such a grand entrance and hallway, helpful staff, free upgrade to a fabulous room overlooking the Chrysler building. The hotel had everything you could want, shops bars restaraunts just a wonderful experience all together 
24984 Rooms were clean, quiet and big for NYC. Staff was amazing... especially Shane at the front desk. Top-notch service! Hotel gym was also very well-equipped for a boutique hotel. 
24985 This was our second stay here. It's in a great location across from Grant Park. The rooms are ok, but the bathroom is outdated if not a little beat up. The staff was nice enough. I would stay here again. 
24986 Great location in midtown Manhattan. Clean and suprisingly quiet rooms, friendly and helpful staff. Cheap by NYC standards. Rooms pretty small but not claustrophobic in any way. Really exceeded expectations. The included breakfast however very basic - but still better than none. 
24987 The Hotel is really nice. The people that work there were very friendly and helpful. Excellent ubication. We loved it. 
24988 Short business trip that became extended due to weather delays. But if I was going to get snowed in anywhere - I choose the Indigo Chicago. Staff was very helpful and concerned about me getting home. Hotel was very clean and comfortable. 
24989 Fantastic hotel !! staff was extremely polite and helpful. Short walk to Time square / Broadway plays Large room with over-sized bathrooms Night club had awesome view of the city but too crowded for my taste. 
24990 Simply the best. Nostalgia overcomes you when you arrive, great service, exceptional attitude and sheer luxury. The location is very good with numerous taxis to take you anywhere you desire. The hotel amenities are wonderful as is the breakfasts! Great stay 
24991 I could go on & on about how bad this is..they advertise free parking but do not have enough spots for each room...that's the beginning & just take my word for the rest....DO NOT STAY HERE!!! 
24992 Ottimo hotel di appartamenti per famiglie con angolo cottura e molto spazio a disposizione. Pulito personale disponibile e gentile reception H24, personale al piano molto cordiale e disponibile. In pieno centro a 500 metri dalla Grand Central Station. CONSIGLIATO !!!!! Supermercati a circa 50-100 metri. 
24993 Stay in Manhattan several times a year. Tried this hotel found it to be $100 less expensive than my normal location and plenty comfortable. Room well appointed free breakfast with decent selection. Will stay here again 
24994 My husband had a conference at the astronomically expensive Plaza Hotel, so back we went to the Warwick. Very comfortable, half the price of the Plaza, an excellent location, good bar, great make up mirror and a safe. I'd go back in a New York minute 
24995 when i was aking to fill my water the waiter did very fast, i have to tell you that And the staek was very american cancer style burned outside, the sauce was black pepper, herbs and and jellyfish inside thank you 
24996 As NY hotels, it has an small room with the minimum needed. It has an modern style in the room and in the lobby. In 5 days I always found a lot of disorder and a mess of towels outside the rooms. 
24997 Recently had a 4 night stay, read many reviews on here and was concerend to the point of nearly cancelling. Glad i didnt, hotel was great, good location, friendly staff, nice size rooms and very clean. 
24998 Decided to try it because it was inexpensive and very close to where I needed to be for meetings. Very efficient rooms. Nice work space. Bed was only OK. 
24999 Beacon hotel was a good value and great location however the elevators were being rennovated and the wait to go to the lobby was 15min one time. Otherwise we enjoyed our stay. 
25000 We can only recommend it. The value for money is excellent. You share bath and toilet, but as long as you're ok with that, there's nothing wrong with the place. Friendly staff, clean and it's central. 
25001 I wish I could write glowing remarks about this place, but I am so frustrated. If you are a business traveler that needs wireless connection (and not LAN), do not stay here. Wireless is available only in the lobby...expect to work in the lobby (or check into another hotel). 
25002 The tagline says it all. Very comfy bed, good size room, excellent bathroom (separate shower and bath always a good thing). The bar does great cocktails (pricey but worth it), and is good for people watching. Will go back without any qualms. 
25003 Recently decorated, good sized space with an alcove for suitcases adjacent to the closet. Room had a lovely bathroom, large window, comfortable chair, desk, newer TV, and king bed. Busy lobby, but little wait and prompt check in. All made for one of our best weekends in NYC. Thank you. 
25004 Great place...simple and walking distance to times square Liza is the best...let us know that is was dining week in nyc...and printed out a list of all the participating restaurants...ate a great meal, at a great price...Thanks already planning the next nyc adventure...Spa week..yeah 
25005 All the employees were incredibly friendly and welcoming. Great location Beautiful Lobby Loved the bedding and huge bathtub Amazing light from huge floor the ceiling windows Gemma's food is really good and enjoyed the atmosphere very much 
25006 The elevator was slow and crowded but not too bad. In general the hotel was very crowded. I tried their Japanese menu at their restaurant/Bar and was greatly disappointed - expensive, slow, and not good. 
25007 We enjoyed our stay very much. Modern design. Beautiful amenities. Great location. Friendly staff. Terrific views. 
25008 Fuimos cinco dias a New York y nos alojamos en este maravilloso hotel,esta fenomenal situado y las habitaciones son de lujo!!las camas son lo mejor!!lo recomiendo al cien x cien!!!si duda volveria a este hotel 
25009 We love this place! Right around the corner from Penn Station, we could go anywhere easily. Great train service to EWR. Hotel has fantastic breakfasts. 
25010 just returned home after spending Thanksgiving at this hotel' the accommodation is excellent and close to all amenities. the staff are extremely pleasant and helpful. rooms are very spacious and spotlessly clean:) i would recommend it highly and hope to return again:) 
25011 Good location and accommodations for the price. Easy walk to shows, shopping, and Central Park. We got rooms (odd #s) on the back to eliminate road noise. Free breakfast was crowded, thus we would go over the Broadway and hit EZ Deli. 
25012 No doubt the cleanliness ..the decor everything is A+!!! just one small problem you have to wqalk faaaaar to long for the nearest Starbucks ,Wallgreens and the remaining shops...else there is nothing wrong. great room..nice channels ... cosy!!! 
25013 Three blocks from Grand Central Station, less than 10 minute walk to Times Square, made the location very central. The suites were very clean and spacious. The kitchens were great, we saved some money from dining out. Would definetly recommend. 
25014 positively surprised by the size of the hotel rooms/apartments, the facilities, the location and the price. My third time at this hotel in 3 months and will come back again for sure. K 
25015 unbelievable hotel, unbelievable city, unbelievable time. If your going the hotel is in such a great place only 2 mins from 5th and 2 mins from times square. Loved it 
25016 only if id go again id wait till it gets a bit warmer!!!!!!!! its freezing over there 
25017 We stayed here and were pleasantly surprised. The rooms were quiet and the staff was super nice. The a/c was not very good but the bed was very comfy. The location has a lot to offer but you need a car and there is a charge for parking. 
25018 We stayed there for one week and we loved it, Patrick was the best ! The staff is really nice and everyone really helpful. Recommend it if you wanna stay on Manhattan. Love to you guys from Iceland :) 
25019 We had received a gift certificate for this hotel from friends who said it was unique. It was a gem. The staff was superb from the front desk to Rick's Cafe.The location is perfect.It was a lot of fun and we met some really enjoyable people. 
25020 Very comfortable friendly hotel. The decor was lovely and the bed in the room was magnificent. Along with the accomodations the front desk staff (especially Jackie and Shefi) were phenominal. they took care of pretty much everything I asked for. I highly recomend staying there. 
25021 Quick trip to check on colleges for senior high school girl Great place to stay i will recommend it again and again 
25022 Really happy with hotel, price and location 
25023 If I had to be critical only bar is adjoining rare restaurant which is good but after walking shopping miles could have done with more relaxing bar / area. 
25024 Great hotel, very nice neighborhood, rooms are spacious compared to others in NYC, very friendly staff. Try the bar as well, there is a nice view of the Empire State Building. Next time in NYC we will choose this hotel again. 
25025 Good central location and everuthing works as it should. Breakfast out of house - in local vicinity, but limited choice. Free Internet access on two computers on mezzanine level. 
25026 come si dice,poco pagare poco valere............distante 4 isolati dalla fermata metro 1,camera piccolissima nn x due pers,senza armadio nn sono mai venuti a pulite e cambiare lenzuola e asciugamano.-(( pero se si vuole spendere pochissimo va bene(diciamo) 
25027 I found the staff to be helpful. Rooms were average but tidy and all my requests were listened. Hotel bar is ok and the lobby busy and nice. The location is suburb! I didn't have the breakfast in the hotel. Overall experience was enjoyable. 
25028 Great location, comfort and service. Zuli and Helena at the front desk are supremely competent, and their smiles will make your day. 
25029 The Hotel is very nice and the cityviews are great ! The price is right ! The location lacks. You will need to take a taxi ride to get about anywhere - you could probably walk to Soldier Field though 
25030 I can just say one thing: Don't stay here. The rooms are horrible with cold water showers and broken toilets. The manager is rude and scary when complaining. No internet access available even though it is promised on website. The list goes on and on... 
25031 Excellent location, location. location, center of the Theater & Restaurant Districts,Personnel, Accommodations(Suites),Lounge, Restaurant,Housekeeping, stayed before in 2010 is our 1ST choice of hotels in Manhattan,NY,!!!!!Hostess,Hannah and James, the bartender are extremely professional and personable HILTON Caliber... 
25032 I visit Chicago monthly and have stayed in several hotels. The Raffaello is a lovely hotel that perfectly balances period charm and fantastic modern updates. The staff is warm and helpful. I will stay at the Raffaello over and over! 
25033 I am a frequent business traveler and I know what service means. This hotel understands how to go above and beyond and the staff of this IHG makes it happen daily! Great leadership by management. I can highly recommend this hotel! 
25034 The location was good to get around from. Hotel had what I needed. Only minus was a late check-in. I was made to wait up to an hour for my room. Not much else is wrong with the hotel. Basic, functional, gets things done. 
25035 A great location. Possibly the smallest hotel room i've ever stayed in....and i'd gotten and upgrade?!! I thought it was expensive for what it was. Clean and tidy. 
25036 Easy checkin, friendly staff, knowledgeable concierge, great breakfast at Norma's - but Very expensive. 
25037 The Palmer House Hilton was the perfect place to stay in Chicago! It is in a wonderful location, just step away from the train. The staff was professional and courteous, and the rooms were so spacious (with two bathrooms!). I would definitely recommend staying here. 
25038 Gem of a hotel very comfortable marvellous location staff polite and go out of their way to be helpful. Will book in again on our next trip 
25039 Very good hotel in a nice location in Chicago. Nice bars and restaurants in walking distance. 10 walking minutes to water tower place. Rooms are small but very nice and new furnished with cool colours. Would definetly stay here again!!! 
25040 Lovely people at reception, room service and roof bar. We so much enjoy our stay. Just for future reference you should look at cleaning standards in the hotel, as property absolutely lovely, but it can't survive without looking after. 
25041 Excellent Choice! The La Quinta Manhattan is reasonably priced, convenient to Amtrak, the subway, busses, and taxis, and is clean, and offers all of the necessary amenities we required (breakfast , a concierage, free nationwide calling). We were very pleased and satisfied. 
25042 We loved it! Great service! Extraordinary rooms! Amazing view! What else can I say!? 
25043 Location sells this hotel. Staff more than friendly. Hotel clean spacious and the view is priceless. Highly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting NYC. Close to the shows, restaurants, subway and tkts booth. 
25044 This is not our first stay at this hotel, and we see an improvement with every stay. There appears to be some positive tweaking going on. If there is a stand-out feature at this property, it is the very pleasant and helpful staff. 
25045 colazioni fantastiche anche se un po' caloriche, posizione bellissima per lo shopping. 
25046 Really enjoyed our stay here, it made our stay in New York very special. The service is very professional & welcoming while the rooms are luxurious! We found the restaurant & bar to be expensive though. 
25047 I stayed at this hotel on a business trip and thought it had a very hip atmosphere in New York. I would definitely stay here again. 
25048 I could not have asked for a better hotel to stay in than this one. The room were perfect, the staff was great and the price was good. I would stay here again without a doubt and would tell anyone to do the same. 
25049 Had a great stay at the hotel, big room, big bathroom and very comfortable. The only gripe was $69 for internet access over the week, but there was free wifi in the public areas. Big thumbs up from me, oh and the roof top bar #amazeballs! 
25050 This hotel is in a great location in Manhattan. You are right in the center of everything. The rooms are very cool and I would definately get a suite if you could afford it. Overall I loved the hotel and I would definately recommend it. Dana-New York 
25051 We stayed over the summer weekend and will return back. At fhis hotel you can feel very special. Great location. Highly recommend their micheline star restaurant Guilt for dinner. Do not recommend hotel's breakfast and lunch restaurant as their food and Menu is nothing special but service ir great anyway. 
25052 This trip was a surprise birthday present and I couldn't have been luckier. The hotel was extremely comfortable, the beds were excellent, the room had a magnificent view and it was so conveniently located that I would advise anyone to stay there. 
25053 Great Customer Service from the front desk to the maid service. Rooms are spacious and clean with views of the empire state building. I had a very nice stay!!! 
25054 Lifts took ages, staff were unfriendly and there was no sense of welcome. Room was dark and dingy and there was nothing redeeming about it. It was also very noisy. Wifi was patchy and calls to the reception rang out. I won't be back. 
25055 What a wonderful hotel. Clean room. Large room. Outstanding buffet breakfast for $9...no service charge, tax, or tip added. Window opened in room. Quiet room. Close to Carnegie Hall. I would stay here again. Across street from subway. Near groceries. Hotel room had microwave and refrigerator. 
25056 Good location, clean but dated. Very pricey and limited room service menu. Parking can handle a hi-top van. Noisy lobby, quiet rooms. Expect 500 a day all in. 
25057 My boyfriend and I stayed at The Roger for a night and were very pleased. The renovation came out great. The rooms were very clean and the beds comfortable. I would definitely recommend the hotel. We got a reservation through Priceline and were very happy with the price. 
25058 We were there for 3 nights at the end of April. Was a basic room, bathroom sink area was a little tight but not a problem. Good location, within 4 blocks of Rockefeller Ctr. Clean and comfortable, especially since all you're looking for is a place to shower and sleep. 
25059 Location is great. Hotel itself is clean and nice by NYC standards. It's in a quiet, yet convenient location. Price is great too. Rooms are small and bathrooms are even smaller, but we were there to see the city, not to hang out in the room! 
25060 Great location,nice size rooms, clean and helpful staff. 1block from Times Square And near good restaurants. Just a great hotel that I would choose next time. Lois S. 
25061 Buona la posizione, vicinissima alla metro, comodissima per gli spostamenti. Condizioni generali discrete, pulito, ma assolutamente insufficienti le dimensioni della camera, dove non si poteva neppure camminare: peccato che, una sbirciata alle altre camere, ci abbia fatto capire che gli altri clienti dell'hotel erano stati trattati assai meglio di noi. 
25062 Stayed in New York in The Hotel Metro in 2008 lovely hotel not far from all the centre 2 minutes from Macy's ,lovely rooftop terrace for drinks ,room clean and comfy staff OK ,spent a fantastic week in New York. 
25063 This hotel is right where you want to be! It was clean, the doorman were very helpful with info we needed; it was the perfect stay. Convenient to all the attractions. 
25064 have recently been to this hotel with a small group. all the staff apart from one were very friendly- especially Mathew who helped organise transfers and store luggage. The bedrooms were fine and the breakfast completely acceptable. the location is great, being a few minutes from Macys!! 
25065 In the heart of NYC. The location is excellent. The service top notch. Both the bar and the Blu Fin restaurant were 5 star experiences. Will definitely return ! 
25066 Stayed here for one night. Great hotel for the price. Booked a queen room and was upgraded to a renovated queen with great bath. Very clean and excellent location! 
25067 Good value for money and included breakfast - great location ! 
25068 Everything about our experience was great. The room was very clean and provided a great view of Times Square. The concierge was very knowledgeable. I would recommend the hotel to anyone. 
25069 Loved this hotel! Great location for all we wanted to do and see in Manhattan. Superb rooms, comfy beds, huge bathrooms, and outstanding service. The hotel was bustling and busy the entire stay but the service and staff were all terrific. Loved the bar and restaurant. 
25070 Stayed 1 night while working in New York.Great hotel,from service to value. 
25071 Just returned from a three night stay at the Renaissance.Great location, great value and a wonderful staff. The staff was freindly, very helpful and extremely professional. If you want a true New York trip stay at this property. 
25072 Good City Hotel with helpful staff. Perfect Location in/near Times Square. Comfortable rooms. 
25073 My family absolutely enjoyed our stay at San Carlos. Cleanliness was supreme and the one bedroom suite was spacious. The mini kitchenette was fabulous especially traveling with an infant and a child who has food allergies. We will be staying there again next year for our December trip. 
25074 safe in room helpful staff, jewel osco nearby great snax and liquor prices. tried deep an pizza not cheap but vey nice. 
25075 If you have a reason to be in mid-town New York, do not miss staying at the Michelangelo Hotel. A wonderful place in the middle of a great city... 
25076 Class. The staff is amazing. Accommodating and professional. We spend at least one weekend in Manhattan every year. Very doubtful we'd stay anywhere else. We have fallen in love with Tribecca and the downtown area. 
25077 Everything was awesome, the only thing I would like to complain about is the breakfast. But otherwise everything was great, it's close to everything 2 min from Empire State Building. 
25078 Nothing could make up for the bad impression of poor housekeeping on arrival. 
25079 Fast check-in, helpful smiley staff, fairly spacious for NY, hot breakfast around the corner, 2 min walk to several subway lines, super clean. A recommended option. 
25080 Went in November to try out New York shopping, what a great time. The hotel was central to all the shops and sites, staff were very helpful and great diner for all those lovely treats. Looking forward to booking next year. 
25081 I forhold til prisen er det et godt bud paa et stedat bo centralt i Manhatten. Det er ikke luksus men rent og i orden, med venlig og hjaelpsom personale. Man kan gaa til mange af de steder der skal ses, og man kan gaa til tog og busstation. 
25082 My second time staying here. Great location. Macys a hop skip & jump away. plenty of great restaurants nearby. Empire state just behind. Staff friendly & helpful. Room spacious & clean. Bar area comfy and staff excellent! Female bartender friendly & entertaining. Food yum. Will be back. 
25083 stayed there for whole july.... staff is friendly, facilities are good, location is best and centrally located. caution: insist for a lower floor, since lift's are in-sufficient to cater to number of guests. 
25084 If you like waiting an hour for a shuttle, having to wait 40 minutes for a roll-away bed, overly priced food, and smell of smoke in the elevator, this is a great place for you. The wait staff was the only good thing--they were extremely friendly and courteous. 
25085 Nice hotel, very good location, new furniture, fixtures and fittings, all in good order. Negatives: loud if on low floor, small rooms, no personal safe in room. 
25086 Everything about our stay was outstanding! It was much nicer than I expected. In fact I can't think of anything I'd change. Roomy, friendly and clean. Food and drink was also a plus. That and so convenient to the ballpark! 
25087 Expensive, but aren't most New York hotels? Great location! Was able to take the subway to Brooklyn and other sites by walking just a short distance. Enjoyed the market in Central Station. Check-in personnel were friendly and efficient. Would probably stay there again, if I could afford the cost. 
25088 From start to finish everything was top notch. Great staff, prompt service 
25089 Even put a smile on my cranky 4 year old grandsons face......not an easy task. 
25090 spacious apartment,rooftop dining an oasis is NYC! 
25091 Well I stayed with my wife and daughter on the 16th floor in 3rd & 4th june. It's a neat place but service is poor. It's basically for short stays. I changed my hotel to renaissance for 20th June. 
25092 Wonderful stay! Service is excellent and location is unbeatable. The restaurant White Oak offers a wide range of healthy alternatives without being boring. The gym is also very accessible and extremely clean. I will definitively return for a stay here. 
25093 This hotel has nice rooms that are small but nicely appointed. The staff was very friendly and the hotel restaurant was good too. On my next business trip to Houston, I will stay here again. Great job to Magideh and her colleagues. 
25094 Wow! Wow! Wow! When I made my reservation I told them it was my daughters 13th Birthday. The people could not have treated us better, They upgraded us to the Crowne Suite, It was the nicest room we had ever stayed in. Definitely a memory she will have to lifetime 
25095 The Marriott delivers in the this busy part of nyc. Centrally located with helpful staff, will return again. 
25096 We wanted to stay close to Navy Pier, the Architectural River Tour, and pay a reasonable price, this worked for us. 
25097 This hotel is close to every important place in manhattan. Hotel itself is ok, nothing special, but its price and location gives him advantage over other hotels with better quality and worse position. Rooms are clean, brekfast not to good. You have free internet corner in lobby. 
25098 We stayed in an executive city suite 
25099 The living space was perfect with huge windows and plenty of space 
25100 Loved the luxury ! The staff on the front desk and the doormen were a credit to the hotel 
25101 I hope we'll be back 
25102 Stayed here for a city break in NYC. Staff were very nice. Rooms werent exactly big, but very clean and comfortable and a great nights sleep. Location is brilliant. A 2 minute walk from Empire State and Grand Central and about 5 to Times Square 
25103 Our group stayed here and it was really great! Great rooms and great shopping! 
25104 Being a Starwood Employee myself, I knew to have high expectations for this property. I was treated like Royalty (despite having gotten a great rate). Everything was pristine and the beds very comfortable. Two showerheads!! I was astounded with all aspects of this place, especially the people working there.... 
25105 A comfortable, clean, basic hotel. The location is great and the staff were very friendly. Would stay again if I wanted the Tribeca area. 
25106 A place to avoid. Had to ask for washclothes, never figured out how to control the temperature, no blanket in room (there was a heat wave the week before, and maybe they took the blankets out?). I should have stayed in Jersey. 
25107 Perfect location and appropriate price. Discovered a great French restaurant over the road, pascolos (spelling wring!). Reception and concierge very helpful! A/C is very noisy so in hotter months that could be a problem choosing whether or not to run it overnight. 
25108 What a great job. This will forever be my favorite hotel in Houston. The staff is always professional and goes beyond the call of duty to make my stay pleasurable. The rooms always exceed my expectations on cleanliness. Thanks to the Management and Staff for all the hard work. 
25109 I'm something of a regular at this elegant hotel. Large enough to have all the amenities I seek (executive lounge, nice work room, lobby bar, in-room internet) and yet small enough to feel personal. The location is terrific for doing business in the loop. 
25110 Enjoyed our stay! Got walked from another hotel and were pleased. More space in room than I expected for NYC hotel room. Very comfortable beds and pillows. Beautiful marble in bathroom. Breakfast the following morning met expectations and had very friendly service. Overall, clean and great value for the price. 
25111 The service and emploers were so nice...The rooftop was awesome........The rooms were very clean and set up totally....... 
25112 This hotel actually spoilt us, attention to detail and one of the best nights sleep we've ever had. Excellent facilities and all the staff couldn't help enough. Would stay here every might if we could. 
25113 We had a Nice stay here. There was construction going on at The time of our stay so The rooms were noisy during the day. Otherwise a wonderful time at this hotel. 
25114 WE just spent 5 days at the Savoy. Great location! close to subways, walking distance to Time Square. Lots to do all around the neighborhood. Simple, clean and reasonable hotel. I stayed here a few years back for 2 nights, and I would stay again. 
25115 Good rooms, lovely staff, great location... the only small but is the breakfast... Here some improvment can be done. 
25116 Very convenient location within walking distance of all attractions. 
25117 Booked thru Priceline...great rate. Stayed on a Saturday nite for the Houston Rodeo. Easy to get to...probably 20 restaurants within 1 mile...CVS pharmacy close by. Free breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, waffles, coffee, juice and a LOT of other food. Very clean...very enjoyable! 
25118 My stay at the hotel was nothing but spectacular. Besides being a brand new facility, the service was prompt, the rooms were impeccable and the location was perfect. It was a perfect blend of posh class with efficient leisure. My girlfriend and I would highly recommend this hotel. 
25119 I was staying with friends, we got the room of the convience, the room was disgusting. Almost like no ever cleaned it when we checked into it. Filled with little cockroaches, spiders. 
25120 This hotel has a great location, has very high standards of comfort and cleanliness. Loved staying there and would recommend it to everybody. 
25121 We stayed here our first night in New York and it was wonderful. The room was clean...we had more than enough hot water for showers...the staff were friendly and I would absolutely stay here again! 
25122 We could not have picked a better place to stay in NYC!! Super close to Central Park. Short walk to Times Square and Theater District. Wonderful staff, and yes, Victoria is as great as other reviewers have made her sound. :) We will certainly be back!! 
25123 The rate was quite low and the rooms were very surprising! Nice new paint, clean, bathrooms were larger than most... The windows facing 23rd St were rather large. I liked the artwork in the room. Subway is across the street. I felt safe as well. I would stay here again. 
25124 The towers room was the best deal from expedia and super worth it. I have never seen a room this big with this view in NY and ive stayed at many hotels. Location fab. 
25125 Fantastic lobby, really sets the tone for the hotel. We mentioned it was our honeymoon when checking in and the guy at reception upgraded us to a superior room. Great location as well, just off Times Square. Will definitely stay here again. 
25126 Wish they had advertised they are smoking rooms, but we could tolerate, others might not. 
25127 Absolutely beautiful spot to stay! Right in the middle of Times Square, close to all Broadway shows etc. Staff was extremely attentive and polite. Plan to revisit next year! 
25128 If you are looking for a romantic stay in NYC, this is the place. Beautifully appointed, comfortable and convenient, you will not find an equal. The hotel is right near Chelsea and the art galleries and restaurants, and a short hop to the Theatre District. 
25129 Favoloso hotel cn vista grandiosa di New York,personale disponibile e abbastanza qualificato specialmente Robert che e stato molto disponibile ad aiutarci in tutto,ma anche tutto lo staff non e stato da meno,un bellissimo hotel nulla da ridire solo cose buone! 
25130 Great prices, great ambiance and all the allure of a boutique hotel. 
25131 OK, it may not be the Hilton or the Westin but the rooms are clean, airconditioning is working and the hotel is ideally located in the centre of NYC. Would definitely go there again on my next visit to New York 
25132 Location: great. Drinks / cocktail lounge: great but could get quite crowded. excellent vibe. Rooms: typical NYC size but very comfy. 
25133 This hotel is European style with small rooms good service good location on Lower East Side and a little pricey ($350/night). All European guests. Next to Seond Ave subway stop and the wonderful Katz' deli. It's a short walk to great restaurants and shopping in Soho or the East Village. 
25134 Long line at check in, but most of the staff was very nice and helpful. Our suite was pretty tiny but clean. The beds were comfortable, but the towels were small and thin. Nice view. Didnt appreciate the duct tape holding up the wall paper in our hall. 
25135 Clean and comfortable, although the rooms are small and the bathrooms tiny. This is NYC but even small for NYC. Easy walk to multiple subway stations and attractions. Elevators are painfully slow when the hotel is crowded, so I am giving it a three. 
25136 Had a great 5 night stay.booked a basic room and it was comfortable and very well appointed. Made a very special base to explore this great city. Well worth the extra dollars 
25137 I stayed at sohotel and i was saprized for the high cleanness of the hotel polite staff. Great location recently renovated hotel you get a high value for your money. I would highly recomend this hotel for anyone staying in the city. 
25138 The hotel is conveniently located in downtown Chicago. It is about a 15-20 minute walk from Millenium Park and Michigan Avenue. The room was very clean. 
25139 We found bed bugs on our second morning here...We were not charged for our room but one week later I am covered with bed bugbites... We were told they haven't had a complaint of bed bugs for over 1 year. 
25140 Another wonderful stay at the Park Central - superb room as requested to the social media team there who made it happen and the use of the hotel limo to take us to the airport. We'll be back 
25141 Very nice hotel, absolutely great location, and large rooms, specially by NY standards! Would definitely stay here again. 
25142 I have stayed here many times (over fifty) on business, and have never had a bad experience. If you have a special request and plan ahead, they always do the best they possibly can. In my opinion, the Sofitel New York is as good as it gets... 
25143 Great location, immaculately clean room if a little small, wonderful bed, bathroom & fittings, plasma TV, internet access, very friendly & helpful staff & exceptionally quiet at all times even when fully booked. 
25144 The service at this location is amazing!! Business travel is a great experience when staying at the Westin!!! 
25145 The hotel itself is nice but not as nice as other W Hotels because its older. The views are awesome. The staff is awesome as well. Especially Trevell the living room attendant, she is down to earth and very helpful. She is your go to girl for sure. 
25146 The staff were very friendly and the location was perfect. Thanks so much for making it so easy to find a great place to rest my head for a night! 
25147 The hotel being right in front f the Library, it is very conveniently located for a short stay in town. We stayed in a twin room which was massive, and our only criticism would be the lack of storage space. All the rest was brilliant! 
25148 I've gone with friends and family. Each visit has been a positive one. Aside from the rooms being efficiently roomy the staff make this hotel an oasis of serenity. They are warm, pleasant and helpful. Oh and by the way the price is right. GO and Enjoy. 
25149 Great location within walking distance from business on Park Avenue and walking to Grand Central Station. Great choice of bars and restaurants in street. Rooms smallish but creatively outfitted. No daylight. Free Wifi. Fancy francofile restaurant for b/f and other meals. 
25150 Boils down to incredibly friendly, genuine staff. The guest service representative was particularly helpful in locating restaurants. Couldn't beat the price. Parking was reasonable, compared to other local hotels, and it's close to everything. 
25151 We really liked staying at this hotel. The beds were blissfully comfortable, everything in the bedroom and bathroom worked, all the staff were extremely friendly and obliging, and just a hop from Grand Central. Adjoining Irish pub offered high quality tradiional Irish food. 
25152 Great service at reception (Purunima was very kind and efficient) - rooms spacy and well conceived - Housekeeping equally kind and efficient - will definitely use this Hotel again. Main Hall a little dark for my taste. Very much appreciated our stay with you. 
25153 A great location, friendly staff, nice rooms, bit small but good use of space, quiet, free-wifi and breakfast included made it a bargain. The staff were welcoming too. Enjoyed it a lot, would stay here again I think! 
25154 Location, w38th street, near 8th avenue.............better impossible, low fare for a small clean room with private bath, nice staff...........everything a needed on my 7-day trip to nyc, saving a hundred dollars a day in comparison with the other hotels of that area. Probably I'll be there again. 
25155 Stayed at the Bowery after a convention at Times Square - What a great stay - wonderful room, incredible view and the staff was very friendly and helpful! 
25156 Well maintained property. Great location for a golfing trip as there is lots of good courses within driving distance. Lots of restaurants within walking distance. Front Desk service was a little down but I think it was because it was so quiet when I was there. 
25157 Situato di fronte al lato sud di Central Park e vicinissimo alla 5th avenue. Hotel molto bello, pulito, camere spaziose, personale gentile. Unica nota negativa Wifi a 9,95 doll. usa ogni 24 ore utilizzabile solo nelle camere. Business center a pagamento. 
25158 This was a good hotel overall but had some issues with staffing after 10pm and before 5am. Housekeeping was slow but did a good job once they arrived. For business the amenities were good and always available. 
25159 Nicely decorated hotel and staffed with excellent employees. The rooms feature many light modification functions. Great views on the upper floors. The food catering by the restaurant kitchen is also excellent. ik and JJ iljalon@aol.com 
25160 Excellent location, lovely and clean rooms, helpful and friendly staff 
25161 ottimo albergo, buon servizio. camere ampie, forse poco luminose. ottima posizione, prossima a fermate di bus e metro. zona tranquilla. un po' di "puzza di ristorante" nella zona, ma per via dei vari ristoranti presenti. 
25162 Our stay was for 2 nights and when we checked in, they upgraded us to a junior suite without us asking. It's a great location and the staff is very friendly and helpful. The room was immaculate with nice amenities. 
25163 This hotel is in a great location 2 blocks from Grand Central station. The service was very good and I was impressed with how quiet it was. The room was spacious and very clean. 
25164 Hotel was located right in Time Square. Great size rooms. Very clean. Restaurants. bars. Starbucks all located inside. Would recommend this hotel to anyone visting the Big Apple. 
25165 Cheesy room, dirty carpet, no elevator, only provide shuttle service to the hospital. The pool looks like something you don't want to get in. 
25166 Around the corner of Times Square in 49th Street. Subway near the hotel. Perfect for a New York trip. Nice rooms and a friendly staff. Best is you book a suite with two rooms, because the standard rooms are small. I stayed in suite room 912. 
25167 The premier is a boutique hotel within the Millenium Broadway. We were upgraded from teh Millenium and let me say we were delighted to be so. THe concierge service is second to none. Great rooms, decent size. Good evening reception and breakfast. Highly recommend 
25168 We stayed at this hotel in November and are returning next week. A great location with really nice rooms. The bar hops at happy hour. We had breakfast at their restaurant and it was great. 
25169 On my first trip to NYC, we stayed at the Michelangelo. The service was great and the room was nice and comfortable. The location also can't be beat! I highly recommend this hotel!!! 
25170 Close to Broadway; Central Park; St. Patricks; Rockefeller Center--this is where you want to be. Not a bargain, but not a ripoff. Nice staff. Good gym. Lots of international visitors. 
25171 Excellent rapport qualite/prix. A 2 pas de l'Empire State. Salle de bains commune tres propre. Cafe Cosi au coin de Park Av pour le petit dej. Seul bemol : climatisation exterieure bruyante. 
25172 We chose, and paid for, one of the larger rooms. Good location; and good accommodation by New York standards. 
25173 un ottimo hotel in posizione strategica,siete vicinissimi alla fermata metro di canal street e potete arrivare a piedi, in pochissimo tempo a soho e chinatown.servizio eccellente e personale disponibile.da consigliare. 
25174 I stayed one night. Good location, enough space, nothing special but this should be a better end as a hotel in NY. 
25175 We returned to On The Ave for another stay and were equally satisfied as our first time. The room was clean; we got a room off the street so it was quiet. I've already made reservations there for a future trip to NYC. 
25176 Great budget hotel - completely refurbished. Shared bathrooms but they were excellent with great overhead showers. Rooms with flatscreen tv & ipod docking speaker things, hairdryers - basic but superb value for money 
25177 Nothing outstanding about the rooms, small but the location, value, breakfast, NYC....all made it a great choice. The staff are top notch, some of the best I have met. Location is everything here and you are right in mid town Manhattan, two blocks from the Garden. Great Breakfast too!! 
25178 I loved this hotel. Very convenient to Time Square, restaurants and theaters. Beautiful, small, luxurious hotel. The staff is friendly and accommodating. The beds are very comfortable and the linens great. 
25179 Does this seem a little strange? Room was very nice and the $75 winning bid on Priceline was reasonable, but I have never paid $50 for parking and I stay at various hotels in downtown Chicago often. 
25180 Very comfy beds, great breakfast Buffett, wine in the late afternoon, and delicious cookies at bedtime too! Beautiful place, friendly helpful staff. Great location--I could walk to the convention center in just 12 minutes. 
25181 it was a perfect central location(!!) but as I expected: it costs silence and some sleep, but the hotel was clean& the staff was very friendly, so always again! 
25182 New York is a great city and the hotel Ameritania was the right choice: strategically located near Times Square. The guys at the hotel were all extremely courteous and willing to help, especially Jalal 
25183 bueno...aunque prefiero vivir en Brooklyn alquilando depto y cruzar por el bridge todos los dias... 
25184 great rooms, although could do with a spruce up, but guests are totally anonymous, which is a little boring. try to stay somewhere smaller in ny if you can. 
25185 Hotel promised renovated rooms, but that's not the same as painting old tiles... Grimy looking bathroom and old carpet gave a worn-down feeling. The in-room blow-dryer caught fire... Hotel had a central location and the maid did a good job, but wouldn't recommend the hotel. 
25186 Not the best value for my money but very convenient to downtown and blue line. Takes 10 min walk to Willis Tower and steps away from blue line Clinton exit! Friendly staff, quick service when I requested extra remote. Lots of television channels and food on site! 
25187 Had a great time. Very Clean!! What more can I say? I highly recommend 
25188 Very nice hotel located in the financial district of NYC. Easy to find, would stay there again. Beds were exceptionally comfortable. 
25189 Rien a redire sauf peut etre le bruit mais c'est New York donc normal 
25190 this hotel has a fantastic location which is very central. The staff were great and the view of the Empire State building was breathtaking 
25191 Hotel con una posizione centralissima, e comoda. Le camere non sono tanto grandi, ma sono pulite e con tutti i confort. Personale gentile e disponibile. Consiglio il bar dell'albergo per un buon aperitivo, atmosfera soft e tipica americana. 
25192 We stayed at this hotel based upon my travel agent's advice. It couldn't have been a more pleasant experience. It was reasonably priced by New York standards, well located and the service was exceptional. I was particularly grateful for the restaurant suggestions from the concierge. 
25193 Verzorgd ontbijt.Nette kamers.Gebruik de minibar en bar van het hotel niet te duur. Wij kochten drank aan de overkant van het hotel in een supermarkt. 
25194 Enjoyed staying here, was close to everything - empire state, madison square, times square. Room was excellent and staff were really friendly and helpful. Will be staying here again in the future! 
25195 I come to NY regularly for business, and the Chandler has been my preferred hotel for the past six years. Amazing staff, wonderful beds, luxurious towels and toiletries, and hot coffee round the clock. 
25196 especially all the staff members were very friendly people who tried to help me with whatever they can. comfort in is going to be my first choice in my next visit to ny. 
25197 If... you are comfortable in a bat cave atmosphere, and are not concerned with dark gloomy grungy corridors leading to the rooms, are under 5'6" slender. with no physical disabilities you could fit into the cabin/room and possibly enjoy your stay 
25198 Very nice boutique hotel that worth the price .Close to Time Square and to Broadway 
25199 Our regular room was very good and neat with a very comfortable bed and well equipped bath room 
25200 Had an unexpected over-night in Houston and booked this place for the rate. At half the cost of comparable mid-range chains, this property was great! 
25201 We found the staff to be very accomodating, the rooms clean and comfortable and the bed very comfortable after a long day of baseball games and shopping. 
25202 staff worked hard to give us the best service. All day u saw staff cleaning and our room was lovely to come back too after it has been freshly cleaned daily. We enjoyed the breakfast. We will be back Grace. Thank u :) 
25203 great location in midtown east, close to all must-see landmarks. friendly staff, spacey rooms and the most comfortable beds ever! 
25204 Excellant hotel to capture the Times Sq. experience. The recent remodel makes for a comfortable and trendy designs. The staff was very helpful and knowledgable. Pricey, but well worth the cost. 
25205 ... we have found our home away from home ... truly a remarkable wonderful place to enjoy while visiting the city ... just remember to ask for a "room with a view" 
25206 Great hotel at super location. Nice value. Good for extended stay. I will return to this hotel. The staff was friendly. Nice neighborhood. Room had small kitchen grocery store is less than 1 block with many food options 
25207 Great overall experience, we always enjoy staying at W's all over the world... 
25208 Recently stayed here, travel to NY frequently and this hotel surpassed all expectations. From the speed and efficiency of check in to the fantastic room and the superb location, everything was set up for a wonderful stay. The staff in particular were very professional and friendly. Definitely returning. 
25209 Great place to stay a excellent value for your money. Close to manhattan and there were a lot of places in the immediate area to eat and party. The public transportation is very close also I will recommend this place all my friends!!! 
25210 They have done a lot of work and replaced a lot of old equipment. So much better and nicer than it was. They still have work to do, but it is so nice to see that the owners are investing money into this property. Much cleaner. 
25211 Stayed 2 nights for a mini-honeymoon. It is in a great location; we could see Radio City Music Hall and St. Patricks Cathedral from the room! Just a few blocks from the subway, walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, etc. I would definately stay agaiin. 
25212 The reception staff were a bit difficult to communicate with, just didn't seem that bothered. Room was fine, small but enough room for 2 with suitcases! Location was good, easy yo get to Central Park and Times square. 
25213 Wish that room service didn't close at midnight. The free breakfast in the concierge lounge is pretty lousy and there's no expresso. The Internet was nice and fast (though not free for all guests). Would recommend 
25214 Nice room decor and clean. Breakfast can get crowded. Tip--go early! Did not care for the construction noise on a Saturday morning. But this hotel was very well located (close to Michigan Ave) and all staff were pleasant to deal with. We'd go back. 
25215 Rooms are small but clean and modern. No privacy as the bathroom only has a curtain from the bedroom. Decent location. Would stay again. Cool bed! No room service and the galley is pretty limited. New York is competitive within the hotel space...could probably get more for your money elsewhere. 
25216 Stayed one week at Affinia Shelburne NY. Room was spacious and clean, staff was very helpful and location central on Manhattan. 
25217 It is a motel but it is clean and the help is very friendly so I give it an above average rating. We stay there everytime we go to Chicago. We would rather spend our money on food and fun than an overpriced room in Downtown Chicago. 
25218 Perfect location, good value, wide bedroom, I would recommend!!! 
25219 huge rooms for a midtown manhattan hotel. Comfy bed, nice amenities, friendly staff. Good value for the money, too, and you can't beat the location. 
25220 Don't stay here unless you are willing to pay $14.02 for very slow internet access. Even being a member of the Marriot Rewards program doesn't help. I've NEVER had to pay for internet access at a Marriot property before. I will never stay at a Renaissance Hotel again. 
25221 Frankly one of the best hotels we have stayed in. Everything from the service, room, personal touches...... A really wonderful stay. 
25222 I love the location of this hotel, Friday night is fun and one can walk to various restaurants and bars. The rooms are spacious, and modern, very clean. But furniture looks a bit flimsy. Breakfast is great, lovely pastries and fresh fruit. 
25223 Positive aspects: -The location could not be better. -Rooms are small, but this is customary in NYC. -The S.T.A.R. manager (concierge) was very helpful. Less positive/negative: -Rooftop bar very noisy (especially if your room is located on the 8th floor...) -Breakfast poor 
25224 A fabulous night in this well appointed and lovely hotel. The room amenities were excellent and the room service breakfast one of the best I have enjoyed in a hotel ever. Not cheap but worth it if you can afford it. 
25225 The hotel made the trip 
25226 It was recommended by friends ....service was excellent and prompt. I highly recommend it 
25227 People are courteous but had a problem with credit billing. They credited it twice to my credit card and then another to another card. I hope they get improved on this major aspect of handling their transactions. 
25228 The service was excellent. The room was clean and neat. The location is very accessable to downtown and surrounding areas. The shuttle bus srevice was the best I have ever encountered. 
25229 Great place to stay. Good location, close to bus line and trolley to Pier. Quiet, clean roomy. 
25230 Very central to everything in New York, room was small with a small double bed but adequate. The rooms were very clean with room service daily. Breakfast buffet style, tea, coffee, bagels, toast etc., was very nice. Restaurant / bar opposite and adjacent to hotel both nice. Overall great hotel. 
25231 Excellent staff with great attitudes and willing to attend to all concerns. Concerns are addressed and corrected immediately. Free breakfast excellent. Great location with easy access to subway system if coming from JFK. Computer available for use. Great and will book again!!! 
25232 tened cuidado porque no te avisan que en tu habitacion a parte de las personas tambien duermen tantas cucarachas como el hotel quieran 
25233 I stayed in here for business for a few days and was extremely comfortable. My room was a suite which was basically like a one bedroom apartment. Very nice. 
25234 I only wish that all our hotels in America were even 70% as good as the SWISSOTEL we would have been overjoyed, after saveing for the holiday of a life time the SWISSOTEL lifted our expectations so very high pity the others didnnt 
25235 This was one of my most relaxing vacations in years. If I had to recommend only one hotel in would be the Affinia Gardens. Great Staff nice reception hour and excellent service. I will be telling all of my friends about the Gardens. Keep up the good work. 
25236 rooms are nice and clean, location is pretty central. however if someone in the next room leaves there door open, then the noise seeps easily through. cleaners start early, 8/9am, therefore more noise and no lie ins. 
25237 Small room (we've had larger on a cruise ship...) but the service and location are great - literally right off Times Square. Price was fair for the location. Staff was very accommodating and courteous. 
25238 After coming from a bad hotel in another state, this hotel was refreshing. Clean and surprisingly friendly cleaning staff, small but well thought-out rooms with everything that you need. Great showers. Quiet even tho near Times Square 
25239 Rather good hotel. No complemetary breakfast. Front desk staff OK Slow elevator. One of two elevators out of order 
25240 A fabulous hotel, beautifully presented, a step back in time to an era of luxury and style. Helpful, pleasant staff, delicious food, central to everything and a lovely retreat from the bustling, lively city f New York, 
25241 The InterContinental Barclay hotel is beautiful! I visited this hotel for a birthday trip to New York. The room was comfortable and clean. The beds were hard to get out of in the morning. The location is great! I will definitely return again. 
25242 Excellent hotel, we ask for 2 beds when we got to the hotel and they happily complied. The room was clean and served us well. The location is excellent in the middle of the theaters and great restaurants 
25243 Het Kitano hotel is een keurig, schoon en rustig hotel maar ook wel een beetje karakterloos. Maar dat is wellicht persoonlijke smaak. De douchekranen zijn trouwens wel gebruiksonvriendelijk. Maar als je het eindelijk snapt, is het fijn douchen. Ook de tv is wat moeilijk om te bedienen. 
25244 very good location,rooms a bit dated but spotless ! clean bathroom and beds,staff were all helpfull,would stay here again. 
25245 very nice staff all very helpful - clean rooms and comfortable beds - ask them to show you the way to the 'Chez Lounge' bar it's a walk away or the 'Big Easy' a drive away - great places for a beer, live music and meet nice Texan folk! 
25246 Better location than I first imagined. Helpful staff. Great dining at the hotel. Rooms were great and even included HERMES bath products. A couple suggestions, the hotel hallways smelled a bit strange (I was not the only one who noticed), and the restrurant was very, very fancy. Overall great hotel! 
25247 i absolutly recommend this hotel if you want to fell yourself very comfortable and quiet even if you have your kids with you. Comfortable,clean and big rooms.Very close to area attractions,Disney store,Toys r us and etc. 
25248 Great hotel in the middle of midtown. Great value and ok sized rooms. Continental breakfast in the best ive had in a budget inn! Look for Antonio doing breakfast, he will look after you. All in all a great place to stay in NYC. Would stay there again. 
25249 the waldorf is not all cracked up to be. the rooms are small unless you you pay more the Bill Gates makes in a year. and service is poor however just to be in the presence of presidents and the queen makes it worth 4 stars. 
25250 What a fabulous hotel...ultra chic, ultra modern, ultra amenities! The Ink has become my home away from home in Manhattan. 
25251 Stayed one night to explore the city before leaving for Rome, Italy. The room did not have a window but only a curtain, but it was very nicely decorated and a good size for the city. Price was very expensive, but that is New York. 
25252 excellent service. clean rooms. helpful staff. always stay at this hotel on all our trips to New York. My husband and i along with our teenage children will not stay at any other hotel. 
25253 Great location, close to central park and Museum of Natural History. Room was a bit on the small side (even for New York), but clean and tidy. Service was good, easy check in / out process. Definately recommend for upper west side. 
25254 Stayed before and will return. Central location, basic but excellent value. Staff attentive. 
25255 Excellent Hotel, with great staff - was filled with suits but we felt very comfortable wandering around in jeans and backpack. Totally modern with amazing rooms - not the best bathrooms i've seen in a hotel but definitely the best bedroom. 
25256 We had the pleasure of staying at the Hilton during the Chicago Blizzard of 2011. The hotel was well prepared and the staff handled problems created by the blizzard without a blip. The room was well kept and the facilities are quite good. 
25257 War jetzt schon einige Male in New York und bis jetzt hat mir das Novotel Time Square am besten gefallen 
25258 TOP Lage direkt am Time Square 
25259 Sauberes modernes Zimmer ! Freundliches Personal ! Gratis Internetstation in der Lobby Wirklich weiter zu empfehlen 
25260 Front desk was very efficient and friendly. They were knowledgable and helpful to us with directions to area attractions. 
25261 This hotel is right in the heart of SOHO. Is very nice and has awesome staff. I was there an entire week and it was very comfortable. 
25262 If you want to have a blend of heritage and modernity....Waldorf-Astoria is a place to be in. Never you see both of these blending with so much ease. There are tons of stories and anecdotes on Waldorf. Ensure that you take a guided tour of the hotel. 
25263 We were pleasantly surpirsed at the great boutique hotel at a great price when we landed at the Hotel at Times Square in NYC. Breakfast included in the price, located near several excellent restaurants with attractive lobby and rooms. Our kids loved it and so did we. 
25264 It was very clean and the beds where comfy it was brilliant how you could borrow a DVD from reception they where very helpful at reception also there was a place where you could buy snacks & drinks. Also the rooms where nice and and a bit like an apartment. 
25265 had a wonderful experience at the w chicago lakeshore. the hotel is hip and perfectly located! the restaurant serves excellent breakfasts. and the hotel conference staff was superb-- making sure every detail of our meeting was taken care of! 
25266 The Comfort Inn on Ludlow Street was convenient, clean rooms with excellent service., I especially enjoyed the DECK on the 7th floor, with its terrific views of the city.Will definetly stay there again. 
25267 everything was great, I visited the website and read reviews before going, and I would like to say everyone has their own opinion due to their personality. I had a pleasent stay and I would go back there again. 
25268 The worst hotel I have ever stayed at. Absolutely horrible. Small and unclean rooms, beaten up hallways and an overall neglected appearance. I would never stay there again. It is a One Star at very best!!!! 
25269 The staff was very friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. This location is close to many city highlights and has easy access to the subway. The room was much larger than I expected, easily accomodating our family with two teenage boys. 
25270 great space, staff and location. great value. stayed there for 1 night on business. very comfortable space and location. 
25271 This hotel was great. Clean, Beautiful, quiet, great service, located feet from Times Square. Served wine, cheese and crackers in the evenings. I can't imagine anyone not being satisfied with this hotel. 
25272 Newly rennovated. Located 100m from times square. Good gym - new equipment. Brian is NY's finest doorman! 
25273 I have stayed at the Sun Suites for several months and they have always been very friendly and the property has been very clean. Maid Service is very good. Duane Stephens 
25274 Hotel convenient for subway station on line downtown. Hotel had bedroom, bathroom, living area with kitchenette (fridge, cooker, sink plus utensils) Ideal for 3 night stay in NY with Fairways supermarket over the road and many restaurants nearby. We particularly liked Josie's restaurant. Hotel staff friendly and fairly helpful. 
25275 one of the best hotels i stayed in,Stunning room, amazing price and great staff :) with special mention of Ismael at the reception, Thank you Ismael for being so helpful 
25276 Beautiful hotel!!! Clean, modern, and great views of NYC. Would stay here again. 
25277 This hotel was close to Chinatown, Little Italy and obviously, the Lower East Side. It was clean, had free breakfast and staff was helpful and friendly. Will stay here again. Room was smallish but quiet and had all amenities we needed...coffee, clean, newspaper daily, frig, iron etc 
25278 The location was perfect. Rooms and corridors were quite worn out, but the reception was great. Hotel is very expensive. We've had nice trip! 
25279 Close to IAH. No shuttle after late PM so we took a cab and the fare was reasonable. Night manager checked us in after midnight. Very friendly and helpful! We will stay there again on our way through Houston! 
25280 We stayed here for 5 nights and the location was good, the rooms small and the service ok. Nothing special, nothing to complain about but nothing to praise either. 
25281 I stayed at the Hotel Mela on business Sept. 26-28. It was a great choice - new, clean, modern, great amenities (H2O products), fantastic location. I would definitely stay here again. The hotel staff also went out of its way to accommodate. Great shopping and food nearby as well. 
25282 Great hotel, would definately recommend. rooms are very modern and on the large side considering its NYC. location was perfect, 50m from 34th St Subway and only a 10min walk to Times Square. Overall Fantastic and would recommend to anyone looking at going to NYC 
25283 Found a great deal in the hotel's website for thanksgiving. Rooms were spacious, good amenities, great location! Would recommend and definetly go back. 
25284 Clean, comfortable and a great position in the city. The HSH was perfect for our short stay in NY. Highly recommended. 
25285 This price is affordable in the middle of Manhattan. 
25286 We had a marvelous time at the hotel. The fitness club is fantastic. I loved the cucumber water they provided. 
25287 I live in England but spend months on and off in Houston on business. My wife and I always stay at the Hilton Post Oak as our home from home. The staff are courteous, friendly and always very helpful. Highly recommended ! 
25288 Anno 2005. Vacanza fantastica. Le persone sono stupende ed il motel molto bello con tanto di piscina e idromassaggio. Vorrei viverci!!!!!!! 
25289 nice hotel in perfect lcoation. fair price for NYC and the best beds ever! 
25290 I'd never stay anyplace else - location and rooms are amazing! The service is incredible - they really go out of their way to make your stay the best it could be. Donald did it right :) 
25291 Hotel was clean--staff was friendly. Accommadations were average, nothing fancy. The kitchen was stocked better than expected. The continental breakfast was average at best. Probably would not stay again because a little over priced. 
25292 My kids enjoy staying in Times Square when we go to NYC. This place was friendly (yes!! can you believe it???--from the inquiring phone call to the front desk, to the bell men), clean, convenient and affordable!! I am definitely coming back!! 
25293 Great accomodations. Personal service. Comes with NY Times and a morning drink. Bed is very comfortable. Large bathroom. Close to Times Square. Great location. 
25294 Great location just off Michigan Avenue; very friendly and helpful staff; clean room and bath but both were very, very tiny; thin walls, could hear conversations in the hall. Great rooftop lounge! 
25295 Hotel is al wat ouder maar alles is er in orde. Kamers zijn net ruim genoeg en worden zeer goed onderhouden. Zeer vriendelijke service. Ontbijt is ok met redelijk wat keuze, geen hartig beleg. 
25296 Bad room. floor dirty and not level at bathroom floor. Bed spread looked dirty. Marks on wall. Mold around tub and shower area. Soap dish appears to be falling off wall. Not what I expect from a LaQuinta. 
25297 Good Hotel in Excellant Location. Special mention to the concierge Mauren who was very pleasant and helpful 
25298 ok rooms, nothing special. Very friendly staff, but somehow not really present. Had the impression they were just friendly as it is part of their goals and targets. Nice bar, not sure about the restaurant. Had not enough time to visit it. 
25299 Beautiful hotel in the perfect location at Christmas with dining, shopping so near. Highlight was the staff, particularly Derron who greeted us with such a welcoming smile. So knowledgeable and helpful, which is rare and delightful in this bustling city! 
25300 This boutique hotel is small, but clean and well maintained. It's not cheap and the rooms are qutie small, like most other NYC accommodations. I've stayed at this hotel 4-5 times.... 
25301 Stayed here for a week in March 2012, staff were friendly and helpful! Clean and comfy bed and great shower, all you need after a day taking in NYC!! The free breafast was a convienience and good but sometimes a little busy. Would definately go back! 
25302 HOTEL MOLTO BELLO SOPRATTUTTO PER LA POSIZIONE, AL CENTRO DI NEW YORK, PERSONALE GENTILE E DISPONIBILE, VICINO ALLE FERMATE DELLA METRO E ALLE MAGGIORI ATTRAZIONI TURISTICHE. SE DOVESSI TORNARE A NEW YORK SOGGIORNEREI DI NUOVI LI'. 
25303 a bit away from the main attractions such as times square, midtown in general. Breakfast very crowdy, not diversified enough. Very effective internet connexion. rooms a bit small but clean & quiet. 
25304 May not have been the best hotel that we've stayed in, but being within walking distance of everything was worth the stay. We were only in the hotel to sleep & shower. The bed was hard, but we slept well after a long day of touring NYC. 
25305 We were especially pleased with the friendly, accommodating staff and the fact that even though we were in the middle of everything, the street noise was minimal. We might choose a package that includes breakfast the next trip, because the restaurant was quite good. 
25306 Fantastica posizione, comodo per raggiungere un po' tutto a Manhattan. Servizi ineccepibili e cortesia costante, con attenzione ad ogni particolare. Ottimo davvero. Da segnalare anche il ristorante "Ai fiori", al primo piano, davvero di livello, con piatti ricercati, ma sempre intriganti nei sapori. Nel complesso ottimo, esperienza da ripetere certamente. 
25307 stayed for a week, decent and clean, free internet in the rooms, large bed but tiny room, in a nutshell it is a simple nice boutique hotel in the heart of manhattan. not sure about the price as i was in a work trip. 
25308 We really enjoy our stay in this hotel. The service was excellent, room was small but very comfortable. Very nice bedding and towels. The room was attractive. We would stay there again. We came with two other couples and we all agreed that we loved this hotel. 
25309 This hotel offers great service from the bellmen, to the front desk, the business center to the restaurant (West Branch). I am relocating to this area of Manhattan and staying at On The Avenue gave me a great preview of the neighborhood feel of the UWS. 
25310 A special thanks to Kurt for responding to concerns of my wife. Great hotel, personel, service and location. 
25311 Good hotel, nice location, near Central Park. But the rooms are very small and noisy and the bed isn't great. Very nice sushi restaurant close by! 
25312 It's cool, edgy, in SoHo, lovely and good-looking staff... No wonder why after 14 years this is still THE hotel to stay in downtown. 
25313 great staff and security...!!! great room value!! however for advertising blackout curtains... why dont they close all the way!!! 15.00 for WIIFII daily... meh. 
25314 Loved this place!! Great location and the most beautiful bar/lounge ever! 
25315 Hotel in posizione comoda vicino a central park; sono raggiungibili a piedi il museo di storia naturale e il metropolitan. Vicina anche la metropolita. Camere spaziose, bagno un po' piccolo. Condizionatore molto rumoroso. 
25316 abbiamo prenotato con anticipo e strappato una ottima tariffa. Ottima anche la posizione, nei pressi di Time Square. 
25317 Stayed at the Marriot Downtown for a great weekend wedding. The staff was wonderful. Got a room to check into right away even though we arrived very early. The conceirge was great and helped with flowers for our brother to mark the special occasion. 
25318 Excelent location, right beside a subway station, and every time you enter the hotel, you can grab a fresh and delicious chocolate cookie!!! 
25319 The hotel penn was clean comfortable and was not what we expected for a 2 star, will stay again next year definately lovely.x 
25320 Check in was smooth and front desk person was beyond helpful. Beautiful room. My daughter lost her wedding rings and they were returned by housekeeping. The location is prime. Construction was ongoing but entrance had been moved to prevent a.y problems from it. Great views. 
25321 We stayed here for a long weekend in September 2012 and it was perfect. Clean, comfortable, great location and the hotel staff could not be friendlier. It's just a few blocks west of SoHo, an easy walk to the Village or Meatpacking district and an easy taxi ride to TriBeCa. 
25322 I thought the hotel was great, it was very clean, the staff was attentive and very professional as well as helpful as it was my first time staying at this hotel 
25323 Very good location close to metro and good for shopping. Breakfast is also good. I like everything in this hotel. I recommend to everybody. 
25324 We stayed here for the Memorial Day Weekend and the hotel is located at walking distance of everything. The staff is excellent, the rooms are clean. Breakfast is very good! I will definitely stay here again and will recommended to friends and family 
25325 The suite is much better than we expected. When we entered the suite, my boyfriend said "let's move in here!" The rooms here are big, and have kitcken and cooking stuff. Servicemen are nice. I'll definitely go there again next time. 
25326 just love staying here - the front desk is so helpful, the rooms cool and stylish and calm - a great oasis in the noisy city. Oh, and my bf proposed to me there, so it will always be a romantic place in my heart. 
25327 Good location near Penn Station. Just a few blocks to walk from the station. Located in Korean section. Old, tired rooms, but they were clean. Breakfast area small, crowded, and poor selection of food items. Hotel staff not too helpful. Room averaged 145$ per night. 
25328 Staff is not customer oriented. The room is tiny, dirty and smelly. You can hear when people talk in the other room. Breakfast is poor and elevator is ancient. Too expensive for what you get. Are we just paying for location? Not worth it. 
25329 Husband and I stayed at The Wawick early December 2004. Very friendly Reception, fantastic suite overlooking Avenue of the Americas. Probably the most central hotel you could stay in. 4 mins from Central Park, 5 mins from 5th Avenue shopping and opposite MoMA. We would definitely stay again. 
25330 We stayed shortly after the hotel opened and enjoyed the clean, modern suite, with additional free upgrade. The staff was very accomodating and helped us with directions and recommendations. The hotel was very modern, quiet, but not too far from the tourist attractions and Times Square. 
25331 You couldn't ask for a more conveniently located hotel. It's close to everything! Staff was professional and attentive and the rooms were clean and spacious. The sky lounge was amazing (just wish they had the bar open up there!) 
25332 All I can say is my stay was perfect. Amazing shower, great bed, quiet room. Room service in the morning a tad on the slow side but it was a Sunday morning so I am sure they were backed up. Great stay, will be back. 
25333 My husband and I stayed at the Comfort Inn Times Square in Oct. 2010. It was a very nice hotel AND a great location. Near everything. People were nice and continental breakfast was included. Rooms were small, but acceptable. We would stay here again. 182dja 
25334 I stayed with my husband and two teenage children at this hotel for two nights. The room was clean, the service was excellent, and the location could not be better. We really enjoyed being in the heart of Time Square. 
25335 The hotel has a great location! Its good for both business and leisure. The service was good and they have a very delicious breakfast buffet in their restaurant. 
25336 6 girls, spread across 2 1brdm suites - ideal for first time in NY as close to all iconic places. subway close, great deli next door, staff friendly and rooms perfect space for 3! room 3503 and 3103 offered brilliant views chrysler building....we would all come back in a heartbeat!! 
25337 Location is perfect. Room is decent size for NYC. Clean, quiet and updated! Bed was very comfortable, water pressure great. All of the staff was great. All in all it was a very welcome retreat from the hustle and bustle of the city. 
25338 This hotel is located in Manhattan. It is clean, nice and has a fantastic roof terrace. The rooms however are rather small, as well as the beds. But for this price and location it's absolutely not a problem! Especially when you're not that big or tall. 
25339 We had a great stay at the morgans hotel. The hotel room was a good size, clean and the staff was very friendly. We would definitely stay there again! 
25340 Our room was bigger than expected and quiet. We loved the bed linens and the soaps and other toiletries which were of high quality. Appreciated the free bottled water. Friendly people. Great location in Midtown. 
25341 The hotel staff is nice, excellent location. A bit old but definitely worth it for the price and location. Just a few steps from the subway station. I'd go back again! 
25342 I loved this place. The decor is great and though the rooms are small, it's very modern with a spectacular lobby. And of course, the location is fabulous. 
25343 had another great stay at the Sofitel in NYC! this is a quiet, centrally located hotel in midtown with very resonable prices when compared to other caparable high-end hotels nearby. and the fact that they greet you with a "bonjour" is a lovely touch. 
25344 Very nice hotel for minivacation with my wife. Convenient location, rooms are very well appointed and convenient location. Good value for the quality of hotel. Friendly service. Improvements: would be nice to have coffee in the room, and complimentary breakfast is a bit skimpy. 
25345 Hotel was spotless and service was great! Will definitely return the next time I'm in nyc 
25346 We stayed here for the AAU Jr Olympics. It was clean and the staff was polite and attentive. I didnt give them a 5 because of the few ants in the bathroom. The price was great compared to others in area with all the people in town. 
25347 Thanks to the staff at this hotel who really went the extra mile to return a lost wallet to us. This kind of honesty and responsibility is indeed a wonderful thing in a hotel staff. 
25348 The hotel room is small, but efficient. The hotel is clean and the workers are attentive. I have no complaints! The location is also good, close to Penn station. One downside is the restaurant sucks. Though, food options nearby are plenty. 
25349 Great little gem in the heart of Times Square. Yes, rooms are small, but bed was super comfy, room was VERY clean, and staff was lovely. Rooms are nicely refurbished with a cool funky vibe. Would definitely go back! 
25350 Great location! Just around the corner from Flying Saucer (excellent bar) and several eating establishments. Great view of the town. My wife did not feel like breakfast, but there is a place down the street called Georges Market which does a really good breakfast alternative to the buffet at Magnolia 
25351 Friendly front desk services and helpful. The room decor is contemporary and I love the swivel TV panel partition which you can watch TV either from sitting area or bedroom sides. Great locations and 1 min walk to 24hrs drug store which carries lots of necessities. 
25352 Nice hotel to park and fly, quiet rooms, close to airport and great covered parking, we were in Mexico 12 days and car was very secure in the garage. 
25353 Great location, room was big! A bit of a draft, so the room was a little cold, but all in all, really nice. 
25354 Amazingly quiet for an airport hotel. Very functional. Banquet food was above average. Call for maid service if you want it done by a specific time. My room was not cleaned until after I called at 4pm. 
25355 Business trip in decemeber. Stayed two nights; it is OK although nearly $600 per night for the quality of sleep, wasn't great. 
25356 Stayed here a couple of times, always good, staff can be a little stand offish but generally pleasant and more than willing to help. Hotel has a fantastic gym! Wasn't blown away by the breakfasts or restaurant food but all in all a great place to stay 
25357 Good hotel. Nothing spectacular. Great location. Did not use room service. Staff was friendly and knowledgable of surrounding areas and locations. 
25358 Great Place. We stayed there in first weeek of May. Excellant location. Freindly people. Delli across the hotel is great. Only things beds and room are small for 4 people in the room. Will stay here again. 
25359 The friendliest hotel I've ever stayed at! Hotel Indigo's staff were all so incredibly nice and accommodating. As a first time tourist to NYC, they offered handy tips and made our stay a complete joy! 
25360 Very good hotel, close to everything in NYC! Close to Central Park and to Time Warner Mall which you can go to Whole food to buy fresh fruits and even have sushi:-) 
25361 Lovely boutique hotel, I had a loft room and it was huge, so clean good part of New York, and I would definetly return 
25362 La station de metro a 20 metres, la 34 eme rue de suite accessible ,c est l ideal. Personnel tres sympathique, hotel tres propre, un seul regret, les chambres sont vraiment tres petites.. mais bon, quand on est a NY ce n est pas pour rester dans sa chambre !! 
25363 Stayed here 10/3-10/4/11 to be near the airport for an outgoing flight. The hotel was wonderful! Very friendly, helpful staff. From check-in to check-out the stay was lovely. The decor was beautiful and everything about hotel was top notch. Would def stay here again. 
25364 Great location, convenient to subway station and Times Square, fairly quiet for NYC. Pleasant staff. The hotel appears to have been recently refurbished as everything was in very good condition and clean. Our room was huge but it was on the Club level. Really no complaints at all. 
25365 it was a nice hotel and location. very clean. Staff very friendly and rooms where very nice. 
25366 I just stayed here for the first time, and the hotel was wonderful. The room was clean, lobby was upscale and offered coffee and hot cocoa, the hotel has free parking (a definite plus in the Houston area), and the staff were friendly. I would definitely stay here again. 
25367 This hotel has it all! Beautifully decorated, quiet, spacious rooms...great restaurant and bar...perfect location for shopping, theater and the park...very accommodating staff. It was our first stay at The London and we'll be back again and again! 
25368 The room was clean & functional. Worth its price ! 
25369 The staff is great and they took very good care of us as guests of the hotel. La Bottega is a nice restaurant too. 
25370 Very classic looking and feel to the hotel and ideally located for sightseeing and feeling the city vibe. The rooms are small but you only go there to sleep and store your shopping. Kmart is just across the street and always has bargains. 
25371 Room was extraordinary clean and beds are extremely comfotable. Breakfast is the best part of staying this hotel. Location is good to me because downtown, galleria area, and premium outlet are very easy to access from there. Especially, crews were friendly and nice. I love them!!!! 
25372 Good location. Fair price. Decent service. Omlettes free. Big roomy suites. Only complaints are thin windows thus sirens kept us up. And even on a sunny day our room 618 was depressingly dark. 
25373 I stayed with my husband and my two kids and loved everything. The staff was efficient and took care of all details. The room was very clean. The location, in the middle of Times Square was fabulous! 
25374 We stayed here over christmas from 23rd to 29th Dec 2008. It was fantastic. Great location, very comfortable and modern rooms. The staff are very friendly and cannot do enough to help. I would recommend this hotel to my freinds and family without hesitation. 
25375 Stayed one night in March, hotel is literally across from Penn Station and MSG so very well located, as such you get the noise below but that's to be expected. Hotel is a bit more tired and unexciting than the website suggests. Service at checkin from front desk was outstanding. 
25376 Have stayed here on several occasions and never been disappointed. Great Location. Lovely rooms. Fantastic service. 
25377 Stayed at the warwick on 11/22-23 for first time and thought it was GREAT! Staff very friendly and helpful and was even upgraded to a suite from a regular room and loved it! Great location to a variety of attractions. Really enjoyed my stay and will be back....... 
25378 Restaurant average, lounge better than average, roof-top lounge crowded, service quite good, friendly and capable staff. Rooms are spacious, comfortable and, actually, luxurious. I might describe it as a Junior Carlyle Hotel. The real version is in the neighborhood, across Madison. 
25379 very nice place, great customer service, loved everything about the place. the location; next to times square, the service; awesome, the cleanliness; very, the bar/lounge; very stylish... and on and on... 
25380 Recently, visited the Houston area. Stayed at the Courtyard Marriot - nice, friendly, staff. Nice relaxing stress free weekend after returning from the second family funeral within two weeks. 
25381 My wife's x-mas present was a trip to NYC. This hotel helped make her first NYC experience a good one. The room was nice and the people were friendly. I would definately stay here again! 
25382 I love the size of the rooms very big that is the one thing that i like about this place. and i love where the hotel is loacated and the great staff. 
25383 We have stayed at this Inn on several trips concerning hospital appointments. The rooms have always been clean. Since we are there for medial needs issues seem to come up. On each occasion the staff has been extremely helpful. We will continue to stay at this motel in the future. 
25384 Nice hotel with large rooms. Most rooms are large suites but there are some typical rooms if you're on a budget. There's also a free shuttle that runs twice an hour. Staff was helpful. Only issue was with the continental breakfast for gold members which was skimpy. I'll stay again. 
25385 This is a stunning hotel and a piece of NYC history. At $500 a night though i found the grand hyatt to have nicer, larger rooms and the service to be better. The Grand Hyatt usually falls between $350-450 a night. 
25386 Nice hotel, great location, large rooms, but small bathrooms. People were very nice and very helpful. Would go again. 
25387 my stay at this hotel it was great and every staff is very friendly specially Erika at the desk she did everything to make me feel comfortable and provide every request of mine. I would recommend this hotel the rooms are very spacious and clean. Will be back soon. 
25388 We had a wonderful stay! The staff was helpful, courteous and dedicated to making our stay enjoyable. They went out of their way to provide non-alcoholic beverages during the evening. They assisted us in making dinner reservations and our stay in New York one of our most memorable! 
25389 Rooms, service and amenities were all very good. The location is fabulous and near restaurants, clubs, Galleria and downtown. Only thing I would change is add safes in the rooms and minubars. Always enjoy my stays here! 
25390 I am pretty fussy about the hotel I stay in. I have asthma. This hotel was pretty clean. Breakfast was good. Husband and I had a nice stay. Staff was friendly. 
25391 We loved the central location. We loved the service. The breakfast was high quality and well organized. We hope to stay here every time we visit Manhattan. 
25392 Nice Hotel, friendly staff. Only thing that grossed me out was around the tap in the bathroom, had a bit a green around it. 
25393 1 dolla for a key, 2 dolla for another key, nonrefundable. room dirty, dirty blood stained sheets with lots of hair; room lacks all amenities; if you must stay bring your own sheets, pillows, blankets and bathroom necessities, we checked in late and left early. 
25394 The room, very comfortable. The service is great. Great staff, Sheena, Nicole, Magiden and Zeek all greeted us with a big welcome. Coffee available, rooms clean, free filtered water/soda, great location in Downtown Houston. I would recommend it. 
25395 Small room, with a good queen bed. Free 24 hours chocolate/cofee. Excelent location. 
25396 Hotel ottimo per visitare NewYork e il suo centro. La stanza non era molto grande, ma comodissima e pulita, completa di ogni confort come dichiarato nella presentazione.Pochi metri e sei davanti all'Empire State Building. Se dovessi tornare a NewYork, probabilmente prenoterei ancora all'Hotel Chandler 
25397 Location and Price were excellent as was the room (24th floor), which was fairly standard NY size. On the down side: WiFi access was erratic (but they took off the $10 per day charge without long discussion). Hotel is popular with groups hence slow check-out at times 
25398 I stayed here for business a few time. Rooms are small and tight. The carpets are not the cleanest and the couches in the lobby are stained. Taxis are not easy to get in the morning. No reataurant on site. It was an okay hotel for NYC. 
25399 Horrible hostel like hotel ridiculously over priced at nearly $200. Rude front desk bad rooms 
25400 this hotel is in that absolute best location, right off the L. the lobby is beautiful and great gathering spot b/f you go out. rooms a bit small and not pristine, although updated. but nice. Hotel is a great mix of old and new, i thought it was great 
25401 Excellent, this is a gem. Friendly staff. Clean. Great location. Heat can actually be turned off (this was a complaint by another reviewer who apparently didn't find the valve). 
25402 they take towels from the room and don't return them. Also rooms.are way to small its like a cruiseship but with a horrible view of abandoned buildings. 
25403 A very different hotel. Rooms are not the largest but everything is black and swish. Located just off times square it is a fantastic getaway location to enjoy NYC. Big flat screen tv and digital radio. Defo one for impressing your partner 
25404 Das Hotel liegt gut, das Personal ist freundlich, aber die Zimmer sind leider garnicht sauber, das Bad ist ebenfalls nicht ordentlich geputzt und die Badawanne und Armaturen veraltet, Beschichtung abgeplatzt etc.. Schade! 
25405 Perfect location, great service, friendly and helpful staff, good concierge, well-equipped workout facility, good spa, beautiful views from parkview rooms, convenient and quick valet parking, more intimate size - not cheap, but worth every penny. The best all-around hotel we have visited in NYC. 
25406 A wonderful hotel in upper Manhattan staffed by a courteous and well mannered staffed. Clean and comfortable. Priced reasonably and conviently located close to Central Park. 
25407 Hotel fine,,TaxiCab service alomost criminal. They dont know where theyre going and they over charge. Best you rent a car. I was dropped off 12 blocks from my destination. Driver not familar with city 
25408 Doordat ik op expedia een goede deal kon maken was de prijs kwaliteit verhouding uitstekend, wij komen al heel lang in NYC maar dit was toch met afstand het beste hotel waarin ij in NYC ooit heb verbleven. vooral het uitzicht (boek Parkview) is helemaal het einde 
25409 I'll say this much, the price was right. If i had paid more for the room, I don't think I'd give it an 'average' review. the hotel wasn't great, but for the price it's hard to complain 
25410 Had a very nice stay at the Blue Moon. Great neighborhood. Paul was very hospitable, helpful and went the extra mile. He recommended a great place for dinner and had lots of insights on the area. Will happily stay here again. 
25411 The Allerton hotel is a nice hotel and well situated for sightseeing The staff were very friendly and helpful The rooms were clean and all towels and bedding were in good condition 
25412 Nice to stay in a small boutique hotel , being part of an international chain. Free wifi was welcome. Shame the rooftop bar was closed for the two nights we visited , but not an issue. Downstairs cocktail bar was good. 
25413 really a very good hotel. Nice place. Good prices. Friendly staff. 
25414 I would put this more on par with other 3.5 star luxury hotels in the area. Really enjoyed the stay, style and staff. 
25415 4 night stay with family was very enjoyable. Decent size room (for NYC). View was of rooftop construction so could have been better. Location was perfect and complimentary breakfast was top notch. 
25416 The rooms were nice and clean. We did not have any problems but the this hotel felt like we have stepped in the 80s. It needs updating badly. The walls are really thin, we could hear footsteps outside and above. 
25417 Paid extra for park view and well worth it 
25418 Room no 1703. Spacious room shower great very powerful. Door men very helpful 
25419 Nice Christmas tree in lobby. Beds very comfortable. Rooms quiet. Good breakfast place at back of hotel called greens 
25420 A clean room in NYC at a reasonable price. The room is small but very quite. The only time we spent in room was to sleep. It met all are needs for our vacation. 
25421 My girlfriend and I had the opportunity to stay here last week. It was very close to everything we wanted to visit during our time in the city. Hotel room was small but very very clean. I would highly recomend the hotel and we will be coming back soon! 
25422 Most 3 star hotels are being upgraded but this one is definitely going downhill. The elevator barely works. There isn't enough staff. It isn't very secure. The rooms are noisy. The best thing about the hotel is the location but there are plenty of other places to stay nearby. 
25423 I stayed there for six days very nice hotel I can't say more. I wish it was near to the time square and other activities. The central park view from the 44th floor is amazing. Hotel room services and front disk are pro. 
25424 Hotel had amazing lobby and restaurant, the room was fine but the en suite tired looking, and we were not overlooking central park. Ate in restaurant and had a fantastic meal on our last night.. Breakfast had a great selection but was expensive 
25425 Clean with a perfect location. Some of the rooms I stayed in have minor updates/fixes to be done. However, as long as they have an availability I try & stay at this hotel every time I'm in Chi Town. 
25426 The staff go the extra mile. Large and clean rooms for NYC, great location doesn't feel close to Times Square since it is quiet and peaceful. The second floor lounge is a wonderful oasis of calm and food 24/7. highly recommended 
25427 Staff helpful, room sapcious and very clean Recommend Highly 
25428 Nice room, friendly staff and great location. We had a bit of trouble with the temperature control in our room, but the staff was really helpful when we complained. Room was a bit small, but I figure that's par for the course. 
25429 Decent rooms good service but the best thing is Annamara Gayle of guest services Who makes you feel like it is your home The restaurant is good. House keeping responsive and the business services decent The many computer are helpful 
25430 Room was clean and comfortable. Very convient to Times Square and good views from the room. Fitness Room was very good. Nothing special with the bar and restuarant. You are so close to some great pubs and dining, why deal with the hotel! Would definitely stay again. 
25431 First time at this hotel, great location, central park just three minutes walk, subway near. Our room was very clean, comfortable and good size, what more do you need for a long weekend in NY when you spend most of the time out 
25432 My family and I recently stayed at The Warwick Hotel in NYC. It is an older hotel but we found everything up to date - rooms were large and very clean. The staff was great, very pleasant and helpful. I'd recommend it to anyone. 
25433 This hotel has everything! Location cannot be beaten,friendly staff,gorgeous rooms and views, delicious breakfast and a comfortable lobby.Definitely the best choice for a New York vacation! 
25434 The hotel was fine in all regards. A very big & busy lobby, full of tours and groups. The double room was clean & quiet but the ice maker on our floor (preferred status) was broken and there seemed to be no advantage to the floor. 
25435 The Edison is only yards from Times Square so is excellent location wise, decor a bit dated, and some of the Staff (Not All) were a bit unhelpful, but overall the Three days we had their post cruise was reasonable, the Room was clean and the Maids polite. 
25436 Comfortable rooms, GREAT BEDS, clean and well maintained. On premises parking is very very expensive. Staff was very nice and helpful. Did not eat at the restaurant but it was packed. Location was great for us, away from "Michigan Ave". 
25437 Excellent location, very close to the real heart of Manhattan. Extraordinary view of Central park from certain rooms: I actually enjoyed that. Professional service. Good solution for family vacation (as in my case) but also for business stays...and regretfully my business does not usually take me to NYC. 
25438 This hotel though not large was amazing. Very serene in a fairly busy area of New York. Staff was friendly and helpful and the restaurant had great food with interesting design details. Mohammed the Doorman on duty Friday night could not have been nicer. Extremly helpful and friendly. 
25439 We stayer there on December 26 and really liked the location. Other than that pretty much nothing good to say. Staff had the poorest attitude, Check-in was a nightmare, check-out not much better... Would only stay there again for a cheap price. 
25440 Overall stay at Microtel Inn was comfortable. The staff was friendly and breakfast provided from 5:30 am - 9:30 am was very good. Copies of The Houston Chronicle local paper were available in the lobby. 
25441 Stayed for 3 nights in July for a short vacation. The staff is very friencly and accomodating. I recommend getting a corner suite that has an extra living room and powder room. The location in Times Square is perfect for sightseeing as well as attending plays. 
25442 I stayed there for 4 nights and the front desk representative was very friendly. Room was great and pretty big with a suite. Location was great for me as it was nearby restaurants (walking distance). I will definitely stay here again. 
25443 Pubic hair in the shower. Enough said. Rooms not ready on time, water pressure waxed and waned, air conditioner couldn't cool the room down, water didn't get hot. Not very clean, customer service was horrible, and of course PUBIC HAIR in the shower! 
25444 Quaint, affordable, nicely decorated, large, beautiful bathrooms and the windows open. Great restaurant-bar (pricey) and lobby. Overall, a comfortable stay. 
25445 room wasnt to bad...very small but clean...it was a little more off the beaten path then i would have liked. if it was closer to were i like to be i would stay again. 
25446 Great location right on Times Square and the view from the bar is fantastic. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Room was very clean and a good size.really enjoyed our stay here. 
25447 Very well located, but it needs renewal. The rooms are very old, with very old TVs. Bed is very confy. Staff is very friendly. 
25448 On the Ave Hotel is a perfect place to stay when visiting NYC. Amsterdam Ave has wonderful eateries and that's just minutes from the hotel. Zabars is just up the street on Broadway. Can't ask for much more!! 
25449 excelente ubicacion si vas de trabajo. esta en times square en el centro de todo relacion precio por calidad es carisimo. pague mas de $400 u.s dollars por un cuarto que en realidad no lo vale. mucha gente parece estacion de tren larga la espera para los elevadores 
25450 After a long search for a hotel close to the airport wih a airport shuttle I was suprised, happy and set at ease to find and stay at this Howard Johnson. 
25451 I was impressed with the hotel. I stayed there for 7 days. The staff were very friendly. Room was spacicous but not cleaned very well daily. It is so central. I will stay there again. 
25452 We stayed here with parents, the staff was great, location superb in the middle of meat packing district The hotel is part of the club scene. Which Gives the hotel extra good vibes during weekend In surrounding area has lots of clubs, restaurants, Apple store. Breakfast was complete 
25453 Stayed at 70 Park Avenue for about a week in September. The room are clean, well maintained, nicely decorated. In the bathroom the use great Etro soaps and products. Would stay there more often if it was not for the SPG or other bonus points. 
25454 We went to NYC for just one night to see a musical. The location is a short walk to Times Square. We took the train and walked from Penn Station - it was just 1/2 mile. 
25455 The location of this hotel right smack in Times Square can make you forget a few of the realities - pricey for tired-looking rooms and average house keeping. They do well because of their location but must become more aware of the importance of quality and service. 
25456 The San Carlos Hotel is one of the nicest place I have ever stayed. The service was trememdous, rooms are spotless, and it is well within walking distance to all area attractions. I highly reccomend the San Carlos to anybody wanting to stay in Midtown Manhattan. 
25457 An absolutely shocking hotel from start to finish. Cockroaches in th cupboards, smelly dirty and staff who are rude and obviously used to complaints. 
25458 Wonderful property with great staff, rooms are clean and comfortable. great location right offf the expressway with plenty of restaurants in the area.. I travel to Houston three to four times a year on business and will not stay any place else. 
25459 This is a very friendly hotel and right in the Lower East side.You can walk to Katz's deli and the not to be missed The Meatball Shop restaurant around the cornwer.It is open till the wee hours and the food is delicious and cheapThe hotel restaurant ia faboulous too. 
25460 Old and a bit tired, the diner was the only good thing about this Hotel 
25461 As I was told by a customer service representative (and I quote): "We are a budget hotel. Don't expect a Hilton service from us." Enough said!! 
25462 Two 10 yr. olds enjoyed the large pool in the atrium, and adults were able to bring favorite beverage in plastic glasses to tables surrounding pool. Location was central to most forms of transportation and attractions. Our 7th floor room was renovated and pleasant. 
25463 My husband and I stayed at the Waldorf-Astoria for a long weekend in NYC. We found the location to be particularly convenient to everything. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. We thought the room was nice with a very comfy bed. Our bathroom was recently updated and nice too. 
25464 The hotel at times square is a no frills place and we loved it because of its location, just two blocks away from times square. The hotel didnt even have a restaurant as one has all the eating joints around it .It serves you a complimentary continental breakfast :) 
25465 room was spacious and well apointed.rooms were cleaned everyday and friendly staff. very efficient and well mannered people and free parking. 
25466 Een prima hotel om te vertoeven vlakbij Central Park, Broadway en 5th Avenue. De lobby van het hotel is donker, sfeer verlichting zou beter zijn. Het personeel is zeer vriendelijk en uitermate behulpzaam daar kunnen we in Nederland nog iets van leren. 
25467 Nice property Well maintained Staff attentiveness needs improvement All in all, a good experience 
25468 Great hotel to stay at great price Peter and Alfredo were awesome, Conciere desk provided great suggestions and made reservations for me several times, the maids were ver nice and friendly 
25469 Great hotel and great location. Big rooms. Nice staff. 
25470 The Marcel at Gramercy is great in any way. Location is perfect (sightseeing things is very near by, supermarket 50 meters, Bagel Express 30 meters), rooms cleaned every day, very helpful staff, free computers with internet and a VERY nice view from the roof deck. Everything looks brand new. 
25471 This Hotel was great. Very clean, the beds were sooooo comfortable,nice bar/lounge area for just hanging out waiting for friends. The hotel staff was great. 
25472 Well located functional hotel. Service is not that great. Refused early check-in while rooms were clearly available. It appears as a reasonable place but you can find better. 
25473 I booked this hotel on the strength of the trip advisor reviews and it met expectations. Staff very helpful , rooms compact but modern and cool , breakfast good , and internet access great. Location also fab as it is so central. 
25474 This is a great hotel with good location. The service is very good and the room is very comfortable. It has Starbucks coffee for great morning start. 
25475 Took my daughter and 2 of her friends for start of their spring break. Very centrally located. next to a subway station. walking distance from shopping areas and other areas of interest. room nice sized considering we were 4 in there. Breakfast was also a good spread. Nice experience!! 
25476 went shopping to new york this hotel is nice, great location about 3 star in my app would say it was clean and ok the location is very inportant and this hotel has that would stay again maybe 
25477 stayed in this hotel with my 2 daughters and one of my teenage grandchildren age 15 we were delighted with the accomadation and the breakfast we could not fault overall it was a perfect stay and would return if we ever get back to new york 
25478 close to all the great NYC gems. staff very polite and wanting to help. close to Penn station, sub-way. rooms clean and neat. felt safe. children enjoyed. was not too noisy. 
25479 The hotel rooms near Times Sq seem small and dated. Thought the staff here were not very helpful. Prefered "Stay" hotel but only just. 
25480 This hotel is one of the older ones that I stay with. It is clean and is keep is acceptable (to me) condition. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The breakfast buffet is above average. Hilton is doing a good job with this one. 
25481 The Affinia Dumont is a lovely hotel in an excellent location for easy walking to almost everything. We shopped around Times Square, saw Broadway shows, and wandered the Lower East Side, Little Italy, and Greenwich Village from this peaceful and beautiful hotel right in the middle of the city. 
25482 Great staff. Excellent location. Phenomenal room service. WOODY ALLEN WAS PERFORMING JAZZ IN THE LOUNGE!! One of the coolest experiences On my life. 
25483 The Waldorf Astoria is a beautiful hotel, with all the original features of when it first opened, we loved our stay but if we were staying again in New York would go for a more modern hotel, that would have a more relaxed way about it. 
25484 Stayed April 3-5th. Spacious suite, clean tastefully decorated. Located in lovely neighborhood. Plan on returning soon! 
25485 Excellent location, very big hotel. The public areas are like a bus station. Avoid to ask for a breakfast, use the menu not special orders. It can cost you a lot.... 
25486 albergho nella media, pulizzia accetabile per chi non cerca troppo. Non offre colazione e la connezzione a internet si pagha 10 DS al giorno. Non lontano dalla 5th Aevenue(circa 10min a piedi). La metro si trova ad una traversa dell'hotel, anche se non e centrale, ci si muove facilmente. 
25487 This was a nice hotel. Location was very good near Times Square and Central Park for example. Rooms were quite big and decoration was nice. Service was good. I could visit there again. 
25488 Excellent budget hotel in an expensive city (in hotel prices..).Very clean, the only problem was the frequent out of work elevator. Great advantage it's location (next to Central Park and to a metro station).Definitely, i recommend it 
25489 I visited New york several times now and I love to change location depending its trendiness. This time I thought the MPDistrict would be the place to be and indeed we loved the neighbourhood. A little vibrant/noisy during the weekend but we loved our short stay anyhow. 
25490 I flat out love this hotel. I was upgraded to a 2 bedroom 2 bath suite and enjoyed my time to the fullest. Great City location, great service and fun. Treat yourself and stay at the W Chicago City Center. 
25491 Excellent Hotel - Clean - Great location - Hotel front desk staff Tricia, Adelina are so helpful. Very comfortable beds - Very charming hotel 
25492 They should expand the breakfast area and possibly also the menu. Also the first impression aroused by hall is a little poor. Great professionalism of the staff. 
25493 Hot Spot, I will be there for Taste of Chicago 2010 
25494 This hotel is right off the mag mile and although a bit dated and small fro the price and location it was worth it. There are plenty of restaurants shops and attraction within walking distance to accommodate your touristy needs,. 
25495 The service level at this hotel makes you feel special. You are greeted by name and any request is taken care of extremely promptly. Their location is convenient and it is a very good value for the rates. 
25496 We booked a Junior Suite through Expedia and were delighted with all aspects of our stay. No negative comments whatsoever and would happily recommend this hotel. Staff friendly and very helpful, especially David, the concierge. Do try Blooms diner at 40th and Lexington for breakfast!! 
25497 Totally average hotel, very well located near the subway. Concierge was nice. Rooms are small and not very clean. Front rooms have nice view of central park (though no overview). 
25498 Some rooms are small, family rooms are good size but hay you only sleep in the room very clean and friendly staff. we were a large party of 27 and would say we would all stay in this hotel again it's in such a good location 
25499 Very trendy. Rooms ok, not massive but central NY !! Best part is the location, 5 mins from almost most things. We walked everywhere, felt safer than in the UK! 
25500 Convenient location. Stylish design for trendy people. Small rooms and small beds. 
25501 The location of this hotel is excellent. The accomodations are just okay. The rooms are small but adequate. You can walk to almost every major attraction. Plentiful restaurants nearby. Leave a couple bucks for the maid and your service improves 100%. 
25502 It was nice. Very cool design. But the rooms were a bit small. I stay in NY a lot. So far the Muse is the best I've found. 
25503 Big rooms, no window insulation, wind blows !, heating system is prehistorical but friendly staff and very good location. 
25504 Rooms very tiny, even for NYC. Stay in top floors, away from street noise and disco neighbor. Very pleasant and helpful service people. Scaninavian streamline decor yet drab coloring in rooms. Great neighborhood for shopping, restaurants, getting to other parts of Manhattan. 
25505 I booked this hotel online. After showing up I checked out almost immediately and went to the Crowne Plaza. Hotel Pennsylvania is a complete dump and is a perfect candidate for gutting and remodelling. 
25506 Wow, what a terrible service! I go regularly to NYC but this is the first time I had such a bad experience (service and room altogether!) 
25507 Stayed August 21st for business. Disappointed, for $50 more I could have stayed at the Marquis which is much more up dated and has more amenities. I will not stay here again when other hotels in the are better. 
25508 A great value in the City at a great location! A very short walk and you are in the middle of Times Square and all of the theaters. The staff was absolutely wonderful and very helpful. Upgrade to the Superior rooms is worth the extra money. It even includes breakfast! 
25509 The Belvedere is true to what people has been saying. Excellent service, clean rooms and close to everything. Highly recommended. 
25510 I stayed at Hotel Alexander for one night with my husband and 2 year old. I found the staff very pleasant, the rooms warm (while it was about 20 degrees outside) and everything very clean and comfortable. I would definitely recommend it! 
25511 Mohammed the doorman was really helpful. All the staff were really nice, the place is modern, but classic. Cool bar and restaurant. 
25512 Arrived before 11:00 am and was very surprised/pleased to be checked right into our room. Front desk service was excellent- helpful and pleasant. Smallish room, but well maintained with nice finishes. Excellent location, would return for location alone. 
25513 Hemos estado muy bien atendidas y la situacion es inmejorable se llega con mucha facilidad a todos los sitios y el personal es muy atento 
25514 Great place to stay at a reasonable price. We found the Grant Park Best Western clean, quiet and very close to everything we wanted to do in Chicago. 
25515 This was an OK hotel. The rooms are small, but clean. There is little noise, and the location is very good. Friendly personell. 
25516 We arrived late evening, but booked hotel earlier. We got what we requested including room in higher floor. Reception desk staff was very friendly. I would recommend your stay in this hotels. It has great location as well, 3 min from Time square by foot. 
25517 Best Manhattan Hotel Experience. If you are heading to New York City, stay here! Exceeded all of our expectations...great room( clean and modern) +service+staff+restaurant and bar+lobby and most of all perfectly located. Our Hotel for life! 
25518 Wonderful hotel, rooms, staff - GREAT BREAKFAST! Restaurant mgr. Geraldine is sweet, and runs a great hot breakfast - nothing not to enjoy about this hotel. Even food for the kids! 
25519 Lo consiglio per il rapporto prezzo\qualita' e la vicinanza alle maggiori attrattive di New York. 
25520 For a 4 star hotel, I had some problems with service. They gave me an occupied room and made me wait half an hour to five me another room... 
25521 The Algonquin has an excellent location in New York, just a few blocks away from Broadway shows, shops and great restaurants. Although the rooms are a bit small, they are cozy and comfortable. The only negative point is the carpet, that is not really a nice option for allergic people. 
25522 The only good thing about this hotel is the location. The carpet and bedclothes looked dirty, none of the sockets worked, the hairdryer didnt work and when we asked for another one we didnt get one. Would never stay here again. 
25523 great hotel amazing location, right at times square rooms are small but trendy. 
25524 outstanding services!! The Doorman were great, and our floor hostess was the BEST!! Carmen on the 22nd floor was so pleasant and helpful, she really made our trip a pleasure!! 
25525 Nice Staff, Big Room and great view. Great location but be aware that at the moment that you step out of the hotel, you will see a bunch of people. So, not good if you want something calm. Worth to stay here at least once. 
25526 The Magnolia is full of cool little details and the decorations are fabulous. They also have a great complimentary hot breakfast (including biscuits and gravy!) for all hotel guests, which sets it apart from most hotels. Overall I had a great stay. 
25527 CHAMBRE TRES AGREABLE, TRES PROPRE et TRES CALME - BONNE LITERIE - SALLE DE BAINS COMMUNE TRES PROPRE - RAPPORT QUALITE PRIX EXCELLENT PROXIMITE DU METRO ET A 5 MN DE CENTRAL PARK RESTAURANT PRES DE L'HOTEL - VRAIMENT UN TRES BON HOTEL A RECOMMANDER POUR BUDGET MOYEN 
25528 Just been for a 4day city break.The hotel is v central close to Empire state building,maceys and Time sq.Great staff v helpful and entertaining especially Mathew.Good all round hotel xxxbeds v comfy as well slept like a logx 
25529 We stayed one night in Park Central Hotel. Room was acceptable (150$/n), but some renovation would be nice to have (outdated rooms). Location was great but due the high traffic some noise can disrupt your sleep. 
25530 Hotel is good value with travelzoo promotion. Was very clean. Bar was not open at beginning of July. Location is not as bad as reviews suggest. Very close to subway and Times Square. 
25531 Stayed with my wife and kids and there was not a single request from a taxi to a restaurant that they dont accomplish quickly, properly and precisely. 
25532 Beautiful, comfy bed with plenty of pillows. Plenty of towels and toiletries. Pleasant staff. Only complaint- hair in shower drain. 
25533 After staying at the Hyatt House for two months, we are clear: the service, the extras, the staff, the cleanliness is all Perfect. Best place to stay for a night, or a year! 
25534 Room too small for 3 adults. Breakfast room way too small for guests! Surrounding neighborhood area dirty and felt unsafe. Good service from friendly staff! Good location for using train and metro! Luggage left for day after checkout for tip only. 
25535 As in several previous stays, all was exceptional and, somehow, exceeded expectations from the last stay. Ambiance and service in Gaby's is exceptional! Front desl is always on top of every request and are willing to assist in any inquiry. 
25536 The hotel is in a great location. However the accommodations were modest and standard. They charged extra for things like storing bags that many hotels would include as a free service. 
25537 Definitely book Towers rooms if you can - well worth the extra! Room was amazing, service was fantastic and the room service was lovely. We can't wait to go back. 
25538 We very much agree with all the positive things said about this hotel. Great location, nice room, wonderful staff. Could have not been more pleased. Check out "restaurant row" on 46th between 8th and 9th. We'll definitely return next trip to the Big Apple. 
25539 Great experience, nice big room, quiet, slept great. The manager was very helpful with directions to get around. Great value for the money, a little inconvient for food but worth the trouble. Will be staying again next week. Thanks to manager for all the help. 
25540 The hotel is nice and clean. However, one of the front desk staff (Nathan) was very rude and unprofessional. Hence, the cleanness of the hotel did not matter as the front desk clerk ruined my experience. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. 
25541 Hotel is a small European style hotel conveniently located to attractions and restaurants. Rooms are small and very well used. Staff was delightful and helpful. Compared to the prices we saw for nicer hotels, this was more reasonable - still New York expensive. 
25542 Comfy, comfy bed!! Service that respected our privacy and needs. Great location to beach, stores and public transportation. Concierge help was terrificn helping us to get to museums, aquarium, Navy Pier, beach and restaurants. The view from the corner, spacious room exhilirated us every morning when we awakened!! Great Hotel!!! 
25543 Iroquois Hotel is about 3 blocks from Times Square. The rooms are not huge, but just fine. Its clean and well maintained. Staff is very nice and accommodating. 
25544 Really enjoyed my stay here 
25545 clean, comfortable, quiet 
25546 friendly staff 
25547 you're not paying for an overdone lobby 
25548 lots of restaurants nearby 
25549 internet access is free and good bandwidth 
25550 really nothing to compain about. Also was very pleased that they let me check in at ~12 Noon. 
25551 stayed in a 1 bedroom suite- 2nd highest floor- view of empire state from bedroom- great location, just a few blocks from times square- walked everywhere- would definately stay again 
25552 Good location and rooms were normal size, but service was below average, room was overpriced, carpet was extremely stained, maid almost walked into our room twice before checkout, no free wi-fi. We just expected more from this hotel, but it was just ok. 
25553 Ottimo per le escursioni a New York, economico, pulito, colazione ....cordiali....stanza piccolina per 4 persone (i letti matrimoniali corrispondono a letti ad 1 piazza e 1/2). Lo consiglio vivamente. 
25554 My NONsmoking room smelled like smoke. The guest next door had a dog that never stopped barking. Their wireless internet amenity was a complete joke. Worst hotel experience I've ever had. Will definitely explore other dog-friendly hotel options for future travel as a result of this experience. 
25555 I will never stay here again and I am a gold HHonors member. The staff are rude except for the folks that keep your luggage. The concierge and the front desk had the worst attitude. 
25556 Great everything, particularly the central location, near the Cartier bldg on 5th Ave. We got a bit more than what we paid for, only downside is the modest in-room breakfast. Great sized rooms and nicely refreshed with big size bath tubs. 
25557 luxury galore , attentive staff , always know I will get my favoritre room type when booked with Vickie Bellinghausen, knows whats importatnt to the business traveler 
25558 I have stayed at the Hilton right next store. These hotels are similar. Parking is expensive, however. It costs 55.00 a day for valet parking and 35 if you park your own car--10.00 more if you have an SUV. Hotel service is friendly- room is very clean. Modern bathroom. 
25559 The hotel has pod concept with small rooms with both singular and common rooms.Its location in NYC is pretty well , in terms of public transportation and chic neighbourhood. The staff , the heating and the pod-douche was ok.The price-quality balance is good as well. 
25560 Easy, pleasant check-in; comfortable, quiet room; fun rooftop bar. 
25561 Really enjoyed my stay with the Omni for 3 nights. This is one of the kids friendly Hotel. The handed over wonderful gifts to my son. Will surely come back ...Great location ,excellent service and the bed was excellent too..Felt nice to rest after a ,long exhaustive day in NCY 
25562 Good location, cheap hotel pay, near subway, restaurant available , convenient transport available from hotel to JFK airport 
25563 Will defenitely come back 
25564 Hilton Hotel ligt lekker centraal, dus alles is te lopen of met enkele haltes metro goed te doen. Om de hoek ligt Metro cafe een heerlijk tentje om lekker te ontbijten, waar ook heel veel New Yorkers elke dag komen. 
25565 Great service and location, Good delis and restaurants around there (breakfast: vien, pain quotidien, alice"s cup of tea, lunch/dinner: serafina, circus...). Hotel's breakfast also good. Rooms not so new, but not a problem, tube in the bathroom and big space. 
25566 Never stayed here before and wasn't sure to expect. Very clean, comfortable and friendly, efficient staff 
25567 very nice workout room. A long way to the rooms. Relatively easy to get to through the train below the airport. it was quite and clean. 
25568 We have stayed in numerous hotel in NYC, all 5 star, but the New York Palace is the very best. The staff is wonderful and extreamly helpful. The Concierge Lounge on the 39th floor is so nice. We have stayed there probably 20 times or more. Great location! 
25569 Perfect location & very friendly staffs. Our room was breathtaking! It overlooked St Patrick's Cathedral. 
25570 Stayed in 2009 Pros (1) Big rooms: bedroom and living room (2) Nice decor (3) Good location a few blocks from Times Square (4) Fantastic price considering quality and room size Cons (1) Hardly any cupboard space (2) Service not very personal 
25571 I found the service to be excellent and very accomodating. It is a good UWS hotel for Sabbath observers. 
25572 I would highly recommend staying at this lovely hotel when visiting Chicago. The hotel is immaculately clean and well furnished. Easily reached from the airport by the metro and near most everything. Best of all are the staff who are proactive to help guests. 
25573 I like the bar atmosphere. Its relaxing not crowded, and they have amazing burgers. Front desk is was not in the front, had to yell to get their attention. Overall the rooms are very clean 
25574 The rudest hotel manager I have ever met in any hotel anywhere. Arrogant, patronising and aggressive. 
25575 Great hotel, enjoyed staying there for 5 nights! Many pros about the hotel (service is friendly, very clean, location is very good), the only cons is the room size, which is quite small! If i have the chance, I would stay once again there! 
25576 Quite possibly the best hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff can't do enough for you and the rooms are immaculate. Its only about a block away from times square, so location is great as well. 
25577 Great Location, nice large room, King bed. My son thought the elevators were like an amusement park ride. The staff was helpful and attentive. I would stay here again when traveling with my son 
25578 The rooms of this hotel seems to have been recently refurbished: nice, modern, clean with reasonable price for NYC. Conveniently located near wall street metro station, from where you can easily go to midtown. 
25579 It didn't disappoint. The pictures are exactly what you see when you get there. Comfy and clean. However the fitted sheet didn't fit the bed properly and kept coming off everytime we moved which exposed the actual mattress. Other than that we enjoyed our stay very much. 
25580 Reasonable rate, average size room and nicely appointed. Decent gym but no pool which was no big loss since we were there for the sites and everything NYC has to offer. Enjoyed a couple of meals at the ajoining restaurant which was very good. Great location. 
25581 My ipad was stolen from my locked hand luggage bag! So whether it was in the room or where baggage is stored , I don't know. But I do know for sure it was at The Hotel. As our next stop was the airport. 
25582 Stayed there with a TV crew. Perfect location to be in the neighbourhoods and out of the hustle bustle of Mid Town. Rooms are delicious and wonderful toiletries. Food is very expensive though. 
25583 E' un due stelle e si vede, ma se avessero dei letti piu' grandi e se cambiassero i vetri in quelli con vetrocamere, attutirebbero i rumori che iniziano la mattina presto. Visita inaspettata notturna di un altro cliente in camera mia per errore... 
25584 This is one of my favorite places in midtown. The people, ambiance and rooms are great. Pam Curtiss is a rock star and always willing to go out of her way to help us. 
25585 Nice hotel, great walking area and close to the empire state building. Clean rooms and a great bed. 
25586 Location was key, close to Central Park, 5th Ave. and Times Square. Rooms were average sized and clean. Staff was friendly, but front desk was very slow. 
25587 A mi familia y a mi nos encanto el hotel estan muy limpios y las suite estan muy bonitas y tienen todo li necesario y el desayuno es gratuito y muy rico yo se los recimiendo cuando vuelva ir a houston regresaria. 
25588 Excellent hotel, great location, great breakfast. Walking distance to Broadway and Times Square. It was wonderful!! 
25589 The location was great, the staff was okay, didnt seem as friendly as other hotels Ive been to. The room was nice. Great view of the city. 
25590 Great serves, clean well appointed room, nice bed with great sheets and soft pillows will keep me coming back. Bell men new the naborhood like the back of there hand and were able to direct us to every thing we needed. 
25591 Stayed here during Christmas season and it was perfect location, nice ammenities but a small room... to be expected in the area. It still had everything we needed and would certainly stay here again. 
25592 Stayed in this lovely hotel recently while in New York Really funky Nice and clean Staff very friendly Rooms are small but comfortable Really good value for money. So central 5 minute walk to time square 
25593 The is a very nice hotel. The breakfast was great but it could be better! Room are small but who cares, we are in NYC! Everything is only 2 step from the door!!! Staff was properly trained and very friendly. The rooftop is awesome! Will come back! 
25594 Service and lobby was nice, but room was small, hot, and needed remodeling. All of this made the price I paid ridiculous. However, I sent an email through the website about my problems and they deducted a good amount from the bill. 
25595 The hotel was clean, quiet and the staff were extremely helpful. The location was ideal for a trip to New York. 
25596 We stayed at the hotel 7 nights. We got a small room (too small for 2 poeple) bt is was clean with everything you need and a kitchen. The location is great 5 miwalk from Times Square and Subway 
25597 We've stayed here a couple of times. Location is great - on 5th avenue accross from NY Public Library. The staff is fabulous. Rooms and amenities are great as well. 
25598 Despite European-sized rooms, the hotel was still a great place, and quite the scene. The Club is fun and the Library Bar nice for a quieter cocktail. Good location, nice decor, good people watching. 
25599 Always loved that hotel. The only negative is the fact that the rooms are too small in general and the internet too expensive although u can have free access in the lobby. But location is unbeatable and views amazing! 
25600 ottimo hotel, molto ben posizionato per attrazioni(times square a 2 passi),molti ristoranti e cafe'nelle immediate vicinanze,staff gentile.e' la camera (doppia superior)piu' grande e pulita che abbia avuto nei miei soggiorni newyorkesi a parita' di categoria. 
25601 un hotel muy tranquilo, con una ubicacion excelente, al lado del empire state 
25602 The staff was amazing and very accommodating, but Brian continually goes out of his way to make all of our experiences fabulous! He is always extremely friendly and makes you feel like a VIP. 
25603 I left my wallet in my room when I checked out. The hotel mailed it to me at no charge and nothing was missing from it, not even the cash! Fantastic location, but the great location is a trade-off for a little bit of street noise. 
25604 We had a bird show and convention at this property and the staff could not have been more helpful or accomodating. Nice rooms, great rates and not too far from IAH airport. We used super shuttle from airport. 
25605 Lovely hotel, very clean, comfortable hotel. Conceirge very helpful and friendly - other staff in bar and front desk could be more friendlier, but would go back to stay here. 
25606 Me and my wife visited him one night and he made the best herb chicken we have ever had great job james the chef. But its and great hotel to do business at and rest. 
25607 Great location, just one block from Empire State Building. In any other location than in the middle of Manhattan this hotel would be heavily overprised. Poor breakfast, hotel room is extremely small, you need to wait ages for warm water in the shower 
25608 Great hotel.Very clean and very friendly staff. Marchin and Barry were the greatest and thanks guys for everything.Breakfast was good .Walking distance to everything .A real gem..Only bad thing i have to say is the slow elevators but its a great place to stay.Beds were amazing..super comfy...... 
25609 We spent 4 months here receiving medical care. The staff are very sympathetic and flexible. The chauffeurs deserve special mention. They are pleasant, accommodating and willingly drive you to medical venues as well as to shopping areas. 
25610 Four of us in NYC for the Holidays. Only place we could find with a 3 bed suite. Price is not bad, for NYC, the rooms are tiny though. Complementary breakfast is decent and the coffee is good. Would stay here again. 
25611 After long flight and late arrival I was so pleased to have Ryan in the lobby arrange my stay with such amazing speed and efficiency This guy will go far and in my eyes is way undervalued at this hotel. Thanks again Ryan from a weary traveller 
25612 ideal place to stay: great value for money, place is well looked after, very nice staff, huge room. Having stayed at many 5 star NY hotels, would always choose this place before them. 
25613 Love all the Affinia hotels in NYC! The nicest for the price and love the area. Staff is always professional and courteous. Rooms very nice! 
25614 Great bar which I can't find listed under restaurants or nightspots. On first floor adjacent the lobby. Great view overlooking Times Square. Spent a sunny afternoon and rainy evening here enjoying cocktails, wine and bar snacks. 
25615 Front desk staff very helpuful Ami made our check in very pleasant and gave us a lot of information. We enjoyed the suite facilities. Housekeeping need to be improved, dusty surfaces for days pillows left on the floor and pillows not fluffed up when no linen changes not required. 
25616 You can not beat the soho grand for a romantic weekend away. My wife was shocked that I took her to shop in soho for the weekend, the hotel is great and easy to everything in soho. The package for the weekend of seduction is a big plus. 
25617 The hotel is conveniently located by the the Convention Center, attached in fact. The only glitch I experienced was an unreasonably long wait for valet to bring car up. Really good service. 
25618 Cannot beleive the bad reviews. Stayed one night May 12. Had a very large, clean room on the 14th floor. Could not ask for more. Would come back again. GREAT LOCATION 
25619 Four points Soho is a good basic hotel with a nice location to explore southern manhattan. Our room was fresh and ok in size for a cheaper manhattan hotel. The only thing we could complain about was a damp and moist smell and feeling in the room. 
25620 Spent one night here on business. Easy check-in, clean + pleasant room, convenient location, nice low-key italian restaurant downstairs. Low-frills, probably best for business. Lobby is quite bare. For $200 a night, there are much better places to stay in New York. 
25621 Phenomenal staff -- so accommodating and friendly! Entire hotel was well appointed and very clean. Huge breakfast (including hot items) which was unexpected but very much appreciated. (I stayed in the Hampton Inn Times Square North a couple years ago, and the free breakfast was very basic.) 
25622 Distinguish, we were in a 15th floor room, the view of the city is excellent. All people at this hotel smile, the made the rooms twice a day, at night they prepare the room for sleeping. It has much details stuff 
25623 I loved staying at the W time square it was clean close to all the action and I really enjoyed the staff and the bar and resturant. I was did not like was the spa! a bit under kept and the services was not up to par. otherwise Great!!! 
25624 very centrally located.... all facilities that you would need are available... staff is not the best.... all else is good 
25625 The sun bright hotel should not be called an hotel but should be named sanctuary for the homeless people, why, cos the third and fourth floors were packed with homeless people. And the fifth floor is more like a prison cubicle. Neatness is zero and the rest ... 
25626 If you have an enemy, to whom you wish the worst in the word, and in fact actually really hate.. you wouldnt even let him stay here.. It's terrible. Pictures say more then words 
25627 We just returned from a four day stay at the DoubleTree. Front desk staff were great. Breakfast was good and comped as Diamonds, Mo took care of every morning. The rooms were spacious and quiet except for traffic noise. All the staff was very personable! 
25628 Clean, quite room, very helpful staff, nice location, better than average gym 
25629 Not quite in Times Square, and that's a good thing. Very central and very easy to get to places. Great deal when booking with points. May be my "points" go to hotel in NYC from know on. Will frequent again and again. 
25630 Booked last minute on priceline for $60/night. Modern rooms, goof location, helpful staff. All in all a nice stay. The lobby was a bit crowded and noisy, but that is probably die to the heavy even traffic this venue receives 
25631 I recently took a group to the W hotel in Chicago. I was so pleased with Eden. She helped me with every detail and was even able to secure a difficult table at a local restaurant. It was a huge relief to know that I could count on her. 
25632 This is the best hotel in Manhattan. Rooms are not the biggest,but big enough for 2 people. Beds are good. Bathroom is good. Tv is great. Breakfast is OK! Location is very good. We paid $160/night and you cant beat that. It's nicer than the Hilton. 
25633 All in all a very good hotel great location to vist lower Manhattan, good value for money, friendly service, a bit annoying that you have to pay for the internet. Not sure if it is possible but better to avoid facing the street. 
25634 The location is perfect that's it. The room is rather small, the bathroom getting older, no fridge in the room and very expensive breakfast. There are better hotels in Time Square for the same price. 
25635 Abbiamo scelto questo hotel come prima tappa del nostro viaggio di nozze e siamo rimasti pienamente soddisfatti. Servizio ottimo tutti molto cordiali e disponibili,ci hanno risolto un problema causato da un loro errore, chiamando direttamente in banca. L'hotel e' bellissimo e enorme con un ottimo ristorante al suo interno 
25636 Nice hotel, great location, very friendly staff from housekeeping, bellman, concierge and front desk staff. Rate was good and I got upgraded to a junior suite due to my Platinum status. 
25637 It is all about location, location, location and the Parker Meridian is the perfect location for a NYC trip. It is close to everything. 
25638 The staff was very nice and helpful! The hotel itself was clean and decent. 
25639 Friendly staff. Very nice area, close to everything, but also very noisy. The hotel is close to streets with a lot of traffic, and it has to be close to a Fire station. The traffic combined with very thin windows made the sleep quit bad. 
25640 Varshne(sp?) was extremely helpful and patient with me at check in.I had a number of questions and requests which were handled nicely. 
25641 Michael did a wonderful job serving us! He warmed up our breakfast with their own personal microwave and allowed us to store our luggage even after I checked out! Highly recommended! Great value!! The manager was wonderful. 
25642 Very comfortable, pristine and pretty bathroom, great view of the Woolworth Building. Bed was a little too soft for my taste, but that's a minor complaint. 
25643 Fantasticoooooo...Stanze super, io dalla mia vedevo la torre di toshiba. 
25644 Wespent three nights in this hotel. Very well placed. The room was outstanding. All was very good. Just one point: for such a hotel I think that billing the internet access $9 is funny. The hotel would improve freeing such a service. 
25645 Fabulolus hotel, location and staff. spotlessly clean. So near to all the hustle and bustle but far enough to be peaceful. great cocktail lolunge and restaurant to die for. I definitely will be back. why 200 characters? if there is nothing but compliments, more is superflous. 
25646 great location, freindly staff, nice bagels and pastries for brekkie, new york times and free coffee all day... very nice clean new room, lovely shower, will be back soon.... 
25647 I stayed at this hotel last week and it is really REALLY nice inside. It's nothing like I expected at all. Outside, you can see and view the construction and traffic. So chaotic. But as soon as you walk into the hotel, you forget about what is going on outside! 
25648 It was a wonderful surprise to see what a beautiful accommodation I received. Everything about the hotel was friendly....and new....and clean. I would recommend it in a heartbeat! And hope I'll have the chance to go back to this affordable little gem on the upper west side. 
25649 We're Platinum members and were greeted and upgraded to a spacious room. The staff was obliging and terrace in the concierge lounge was a bonus we enjoyed for outdoor cocktails and breakfast too. We frequently stay at Marriotts in NYC and we will be coming back to this property. 
25650 Great Great Great Location!! Perfect sized room for 2. Unlike other reviewers I did not experience loud music coming from below. The beds were very comfortable, each room is Equipt with their own thermostat which is amazing! The staff was very friendly. Definitely going back! 
25651 Wir wurden sehr nett empfangen und man hat uns ein tolles Zimmer (mit Vorraum) zugewiesen. Rundherum eine gelungene Zeit. Die Lage war genial, alle Verkehrsmittel sind mit wenigen Schritten erreichbar gewesen. 
25652 Quaint, charming hotel with a lot of history. The rooms are well-appointed but very small. Good location. Loved hanging out in the lobby. 
25653 You can tell that at one time this was a very nice hotel. Unfortunately now it's been neglected and is in desperate need of a makeover. To charge $400+ per night is a joke considering how run down the rooms are. 
25654 Nice hotel, good neighborhood, good value for your money. Stayed there with my family (two girls); room was not big but fine; very clean; good beds and pillows; friendly staff 
25655 Alter Kasten mit morbidem Charme, super Anbindung (Pennstation) 
25656 My family was traveling to participate in a Broadway Artists Alliance summer program. The staff was helpful and knowledgeable throughout our stay. The location of the hotel was convenient to everything we wanted to do and even the wait time for the elevators wasn't bad at all! 
25657 I found out about this hotel through a referral of a friend. Nice rooms, clean and modern. Location was really key. Made it to all my Midtown meetings. Would recommend. 
25658 Hotel was awesome. The staff was very accommodating. Strategically located in d-town Chicago. My room was off the charts. Cozy and very comfortable. The beds and pillows were unbelieveable. Strongly recommend. 
25659 First visit and certainly not the last. Great location, smack bang in Time Square. Good hotel very busy, no problems with Lifts. Service was good, we wanted a late checkout and we were offered until 3.00pm and no extra cost. 
25660 Great rooms, great service, historic, pleasantly decorated common areas and hotel rooms, great food and staff to answer any question and deliver a services. 
25661 Nice clean hotel. Average sized rooms. Air conditioner was a little noisy, but no big deal. A great value for NYC. 
25662 I experienced greaty service at this hotel. The staff was very professional and also honest. I lost my cell phone on the hotel shuttle and the driver returned it to me. 
25663 Wife and I have stayed there many times when they have a discount period. Always a treat. Everything is special and the location is incredible for everything. 
25664 Not far from Times Square, but not too pricey. New place, with a staff who is trying to establish a reputation as helpful and knowledgeable. 
25665 Kamers zien er net zo uit als op de foto. Om de hoek bij Macy's, metro station om de hoek. TOP hotel. Tip bij aankomst Newark: Als u aankomt kunt u voor $15 p.p een shuttlebus naar New York nemen. Stopt ook voor het hotel. 
25666 I travel to NYC about once a year on business, and I've stayed at the Grand Union two or three times. It's clean, safe, cheap, near my client's offices, and has refridgerators in the rooms. What more could you ask? Some of the rooms have only showers and not bathtubs. 
25667 This hotel really offers a good stay when wanting to live in the center of NYC. The staff was serviceminded and kept our room clean and neat every day. However, this hotel seems a bit overprized regardless the location. Futhermore free wireless internet should be standard in every room. 
25668 I stayed here whilst on an extended business trip. It was one of those rare hotels in NY that offers value for money. It has all the various amenities and is quite clean and modern. Don't expect anything too flash, but it has everything you need and is centrally located. 
25669 If you want to see NYC and don't care much about hotel, this is good deal. Shared bathrooms are clean, so are the rooms. Terribly hot elevator, so try to get room at lower floors. In some rooms they should clean/change filters in air conditions. Great budget hotel! 
25670 Location can't be beat. East, West, North, South... there is plenty to do. Employees are super amazing and kind. Professional and NYC great. Hotel is very Holiday Inn feeling. One could easily stay here as it was clean, just moderate in decor. Wouldn't recommend more than a few nights. 
25671 the hotel is ok but the location is far way from the main city.good sitting are in lobby.you get what you pay.the christmas pary was good. 
25672 bien situe. La chambre un peu petite et surtout des fenetres donnant sur un mur a 30 cm, donc stores en permanence baisses, lumiere artificielle, un peu dur, de 6h a 8h apres une journee de cavalcade... 
25673 L liked everything in this hotel l loved it because I have my kids there and my husband 
25674 We stayed here for a girl's weekend. The free breakfast buffet was AMAZING. Location was great for all of us. Not a long walk to Time Square. We would definitely stay here again. 
25675 PROS: price and location (quiet neighborhood) CONS: crampy room, 20,000 layers of paint over everything (very old), worst bed I have ever slept in. 
25676 stayed at this hotel for 5 nights and would definitely recommend. Rooms were clean, modern and beds ultra comfy. And location was great for all sights in NY! Staff were brilliant. I'd give this hotel an A* for everything and would recommend for a great stay 
25677 The room was tiny and dingy - almost creepy. The heat didn't work and the shower was lukewarm. Don't bother staying here. 
25678 Breakfast was fantastic. Rooms were clean. All the staff was pleasant and helpful. Guests were quiet and friendly. We would highly recommend this Hotel. 
25679 We stayed at the hotel for one night. The location is great, near the Times Square. The room was pretty clean and organized the staff was helpful. Nothing more, nothing less. With our experience with New York hotels, maybe it's for the best. 
25680 Very cheap, right in the heart of Chicago. Walls are a little thin, but who cares? Nice little greasy spoon attached. 
25681 We go to New York several times a year and stay at many different hotels and The Milford Plaza has been the worse. Very tiny, cramped rooms, unfriendly staff. Too many other places out the to waste your time here. 
25682 Basic facilities but very adequate. Great location only two minutes walk from Time Square in one direction and Central Park in the other. If you want to see the hotel on DVD watch the Borat movie where he gets into the elevator and thinks its his room. 
25683 I got this hotel on Priceline for $50 and what a great bargain. The rooms are large, comfortable and clean. The daily breafast is free and appreciated (if a little boring). I stay here everytime I am in this area. You cannot beat the value and comfort. 
25684 Love this hotel. Michelene Zuli was my front desk help, and did an excellent job. Everyone at hotel very helpful and friendly. 
25685 Very basic hotel but very clean. Rooms have air conditioning, cleaned daily, with fridge and TV. On 25th Street and close to subway, great for those that don't intend spending time in hotel room, but why would you when your in New York? Would recommend to others on a budget. 
25686 We recently stayed 2 nights at Trumps overlooking Central Park - WOW, what a room with a view! The room was beautiful, the staff delightful and courteous and just a wonderful experience - although expensive, it was worth every penny and we would HIGHLY recommend! 
25687 Hall elegante e moderna con bellissimi acquari, e dotata di wifi, camere normali e bagni un po' piccoli, comunque puliti. Ci ritornerei solo per la posizione.

25688 We held a function in the Penthouse Ballroom. The staff was incredible with a wonderful view of Manhatten. The rooms were clean and large. You just don't get better value in NYC 
25689 Arrived about 9PM, they gave away my non-smoking room and said they had nothing else. Manager didn't care. Desk clerk was nice and apologetic. Received room on 14th floor where they have converted part of floor to a rooftop bar. Very loud until well after 1AM, hard to sleep. 
25690 Stayed here for a wedding. The manager was extremely friendly and the location can't be beat for the price. Highly recommended. 
25691 Always impressive. Staff and hotel were top notch. Location could not be better. Every hotel should strive to be the the St. Regis! 
25692 Good location, very clean, excellent service from all staff. We had to pay for WIFI which cost us about $24 for three days PER DEVICE! Also there was only one bedside table & lamp which was surprisingly annoying. 
25693 Hemos estado tres amigas ,durante seis dias.El trato ha sido excelente,personal de habla hispana que se desvivian por atenderte,muy limpio,centrico.Les aconsejo que no lo duden y vayan ha este hotel.Amigas Rubio de valencia 
25694 Super location. Nice people. Convenient. Well laid out room and bath. Quiet and small 
25695 The room was spacious along with a view of the lake. The spa has excellent jets; most relaxing. The hotel is located at the river. Restaurants and shops a short walk away. Bus service and "L" transportation close. Overall a very good experience. 
25696 find somewhere less pretentious and more welcoming ........... should be easy on the budget to stay at Essex House 
25697 Pros Parking Garage Pool Location Microwave & small refrigerator in room Cons The other reviewers were right,,,strange and strong smelling cleaner/deodorizer The rooms could be cleaner Paying extra for wi-fi is ridiculous,,,not the money,,,the point,,,they should just charge more for the room and give free-wi-fi,,,Hate feeling "nickel & dimed" 
25698 I stayed there for a business trip for two nights over the weekend. The room was very nice - plenty of room, comfortable and very clean. The location was great - close to central park and within walking distance to 5th Avenue. 
25699 excelente ubicacion y servicio. 
25700 Fine hotel with great beds. Very, very big though! A plus definitely is tha rooms with connecting doors. 
25701 Very trendy and user friendly hotel. Luxurious bedding, great service, friendly staff., I will return 
25702 The reviews are absolutely true..this is a great hotel in terms of location and the helpfulness of the staff. We stayed here for 3 nights will definitely stay here again. 
25703 Very nice accommodation that I landed for about $120 for a Sunday night stay at the last minute in NYC. FANTASTIC location for this theater goer. Rooms was large, slightly aged, but had a microwave, great functional furniture and free ethernet Internet. I would stay here again in a second. 
25704 If your looking for luxury then don't stay here. If however your looking for a good clean place in a fab location then this is the one for you... Walking distance to all the main areas, little italy, tribeca, china town... 
25705 I can recommend this hotel to everyone, it is clean, the rooms and beds were perfect, bathroom very clean (even the showercurtain!!) The location is nearby Central Park and only a few minutes walk to Times Square. 
25706 Wow...Great value for the hotel and location. Quiet and great weekend get away....Ran the NYC half Marathon great place to crash..before the race with my wife. Room ok but the view of the empire state building and downtown with the east river...Priceless. 
25707 We stayed at the London in August 2011 when the hurricane hit. Everyone at the hotel went out of their way to see that the guests were comfortable and had whatever they needed. The rooms are especially nice, with separate living room and bedroom areas and a walk-in closet. 
25708 Ottimo hotel, in posizione comoda per la metro ed a due passi dal Rockfeller Center, Times Square e Central Park! Stanze grandi, spaziose, dotate di tutti i comfort e molto pulite! Consigliato a tutti! 
25709 Located a rock's throw away from Times Square. Stayed on 9th floor and the room was small, but pretty big for New York. Exceptionally nice bathroom and very clean. Good selection of food for breakfast. I especially liked the microwavable sandwiches. Liked the atmosphere and setting of the lobby. 
25710 Congress Plaza Hotel seemed to be the least expensive in this part of town. Good location right across from Grant Park. Shower was a little small but only knock on this hotel. Everything else good for price. 
25711 Ottimo sotto tutti gli aspetti. Camera molto accogliente e spaziosa, letto comodissimo. Silenziosissimo. Personale molto cordiale ma professionale ed efficente. Unica nota di demerito: in camera mancavano le ciabattine ed ho dovuto richiederle + di una volta per averle. 
25712 Stayed one night. Very clean. Nice staff. Had a clean indoor pool and hot tub. Good breakfast included. Will stay there again. 
25713 This was our favourite hotel on our recent trip. The staff were great, the location was incredibly convenient, the suite was really well set up, clean, comfortable and quiet. We would ABSOLUTELY stay here again on our next visit to New York. 
25714 This is a really great place, the staff was kind and professional, the rooms are memorable, and Marcia was so amazing- totally stay at the "Kim" for your honeymoon 
25715 Hotel was in a great location just minutes from times square. Hotel was very clean, staff was really friendly, lots of towels in bathroom etc. Rooms weren't huge but manageable,didn't spend much time in the hotelroom. Hotel was a little pricey but I guess your paying for location. 
25716 The room was very clean, the staff was friendly and helpful. Well located. The hotel was undergoing renovation while I stayed there, but I didn't see any dirt and there was no noise. Breakfast was good and the little wine&cheese thing at night very inviting. 
25717 Yotel Time Square is a futuristic hotel, central located in midtown manhattan.. Subway a few steps away.. many places of interest are reachable by feet.. small but clean and good conceveid cabins.. pretty friendly and helpful staff.. well prepared - enough food/drinks - during the hurricane sandy.. 
25718 Nice hotel, nice room, nice service. Vladimir the concierge give good advice and directions. Albert at the front desk he's so nice and he's always kind.. He makes me feel welcome! It's my second stay there and I will come back fo sure. 
25719 Great hotel! Excellent views overlooking the city! We had an excellent experience! Nice large suite on the 45 floor. Very helpful staff at check in. Breakfast buffet was average. Overall, great hotel in an excellent location. I can't wait to come back. 
25720 The staff very very friendly and Knowledgeable. Great midtown location. Rooms very clean. Received cookies upon arrival. We were checked in by Vicki employee of over thirty years. She went above and beyond to meet all our needs. I will choose this hotel in the near future. 
25721 Such a surprise for a really nice hotel in the downtown Chicago area. Good deal and very friendly staff! Greeted you everytime you walked around somewhere. 
25722 We were very pleased with the location. The stay was just average. The staff was ok. Not exceptional. The bed and pillows are exceptional. The room was noisy and the daily rate high. 
25723 We stayed there for a weekend getaway. Booked a breathtaking Lake Michigan view room. Navy Pier view at night was awesome. Beds were THE most comfortable we have ever had. Room was clean, quiet too. Would stay there again. No problems. No complaints. 
25724 My first time coming to red roof on my own. Ms. Sheena, wonderful customer service, very positive attitude with smile. I thank you for making my first visit awesome. You saved me today and my pocket. Thank you very much! 100% 
25725 Prima hotel met goede service , en vriendelijk personeel Ruime kamers , schoon en netjes Fitness , internet kamer en bar met goed restaurant aanwezig Ligging centraal op loopafstand naar vele bezienswaardigheden. 
25726 This hotel was perfect for New York within walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, Times Square. The Business Centre was free which I found unique but very much appreciated. The staff were friendly and helpful, I would stay here again. 
25727 Amazing Place to stay. Good Location. Clean Room. Great People. Renovated rooms, Clean Carpet. Actually Liked People. They were Warm. I will stay again. 
25728 Enjoyed the extra friendly staff who went out of their way to make me and my family feel welcome in their hotel. Room was perfect, spotless, and roomy. Staff responded to all requests well and quickly. Would return! 
25729 This is a good hotel in a good location. Plenty of eating options nearby. Hotel check in was smooth. Parking was $14 per day. Rooms are a little larger than normal, and decor was above average. Nothing really great or terrible. 
25730 Enjoyed the location and cleanliness of this hotel. Nice people too! 
25731 Rooms were nice size, nice decor. Bathroom looked dated and not completely clean. Service was not the friendliest but not rude either. Location was great, litterally close to everything. The hotel is overpriced in my opinion. 
25732 The best location, best price and perfect setup at a great price. Steps to Broadway,Central Park and Rockefeller Center. Comfortable bed and surpisingly relaxed room. Vana at the front was always there to welcome us with a smile and a laugh. Would recommend this for sure. 
25733 Really enjoyed our stay. The beds are very comfortable, great location, helpful staff. The pipes from neighboring rooms were a little noisy at night, but it wasn't that bad. 
25734 I usually stay 30 to 40 days a year in New York and this is the best boutique hotel in town. 
25735 The title says it, at check in the clerk was cheerful and helpful. Looks like the cleaned up the place nicely including new beds. 
25736 This was my second stay at the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square. Both stays have been perfect in every possible way. The location is fantastic, the rooms are comfortable, and the staff is excellent. Bravo! 
25737 Spent the holidays in New York and could not have been more pleased with the accommodations. Spacious, bright, warm, homey! 
25738 Although this hotel is a brilliant location, the rooms are awful! The bathrroms in particular were bad with a constant leaking tap, peeling paster, stained bath etc! The windows are also very bad at blocking all the noise from madison sq gardens so bring ear plugs! 
25739 Service, impeccable but not arrogant. Rooms-older but well maintained and nicely appointed. The featherbed! Great hotel-it's continental, classy and well run. A pleasant experience overall! 
25740 Possibly one of my favorite hotels I have ever stayed in. I cannot rave enough about the service, location, rooms, or the physical building itself (designed by a world-famous architect). I would recommend this hotel to anyone in a heartbeat... anyone with the wallet fat enough... 
25741 Accomodations are comfortable, breakfast is great, pool and bar are fabulous and it's all in the heart of times square! 
25742 Close to metro. Good value for money- this isn't a swanky hotel, but it's perfect if visiting New York is all about what you do and being out and about. It's clean and the staff are helpful and friendly. 
25743 really loved my stay, location is great, atmosphere is tremendous and so is the staff. Can't say as I've stayed at a better place in NYC. 
25744 Great location, walk to Rockefeller Center, helpful staff, beautiful Boutique hotel with a pillow menu, spa and fitness center, restaurant, pricey cocktails, but a great place to stay! 
25745 Excellent location, easy to get to museums, galleries, restaurants etc. Efficient and friendly staff, clean and comfortable rooms and generally quiet. We'll certainly try to stay at the Affinia when visiting NYC in the future. 
25746 This hotel is truly a rare piece of history. it's the original St.Regis. All the other St. Regis properties are just fake. The NYC St.Regis set very high standars and staying with other St. Regis properties is not comparable. Best Location in town, best staff. best feeling! 
25747 Staff was great when checking in. Actually checked in at noon and still got a decent room, no problem. Bellman actually went looking for an umbrella for me. Comfy bed. Bathroom is a little dated. Would stay again. 
25748 Classy hotel with a nice location. Compared to the other hotels in the area, this is a better choice for the money, walking distance to many attractions in NYC 
25749 I have been staying at the hotel indigo for the past 3 years and have never been disappointed. Very helpful staff. Only negative is the daily cost to park a car in the garage next to the hotel. 
25750 Great location for what we were seeing in NY, wonderful hotel, beautiful rooms. Very impressed! We will go back for sure! 
25751 Really enjoyed our stay here. Perfect location in the heart of the theater district, walked everywhere. Room was spacious and luxurious. 
25752 I can't say enough about this...noisy, smelly and terribly HOT in the middle of the winter! I will never stay here again. 
25753 Het Salisbury is een uitstekend hotel voor een verblijf in NYC. De kamers zijn prima en groot. Het enige (kleine) nadeel is, dat de badkamer in verhouding met de rest relatief klein en oubollig is. Maar voor ons is het zeker een aanrader. 
25754 stayed here during Sandy and everything was just fine; hotel kept us up to date and functioned almost normally. All in all a very pleasent stay 
25755 I live in England , but visit Houston on business for many months on and off and my wife and I always stay at the Hilton Houston Post Oak. The staff are courteous, friendly and very helpful and the beds are great ! 
25756 This location cannot be beat ... within walking distance to the Theater District, Restaurant Row, Central Park, The Plaza, Carnegie Hall, Times Square ... Enjoy the greatest city in the world. 
25757 Great staying in Casablanca, good ubication, good treatment and staff. 
25758 This hotel is located in a great area. The rooms were clean and the staff very professional. Great deal for the price. 
25759 We stood a penthouse suite. Nicely set up, very clean. We had a great stay. 
25760 Excellent experience. Room roomy and tidy. No noise from the road (8th floor). Great Bathroom with complete set of accessories.Fantastic location: exit of Grand Central on Lexington. 5 minutes walking from shuttle bus to JFK. Personnel very friendly and helpful. 
25761 We were quite high up so the view out of the window was good Liked Chicago very much loved millenium park. Parking in the surrounding area was poor. Understand the coach driver had to move the coach in the middle of the night. 
25762 Overall great place to stay. Location is very convenient and the rooms were clean. Perfect for A short business trip and great for a weekend stay in new York. 
25763 Dit hotel ligt op 5 minuten van time square, subway,lekkere eettentjes,broadway te veel om op te noemen. Goede bedden, schoon en kamers goed ingericht, koelkast magnetron en TV. Heb je een kamer aan de straat kant dan hoor je het verkeer. Dit hotel is zeker een aanrader. 
25764 Lolita the front desk clerk was very rude to me when i checked in. She gave me attitude and disrespect 
25765 hotel ottimo da tutti i punti di vista! situato in posizione veramente centrale, stanze silenziose e pulite (purtroppo alcune senza alcuna vista!), colazione soddisfacente, personale disponibile e gentile, fermata della metropolitana vicinissima. la prossima volta che decidiamo di rivisitare new york sicuramente sceglieremo di nuovo questo hotel! 
25766 We had a room in the executive floor...small, with an old and noisy TV, with a dismal bathroom. Elevators were old and crowded. Breakfast in the executive lounge was terrible, you had to queue up before getting a table, and for what? for some coffee, industrial bread and an egg...bleah 
25767 My husband and I s tayed here for two nights before leaving on my honeymoon. We checked in very late and checked out very early; the staff was very accommodating. The rooms are small and dark when the curtains are drawn, enabling you to sleep all day. 
25768 Stayed at London NYC for 5 nights great location food great room very spacious myself hubby and 16 year old daughter and her fav boy band were also staying so she was elated great staff very helpful 
25769 muy caro, las instalaciones viejas e insalubres parecen de carcel, los 2 recepcionistas que me atendieron groseros y despotas,, en las fotos parece la habitacion decente pero no, NO LO RECOMIENDO POR NADA 
25770 Everything about our stay at this hotel was perfect from valet service to checkout!!! 
25771 This hotel is at the Galleria in Houston and provides many options of things to do. They have a very large and well equipped fitness center. There is free and convenient parking in the garage. Breakfast at the Daily Grill was great. Rooms are large and well furnished. 
25772 this is the third time iv been to new york in 6 months...i have stayed here twice..room was very clean and cosy..staff were great.great location.and will stay here again 
25773 Great hotel, location is amazing.... Only downside was the heavy price tag... But would go again perhaps midweek to save $$$ 
25774 clean, friendly staff & great location, overall i enjoy everything that the Radisson Martinque has to offer - keep up the great work and thank you for making my stay enjoyable 
25775 Husband and i love this hotel. Location is perfect we were right in the middle of time square. I stayed here a couple of years ago during New Years. We would definately recomend this hotel again and again. 
25776 Very spacious and quiet rooms. Friendly staff. Shopping mall next door 
25777 Don't think I've ever stayed in Manhattan without hearing street noise and our room was virtually soundproof. I woke up and forgot I was in Times Square! The room was spacious and cOmfortable and very clean. I highly reccommend this hotel! 
25778 Mit dem Crown Plaza haben wir eine gute Wahl getroffen. Aus dem 40igsten Stock gab es eine wunderbare Aussicht auf den Time Square (insbesondere bei Nacht). Es war ein optimaler Ausgangspunkt, um New York zu erkunden. Immer nach einem Zimmer in den oberen Etagen Fragen und den Tip nicht vergessen! 
25779 This was a great hotel. We were unable to stay at the Essex House as we usually prefer. The Palace was just great. The rooms were spotless, the service is excellent. Location is great! However, it is a bloody fortune! 
25780 We enjoyed our weekend stay at the Hilton. The rooms are compact but the recently refurbished interiors feel elegant. We received excellent service and the location is ideal. 
25781 Pick-up from the airport worked well. The hotel has no restaurant so we ate in the nearby Hilton. Spacious room, comfortable bed. Never managed to get cold water in the sink. Breakfast buffet of yoghourts, cereals, muffins, juices and hot drinks (waffle maker also available). 
25782 estupendo hotel ,las habitaciones grandes y muy cerca de Times Square y central park 
25783 this is a real nice place to stay quiet clean very comfortable , small but perfect 10 poins designed 
25784 This was a busy busy hotel but the staff was always very accommodating. Beds were comfortable and bathroom was very nice. Especially liked the lighted make up mirror! Very convenient to downtown shopping and sightseeing. 
25785 Good location almost opposite Penn Station. Unlike some Manhattan hotels at least my room on 23rd floor was not small. A bit brownish in character, but that is perhaps part of the old style. Much appreciated managements response to my complaint about noisy ac. 
25786 When we checked into this hotel we were given a room with a times square view even though we didn't request it! We stayed on the 28th floor and the room was nice. It was agreat stay. 
25787 Very good Hotel to stay in the center of Time Square. great place to combine work and leisure. a very good service and staff very friendly and always ready to help and suggest places to visit. 
25788 Tthe room was not large, but it was just fine for two adults. The bathroom was well organized and well laid out. A breakfast, even just muffins and yogurt, would have been helpful. Free internet access would have been an easy addition 
25789 Es importante tener presente que es hotel de viajeros y de bajo costo por lo que el mantenimiento del hotel es un poco descuidado, en mi caso que solo lo utilizo para pasar la noche no me quejo, ya que lo que hay a su alrededor es bastante importante. 
25790 Back in the big apple after a few years of absence. I got what I expected from a Westin Hotel: convenient location, quiet room, very comfortable bed and excellent overall service. Suitable for both for your business and family travel. 
25791 Hotel is clean and TK was very helpful! Had many recommendations for restaurants and sent complimentary snacks which made you feel welcome. 
25792 Staff was extremely helpful. The rooms were large, comfortable, very clean, and attractive. Amenities-including fitness room, pool, and sauna were very well-maintained. The inclusive breakfast had a wide variety of choices. I would definitely stay here again. 
25793 Great location, stiff price... Hole in hotelroom floor???? But all in all worth a stay.... Slooooooow elevators... 3 min walk to Times Square, Carnegie hall 1 min walk.. Subway any direction 1 min walk...:))) 
25794 Although the room was small it was well equpped and the bed was extermely comfortable. The staff were extremely helpful and put right any problems within minutes. The location was ideal for sight seeing. I would stay again! Really good value for money 
25795 Very pretty lobby. Rooms have clearly not been updated in years. Peeing wallpaper, a little grime here and there, etc. Not dirty, but not terribly nice. Add an extra $15 a night for Internet. My stay was fine, but I would not stay here again. 
25796 Love the Kimpton hotels and this one did not disappoint! Great location and helpful staff. I would stay here again! 
25797 Reserved this hotel with an awesome AAA rate. Good, central location two blocks from Michigan Ave. Our (early) check in was fast, and everyone has been super friendly. The pool is small, but pool area is nice and the hot tub is HOT! I would definitely stay here again! 
25798 Its a good hotel. Good location. The hotel is dated and it looks a bit worn but thats all a part of the charm. The staff is responsivbe. We had asked or a quiet room and did not get one. We complained and the issue was resolved the next day. 
25799 Location and hotel were excellent for NYC standards. Very pricey and small room but very clean and comfy beds and we had a view of the Empire State Building! Near red line stop on subway, convenient for travel in city! Comfortable stay. 
25800 We stayed here for 2 nights and had a terrific experience. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are pleasant and clean with comfortable beds. For the price, I don't think you could find a better place in Mid-town Manhattan. 
25801 Great stay, easy for walking to Times Square and surroudning areas. Rooms neat, modern and clean, staff friendly. 
25802 Location, price, staff, room, etc.... perfect. You cannot go wrong with this hotel. It is a gem. 
25803 We stayed here only for 3 nights and found the hotel to be better than the usual Marriott standard. Everything about the hotel was great incl. the prices of food and beverage. A hotel not to be missed and look no further if going to Houston. 
25804 22nd century hotel. Unbelievably modern. Super small rooms. Breathtaking view! Staff not so friendly, but it's a really cool hotel, if you're young, you'll love this place. Everything is so modern. The "lounge" is so cool! The beds move too! 
25805 Wonderful hotel in a fantastic location! We stayed here for two nights in February for our birthday and we could not have been happier! Great hotel, great location- No complaints!! 
25806 Perfect location, with view on the Times Square or Hudson River. Near to the theaters, subway, restaurants. 
25807 take some ear plugs as the seals around the air con unit have perished and the noise from outside will not let you sleep! comfortable beds clean, but badly in need of a refurb, bit shabby. 
25808 Verbrachten den Jahreswechsel 09/10 im Marriott Marquis....... Freundliches Personal, sauber und gepflegte Zimmer und die Lage einfach unbezahlbar!!! 
25809 Hotel is in a great spot across from Grant Park but is older and needs some upkeep. The lobby has tremendous charm and the rooms are comfortable. Concierge staff was accommodating. I loved the older style and ambiance which overlooked everything else! 
25810 Stayed here on a last minute notice. Hotel was very nice. Friendly staff. Great service. Room not my style but very comfortable. I would still glady stay here again if my usual choices are full. free wifi. Had breakfast at the national which was out of this world. good place. 
25811 Nothing to complain about at all. Gorgeous bathroom. Attentive service. Comfortable bed. Large room. Got a great deal on Priceline. 
25812 32nd floor, view of Time Square, great location and friends...what more could you ask for? Housekeeping was amazing and kept up with our needs; of which there were many with 4 women together. Walking distance to so many places we didn't know where to start. 
25813 Room was extremely tiny - even by NYC standards. Not enough space to even walk straight around the bed, let alone store any luggage. Staff couldn't have been more rude. Will never even consider staying here again. 
25814 Hotel photos are better than the actual room, a little bit far from most of the action and it can be pricey when compared to hotels in the area. 
25815 Typical Four Seasons standards - great service, rooms and facilities! No need to write a long review - if you stay here you will not be disappointed! If there was a 6 star option I would gladly give it this rating. 
25816 Beautiful hotel with very nicely renovated rooms which are very clean. Good sized rooms by Manhattan standards too! There is also a nice restaurant/bar downstairs. Very nice location and very nice staff. Highly recommend! 
25817 Very nice room: small but very clean, modern, new. Heating unit a bit noisy at night. Staff was friendly and helpful. Great location for staying in the financial district - Bowling Green subway only about two blocks away. 
25818 Stayed 3 days in August 2011 Desk staff vary but mostly friendly. Our room was tiny with barely space for luggage. Air conditioner very noisy. Met our requirements of being clean and well located 
25819 We stayed for 4 nights in November/December and couldn't have been more pleased with the value for money offered by this hotel. In a city of overpriced hotels, this offered a great location, friendly and accommodating staff and terrific value. Would definitely recommend it. 
25820 This is a very dirty shabby hotel. We were offered 3 rooms none of which were clean. The bathrooms all had mouldy tiles and peeling baths. We expected basic but not dirty. A very disappointing start to our holiday. 
25821 We stayed in a wonderful room, huge and clean. The staff is very accomodating and friendly, especially Robert at the front desk. I do wish there was a restaurant or lounge, however, there are so many within walking distance that it really doesn't matter much! 
25822 Clean, spacious, and groovy (kind of...). I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to stay in a good location with easy access to uptown or downtown. They score points for the self serve espresso machine, where you can make yourself all kinds of warm drinks... 
25823 Very poor room service - after 35 minutes trying to order a meal I gave up. 
25824 this courtyard right between Bryant Park and Times Square is perfect located if you have to be somewhere right in midtown. the hotel itself is nice; all of the amenities you'd expect in a courtyard. no surprises; very fair price for midtown Manhattan. will go back; easy. 
25825 the motel was awful, holes in the walls rats everywhere I DO NOT recommend 
25826 camas al principio muy blandas, pero muy comodas y buena habitacion en general. recomendado. 
25827 The price was cheap. The rooms were clean. The service was friendly. Location great. BUT, the duvet/blanket was HORRIBLE--lumpy (see the user photo I've posted), not warm, and not corrected by staff. Also loud club downstairs kind of annoying. Would recommend staying very high up. 
25828 Room was good size, clean. Hardwood floors, convenient to Empire State building. No frills lobby. Check-in staff friendly. Provided coupon to local Italian restaurant. Very good. 
25829 Nice big room which is hard to find in NYC. Very good location. You're centrally located in midtown 
25830 A rock solid upscale hotel with wonderful staff. The room was large, clean and perfectly functional, albeit lacking any particular charm. An excellent bed and huge TV. Better for business trips than couples (we were a couple). Brunch at Norma's was insanely good. 
25831 I didn't stay here because after I made reservations I cancelled them and they charge 20 dollars to make a reservation and do not refund your money. The hostel has terrible customer service. They should get audited and shut down for being so disgusing. 
25832 The location is great and service spot-on. I had a truly wonderful and effortless stay. Kudos to Eliecer Garcia who provided an much needed evening libation with my popcorn. Definitely will stay at Hilton Fashion District again and recommend to my friends without hesitation. 
25833 A little high priced but it's downtown Chicago. Easy checkin, great staff and it's in the heart of downtown Chicago 
25834 Everything was great but don't use the hotel garage (actually is not in the hotel, it's a valet), our car was scratched at 2 different place....and we have been trying to contact the garage administration for 3 weeks without success. 
25835 Yocasta was manager when we stayed. She refused to guarantee room cleaning after waiting 11am-8.30pm. If you pay inadvance this hotel is not interested in any room service. Do not pay in advance so that you do nor get nasty surprises. 
25836 At the center of NYC, entering this Hilton can feel a bit rough at night but you can walk to all the mid town attractions and subways. Staff has a NYC edge neg/pos. Great free breakfast for Hilton Honors members. Big rooms for NYC. 
25837 Mooi hotel op wandelafstand van Central Park. Mooie kamer, mooie badkamer. De handdoeken en lakens werden elke dag ververst. Gratis internet. Het personeel was heel vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Ik zou er zeker terugkeren. Aanrader! 
25838 travel back to airport was so easy from hotel. Only 1 turn and LESS traffic. Also multiple selections of restaurants reasonably priced in close proximity with minimal traffic hassel. Will come back as we often travel to Houston area to visit family 
25839 acceuil moyen, pas de frigo disponible en plein ete malgre de multiples demandes, note de telephonne astronomique 420 usd pour 5 appels de moins de 5 mn chacun vers l asie !!!! petit dejeuner hors de prix a eviter , bar du soir agreable 
25840 Very nice, clean hotel. Very nice and friendly stuff. Good location to walk everywhere downtown. 
25841 The rooms are small but good to share. Our room was somewhat dirty when we got there and the phone didn't work so we couldn't even call for it to be cleaned. Once fixed, though, it was fine. Comfy beds. great location walkable to central park. 
25842 You get what you pay for. Nothing fancy, but clean and very well located in vibrant Chelsea neighborhood. Cool Salsa dancing club downstairs too! 
25843 This was a trip for a special occasion and hotel staff were fantastic, making us feel really welcome. Nothing was a problem. The location for New Year was great. Hotel very central. Especially good for first time visitors as it is in the heart of Manhattan. Would definitely recommend. 
25844 Muse Hotel, New York. Perfectly located within 2 minute walk of Times Square. Staff extremely pleasant and helpful. Room was very large and well furnished. My partner was particularly impressed by the L'Occitaine toileteries. I would definately stay there again,when next i go to New York. 
25845 Great hotel. Terrific personal service. Comfortable bed. Good value. Would stay there again. 
25846 Fantastic location and extremely helpful and friendly staff. Very good restaurant and bar. Rooms clean and tidy, although ours was a little small and due for a re-fit. Over all very good value. 
25847 Checked in to spend one night, room was small which we expected but clean and crisp. The amenities were up to date and clean. I would stay there again, the staff were very helpful. Close to everything restaurants, Times Square and theatre. 
25848 Clean, close enough to walk to the Magnificent Mile, breakfast and enough food at dinner dinner to feed a family. For adults I recommend eating out at any great Chicago Restaurant. My daughter enjoyed her time at The American Girl Store just a short walk away. 
25849 Great location, very friendly staff. Hotel nothing really special but in a great spot. 
25850 All the other hotels were 150 plus for a hotel with bar. Stayed 3 nights and got 30% off. Great value. Looks like a new hotel. Tv had as many HD channels as I have at home. 
25851 New, modern, clean, stylish, European, great amenities (Keurig Coffees) and best of all totally convenient. The only negative was the $55 parking. I think the Chicago parking situation is a total rip-off to all those who travel. They should include the parking in the rates. 
25852 Great Staff! 100% Professionals and Great Smiles it really is the Staff that makes this place worth every penny. It was Great and Peaceful, If I am ever in the area again I know where I'm staying! thanks Everyone! 
25853 The location is unbeatable and the rooms are just my style - contemporary but super comfortable. 
25854 The hotel is currently experiencing some construction. Very basic amenities, nice breakfast offering. 
25855 Great location and very helpful staff. Asked for early check in if possible and they were very accomodating. Good breakfast and clean room. Will definitely stay here again. 
25856 Stayed one night. Close to Intercontinental Airport. Room was clean, quiet and well appointed. Locals told me not to wonder too far from the hotel on foot at night. 
25857 I am a New Yorker who now lives in Boston. I travel everywhere now. I love this hotel. The rooms, the service, the location, the people, the front desk people, the restaurant. The best! 
25858 The hotel was in a fantastic location, found the hotel staff very helpful, Rooms were spacious and cleaned everyday with fresh towels daily we asked for extra tea bags in the room which wasn't a problem. Would recomend this hotel to friends, would definately stay here again. 
25859 no noise - 10th floor no bedbugs great little breakfast place across the street isabella great location friendly door staff concierge helpful sign up for loyalty program and get coffee in am 
25860 The Affinia Manhattan was a nice treat. We found the lobby and elevators to be charming in an art decco way. The room we stayed in was fine - high ceilings gave the feel of a much larger room. The staff we all very friendly and helpful. 
25861 We have stayed at this hotel everytime we go to New York. I would recommend it to everyone. It is very clean, the location is ideal (block from Times Square), the staff are so helpful efficient. Great choice for anyone visiting New York. Thank you Hotel Mela :) 
25862 Very good situated, very friendly and helpul front desk. The room was very clean and whatever I needed was arranged very fast! Very small rooms, however this is not a big issue since we are in New York for the city and not for staying at the hotel!!!! 
25863 Good location and decent hotel overall. Beds are super comfy. 
25864 Camera pulita, cambio ascigumani ogni giorno, posizione ottima per visitare NYC. Consigliato 
25865 Estuve hospeda aqui por una semana y no tengo ninguna queja. Es un hotel muy formal, esta muy cerca de Grand Central, es silencioso y super limpio. Me volveria a hospedar aqui. 
25866 Everything about each of my stays at the Waldorf is always outstanding. However, the best part of each visit is the treatment that I get from Jackie in Guest Services- Diamond Reception. She makes each visit feel like I am returning home. 
25867 A great place to stay for our 3 night stay in NYC. The staff was superb and housekeeping exceptional. The park across from the hotel was perfect for our Starbucks. 
25868 The bath tub did not drain for hours and the corners were gross. There were cracks on the wall everywhere. However it was warm. The employees down stairs did not know New York at all. When asked where the nyairporter bus was located for pickup they had no idea. 
25869 I guess a garden view room would have been good - however, I was not in the room much during the day. 
25870 Excellent hotel, excellent location for sightseeing! Loved the hotel from the service to the spacious rooms, to the great breakfast! Would stay here again with no hesitation. 
25871 Stayed recently- much better than I expected. Still wouldn't want to pay the full rate for this hotel. Plus is that the rooms are huge (for NYC). 
25872 I loved this hotel. Very Elegant!! Was convienient to major attractions as well. Would definately stay here again. Near the Navy Pier. Merchandise Mart. connected to the Chicago Institute of Arts. Restaruants inside the hotel. Just an overall GREAT stay with Great views of the city!! :-) 
25873 The staff here really made it special. They went out of their way to be sure we had every question answered about where to go and when. Typical Garden Inn, with the perfect location. Pigalle was a leap above the food at most hotels. 
25874 I asked for a quiet room and got one. The location was within walking distance of some very good restaurants and attractions The hotel bar and adjacent cafe are severely overpriced with below average product---go elsewhere for dood and drink 
25875 My wife and I stayed at the Doubletree March 25-27th.... Everything was great from the check-in Friday until the express check-out Sunday....The room was very clean and the bed was very very comfy...Nice large FS TV... Bathroom was small but clean.....very good towels....Maid staff was great..Anything we needed... 
25876 We stayed there during Hurricane Sandy. The staff was outstanding. Even without power it wasn't too bad. They tried their best to make us comfortable. We were there two days before the storm and enjoyed our stay even though the rooms were very, very small. 
25877 We were very happy with the hotel and the location.It was close to good restaurants and foreign consulates where we had business. The consierge service was friendly. The hotel is quiet and clean. we will stay here again. 
25878 stayed one night to attend a funeral. clean, comfortable, quiet. only complaint was the broken hair dryer and the inability to close the drapes. felt a little vulnerable with just sheers over the window. 
25879 We had a wonderful time. Our concierge Laurelin was extremely helpful urging our stay. I would definitely recommend this hotel. She helped us check int our flight and was very professional. The s'more refreshments were wonderful. 
25880 Very goodhotel. The room is very spacious with a kitchen that you can use with no problem. The staff is very kind. The only thing that can be improved is the breakfast.Overall good!! 
25881 We needed just one night before a conference at 69th & Amsterdam. The Beacon was walkable and very good choice: pleasant staff, perfect price, clean & comfy roomy room with a view on 18th floor. We will stay again for longer to explore the groovy upper west side! 
25882 What do you expect for $99 a night in New York? The elevator is tiny, the staff maybe not the most friendly, but passable. The sheets and beds were clean, the shower clean. A little rough around the edges, but in NYC you cannot beat the price. 
25883 very nice hotel and nice people. the staff was very attentive. only problem was Bed Bugs!. i was itching every morning. 
25884 Disgusting and Dirty! Very rude front desk clerk. Urine scent everywhere!! Gross kitchen and Moldy bathroom! Would much much rather stay at the YMCA, hostel or even the subway. 
25885 Es un hotel muy bien ubicado, andando a 4 minutos del Times Square. Es un hotel grande, con un gran hall. Las habitaciones son bastante amplias, aunque ya se ve un poco antiguo. El servicio de habitaciones solo limpian la habitacion, pero no colocan nada, como hacen en otros hoteles. 
25886 This hotel is so beautiful and the service was fantastic. My friend and I wanted a weekend getaway and this was the perfect spot. I can't wait to come again!! Mindy Stein 
25887 This is more than you want or expect from a hotel. Quick and easy to get to restaurants and to the airport. Sitting around the pool at night to relax was another suprise; nice and quiet. The bed made for a great night sleep. 
25888 Great stay. Clean Room. Nice and new furniture. Very Confortable bed. Very Luxury hotel in the heart of Manhattan. For sure I will return and recommend to my friends. 
25889 A great position, nothing too far. Bigger hotel than I thought, ut we were very pleasantly surprised! 
25890 Es cierto, que el precio no es muy alto y que esta bastante bien situado, pero yo estuve alojada en otros hoteles con similares condiciones tanto las habitaciones, las instalaciones y el servicio son bastante mejores. No esta mal calidad precio, pero hay mejores opciones. 
25891 Nice remodeled room, great concierge service (Alfredo!), very good location- near yet far enough away from Michigan Avenue. Good workout facility. Enjoyed my stay, would gladly repeat. bar and restaurant only so-so. 
25892 Wait till construction over. Up at crack of dawn, no sleep and long drive ahead. Marriott said nothing at check in so call ahead. Other than construction great room for price. 
25893 Stayed at this hotel in the past and it was always shabby. They have renovated it and the rooms are much nicer. Public spaces are better as well. Worth re-trying if you were disappointed in previous stays. 
25894 Non fatevi ingannare dall'appariscente hall... Le stanze sono piccole, il bagno vecchio e poco accessoriato! Aria condizionata rumorosa, no frigo bar, poca pulizia! Per chi e' abituato a viaggiare ad un certo livello decisamente da evitare!!! 
25895 Great hotel, brilliant location! Staff pleasant & helpful! Room was grand size, 2 double beds, small bathroom but perfectly fine for the time we spent in the room! Very well equipped substantial gym! 
25896 The hotel is very well situated between Times Square & Central Park. The check-in was quick and efficient. We had requested for upgrades but it was expensive. The rooms were small. But overall I would recommend the hotel when looking for accommodation in Manhattan at a budget price. 
25897 Nice hotel on the Magnificent Mile, clean rooms, friendly service, walk to cta Red line, walk to shops/ amenities. Hotel is somewhat dates but has lots of history....and has been featured in many movies/ TV shows.... 
25898 The Yotel was a comfortable, fun hotel, but make sure you know what you're getting. The regular rooms are pretty small; they felt more like European rooms in size. Everything was brand new, though, and the location in Midtown Manhattan was great. 
25899 This was a fantastic choice: Especially great service, extremely clean and updated, fantastic location. 
25900 The location was amazing. The concierge was really great. She pointed out a wonderful breakfast restaurant that was within walking distance. The room was clean and the bed really comfortable. The only complaint was they didn't tell us when booking the pool would be closed. 
25901 Like every W I have been to, I loved it! the concierge was extremely helpful and personal, the room was just another level. We were upgraded thanks to our SPG status. Great location as well, right downtown. 
25902 I have stayed here for three nights. Hotel is alfhearted about amenities: you'll find a bathrobe in your room, but no slippers. Good bed, which I find important, and that's about all I remember from it. The hotel does not offer anything 'special', it lacks character, I think. 
25903 Rooms are great, the decor downstairs was great, but it was so frustrating that they didn't get the elevators working for the first day. I might try this place once more as it is well located and a bit unsual. 
25904 Enjoyed our stay here and for us, the location is excellent. The hotel tries a bit too hard to be "hip" and takes itself a bit too seriously in this regard. HOWEVER, it is still a great place to stay. 
25905 Net en modern hotel in de rustige wijk Gramercy. Binnen 10 minuten sta je in de drukte van Broadway en andere wijken, maar de wijk zelf is wat rustiger ( wel veilig!) Het hotel zelf is modern ingericht, schoon en de service is prima. 
25906 I like staying at Hamptons andHilton Garden Inns so I knew what to expect here. I thought the rooms were smaller than the other NYC Hilton properties I have stayed at but I've stayed in smaller. Great location. 
25907 The hotel was excellant. The suite was great with the living room, bedroom and large bathroom. We even had two TV's The staff was outstanding with quick service and very helpfull. I just wish Times Square was less busy. It was probably the time of the year. 
25908 Hotel was good, but one guy which his name is Guillermo made this experience is amazing ! ask for him, he will do his best to make you comfortable. 
25909 Great hotel at reasonable price. A bit far from downtown and about 30 M from airport but free parking and good food covers it. Overall, a recomeded place in Sugarland area if you're on business or pleasure. 
25910 I just stayed at this property and was pleased with every aspect. The bath tubs could use a remodel and they don't have a club room on the executive level, but other than that it was great. I walked to the mall and to eat every night. 
25911 This hotel has been updated and is very comfortable. Staff is great with a wonderful breakfast. 
25912 The hotel was average with the staff stingy in giving stuff like tooth pastes etc. But the rooms were clean, the food facility was not good and the laundry was delayed. The general stay was comfortable over all, except that I had to eat out all the time. 
25913 Het was net een bezemkast! 3,5/3,5 meter groot maar het uitzicht doet je alles weer vergeten. Alles was wel schoon en de mensen vriendelijk en zeer goed gelegen. ook proberen ze overal een slaatje uit te slaan. (taxi) 
25914 Was the cheapest "normal" hotel i could find. The location was great, room was clean, lobby was nice, and theres a consierge. Only complaint was drain in bathtub was pretty bad, and there was about 4 inches of standing water while showering. 
25915 A very nice hotel! I love the beds at the Garden Inns. My back felt much better than it does after sleeping on my waterbed at home! The hotel is close to the theater district and Times Square. Everyone was helpful, and I look forward to returning!! 
25916 Everything about the London Hotel in NYC was outstanding: location, price, accommodation, staff, food. All first rate at a reasonable price compared to its peers. 
25917 Nice room, though it was starting to show its age. 2 out of 3 evenings had no heat until after 10:00PM. Smoke alarm battery had to be replaced to stop annoying beep. Staff was pleasant and generally responsive. Excellent location for dining. 
25918 Very large rooms, helpful congierge, easy to walk to Grand Central area,Rockerfeller Plaza, an even Times Square. 
25919 Nice spacious double room, helpful staff and convenient location. 
25920 This was our 4th stay at this hotel. we have always enjoyed the hotel and service, and highly recommend staying there to anyone visiting New York. 
25921 good location and great service. However, the hotel had a cramped feeling both in the lobby and rooms. The bed was uncomfortable and construction starts promptly at 6:50 am outside many of the windows. I like Kimpton but this one is not one of their best. 
25922 Great hotel, great service....friendly people, nice workout room....nice bar...nice restaurant...beautiful bathroom w/ shower AND tub. One complaint: Shower was underpowered. Dave 
25923 Everything went like clockwork. Got rooms we requested. Hotel is immaculate. Rooms nice with comfortable beds. Breakfast good. Staff was extraordinarily pleasant and helpful. 
25924 Title says it all. It's right there! Rooms were noisy.. I don't normally have issues at any hotels, but this one was very noisy. People were nice, food was good. 
25925 Wonderful location and great service. Room decor is a bit tired and television sets could be upgraded to larger screens and HD service. Butler service was sublime. Near shops and restaurants. Bathroom is huge compared to other hotels. 
25926 Great value, slightly off the beaten track but close to the restaurants on 8th and 9th, rooms are large for NYC modern and comfortable with everything you need ... Free Wine hour a positive and free tea and coffee in the mornings a nice touch 
25927 We stayed in the Millenium Broadway for 5 nights and had wonderful service from all the staff. They attended to all our requests with the utmost of care. Would highly recomend this hotel, it is also in an excellent postion. 
25928 This hotel ticks all the boxes. Nice room, nice design, good showers, clean and great location. Its a nice place to stay. 
25929 The hotel front desk turned my wife away although she had a valid and paid hotels.com reservation. I have never had a problem with hotels.com before. Nice work, Hilton. : ( 
25930 I stayed for one night in this hotel and was satisfied: price is good and the room was large and the bed comfortable. For going to the Galeria Mall you need a car. On site convenient store very practical. I would stay again. 
25931 This hotel is very friendly: We arrived 3 hours before check in time. They gave us a room free of charge. Kimbely Hotel is very quiet, clean and its location is outstanding. The relationship quality-price is perfect. I highly recommend it!!!! 
25932 Reserved a non smoking room when i arrived only smoking rooms were available. I was given a can of lysol to cover the smell, bath tub was filled with water ,cable didn't work,burn stains on cover,flat pillows. 
25933 The hotel is old, elevatores do not work, room terrible. Never been there again 
25934 This hotel is a long walk to Time Square, 2 big blocks from the nearest subway station. TV reception is on and off every 5 minutes. Do not expect warm friendly host at reception. However, the restroom is spotless, and they have microwave in the room. 
25935 A very clean, quiet, upmarket hotel with very efficient and friendly staff in an excellent location. The most comfortable hotel bed I have ever slept in !! 
25936 Wonderful hotel! Wonderful location!!!!! Everyone was great to us!!!!! View was amazing. Great price as well. 
25937 This Sheraton Hotel is Clean, Economical, Comfortable,Quiet and just Excellent! 
25938 I enjoyed my stay the facility was great. However I have had the toughest time getting thru accounting to reverse the erroneous billing on my card. They told me it will take 3 days. Since then have not been able to speak to a human. 
25939 Loved this hotel. The staff was great. Everything was clean. my daughter loved the pool. Other reviews indicated long food lines for the free breakfast buffet, but we did not have any problems. Everything was fresh. 
25940 Rooms were great and very spacious, ig bed and comfy mattress. Location was a fab. Prices a bit high as breakfast was not included but then again you are in times square! 
25941 My girlfriends and i went to see Hugh Jackman on Broadway and the hotel was the perfect location. The hotel is clean and I especially love the heavenly beds!!!! You can walk out the door and your near everything. You won't be disappointed. 
25942 Pros: great location, good value, friendly and helpful staff. Cons: 'lake-view' room is an optimistic assessment of the word 'view': you could see water, I'll give them that. Verdict: In its class, a very good hotel. 
25943 I stayed here for a week with my husband and 2 college age kids. The room was a good size for New York, the location was perfect, and the staff was friendly and helpful. I highly recommend this hotel. 
25944 A great find. Worth taking the 15 mins on the subway to get anywhere you want to go. Love the friendly staff. So NOT NYC!!! 
25945 We stayed in this lovely hotel 6 nights. It is located near the subway station and this is very helpful for sightseeing in the city. The hotel is clean and comfortable. Thanks a lot to the Front Office staff. Best regards Egemen & Yuliya Yurek 
25946 We hebben 5 nachten in dit hotel doorgebracht. Door de prima ligging waren alle bezienswaardigheden goed te bereiken. Omdat het zo dicht bij Times Square ligt, zijn we daar vaak nog eventjes geweest. Erg gezellig. Zeker een aanrader! 
25947 This is my forth visit to St Marks since 2007! This place is consistently clean and always value for money. Location is fab. Stayed in the suite which consisted of two adjoining bedrooms each with their own ensuite bathroom. Bargain at $200 a night! 
25948 estuve en days con un amigo en enero del 2009 el hotel esta bien para llegar y dormir,tiene justo de bajo del hotel una linea de metro que t lleva al mismo centro,el personal del hotel muy amable te ayudan en todo lo que pueden,yo volveria!!! 
25949 The staff were very friendly and really helped us planning our days and find the very best resaturtants. Thanks for a nice stay @Night! We'll be back. 
25950 this hotel was just perfect for us and I am now planning another trip back to NY just so I can stay there - it made the whole trip! Great touches, great style, perfect location,all good. 
25951 This Hotel is newly renovated, our room was lovely and the staff couldn't have been nicer. We love this quiet location that is close enough to walk to the theatre and shopping districts. We can't wait to stay here again! 
25952 You are in the middle of Times Square. The view is spectacular. If you get a Times Square view you don't wanna sleep because there is always something to see. Junior's, shopping, and off the tourist path is right there. The beds really are the most comfortable. 
25953 I stayed here for 2 nights with my sister, this hotel is in a great location right opposite port authority bus station a few minutes walk from times square. Rooms were clean and modern and free breakfast was yummy with good views from the sky lounge. 
25954 its like a extended stay america. the rooms are quite the same. view is nothing to write home about. too expensive for what it offers 
25955 Charming rooms. A litle old but well kept. Impeccable service and staff. Overnight laundry. Excellent restaurants. Close to central park. Greatvfor business travel. 
25956 great location for everything. lobby was a little warm and dark, but it was okay. The bed is queen sized but it seemed a little short. I am 5' 11" and unless I put my head on the headboard my feet hung off the bed. 
25957 This is our fourth time staying at this hotel we fly from scotland once or twice a year we would not go to any other hotel all the staff are really nice and helpful and its close to all the ammenities looking forward to our return soon janet sharkey 
25958 Nice quiet hotel. Very basic - small lobby, good breakfast, reasonably priced for NYC. The rooms are decently sized for NYC, though the bathrooms are small. 
25959 Hotel is a great value. The hotel has retained its Art Deco feel in the public areas, but the rooms are modern, clean, and well furnished. Staff is friendly and helpful. Good coffee shop. Location is good, subway stop right outside. 
25960 room was clean,we were surprised by all the amenties hair dryer coffee pot/with coffee .iron with ironing board. the only prolem we had was with the people up stairs very noisey 
25961 Sono stato in questa struttura nel Novembre 2012 prenotando qualche giorno prima. Hotel grandissimo con centinaia di camere ma dcisamente mediocre, se non fosse per la posizione centralissima sarebbe scarso. Le camere piccole e freddine, la hall sembrava un porto di mare e il prezzo decisamente elevato rispetto all' offerta. 
25962 Everyone in hotel locked out of room. The staff had no idea what to do. They made us wait in the hallways for one person with a key card to come and unlock rooms. Never stay at this hotel! They have no idea what they are doing! 
25963 Great location with good value. Clean modern rooms. Very attentive staff. 
25964 We reisden met een groep van 6 personen verdeeld over 3 kamers op de 11e verdieping. Prima kamers (2 kamers ge-upgrade, wel aan te bevelen!) en zeer vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. Super locatie en zouden dit hotel zeker weer uitkiezen in de toekomst. 
25965 I spent 3 nights in this hotel. The rooms were cozy and very clean. The location is perfect. The only negative aspect is the breakfast. The breakfast room is so small that when you get there there is a handwritten waiting list!! 
25966 stayed at this hotel over the weekend of the 9th of April. I was rather apprehesive, but was most pleasently surprised! Room was a nice size, bathroom clean and large, large tv, complimentary breakfast and perfect location. Staff was pleasant and most effecient. 
25967 De eerste kamer die ik had gekregen had ik niet geboekt, zeer klein, uitzicht op muur, luidruchtige airco, vieze koelkast. Tweede kamer, zelf om gevraagd, was groter, bed slordig opgemaakt en kamer slordig schoongemaakt. 
25968 Very friendly service by doorman and front desk. When they heard it was our 35th wedding anniversary, they upgraded us to a nicer room and breakfast was also included. Great location! Would recommend to anyone wanting to enjoy Central Park area of Manhatten. 
25969 Very clean and comfortable. Friendly staff. Beautiful outside bar. The only problem we had was that the hotel was not clear about the daily internet usage fee when signing on to the internet on my laptop. 
25970 Spent 4 nights at this hotel last week to celebrate my 50th birthday. Cannot fault the hotel at all, the most comfortable hotel bed I've ever slept in! The service was excellent, the staff were friendly, everything was perfect,a will definitely be back. 
25971 The hotel is in a great location but I feel the price is too expensive. Make sure to take advantage of the free Acura car service. The lobby is great spot to people watch. I would stay here again if the price was right. 
25972 Beautiful Hotel right on the water. The late night walks cant be beat. Very close to everything. The staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Will be going back and staying here. 
25973 I really love this hotel. It's on a great spot on Times Square. We had a renovated room. Excellent breakfast. Would go back there. 
25974 Nothing was exceptional about the hotel--pretty average. Bed was okay, rooms were small, price was very high. Location was close to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, Central Park and Fifth Avenue. 
25975 I can't make this up. In the middle of the night, we heard a loud gurrgle a then sewage, and I mean all kinds, shot up. They changed our room but in the next room, the sink drain was very very slow. I'm thinking this whole hotel may blow. 
25976 I travelled there for business, people are so so but the hotel SUCKS! do yourself a favor and not stay there. 
25977 Excellent position. Not too noisy. Near to all amenities. Helpful staff. Clean room with good lighting for reading 
25978 This was our first stay there, but probably not the last one. The hotel was great, location wise but also when it comes to the friendliness of the staff. Lot's of good bars and restaurants around the hotel make it simple to find something that accomodates every taste. 
25979 Get a room on the fifth floor. You sleep in your own room, but the room ist one of 40-80 small rooms on the level. So you can hear any Persons on the floor there you are sleeping. If you can, find an other hotel... 
25980 Great hotel, in an excellent location. Free breakfast was a real bonus and the rooms / staff and facilities were all very good. Would stay here again. 
25981 This is the second time we have stayed here. Great hotel, clean and well run. Ideally situated for Times square and the theatre district. 
25982 Great spot to get to anything 
25983 Hip place to go have drinks and food 
25984 Just a fun place to visit 
25985 The Fairfield Inn New York Manhattan/5th Avenue is a great new hotel. It was very clean, the staff very accommodating and even though the rooms were small it was very quaint and had everything you need. Breakfast was good and the location great (37th Avenue between 5th & 6th). 
25986 We used to live in NYC and returned for a wedding. The Westin is newish, very clean, modern rooms, AMAZING bed. Staff is very polite. Pocket door of bathroom didn't close firmly for privacy but other than that no complaints. 
25987 The lobby of the hotel is breathtaking. I enjoyed my stay. The room/bathroom seemed outdated. I felt as if the building had previously been an old apartment building. 
25988 Great location, close to everything! Breathtaking view from the window. Change linens every day! Very comfy bed! Immaculate service. Free Wi-Fi, but not very stable(( No coffee/tea making facilities in the room, a bit disappointing, but not a big deal. 
25989 Room was decent. Bathroom decent. Bed just ok. Food at hotel was horrible and the waitress was rude. I would check around. Seemed like lots of hotels around. Chicago is clean and the folks are very nice. 
25990 Pulito, silenzioso, personale gentile e disponibile 
25991 If you want a hotel right in midtown this is it. Close to Central Park, Times Square, Carnige Hall etc... Nothing too special, overall the room was clean, bed was comfy (no bed bugs). I booked one night for $96. I'd stay again but wouldn't pay over $150 a night. 
25992 Minimalista ed informale come tutti gli hotel della catena.Pulito. Ubicato in una zona emergente soprattutto per la moda:Soho!Nota di merito per il personale davvero disponibile e cordiale, per noi sventurati cui avevano smarrito le valigie - causa sciopero British Airways! 
25993 Everything about this hotel is awesome. The lobby, the rooms, the food, the location. My favorite was the steam room. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. Definetly worth the price. 
25994 Great location; great brand; still solid value. This hotel has had its ups and downs and is now trending back up. Rooms are clean and somewhat spartan, which some of us like. Professional staff - visible when you need them, invisible when you don't. Food is good if pricey. 
25995 We stayed here after New Year's Day and had a great time. We reserved 2 adjoining rooms for 3 nights for our family. Staff was friendly and helpful. International guests in hotel. Huge breakfast buffet included in the room deal. Perfect location for anything in Manhattan. 
25996 What a great hotel for the family or business in the heart of downtown Chicago! The rooms are enormous, and the morning breakfast is fantastic. The hotel takes pets, too. I'll definitely be staying there with my family the next time we have a Chicago getaway! 
25997 Most of the staff was very friendly, they where defininately accommodating to my needs. Breakfast was included and good. Be ready for the lines. The beds Were amazing, comfy pillows, clean linen, and the room was spacious. I would definately return and recommend. 
25998 I have stayed at this hotel twice with family on returns from chicago back home. The little restaurant inside this hotel is a great place to eat, lovely food and friendly staff. Although this hotel is situated right on the airport, it was not noisy. Would stay again! 
25999 Great experience - from the staff to the hotel to the restaurant to the coffee bar. We'll stay here forever when we visit Chicago. 
26000 My 4th stay at Salisbury.....it may not be as well known or as luxurious as some, but the location is great....employees strive to be helpful. NO sign of bedbugs. Location is unrivaled. Anthony's Oven Baked Pizza, one door down, has better spaghetti than Little Italy. 
26001 Elizabeth is a great professional front desk advisor. She reflects the positive attitude of the park central hotel. During my stay , I found her a great advisor and facilitator. Thanks to her help we enjoyed our stay in the hotel. Thanks Elizabeth 
26002 Location is in Chinatown. My room was extremely noisy. Window did not close well. As I tried I got my hand dirty. Breakfast cost $24 for 2 and was horrible. Fruit was uneatable, eggs were cold, no doughnuts, cakes or anything good. Do not go there. 
26003 New hotel boasting excellent and modern facilities. Rooms are a little small though, but not at all unusual for NY. Staff is very helpful and friendly. Good location and value for money... Will definitely stay there when returning to NY!!! 
26004 Comfortable, Great Location. Problem Arose with Safe, which was dealt with above and beyond what was expected, to our benefit. Would certainly stay there again. 
26005 We had a wonderful stay at Park79. The staff was very courteous and professional. They were always eager to accommodate us. 
26006 This was my second time staying here and the services is great. The staff at the first desk was helpful and kind. The staff knows how to take care of their customers. The hotel is close to everything and I would stay here again very soon. 
26007 Just great overall. We went with a group discount for work reasons, and the place was fantastic. Will be back there again. 
26008 Awesome location right in the heart of the theatre district. Friendly staff, clean room. For a place that is about to close for renovation, it looked just fine. Maybe there are other rooms that are a little grungy (as others have reported) but ours was fine. 
26009 This is a perfect hotel for an ORD layover. The location is great, very convenient right across from the terminal. Service from staff is good. Food is ok, not great though. The rooms were comfortable and quiet. Can recommend this hotel. 
26010 Just the front of the motel looks very friendly and so it is the inside. Very helpful staff, clean rooms and a good location to visit Houston an its sourroundings. Thank you for this nice experience. 
26011 I have visited this hotel a few times. I have enjoyed each stay at the westin hotel!! Excellent customer service from the staff there with a perfect location in downtown Chicago. Would defnately recommend!!! 
26012 The elevators are dirty, no one seems to vacuum on the weekends, and the quality of the bed linens have decreased since Wyndham took over the hotel from Crowne Plaza in March/April. 
26013 I had a great time at Park Central hotel! This was my second time at Park Central and what I like about this hotel is it's location... It's near of everything: central park, times square, subway, 5th ave! Elizabet, the reception manager, was great and very helpful! 
26014 Could not think of a better value for NYC. Central location, clean, good value, child-friendly. WHat else could we ask for? 
26015 Nettes Hotel, guenstig und gut zu erreichen. Die Anfahrt ist etwas schwierig da die Adresse dem Highway identisch ist aber wenn man diese Huerde ueberwunden hat kann man ein Hotel mit gutem Preis/Leistungsverhaeltnis ohne Hoehen und Tiefen erwarten. 
26016 Front Desk Staff were AWESOME, especially my Check-In Rep!!! Pleasant, efficient, knowledgeable...throughout my two days there, they NEVER failed to greet me by title/surname -- without prompting and without mispronunciatiation...CONSUMMATE Professionals!!!! 
26017 This was by far the best hotel I have ever stayed in. View, service and clean. People say to much noise but it didn't bother us at all. We had a times square view but I'm sure all views are amazing. Our room was on the. 22nd floor 
26018 I traveled with friends on short notice and managed a terrific room during a friend's wedding weekend. The staff was terrific and accommodated our every need. The hotel is centrally located with easy access to all you need in the way of shopping and dining. Terrific! 
26019 Excellent location, friendly staff and large well appointed rooms. will definitely stay here again!! 
26020 staff friendly and helpful, room was cozy and efficient, clean nicely appointed, location great for theaters and the neighborhood, easy access to subways 
26021 will return 
26022 The Mansfield hotel is really close to Time Square 3-5 minutes on foot 
26023 Is a lovely hotel, we were 7 friends occupying 4 rooms and I have to say we had a lovely time 
26024 I will visit the hotel again although the rooms are rather small but clean 
26025 Great location. Rooms decent size for New York. Elevators slow but that's the only complaint. Good gym for a hotel. Hotel check in on the 8th floor which is a little weird. Rooms clean and pretty quiet considering you're on top of Times Square. 
26026 This is a great hotel, great location and I had the best nights sleep ever!!! 
26027 Great location and staff. Very confortable, besides medium size room (double queen bed). Near metro station and 3 min walking distance from Empire St Building. A lot of restaurants, bars and coffees nearby. We would definitely come back. 
26028 Excellent..... Great food, Great Staff, Great Stay 
26029 This hotel was perfect! Location couldn't be more central, overlooking Empire State Building, great food places within walking distance and fab breakfast! Would definitely stay again! 
26030 Amazing views, nice, clean rooms, and a fantastic roof top bar. If you can get this for a decent price, choose this over any other "tourist"-hotels in Manhattan. 
26031 Staff was friendlly and helpful. Rooms were very nice w/ microwave and mini refrigerator in room. Close to all major subway lines and across the street from a market and a deli. Would definetely recommend and stay there again. 
26032 I'm not going to write a long review on this hotel. All I will say is that the design is awesome, the location is awesome, the staff is awesome.... I think you need to experience it!! 
26033 Thank you for advising us to book in the Grand Hyatt: Location is excellent, cleaniless of the room was very good, staff very welcoming. In one world: We will surely come back and recommend it to our friends. 
26034 Stayed @this location, which btw is pet friendly, for several days while visiting NYC. The location is perfect, near to Chinatown, Little Italy, TriBeca - great for walking! Staff was very friendly, very helpful. Comfortable beds! Smaller boutique type rooms. Will def book again!! 
26035 El hotel esta muy cuidado, son detallistas muy bien comunicado, en general muy bien. 
26036 If you don't want to walk too far for Time Square and Broadway this is a great location 
26037 We stayed here a year ago in an old room and had the worst experience. They have improved alot. The rooms are VERY modern now. It was much better and more enjoyable this time. Much cleaner and nice tvs finally! Was a bit loud 
26038 Great hotel. Quiet, ckean and very secure. Friendly and helpful staff. Far enough away from the main road so there is no traffic noise but close enough for convenience for shopping and numerous restaurants. Would recommend. 
26039 dark rooms but eveyting overall good 
26040 The staff were friendly. The service was really good and the view was amazing. I would stay there again. 
26041 The location is excellent, rooms are smallish but clean, and there was a bit of traffic noise from the 9th floor. Nothing about the hotel really stood out as exceptional. 
26042 Great hotel along with excellent customer service and a terrific front desk staff. I was totally impressed with this hotel. 
26043 After checking in with a TOTALLY CLUELESS clerk,I was finally given a decent room and a kind word from asst manager Jacqueline... The hotel is nice,but the planners created very small rooms which can be annoying after a day.Fortunately our stay was for one night....Thanks Jackie....please train that bimbo!.. 
26044 Really enjoyed my stay here. Rooms were modern, small by most standards - but fair size by Manhattan standards. Free wi-fi in the lounge and main floor was great. 
26045 Room was very small. Strange location on side street. Was very difficult to get a taxi. Modern. 
26046 Great location - especially now that the High Line is open. Otherwise a perfectly OK hotel that seems more interested in its trendy bar brigade watch out on Saturday nights) than hotel guests. Reasonable value for Manhattan. 
26047 Morgan 's staff consistently makes its hotel my home away from home. Friendly staff who address you by name and seem genuinely interested in your new York vacation or business trip. Clean Comfortable rooms with crisp sheets and attentive housekeepers provide a respite from the hustle of the city. 
26048 Stayed 2 nights with My family there and we liked the hotel very much. Great lication and friendly, service minded staff. clean room and nice indoor pool area with terasse outside. Surely worth the money. We Will choose this again when in the area 
26049 Positive- Clean, easy to get to, close to Madison square garden, short walk to time square and surrounding area. Downside- Rooms were very small. hotel has no fitness facility. You had to pay I believe $15 to use another locations workout facility. 
26050 This was my first time stay at the Crowne Plaza Houston-Sugar Land Suites. I was so impressed by the hospitality of the staff at the front desk. The room was great with a high comfort level. Overall, the hptel was way above my expectations ... It can not be better! 
26051 The hotel was nice and was located situated centrally. Short walking distance (10-15min) to Time Square and only one block from 5th Ave. It was a 3min walk to Union Station. Can recommend this hotel for families. 
26052 Overall the hotel was just adequae, a little old and run down. nothing to do around the hotel adn access is a littel complicated. windows leaked air so there was a whistle all night long. just needs a good upgrade on everything. toilet paper is tooooo rough! 
26053 Wonderful hotel, very good service. The room was clean and pleasant and had beautiful balcony with a great view. The location is great, close to the park and museums, very good restaurants around, well connected to the subway, far from the touristic and hectic mid-town area. Highly recommended. 
26054 it was a very nice stay in the hotel! good ideas and a welcomed not to big breakfast - cool sound in the pool area! we come back. 
26055 Stay away!!! I was bitten to death by their bedbugs. Only stayed two nights, and, two days later, am still itching away! 
26056 Great location, service, cleanliness & staff. Checkout was a little weird and they had to call the manager over to take a cash transaction. But overall we had a great time and the Martini's from the lounge are excellent! 
26057 I love the location. It is in the middle of everything. The customer service representatives were very professional, courteous and expeditious in getting their customers checked in and out. 
26058 Great service. Especially Joyce!!! 2 nice big rooms. Unfortunately slow internet and tumble dryers often out of order. General standard average. Rooms better. Good location. 
26059 Spent one night and was extremely disappointed for the price we were charged. Duvet did not have a cover, the ac control was in a grime filled whole in the wall and NO coffee in the room. Besides its location, it has nothing else going for it. 
26060 Spent a miserable night at this hotel due to a party in room adjacent to us. Noise persisted all night and we had the feeling the party animals were in the room with us. Management was totally ineffective in dealing with the rowdy group, which made the stay even worse. 
26061 Ok. This place shouldn't be called hotel... More like motel. Old building, outside traffic noise, no bed frames, elevator noises at night, you get the picture. I paid reasonable amount for three star hotel. Didn't get what I expected.(terrible pillows). Only good thing was location. Walked to Rockefeller center. 
26062 The hotel was nice size room for 5 people. It was clean and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Also a great location. 
26063 nice comforatble stay, good service, large gym close to times square and theatre district. 
26064 Great location and great hotel. The room was a good size for a large city hotel. Comfortable bed and pillows, good coffee in room, checked in early with no problem, great views of Michigan Ave. I will stay here again and recommend to everyone. 
26065 Really fabulous rooms. Spacious, clean, friendly staff, and the bar was great. Location is near the center of downtown and city activities. Thumbs down on the hotel parking - $7 dollars in and out. 
26066 The front desk staff was helpful, the room was clean. Fresh towels available on request and since it's extended stay, no daily housekeeping. 
26067 Very welcoming on check in. easy to arrive early and stay late. Lovely rooms - spacious bright. Bathrooms prefect with deep rub and excellent shower. Complimentary Masserati drive in hotel car topped it off. 
26068 always good here. only complaint is the start time of breakfast on weekends. not customer friendly. 
26069 I stay here at the Hilton in July 2010 for 3 nights - clean and great size room - comfy beds - no fridge tho. Location is amazing - easy walk to Rock Center, TS, etc.... Staff always helpful- nice lounge area. Would def stay here again! 
26070 stayed at the metro for a week in june 2009 and loved it. this was our 5th time in new york but the first time at this hotel, but we would definately stay there again. book with confidence, you will not be dissapointed. 
26071 Unexpected value. Free computer & printer use. Great hot breakfast. 
26072 Our stay at this hotel was good. We were in a city view room and the room was big, clean and comfortable. Room service from the restaurant downstairs was great. We would definitely stay here... 
26073 Free breakfast, free meals on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays (with beer and wine), very friendly staff, reasonable rates and and spacious rooms make this hotel a must if staying near the gold coast. the Mag mile, Hancock center, Navy Pier and Oak Street beach are all within walking distance. 
26074 I stay at Courtyard Hobby several times a year, and find this hotel has a friendly staff (possibly one exception), clean room, and makes me feel right a home. 
26075 the hotel has nice, clean rooms. The hotel is well located, but due to the trains bridge just a few meters away, it's very noisy! But for 2-3 nights, it's OK. 
26076 I would first like to say I LOVE W City Center Chicago. I felt like royalty the way the staff took care of my boyfriend & I. TK & Jessica were two employees who truly made my stay enjoyable they went above & beyond 
26077 le camere sono piccole e squallide ,non parliamo dello champagne offerto che faceva schifo .. non ve lo consiglio se volete stare piu di una notte 
26078 einfaches hotel in toller lage. insgesamt schon etwas abgewohnt aber sehr sauber und ordentlich. nettes personal. ideal fuer einen kurzen staedtetrip. u-bahn und starbucks in der naehe- was will man mehr? 
26079 Hilton Times Square was extremely crowded do to expected hurricane. Lobby was loud and people confused. My experience was that Raquel Ortiz of the front desk brought a calm to the area with her smile, knowledge of the hotle and personality. She certainly represents your company well. 
26080 Convenient location between 5th and Broadway, clean rooms, great view of the ESB from Rooftop bar and our room. 2 blocks to Subway. Breakfast was well stocked, staff friendly. Our friend in Manhattan couldn't believe the deal and will rec. this site to others. 
26081 This hotel was an excellent find! The amenities were superb, rooms clean and sleek and the staff was fantastic. The location was also great. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
26082 Hotel was great and Weber Grille resturaunt inside was great for breakfast. Subway terminal right outside the the hotel was great for getting around Chicago. Do not rent a car, there is no need. Had a great time. I will go back again. 
26083 good hotel ,nothing special, would stay again because of location,buffet breakfast not good value 
26084 for a brand new hotel I was surprised at how thin the walls were. However you cant beat the location and thought the rooms were very modern looking. 
26085 Rooms are well equipped and nice, though a bit small for my taste. Very friendly and helpful staff, nice coffee bar, excellent location right off of times square, and between 2 metro stops. Rooms are quiet. 
26086 Located between 54th and 53rd - short walk to park, times square, and 5th avenue shopping. Great conference facility too, which makes for a very busy lobby at all hours. Rooms are good size, bathrooms small for two! 
26087 The suites are large, airy and clean. Small kitchen but quite adequate for our needs. Plenty of grocery stores to stock up on essentials. Friendly staff and the hotel is well located. All in all, a very good hotel. 
26088 I was sick in bed part of the time but it was a wonderful place to be sick! Comfortable beds, room service, shopping mall and variety of eating establishments available. A great place to be! 
26089 Two night here.in February. The hotel is very clean and quiet. There have been recent updates to the rooms and other common areas. I will stay here again... 
26090 Best value for money if you attend conference or event near Time Square. Small hotel, but it has everything you need. Free wireless. Most comfortable mattress that I've ever slept on in hotels worldwide. Breakfast is very poor. 
26091 My go to place in NY. Love the quiet location. Rooms are spacious and well appointed. Great value if booked through Virtuoso so rate includes continental breakfast and $100 hotel credit. Downside is that checkout is always screwed up. 
26092 We arrived to a very friendly and organized hotel staff. The rooms were nice and clean and the location is great. 
26093 Sehr nettes Personal, kleine, aber saubere und komfortable Zimmer 
26094 The location is really great for shopping and staff nice. It was a good hotel for a long weekend of central NY and ok price for the city. Rooms bigger then expected (my expectation was not high). but the condition of the corridors and rooms was not good but ok. 
26095 one of the inexpensives hotel in new york. no glamor and kind of onfresh. i get bedbugs bites over my hole body. 
26096 Small compact rooms - what you expect in new york Trendy bar and resturant Easy check in and check out process Clean and NEW The cabins are really cool and I really enjoyed the area that we were in 
26097 Hotel stay was great. Room was worth price location made it great. However the restaurant was seriously lacking. Service was good but food was overpriced and frankly did not taste good. Would definetly stay here again. 
26098 Red Roof offers the absolute best quality for the money anywhere. Wouldn't stay anywhere else. No other hotel chain equals this perfect combination of quality and economy all in one package. 
26099 Check in was easy, room was great, in room beverage arrived on time with USA today the next morning. Buffet breakfast was great too. 
26100 After arriving to the hotel we recive an excellent from Elisabeth, the guest relation manager! She solved our problems imidiatly and help us in all questions. Thank you very much elisabeth! For your excepcional service. Julia 
26101 Questo hotel per me ha un significato particolare. Sono 4 anni che vado e ho dei ricordi bellissimi, alcuni indimenticabili. Quindi anche se ha cambiato la gestione da QT a Room Mate, non lo cambierei per nessun motivo al mondo. 
26102 Ligging is gunstig met 2 metrostations dichtbij. Kamers zijn ruim. Let er wel op dat men u een grote kamer aanbiedt. Er zijn namelijk ook kleine kamers die ze proberen te slijten. Slapen aan de voorkant van het hotel is rumoerig door het almaar doorgaande verkeer, ook s'nachts! 
26103 Buon hotel in posizione centralissima. Stanza non molto grande comunque comoda per 2 persone, in 3 si sta sullo stretto. Servizio di deposito bagaglio con mancia obbligatoria. Ascensori veloci, ma spesso affollati con tempi di attesa lunghi durante gli orari di punta. 
26104 if you fancy a trip back in time to the seventies, check this place out. on the plus side its in a quiet part of town but close enough to mid town area (if you want to go there) bomb sniffer dogs out front add to the experience as well. 
26105 Das Hotel is sauber und hat nette Einrichtungen. Das Service is excellent, die Leute sind nett und Hilfsbereit. Das Hotel ist auch schnell erreichbar durch die gute Verbindungen (Subways and Buses). Ein paar Statonen weit vom Hotel ist die bekannte Columbia Universitaet. 
26106 The Hotel 414 was the perfect place to stay while taking in the rich culture and excitement of Manhatten. The breakfast at this boutique hotel was a bonus. The only downfall is that there is no elevator, therefore I'd recommend asking for a room on the lower floors. 
26107 I recently stayed at the Embassy Suites Downtown Lakefornt and it was just perfect! A perfect location, close to the Magnificent Mile and the Navy Pier. Our room was great. Everyone at the hotel were so friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend staying there!! 
26108 This hotel is well located within Manhattan. Within walking distance of Little Italy, Chinatown, the subway and of course, Soho. Service is good and you get excellent value at this Holiday Inn. 
26109 Great location. It's very basic but when your staying in NYC why would you spend all your time at the hotel?!? It was clean, comfertable and only around the corner from Times Square! Great service & amazing view from my room window. Made my trip to NY even better :) 
26110 This hotel is right in the middle of Time Square. One block from the subway. The rooms are very confortable. We were very lucky our room had a view of Times Square. We recommend this hotel 
26111 Very good location near Times square,fifth avenue and overlooking Central Park.Very great stay 
26112 Fanny the concierge was fantastic! She Found us the best place to celebrate our anniversary! Thank you Fanny! The room was very small but the location and staff were fantastic! 
26113 It is rare to encounter an entire hotel staff that is unfailingly polite, and helpful. This was our experience at the Peninsula. Great location, comfortable rooms, outstanding personnel, what more could one hope for? Highly recommend. 
26114 Excellent location in midtown Manhattan, near shopping and entertainment. Small, clean rooms with very comfortable beds. Really nice hotel bar made great drinks. Concierge was on the money with all of his advice. 
26115 Room small (as with NY hotels) but very nice, good quality and with Aveda products in bathroom (which was a bonus). Dingy street but quite safe and in 2 minutes you're in Times Square. 
26116 Small rooms, small bathroom, few amenities for the price. King bed made with queen sheets. Had to call at 11:00pm to change it. Should have mattress cover. Room stuffy. Halls dark. Elevators dark. People nice. 
26117 Don't usually stay in large franchise hotels but the Post Oak could change my mind. Room was large, the exterior window actually opened! Hotel staff very accomodating and helpful. 
26118 We stayed just one night to catch dinner and a play and were upgraded to a corner room...rather small but nicely appointed. Staff were efficient and nice. Comfortable bed, pillows, and fine linens. Rapid elevator service. Sense of elegance throughout,despite rather busy lobby with a hodgepodge of people. 
26119 I've stayed here before, and have yet to be disappointed with a room. Laundry facilities were hot and dirty, and the continental breakfast was almost non-existant. (Good thing there is a Whataburger next door.) Staff were (as always) friendly and helpful. 
26120 Old style hotel with different types of rooms, mine was rather small but hat everything you need. With a metrocard you can visit a lot of museums and important places. Empire State Building is within walking distance. 
26121 De lo mejorcito que he visto , tanto en precio como en instalaciones Recomendable cien por cien 
26122 Perfect for a short or long week end in new York. Service great and food very good. The boum boum bar the place to be in Manhattan 
26123 Courtyard Marriott is in the heart of Manhattan ... Door man always there to greet you and the hotel is kept in great condition. Great find! 
26124 The accommodations are nice. The rooms are comfortable. I'll definitely return as I'm a strong advocate for Kimpton Hotels. 
26125 We spent 10 days and the guest relations manager Elizabeth Cacovic was excellent, proactive and helped us in all aspects, from the luggage and selecting a perfect room for 3 friends to places to eat - very well located hotel. 
26126 Hotel was perfect. Great restaurant right across street, Planet Thailand. Nice bar/Restaurant in adjoining building. Close to all that Chelsea has to offer. Friendly staff , clean rooms. Great nights stay. 
26127 The elevator is a litlle scary, the aisle is pretty narrow (only one person at a time), the room with 3 beds was pretty clean. Noisy air conditioner, not view at all, no heater, beds were noisy and uncomfortable. I guess you get what you paid for. Great location. 
26128 This hotel was lovely. The staff was very friendly, the room was surprisingly large and it was a great location for shopping and visiting museums on the UES. Very fairly priced too. I will definitely stay here again. 
26129 Visited for anniversary. The staff is AMAZING. Hotel is in a great location. Room was perfect. Bed was Wonderful. I would highly recommend this Hotel to anyone wanting to have a memorable time in NYC. 
26130 The offioce employees were eager to help us. They were very polite, professional and friendly. Even the cleaning ladies were helpful and very friendly. 
26131 Just blocks from Madison Square Garden, a block from the Empire State Building. This is a great place to stay for an incredible price. 
26132 stayed at the london numerous times. location is perfect for manhattan visitors, easy access to virtually the entire city. staff is responsive and on their game. priced right for the city, but not the frugal traveller. 
26133 I have been staying here for about a year. I get the rooom for 30 days at a time. I brought my family here for the weekend, and they loved it. The hotel staff are Great!! Price is very reasonable. 
26134 I travel alot and really enjoyed my stay here. The hotel was very clean and the staff very professional. It took me only 5 minutes to make it to downtown and the campus is beautiful. Will stay again soon. 
26135 El Hotel esta situado en el Carazon de Manhatan, Restaurantes,estaciones del Metro, Comercios , Sitios de interes. Es acogedor, el personal amable, muy limpio y con decoracion sobria y elegante. Precio versus servicio el mejor de Manhatan. Volveremos y lo recomendamos ampliamente. 
26136 We were looking for something in a funky part of town, and lower east side is not quite that area. The hotel is great, and the staff were fab, but it was super cold outside, and there didn't seem to be much of interest that was within close walking distance. 
26137 poca variedad en desayunos, por lo demas muy bie, muy bien situado 
26138 Location is great - renovation was donee tastefully and well - we had stayed when it was the Gorham, and this is a considerable upgrade. blri83@yahoo.com 
26139 Hotel situato in una posizione veramente fantastica davanti a Central Park e all'inizio della Fifty Evenue !!!! Personale altamente professionale con un tocco di simpatia e ironia che non guasta mai. Le camere perfettamente pulite con una vista sul Central Park stupenda. 
26140 Great hotel. Highly recommended.Clean well kept. Great staff. 
26141 I stayed at this location to be near Texas Children's Hospital. The transportation was wonderful. The hotel was very clean and we received great customer service. I would recommed this hotel to everyone. Staying here took a lot of the stress off of a very stressful time. 
26142 Was here for 3 nights on business. WOW was I impressed. Front desk was super helpful with directions and cabs. The TempurPedic beds are AWESOME. Room was super clean every day with nice towels. Would stay again if I had the chance. 
26143 The price is amazing for the location. The room are a little bit small, but VERY new and the bed was one of the bests i've ever slept for this category of hotel. Location is perfect. 
26144 Dit hotel is goed gelegen tov de stad. Het personeel is enorm vriendelijk en behulpzaam. De kamers zijn in orde. Schitterende king size boxspring bedden!!! Zalige nachtrust gehad. 's Morgens is het ontbijt in orde. Niet het typische Amerikaanse ontbijt. Voldoende afwisseling. Kortom, goed hotel !!! 
26145 I had a suite. It had a wonderful view, great service, and perfect location. The management and staff were courteous and helpful. I would highly recommend and will definitely stay there again. 
26146 After the long flight from Australia, we were pleasantly surprised to be upgraded to a suite upon check-in. Rooms were well maintained and very comfortable. Close to Central Park. A relatively quiet area - great for families. 
26147 The hotel is a haven of calm. The staff are all polite and very efficient. The room was clean and surprisingly spacious for the middle of New York. There was an excellent continental breakfast included and everything just worked. It is located well for doing the tourist thing. 
26148 Great location- very close to Times Square! Rooms were clean and well maintained and surprisingly big for NYC. Concierge was well versed in restaurants nearby and suggested a great steak house, made us reservations then drew us a walking map. Would definitely stay here again. 
26149 The room was actually good sized- we had been warned NYC rooms can be quite small. The hotel was beautiful, location was excellent and the service was too. Would stay again. 
26150 This hotel has a good location. Very close to time square. Rooms are quite small. Staff are friendly 
26151 Many nice resturants around the hotel. Coffee machine in the lobby for guests. Mini market in the lobby. 
26152 Bellissimo albergo !!! Cortese ai massimi livelli il personale !!! Di fronte a central park. Sembra di stare in uno dei film degli anni 80-90 dove c'era il portiere che chiama il taxi e ti apre lo sportello, e lo fanno veramente. SPETTACOLARE !!! 
26153 I took my girlfriend to the w in manhattan and we went to the oasis bar. They had excellent service. We were greeted by a bartender named marianne who added to the ambiance of the hotel with her wonderful charm. 
26154 It is the dirtiest place I have ever stayed at. I wouldn't let my dog stay there. 
26155 We spent four days staying at the Hilton Times Square and try as l might l cannot find fault the hotel in any way the staff throughout were polite and helpful from front desk to service staff. Thank you Hilton for a most enjoyable stay.Regards Chic Rodgers. 
26156 The location is ideal. The desk staff, the bellmen and the parking staff were courteous, patient and very helpful. 
26157 The hotel was as usual wonderful, the staff friendly and efficient and the room had a beautiful view. 
26158 Okay yes the hotel could use some work. The bathrooms are kinda gross, lobby small, etc...However the location and the Staff are wonderful. I have never had a problem here. Very happy the internet is working. 
26159 We stayed here for 7 days and found the location great for access to all attractions as well as being close to buses for travel a bit further. The standard of the rooms was great and the staff very helpful. Would stay here again. 
26160 Good hotel with nice sized rooms, but a little pricey for the location, which is pretty far on the East side. The bed was very comfortable and the staff was friendly. 
26161 Located at the right place, near central park, time square, etc. 
26162 Centrally located near all restaurants shops. Red tour taxis. Flew into JFK airport but best to fly into the other airport. Closer to hotel 
26163 Bit of hassle getting a shuttle there. Took a taxi. Approx $55 fare 
26164 very good as usual. clean, very comfortable bed, nice atmosphere 
26165 A fabulous hotel with excellent and friendly staff, onlet down by the waiting staff in the restaurant who seemed to have an "attitude" problem. Would stay here again. Excellent facilities including the pool. 
26166 With its location one block off Michigan Avenue, this little charmer is worth it and then some. The price/value relationship is sensational and if you do not crave a crowded, over priced hotel, this is the spot. After my second stay, absolutely a must for me in Chicago. 
26167 What a dump. All I can say. Tattered everything, old fixtures. Two guys duct-taping a 50 year old airconditioner together when I walked in. 
26168 Here for business so not a lot of time at the hotel but staff was friendly, helpful, room was quiet and clean (and small). 
26169 The hotel is less than two blocks from a subway station and within walking distance to the theatre district, restaurants, and Times Square. The rooms and beds are clean. The staff is professional and courteous. I had a pleasant stay and would stay here again. 
26170 Hotel-Awesome. Service- Immediate, NO hidden charges. Rooms are elegant with crisp ironed sheets. Location -excellent! 
26171 rooms are tiiny but that's New York. Nevertheless room looks perfect and have everything you can wish for, bed is very comfortable. View are stunning and location is great! 
26172 Clean rooms, good service. Great hotel! Thanks for the great stay! 
26173 This hotel is conveniently located a short walk from Times Square and an even shorter walk to Macy's and the shopping on 34th street. The room was a bit small but the bed was comfy which was all we cared about. Staff were friendly and helpful. 
26174 We stayed over on February 16th and had a very nice stay. Located in the perfect location to do everything possible. We plan on staying again. Personel was informative and the room was very nice. You will not be disappointed with your stay here. 
26175 Stayed at this hotel for three nights at the start of East-West tour of USA. It is in a good location and comfortable enough. Some parts of the hotel are a bit tatty and a little tired would be the best description. 
26176 We stayed in this hotel for the second time. Both times were a very pleasant stay for us en maybe not the last time. The future will tell....... 
26177 have stayed here before and it seems to get better with age. the only downfall this trip was that we could hear service doors opening during the night 
26178 Can't say anything more than 5 stars across the board. Easy friendly check-in, great room, friendly employees. Can't wait to return next year. 
26179 Hotel is very nice,room quite big for two.USD170 per night.cheaper than Comfort Inn which is also not far from this hotel. We can walk around the city if staying in this hotel. 
26180 do not stay here. words cannot describe how bad this place is. find somewhere else quick 
26181 We stayed here for 5 days, no dramas. The hotel is located just across the Times Square. If you require basic accommodation just for sleeping in new york city, this is the right hotel for you 
26182 Rooms are from the stone age. Bed was a bit uncomfortable. Noisy hallways kept me up one night. 
26183 We had an amazing time at the Warwick. The location is perfect and the service was great! Our first room had problems with the aircondition and they immidiately upgrated us to a bigger an newly renovated room. We left the hotel feeling it had exceeded our expectations. 
26184 Got a great deal money-wise here and the construction was noisy but it ended by midnight. This hotel is in a great location and it was very meaningful to see the area and to be able to run along the harbor at night. 
26185 Club Quarters - Rockefeller Center corners the market on minimalist accommodations. You get a comfortable, clean bed in a convenient location. Other amenities such as a working remote control for the TV and light switches that do not have to be jiggled to work are extra. 
26186 Nice hotel, great location One thing we were a little bothered with was waiting for the elevators... 2 elevators for 7 huge floors is not enough when every body is going to breakfast around the same time! 
26187 Excellent is the best description. The room was comfortable and clean, very close to the airport, near many great restaurants with a great restaurant and bar onsite. I will stay there again since on top of all that the staff was friendly and great! 
26188 As others have said, the location's great (if you want Tourist Central). Staff very friendly. Foyer really smart. But none of that matters because the rooms are way below expectations. Book elsewhere and get better for less. No more to say, just check my pics... 
26189 This hotel is quite elegant. They staff is so friendly and helpful. The beds are the best! We are considering purchasing a Four Seasons bed. The in-room breakfast is fabulous. 
26190 The old guy called Myint Aung was very rude to me 
26191 He tossed keys around and even shouted at me for no reason 
26192 The worst hotel experience I have experienced in my whole entire life - Definitely would not recommend to anyone 
26193 Awesome location. Clean room, friendly staff, and superior amenities. Overall, great experience. 
26194 Just returned from a great stay at The Allerton. The location is wonderful, staff helpful and suite was a great size. 
26195 Excellent stay great rooms very clean superb housekeeping...classy ..breakfast a little disorganised staff not really on the ball , they could smile a little more and start to read the tales. Good location very busy place excellent fit out classical but modern style 
26196 Recently spent 6 nights here and absolutely loved it. Great location just 2 blocks from the subway. Across from market. Excellent view from my room and a super comfortable bed. Clean and tidy. Friendly staff and surprisingly quiet once in room. 
26197 Prima hotel, redelijk kleine kamer. De muffins als ontbijt gaan op den duur vervelen en helaas werkte de koffiemachine niet op onze etage. Al met al een net en luxe hotel met vriendelijk personeel tegen een goede prijs. 
26198 Great small hotel in excellent location, staff were all exceptionally helpful. Rooms are small but very clean. No food facilities in hotel but a coffee shop next door and loads of other good places to eat near by. Will definately stay here on next visit. 
26199 Charming hotel. The staff are VERY helpful. Nice, clean rooms. Had some problems with television in room, but that was the only problem. Dress code a little too strict for my taste. 
26200 We loved our stay at the W Union Square. We stayed two nights July 1 and 2. The staff was great. The bed was very comfortable and we had a nice view of Union Square. Construction noise on Union square started early, but we were up anyway. 
26201 We have stayed at this hotel multiple times and each time the experience was wonderful. They shuttled us to our destination quickly, safely and on time. 
26202 This is our 3rd time at Blake. We had a gorgeous room with huge ceilings, large bathroom and great service. We booked the room for $89, a great price for the location. Wifi in the room is so slow it's almost not worth it though. 
26203 No wifi in the rooms, great location, pricey for the look of the rooms and bathrooms, needs an update. 
26204 what a gem ,, this place is ,, not luxury ,, but a beautiful reception area with great friendly staff and clean easy access to subway and centre of new york,, could do with a bar and maybe restaurant ,, but other than that ,,, fab 
26205 Nice room, Clean, Large for NY city! Great location! Not the first stay there and I will go back for sure! This is a great hotel to stay for a Romatic stay just 1 block from Time square. The food was also really good at the restaurent. 
26206 Great Classy hotel. Fantastic service...really the nicest hotel I have ever stayed in. Really comfortable beds which is important to me (I have a bad back). 
26207 So glad to finally find somewhere in NYC that is affordable without being grotty. The rooms are small, but efficient. They have everything you need to be comfortable without wasted space. 
26208 This is a good hotel. It has as perfect location: in the centre of NYC and very close to the metro. Breakfast included, comfortable room with a bathroom, comfortable bed (I had a double bed for one person), and friendly staff. And all that for a good price. 
26209 Stayed in a two room suite for 4 nights. Very happy with my stay and would definitely recommend it. Fairway is located adjacent which is useful with the kitchenette. Very clean, great service and helpful. Near the subway. The hotel has a laundry room. No negatives. 
26210 Ci siamo trovate bene, buona la posizione proprio a due passi dalla Grand Central Station, bello l'hotel e gentile il personale, certo la stanza non era enorme, ma sufficente per le esigenze. Lo consiglio! 
26211 We spent four days in New York for our nephew's graduation from art school. This hotel was in a great location surrounded by plenty of things to do and see. the Maritime Hotel was very clean with friendly service that was very accomodating. We would definitely stay here again. 
26212 In 30 years of traveling, I've lost quite a few items to hotel maids. However this place has honest ones, and the hotel manager, Rizwan Marfani, went out of his way to make sure my property was found and secured. While a little thing, it means a lot to me. 
26213 Our stay at Crowne Plaza, located on Southwest Freeway exceeded our expectations. The room was clean, comfortable. The staff were professional and very courteous. * Would you recommend this hotel to a friend? Yes No * Describe your trip (Select all that apply) 
26214 I can't say enough great things about the Hotel Chandler. Great beds, very clean, friendly staff and an all around pleasant stay. 
26215 Although the Towers rooms are still beautiful, the rest of the hotel is tired and worn. Unhappy staff who speak ill of their managers in voices loud enough to hear are probably telling the truth. The place has seen it's glory days and those days are gone. 
26216 Very nice hotel. Probably better for business traveelers than tourists because of location though very near Statue of Liberty tour, 9/11 Memorial, Wall St and subways to midtown. 
26217 Very nice hotel. The entire staff was very helpful and friendly. This hotel is in the middle of everything you would want to do in Manhattan. Just be aware you are at the north entrance to time square so it is crowded the minute you step out the front door. 
26218 The staff made this hotel, they made us feel as if we stayed in a higher rated hotel. It may not be the newest hotel with the most confortable beds. The staff makes up for it, the kindness and cleaniness goes a long way. 
26219 This hotel is right in the middle of everything. It's a short walk to all the major shopping areas as well as Rockefeller Plaza. Nice Gym The staff is extremely helpful and kind. The rooms are a bit small but I feel the amenities make up for it. 
26220 Very small rooms that are not clean. Staff is uninformed. Lots of better options elsewhere 
26221 Love this hotel, so grand, so expensive but fabulous! Highly recommend! 
26222 I stayed in Ramada for 5 nights this May. I could not find positive words to describe my stay there. Some guests lost their belongings in their locked room ... 
26223 Above average hotel for business and conferences, friendly good service. Only down point is being charged $15 a day per device for wifi and Internet. 
26224 Love the location & service. The rooms and decor are outdated. The complimentary breakfast is great if you are traveling with kids and the food is pretty good. This location allows you easy access to Navy Pier, Magnificent mile, chicago trolley stop and the beach. 
26225 Dylan Hotel, located in midtown Manhattan in NYC, offered a great location for business, restaurants and sights to see. The staff was very attentive and helpful during my stay. To improve the customer's experience the Dylan should freshen up the decor and invest in better lighting. 
26226 Stayed here on our first night in NYC. Great rooms, huge bathrooms and lovely views. Service by all, especially Robert and Jessie who helped when my son lost his IPhone, was first class. Love the modern decor, central location and facilities. 
26227 We stayed here a whole back. Excellent location to explore the city. Executive floor a must as has access to executive lounge! 
26228 good location for both Central Park and Times Square activities. Rooms were excellent. Outside doesn't look that great, but inside is top notch.. Free breakfast. Get there early to avoid the line. Price was reasonable 
26229 Great location. The hotel is very close to Times Square and other attractions. there was a Small problem with water temperature in shower (too hot / and too cold ) it was a little hard to regulate. The room had a Microwave and a small fridge. 
26230 Constant garbage truck noise from 11p.m. to at least 5a.m. Also an air conditioner loud hum in our room & we didn;t have the air condition on in our room. The staff was very pleasant & friendly. A nice buffet breakfast. 
26231 Had a great stay at the Muse for a long weekend. Free Internet and wine reception were great. Room was Large, with a separate sitting area. Location was perfect, near but off times square and convenient to rockefeller center and shopping on 5th avenue. 
26232 Modern hotel but revenue maximization to the maximum. Small room and hefty prices for beverages and food (New York?). The lobby turns bar/disco in the evening. The location is definitely great. The "ladies" at the reception are a bit too cool for me. 
26233 Stayed 1 night for business. Staff was pleasant, courteous and helpful. Fitness center was a bit small, but clean and modernized. Fresh fruit available, towels, tv's. I stayed in a suite w/ garden tub and stall shower - very nice. Beds were comfy. No noise. No complaints. 
26234 We stayed for 3 days in a 1 bdm suite. The service is out of this world. Weve stayed in several five star resorts but the service does not compete. Personal assistant offered to run to the store for a few things we needed for the say! Amazing experience! 
26235 The staff at the Courtyard is very friendly and helpful, great location by the Galleria - within walking distance of many resturants. 
26236 My friends and I stayed here for my bachelorette party. It's pleasant, clean, and cute. The rooms are a decent size for the price. No complaints. 
26237 The hotel is cheap and cheerful. Well located (in easy walking distance of a subway station), clean and comfortable. The Manhattan Diner (across the street) is also fantastic. 
26238 The Public has beautiful and useful public areas, free wi-fi, and free loaner bikes. Very friendly and helpful service from all staff. Rooms are nicely designed. They did a fabulous job updating an older hotel. 
26239 I love Omni hotels-- become a "select guest," it's worth it. This is a great one. Very nice staff, lovely room, very large for the city. 
26240 Fantastic location, Clean, polite staff, AMAZING views with lovely big bedrooms, for your first time in NY i would defiantly recommend this hotel as everything is so easy to get too, would defiantly stay here again. 
26241 Brand new hotel. Clean and Modern. Spacious rooms. Walking distance to my downtown office, toyota center, and convention center. Recommend to anyone including families. Drawback is only option for parking is valet at $26/day. 
26242 I always stay here when going to the convention center. Great location, great price, clean and best of all FREE parking! I've stayed in more expensive hotels in NYC that weren't very nice so this one hits the spot. 
26243 Average hotel, clean but pretty poor unfriendly service. Recommend staying at a much better hotel like " The Muse" though if you do stay here definitely ask for an internal room, no street noise! Also construction work currently being done at the back of the hotel, drilling started at 7am! 
26244 This hotel we got on Priceline for a very reasonable price. Great hotel, here are my pros and cons: Pros: VERY friendly and helpful staff, food on site, bars and a bowling alley on site Cons: EXPENSIVE parking and not being able to use the luggage carrier without a bellhop. 
26245 Fine hotel with friendly front staff. Great dinner options in the Italian Market. Clean and comfortable. 
26246 Excelente 
26247 Tiene la ubicacion perfecta en el centro de la diversion, sus habitaciones son comodas, aire acondicionado, tienes refrigerador, micro, caja fuerte, lo unico incomodo es el colchon del sofa cama, la cama pincipal muy comoda. 
26248 Great romantic, fun and exciting destination spot. Fantastic rooftop bar! 
26249 A good spot slightly off the beaten path. New interiors done well. Very close to a Whole Foods Market, which is very handy. 
26250 Stayed here following a guide book recommendation. Superb location, excellent decor, spotlessly clean room with great view of Empire State Building, helpful and friendly staff, discount at great restaurant next door. Couldn't recommend more highly. 
26251 Great Location - Outdated rooms - Will consider other hotels next time 
26252 My wife and I stayed at the Renaissance Hotel during the first week of December. Other than being way overpriced and our room not being ready when we arrived, we were very satisfied with our stay. Great location and friendly, helpful staff. Our room was nicely sized and well appointed. 
26253 Rooms darkly decorated and dirty around the edges. Was about 70 degrees when we were there but the elevators and hallways were saunas. Room size nice. Staff a bit on the rude side, not all, only some. 
26254 I got a really good deal for a small but lovely room at On The Ave. Service was great, friendly. Nicely furnished rooms. And in a GREAT location, especially for a single woman traveller. Looks like it's been discovered -- rates are higher but I'd still recommend it. 
26255 Great hotel staff was awesome did a great job. Rooms were large and very comfortable would highly recommend 
26256 Hidden away in Uptown Park! By far the best service I ever had! Love everything about Granduca! 
26257 Clean but small room. Quiet safe block close to everything in Midtown. Staff helpful but not overly helpful. 
26258 Perfect location near Time Square , wonderful design, friendly and helpful stuff especially the Arabian man called Simo Ana Disla in concierge desk , moderate price. The greatest value for money in New York I have ever seen. 
26259 The Hilton Times Square provides the perfect location. In the heart of manhattan, for real. I got the chance to reach every part of the island without any struggles. The staff is so welcoming, specially Dino at the door. Thank you for always having a cab ready. 
26260 Our second stay, and hopefully not our last. I don't recognise the hotel described critically elsewhere. Friendly staff, good value and ideal location. My only criticism would be the noise of the air-con unit, but hey, that's life! 
26261 We were pleasingly surprised of how nice the hotel and the location were. The staff is very friendly especially the hotel driver. 
26262 Got a deal on two rooms through hotwire. The hotel is in the heart of the city. Clean and modern, the higher floor rooms were above any traffic noise of the city. The staff were courteous and were not pushy for tips. 
26263 Reception is quick and supportive.I have had coffee machine in the room, also complimentary water was delivered. Clean bathroom and big comfortable bed !Great location, just next to subway station. 
26264 My husband and I stayed here in July 2011 and we actually have no complaints. The staff was friendly, the room was clean and nice and the food was good. We loved the location of the hotel. We knew nothing about Houston and the location made it easier for us. 
26265 Once again, we spent 5 nights in NYC and at the Courtyard Times Square South. The desk attendants, restaurant staff, and room cleaning staff were friendly, courteous, and accommodating. Though spartan and intended for primarily business people, the rooms are clean and have everything one needs. 
26266 Comodo hotel a pochi passi da Times Square e dalla fermata della metro. E' situato in una zona tranquilla lungo un viale alberato. La camera era molto spaziosa con letto king size, bagno spazioso e internet wireless gratuito. 
26267 Fabulous location. Staff could not be more helpful - they make the whole experience of staying in this hotel a very personal one. Ricks cafe is a great facility. We will certainly stay here again next time we visit New York. 
26268 Small room but you get used to it. Hotel well located and very clean. Book in advance for a better pricing. Free muffings are good. Free coffee and hot chocolate on each floor. Very friendly employees. 
26269 Older hotel remodeled. Everything brand new in my room. Walking distance to Toyota centre and minute maid park plus convention centre. Free town car to take you anywhere you wanna go at night 
26270 We booked the hotel on Hotwire and got a good value. There is a tunnel at the end of Erie St to get to Lake Michigan. Try the West Egg for breakfast which is next to the hotel. The swimming pool is great. 
26271 How is it possible to charge so much for so little space? Is this modern? No, this is just greed !! 
26272 A great place to stay while you are in Houston. Rooms are large and clean. Bathroom is very spacious. Free Wifi internet facility in all rooms, and good food. There is a shuttle service to nearby shopping malls for some quick shopping. 
26273 The Sanctuary is just that a quiet, swank and friendly sanctuary. Superb ambiance. Comfortable and spotless accomodations. Helpful and friendly staff. And the location can't be beat. 
26274 Nice location, and great view if you get a higher floor suite facing the lake. Great service, staff are all friendly, smiling and very helpful. Rooms are not fancy or luxurious, but everything else more than make up for it. 
26275 Excellent location, good service and huge breakfast included. There is even a free access to the laundry! Rates are very correct for the service 
26276 Spent a night at 6 Columbus. Our room was small but nice. Great bed, quiet room. The staff were all pleasant and ery accommodating. We will definitly return to this hotel. 
26277 This hotel exceeded my expectations in all respects. We has the 1 bedroom suite, which (compared to the same at the Hilton on 42nd at a higher rate) was huge. Service was impressive. Location was great particularly if you don't feel like being around Times Square and midtown. Highly recommended! 
26278 This hotel is a gem ,friendly staff,Clean rooms,fantastic diner and chic restaurant. it is only 1 block from maceys ,10 mins from time square,would highly recommend this hotel 
26279 We stayed here due to a flight cancellation and already checked out of the other hotel. I would have liked to stay here during the entire time spent in Houston. The owner and staff were very much accommodating. Rooms were clean and quite. Would recommend! 
26280 Really clean hotel, nice and quiet. Free wifi internet. Perfect place for a great trip to NYC. 
26281 Clean and comfortable room. Close to times square. Would stay again. 
26282 The Doubletree is a wonderful hotel. It is located right downtown within minutes walk of the Navy pier. The rooms are large and spacious. And the best are very comfortable. The porters are great but the front desk staff always seem to have better things to do. 
26283 Great location only two blocks off of Times Square. Wonderful clean and stylish room. 
26284 Room was small but nicely furnished and the hotel has an excellent location. 
26285 After numerous trips to Manhattan and a different hotel each time, we're here to stay. From check-in to check-out, our experience was great all the way around. The concierge service, room amenities, bar and restaurant, and location stood out, in particular. 
26286 Upon checkin the Staff was courteous and helpful! The Concierge was amazing with acquiring our Broadway Show Tickets! The room was spacious, great views!! Excellent for a family traveling to NY! 
26287 I felt the hospitality staffs were friendlier and professional than front desk staffs. They seem too proud to be standing there while staffs from cafe to valet are more than courteous. Overall, the hotel us well kept and clean. definitely returning to this property for business trips. 
26288 Xavier was amazing!! Did his job to a "T" service wouldn't have been the same with out him! He made my stay as comfortable as it could be!! Best hotel I have stayed in... In the north east!!! Gansevoort rocks!!! 
26289 This was my first visit to Chicago and this hotel is greatly located near Michigan Avenue with all its great shopping and attractions- all within walking distance. The rooms (suites) are large and clean. 
26290 Aurelia Gaskin, Front Office Supervisor, is a huge help and takes great care of the guests! 
26291 My second stay in this hotel and so much better. Rooms great. Checked in early without problem. Valet parking worked well. Had problem understanding safe in room and was responded to immediately. Concierge service great as well. Location is perfect steps from Central Park and NYC subway. Will definitely return 
26292 This place was perfect for our needs. It was walkable to Penn Station and had a big breakfast selection. The room felt modern and very clean. The only complaint was the air conditioner was very loud when it came on throughout the night. The staff was very friendly and helpful. 
26293 Het Beekman tower suite hotel staat op een goede locatie. Je bent meteen downtown, maar hebt geen last van geluidsoverlast. Een lekkere kamer, goed comfort, praktische keuken, prachtig uitzicht, vriendelijk personeel, perfecte schoonmaak. Een aanrader! 
26294 Great Room... Great Staff... Wonderful bar and restaurant... Close to Sights and Subway. 
26295 Good central location, right next door to Grand Central. Rooms are good sized for NY, I was surprised. Hotel is under renovation, work starts at 7am weekdays. Could stand a good cleaning in the shower. Friendly and helpful staff. 
26296 Veruit mijn beste ervaring in downtown Manhattan. Hotel is uistekend gelegen voor zakelijke reizigers die in het financial district moeten zijn. Hotel ligt ook dichtbij de belangrijke metrolijnen. Zeer goede service en vriendelijke bediening. Wel een luidruchtige AC, en de kamers hebben een wat donkere inrichting. Kom hier zeker terug. 
26297 Sara was extremely helpful in assisting me with a billing question- fast and accurate. Provided me with everything I requested within 20 minutes of my phone call to her. She went above and beyond my expectations. 
26298 I will definitely stay here again - great value, outstanding accommodation. A great find in New York. Staff were exceptionally friendly. 
26299 Muy buen desayuno y gratis, lo que es algo poco tipico en NY. barrio tranquilo y seguro, todo muy limpio, las habitaciones pequenas pero suficiente y confortables, definitivamente lo recomiendo y me volveria a hospedar. 
26300 We booked 2 rooms, 4 teenagers happily shared one room. Free wifi and great breakfast makes a huge difference when traveling with this age group! Very quiet - great location as close to multi line station and easy walk to time square! Loved it! 
26301 Was going to stay at the wardolf but now i'm really glad that they were fully booked ! Fantastic location and the rooms were spacious, clean, modern, comfortable and quiet :) 
26302 We came home with horrible bed bug bites. The heater didn't work beacuse the outlet didn't work. The bathroom was filthy. The only good thing was the facility for the dogs during Westminister. 
26303 Very friendly place makes all the difference. Clean, older hotel with enough charm to see it through. 
26304 comfortable room, quiet, clean, slept very well, good lobby to read in in the early morning 
26305 PAs de possibilite d'avoir un taxi depuis cet hotel 
26306 Enjoyed every aspect of my short 4 day stay! Garden Inn works for me. Perfect location with big rooms that have windows that open and good a/c. Short walk to anywhere in Time Square and the subway station. Well taken care of by the staff. I'll be back soon. 
26307 Great location for two first-time travellers to NY. Walkingdistance to Empire State, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Flatiron Building, Meatpacking District....overall great location. 
26308 Had a wonderful stay at the Meridien! Clean, nice pool, and courteous staff. Don't go to Serendipity 3 restaurant-bad experience. 
26309 room very clean, comfortable and has all of the amenities needed for business. would stay here again on business or pleasure. would recommend brighter lighting in hallways if anything. 
26310 excellent hotel for the price. clean,friendly staff and a great location. within walking distance to times square, macys and the empire state building. 
26311 Great hotel! I have been staying at this hotel over the past six months. The staff is great! Very friendly and accomodating. The rooms are of an average size and offer many amenities...one of my favorites, the luxurious bath robes. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
26312 A clean, modern and comfortable room. The service was all right and it is pretty close to everything! 
26313 This hotel has a great location, wonderful views. However, it needs new mattresses and furniture in the living area. For the price, some upgrades should be made. The staff was pleasant and very accomodating. 
26314 Great location just by Times Square. The superior room was clean, nicely decorated and quiet. Staff extremely friendly and helpful. Breakfast was good too. 
26315 As always, Hyatt did not let me down. Great customer service, nice bar experience, very nice and clean rooms. Good location. 
26316 Just a few blocks from all things NYC. Can walk to penn station or time square with ease. Do some shopping at Macy's largest store. Can walk out of the subway and walk a few feet to the hotel.. 
26317 My husband and I stayed here for 12 nights. The service was wonderful and the staff friendly. We had a 1 bedroom studio with kitchenette which was perfect for our needs. We would definitely stay here again. 
26318 We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights during spring break. The location is great, room is clean, bed is very comfortable. 
26319 Hotel was clean, with clean bedding, a great location with some good views from the roof top. 
26320 I have fond memories of this hotel. It's very boutique-ish, the rooms are beautiful, and the bathrooms large! Great location, I can't wait to go back, I'll definitely stay here again and again!! 
26321 Great stay here staff and rooms etc more than enhanced our stay in New York. View of the Chrysler bldg from our room The concierge Rob was so helpfull!!. Would go there again for sure !! Can't rate the breakfast tho' as we chose to eat out... 
26322 The hotel was very clean and the furnishings nice. Staff was very efficient and friendly enough. Location is convenient to businesses in the area but it is not necessarily in the main tourist area. 
26323 Stayed at this hotel July 15-17...Great hotel!! Rooms are NewYork style - small yet very comfortable!!! Breakfast was more than expected!! Only thing missing was.....a small fridge in the room!! Would stay here again!! 
26324 Ein renoviertes Hotel mit sehr guter Lage. Modern eingerichtete Zimmer und kleine Suiten mit viel Platz. Tolles Badezimmer und einwandfreier, netter Service. Reinigung und Sauberkeit sind ausgezeichnet. Auch der Empfangsbereich mit einer kleinen Bar sind ansprechend gestaltet. Alles in Allem sehr zu empfehlen. 
26325 The location was great and the staff was welcoming and nice. The rooms okay: the bed were confortable, the washroom was spacious and beautiful, but the room itself was a little bit small. We really enjoyed our stay overall, WOW is a great adjective for the Crown Plaza ! 
26326 Excellent place, rooms are clean and nice, staff is friendly and the location is safe and great. I felt safe walking around late at night. 
26327 Excellent customer service throughout our stay. A fantastic location, and helpful staff, including Richard who printed our return boarding passes as the business service was unavailable that day. The hotel is in a great location, easily accessible via subway, and close to Times Square. 
26328 Remember that this is a two-star-hotel. I forgot, but was reminded very quickly. The hallways are very narrow, the elevator is claustrophobic and the rooms are likewise small. The staff was not especially nice, and the included WiFi was just horrible. Location is alright though. 
26329 They have the best customer service I have ever experienced! I would advise anyone who is coming to Chicago to stay here!! 
26330 the room was small and faced an enclosed air shaft...when I asked for another room the service given had to be the worst I have ever experienced in any hotel or city I visited..I would advise to stay clear of this hotel...It made my NYC experience less than enjoyable 
26331 Brand new property. Clean neat and efficient. Friendly staff. I liked the off-lobby restaurant w bar. Nice pool area indoors w nice work-out room. Great menu at the restaurant and a good beer selection. I appreciate being able to stay and eat on site with out having to "taxi" around. 
26332 Great location, very hip, comfortable beds and great nightlife. 
26333 The people working in this hotel are totally negative. They never smile. They do not give a clear answer to you. 
26334 Ojala alguien me hubiera advertido... nos picaron pulgas o garrapatas, muy sucio y pesimo servicio, verdaderamente el gobierno debe clausurarlo. 
26335 I love this place! The staff is very friendly and accommodating....I feel like I'm in a little town somewhere when I'm here than you step outside and you are in the heart of nyc....I love it! I stay here all the time. The front desk staff is amazing! 
26336 Stayed there for a business trip for 3 nights. Bar is great as always. Breakfast - very good. Rooms and hallways have been renovated (at least the floor I stayed in) = simply wonderful. The darkness is gone, everything appears more lively. Service as always excellent. 
26337 I stayed here all of 6 hours after a red eye but really nice room and service and QUIET! 
26338 spacious, clean room, nice breakfast, but one problem, was told there was a 24 hour complimentary shuttle from airport, arrived just before midnight, called hotel at 11: 55 and was told shottle finished at midnight- had to take a cab, $12, and a very disgruntled driver. Otherwise waspleased with hotel 
26339 Staff very helpful when checking in. Room was lovely, very clean although slightly small but have been told that's pretty normal for New York. Great location as well! Would definitely recommend!! 
26340 Stayed in a family suite that slept 5/6 with lots of space for NY. The best nights sleep I have ever had in NY - this hotel is soooo quiet yet right on Times Square... Great value for money and its all in okay condition. 
26341 This hotel provided what I needed; a clean room with a comfortable bed, nice flat screen television and wifi. The staff was friendly and check-in was quick. The hotel is one block south of Canal St. and the subway (A,C,E) is in front of the hotel. I will be back. 
26342 Wonderful location and very attractive hotel and room. The staff couldn't have been any more attentive to us. We also enjoyed a fabulous meal around the corner and a jazz club just blocks away for evening entertainment. Easy access to Magnificent Mile, Navy Pier, Modern Art Museum and public transportation. 
26343 Estuve alojado durante una semana. La ubicacion es excelente, a 10 min andando de Times Square. El servicio es bueno, aunqe los desayunos y el roomservice dejaba bastante que desear. 
26344 Super-convenient to me, visiting home office right around the corner. Couldn't be better. Highly recommended. Bed was extra-comfy. 
26345 Very good location, just off times square. Hotel is modern but lacks atmosphere Rooms are quiet small but very comfortable and nicely decorated The breakfasts are very good and portions are huge so no need for lunch. New York is my favourite city in the world you won't be disappointed 
26346 Pase 4 dias en sept 2011. Excelente ubicacion en pleno times square metro a 200 metros. El hotel es tipo boutiquenmuy moderno. Tiene un bistro interesante. Las habitaciones son chicas pero modernas muy lindas y muy limpias. Lo recomiendo sin dudas ! 
26347 Great hotel,good location for touring , service was great,ideal location to subway and bus. Breakfast was very good, hot foods was hot and the cold food was cold and there was enough for all guests. 
26348 A notre arrivee le 16 fevrier l'hotel n'avait pas pris en compte notre reservation de france.plus de chambre et aucun effort pour comprendre notre detresse apres 12 heures d'avion.Chambre finalement qui ne correspondait plus pour trois personne .Personnel detestable et chambres minuscule.Navrant 
26349 Small room with bunk beds, shared toilet and shower with whole floor, good for those who plan to enjoy the city and only use the room to sleep or rest 
26350 really great Hotel, great and friendly service. recommend 
26351 Stayed at the hotel this past weekend and the hotel was very nice and accommodating. The Michael Jordan Steak House was excellent. Only issue I had was the A/C fan was running all night. 
26352 Stayed for business. Rooms were clean, staff was very nice. Location is handy for the airport. I would definitely stay here again. 
26353 Fantastic hotel with great staff and perfect location.. We just cant wait to return 
26354 We spent the first night ouf our wedding weekend at The Plaza. Unbeatable location, beautiful and very luxurious room with an increadible bathroom. Service was excellent. Could not be a better way to start off a wedding weekend. Had drinks at the bar which over looks the stunning lobby. 
26355 This hotel gets a high rate for the great location. The rooms are ok, the bathroom is quite small. The service is great and the staff are friendly and helpful. Very close to Madison Square Garden! 
26356 The room was clean and very quiet at night. I especially like all the amenities this hotel offers in the rooms. 
26357 The hotel was too big to my taste, masses of people jamming the elevators and lobby areas.. My bathroom had hair remains from a previous guest, which is not that pleasant, and it wasn't cleaned after my first night (out of 2) 
26358 Stay Hotel was excellent. The location was unbeatable; the staff were approachable, helpful and welcoming; and the beds were extremely comfortable. We would definitely stay here again. Perfect for Times Square, Broadway shows and the Rockefeller. 
26359 Very trendy. Central location, friendly service, clean & good rooms. Excellent restaurant. Unfortunately no swimming pool. Wifi not always stable. Gym good but busy at rush hours. Problem with airco was fixed quickly after reporting. Check out swift and professional. 
26360 I stayed one night...called from the airport and booked the room. Friendly staff, very clean room, standard room perfect for solo traveler. Noise not a problem...comfortable bed and linens. Staff was prompt in delivering forgotten toiletries/iron, etc. Lobby is adjacent to Starbucks open until midnight. Would definitely return. 
26361 From start to finish, a great stay. The front desk staffers were friendly and helpful, the room was spotless, large, new, and quiet, and the breakfast was plentiful and excellent. 
26362 Great location hotel and value, although rooms slightly on the smallish side. Maybe that is the same for all NY thought. Don't get breakfast - many options on the streets around. Definitely worth going back to if their prices stay down. 
26363 Day and night compared to the old Helmsley hotel. The staff was very attentive and helpful, most of the times. Small lobby area with limited bar and restaurant but great clean rooms, gym and location! Two blks from grand Central with many types of transportation. 
26364 Clean, comfortable and spacious room. Staff friendly and helpful.Good sports bar. In a quiet area, but only 20 minutes by bus to the very centre of town. Thoroughly enjoyed my stay and would recommend this hotel. 
26365 The location of this hotel is perfect and the rooms are confortable. They should improve the front desk and the breakfast. 
26366 Spent Mother's Day at this wonderful hotel with my family. So close to everything, amazing staff, comfortable rooms. We will definitely choose this hotel for our next trip to NYC!! 
26367 Stayed here for 4 nights in July. Walls are paper thin so could hear the couple next door making love! Definitely not up to the standard of the Grand Hyatt in Melbourne Australia. 
26368 The rooms are very small and the hotel is overpriced. The breakfast was OK. Very nice strawberry croisants. You can do better in NYC. 
26369 Great hotel! On arrival the staff were polite and friendly and no problems with our reservation. The room was small but immaculate. Everything we could have needed was supplied. I would definatley recommend! 
26370 The hotel was so convenient to Times Square just around the corner. Hotel was chic and modern. Rooms were small and cozy but for 2 people on their honeymoon it was perfect. Near everything includining subways. Will definately stay again. 
26371 This is a good hotel. The staff was friendly, and the rooms are big and clean. There is a nice lounge, and the free wireless interenet access is very nice for business travel. If you are into shopping, you will not be bored. There are also several nice restaurants nearby. 
26372 This hotel was very clean and had very good service for a really good price. Unlike the other review - I did not see any bedbugs! The service was very good and friendly - and the breakfast was good as well. 
26373 This is a very good hotel. Pretty, large rooms. Friendliest staff and great customer service. 
26374 Perfect location for all things NYC, whether business or pleasure - this is a great spot! 
26375 We stayed here for our first trip to nyc. Very luxurious! Service was top notch, made us feel very special and went out of their way to please us. Location was excellent. Definitely recommend to stay here! We will be back! 
26376 Friendly staff, great location. Used SPG points. Offered high room and very late checkout. Great bed, pillows, and towels. The burger smell in the lobby gets old. Would stay again. 
26377 If you want a good night's sleep and some space, this is the hotel for you. Location is amazing...walking distance to Times Square, Central Park, and several trains. Wouldn't mind staying here again in the future! 
26378 I got a great deal on a standard room on the hotel's website, and they gave me a complementary upgrade to a junior suite on arrival! The suite was very nicely furnished and spotlessly clean. Check in and check out were a breeze. I highly recommend this hotel. 
26379 everything about this hotel was great except the street has a lot of sirens that may keep you up at night. bring some earplugs. 
26380 Girls trip... while one had a conference at hotel... Location was perfect.. Cabs always available.. no need to rent a car. Beautiful view... Staff was very friendly and very helpful for anything... Drinks at bar were pricey but well worth it, they were great. 
26381 The most pleasant , polite and helpful staff .. Clean and large rooms with huge bed !!! Thanks for a memorable stay and the best services! (many of them free) 
26382 Staying at the Pierre was a delight from start to finish. The room was beautiful with a breath-taking view over central park and the city. The bed was probably the most comfortable bed I have ever slept in... All staff were attentive and cheerful, making us feel very welcome. 
26383 el hotel es antiguo pero todo esta correcto, limpio..., cada dia cambian toallas y el personal muy atento. a nosotros nos toco una habitacion con vistas al empire era ideal, total a ny solo se va al hotel a dormir no hace falta reservar una suitte real. 
26384 clean and large room! great location, very near to times square, subway, airport express. very nice and friendly staff, they help you with anything! i would come back anytime!! 
26385 We have stayed here for a week. The staff is very friendly and helpfull. We had a room on the 3rd floor. The room was very quit and certainly big enough. Spacious room. We can recommend the breakfast buffet. Enough choices between hot and cold food. 
26386 Hat uns sehr gut gefallen, sehr zentral, saubere Zimmer, netter Service 
26387 Et veldig bra hotell som gir deg mye for pengene. Beliggenheten er helt fantastisk - midt paa Times Square, uten at dette innebaerene nesten noen form for stoey. Hyggelige ansatte, store og fine rom, og veldig god service. Kommer garantert tilbake. 
26388 This was an exciting find! It was clean, spacious, and priced perfectly! Traveling with children this hotel is wonderful ! 
26389 Nice location, the rooms are a good size, however our bathroom was very small. The hotel is ready for some upgrades however nothing bothered us to much. Just a short walk to time square and we felt safe walking in the area. 
26390 Easy to get to off of I45, lots of places to eat, Walmart close. Friendly. Will use again next time through. 
26391 Het Amsterdam Court Hotel had voor ons een prima kamer op de begane grond Prima kamer , bed was wel wat hard, maar gelukkig prima kussens, werkende airco en een prima douche. Kortom het hotel is de 3 sterren helemaal waard. 
26392 world record cockroach infestation-i pulled back the bed headboard and there was hundreds on the wall,all sizes. they changed my room,never stayed there again. dont forget your video camcorder-my biggest regret. 
26393 What a great find. The rooms were huge and very comfortable. The location was extremely convenient to everything we wanted to see and the service was impeccable and very friendly. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting a comfortable, affordable hotel with genuinely friendly, helpful staff! 
26394 My husband and I are frequent guests since 2007 and we feel like being at home. This time we stayed for 25 days. 
26395 We stayed here for 4 nights at the end of 2010. Fantastic Location! Rooms are small but good value for the location. This was out second time staying here and would definately stay here again. 
26396 wonderful hotel. even though the rooms are old retirees. new beds equal to all Hilton hotels and LCD TV. large bedroom and bathroom. very nice fitness center. worth staying in this hotel by going to NYC. 
26397 We have stayed here twice and would definitely come back again. Great location and staff. Love the beds and cleanliness. Felt like coming home again. jody 
26398 Spent 3 nights in the hotel in July 2012 and was very satisfied. Hotel was clean and rooms were well done. The staff was friendly and helpful. The only negative was the size of the rooms--they are very, very small. Price considered, this is a very nice place 
26399 Great location, great service, very clean could not ask for anything else. Two blocks from every where. I also love the general manager's office in the lobby. 
26400 I had written the GM in advance that I was coming for my 5th anniversary. From the check in it was all easy, fast and extremely forthcoming. I was already upgraded in the computer and asked if I wanted a late checkout. I can only recommend the W! 
26401 Great location but absolute average at top end prices 
26402 We were absolutely thrilled with this hotel. You never know what you are going to get when you book a NYC hotel, but the description listed was exactly what we got. Clean, roomy, great location, great staff and a bargain price. We will stay there again! Thank you! 
26403 A horrible experience. Ancient, slow elevators, surly desk staff, uncomfortable bed, lots of noise in hall, avoid at all costs. 
26404 Pleasant boutique hotel with a great restaurant. Unfortunately a very small gym. Excellent sleeping menu. Pick your favourite pillow from the menu. Ask for an upgrade to a suite and enjoy a living room next to your (bed)room and a fully equipped kitchen. 
26405 Very nice and a great place to stay. Good location and the people who work there are great. 
26406 The location is excellent. However the hotel staff/ facilities and quality of the hotel is totally unacceptable. Few of my collagues got bed bugs! Housekeeping keep banging on the doors, rush into your room without checking for the sign! Front desk staffs were not helpful!! Manager is such a GARBAGE! 
26407 Clean rooms though a reno might be needed. (paint peeling) Linens 100% cotton which was good. Hated the shower, flooded the bathroom every time Big rooms Staff friendly 
26408 Is a fantastic location 5 minutes far from Time Square. Full of colors and music. Fantastic for young people. 
26409 Krishna did an outstanding job when it came to customer service. She went far beyond her call of duty and went out of her way to make my stay here at the Super 8 excellent. I officially nominate her for outstanding employee of the month. 
26410 Incredibly small bathroom-typical for an older hotel. Large room and comfortable bed. All needed internet/video/tv connections. Would have enjoyed a bathrobe, but bath amenities were fine. Front desk service efficient and helpful. Not the best-but certainly far from the worst of Manhattan hotels. 
26411 Great location. Nice Staff. Very small but clean rooms. However, the hotel should invest in more insolation between rooms and triple pane windows for noise reduction and also check that guests are quiet between midnight and 6 a.m. 
26412 L'hotel pourrait ajouter une machine a cafe et un four a microondes dans chaque chambre. De plus le refrigerateur ne laisse aucune place pour les aliments personnels du client. 
26413 Brand new hotel with very comfortable and modern rooms. The bathroom is spacious and weel equiped. Cleaning service was impecable, and staff very friendly. Great location, near everything and yet in a calm quarter. Highly recommended. 
26414 This hotel was a nice surprise. In that it was near Time Square, inexpensive, clean, wonderful friendly staff, parking near by, comfortable bed, updated bathroom with fluffy towels, breakfast and a quiet and descent size room. I will return. All I wanted was something nice to sleep at night. 
26415 Excellent facilities for the price. Great location on East 40th for Grand central station, 5th avenue, Broadway and Times Square. Room was clean, tidy, warm and the staff were very friendly. Would not hesitate to stay here again. 
26416 This hotel was in a great location on Westheimer road. Close to lots of restaurants and shopping. Will definitely stay here again. 
26417 We stayed one night- july 4, good location-- 1 blocks from subway--very friendly staff-- Room small (but on par for NYC) - But very clean. Beds were very comfy. A great deal on the price as well. I would recommend to all! 
26418 Le camere molto piccole ma pulite.personale non parlante italiano.vicinissimo alla metro. servizio internet solo a pagamento e senza minuti gratis come era scritto nel sito. clientela giovane e poco esigente. 
26419 Booked hotel as recomended by Aussie travel agent, found it to be value for money, great location, staff very helpful and had no problems at all, overall a good hotel to stay at at its price bracket 
26420 Main entrance is on 222 West 77th St but we spent some time looking on Broadway to no avail! 
26421 Very friendly staff. Room was clean and very confortable. Will stay again. 
26422 Spent 5 days in this magnificent hotel. Its right on times square. Amazing place to stay. 
26423 Just stayed at the Swissotel in Chicago for one night - room was upgraded to a suite that was just wonderful. The staff were helpful, the room was spotless and the setting was very nice. 
26424 Lucia, Bernetta, and Gracie have awesome customer service and were very helpful, friendly and nice! 
26425 Close to the airport and rides a shuttle to interviews for united. A great family runs it and tjey were all so pleasant. 
26426 The Mayfair is in terrible shape, the rooms are small, nothing is maintained. Service was horrible. Obviously it is WAY overpriced. Its location is the only positive. I will never stay there again. 
26427 you can find private bathrooms and friendly staff. we had no problems and were very satisfied with the service. thanks a lot. I will again stay here next time. 
26428 10 / 10 for a city break hotel. Gorgeous room, huge bathroom and minutes from times square. Couldn't have asked for more. Love this hotel and will return whenever in New York. 
26429 The rooms are comfortable and lovely. The location is great. The staff is more than accomodating to your every want and need. Waku the bellman went above and beyond...thanks Waku...the chocolate taxi made it home in one piece! 
26430 We (my wife and I) had a fantastic time. Its right in the middle of the theatre district and 100m from Time Square. The price/location/quality relation is very good. Our room (622) was rather big and the bathroom was OK, with a bad. I can realy recommend it to anyone. 
26431 I really enjoyed staying there. Pretty and clean hotel with great price! Staff was very friendly and helpful. My bed was really comfortable. There are some great places to eat close by. Thank you for the hospitality!!! 
26432 The rooms are beatuiful and the location is perfect. It was such a good deal I couldn't believe it! The staff was unreal. SOOO helpful and awesome. Especially Jamie and Kim... will definitely recommend. Thank you soooo much! 
26433 The bed was good the lighting was very dated and poor. It was a good location close to the action and on the side of town nearest Mccormick. If they would put new lighting and some newer furniture in the room it would be better 
26434 This hotel was fantastic. The rooms were well maintained. The staff was ready to please at all times. Free shuttle service with recommendations to the best restaraunts and a very good on site steak house. 
26435 I stayed there again this year and enjoyed my stay. We stayed on the fifth floor this time and it was more quiet. The room was very clean and comfortable, maybe a bit small. The shared bath are very clean. Very well located!! Would go back again. 
26436 We enjoyed our stay at the New York Hilton but were very dissapointed at the food in the lobby lounge. Noisy, poor servcice and very modest food. Stay at hotel but do not eat there 
26437 Not cheap but it is New York after all....rooms were clean with good air con. Concierge and other staff helpful 
26438 Clean lobby, room, square footage of room good. Bedding good quality. Used parking for flight out of Hobby Houston. 
26439 Very good location. Very easy to get good vegetarian indian food at DESI JUNCTION 
26440 Minutes from Times Square 
26441 Had a great stay at the Eastgate Towers for three weeks. The accommodation is affordable, comfortable and clean. The staff friendly and professional. The location is quiet but close to all the amenities. Recommended highly particularly for a longer stay. 
26442 Stayed at the Westin for a quick 4 day stay in NYC. It was a great location, terrific service, and the rooms were good size. The owe from our room was amazing! Centrally located to get around the city easily... 
26443 I almost always stay here when visiting NY. It is no frills, but it is very clean. I love the location. The staff is very helpful. NEVER any b.s. or hassle. Always a great price and location. 
26444 great hotel, top location, very clean and safe. the stuff is very helpfull and kind. 
26445 Stayed there in April and can't fault the hotel. Rooms were clean and modern, and staff, very polite and helpful. Breakfast can be busy but you don't have to wait long before you get a table, and the food was very nice. I would recommend this hotel. 
26446 The hotel staff was polite and gracious! We continue to visit this hotel because of its cozy location (just blocks away from a train station) and the rooms with kitchenettes which saves us tons of cash. No complaints here! Perfect for budget traveler needs. 
26447 Nice clean room Busy location,but quet room Nice bathroom,good size by NY standards Wish the would have free WiFi and there is no help with food places Dont order food downstears, especially desert. Good Starbucks across the street. 
26448 You can't be any more convenient to Midway airport. The shuttle service is great. The room was very clean and very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent, possibly the best breakfast I have ever had at a hotel. The food was high quality and the preparation was perfect. 
26449 We loved our stay at this hotel. All of our needs and requests were met. The room was clean and the view was beautiful on the 30th floor. Everyone was courteous and friendly. The front desk and valet were excellent and accommodating. 
26450 Great location, descent room size and very clean. Very friendly staff! Nice cafeteria for quick breakfast with good coffee and a big range of croissants / pain au chocolate... Free Internet in the lounge but not in the rooms. all in all, I truly recommend it! 
26451 Have stayed 3 times in past month. Have been very pleased. Service of all staff we encountered was outstanding. We were truly made to feel like guests, and not customers! Great value, especially when using Gold Passport points. 
26452 We stayed in a Grand King room. It was very large, well furnished and equipped and extremely quiet. It also had dual sinks, a large tub and separate large shower. The staff was excellent and very attentive. We would defniitely stay here again and would highly recommend the hotel. 
26453 Recently stayed at the Hotel on Rivington for business. The hotel exceeded all my expectations, from decor to service. As a hotel GM, I am very particular about service and this place didn't dissapoint. Michelle at the restaurant is amazing. Can't wait to return. 
26454 this stay was good, as usual. i have always enjoyed my stay at this property. the staff if always friendly and helpful. they have always been very responsive to my needs. 
26455 Clean/delime the shower heads pls as this would substantially improve the showering and stay experience. 
26456 Check-In most pleasant. Room clean, many lights and lamps, bathroom like new, TV seems new, heat modern and controllable. Bed extra comfortable. You won't beat this hotel at a comparable price. 
26457 Good price for a good sevice and location. 
26458 A small but centrally located hotel. Positive side that it has internet, breakfast and there is a refrigerator. Negatively is that there are narrow stairs and no elevator. 
26459 My family & I stayed at the Staybridge for two weeks. It was truely a pleasurable stay. The staff were hospitable, friendly and caring. The rooms were spacious, and the location was outstanding. This was the best value for money that I have enjoyed for a long time. 
26460 This hotel is a Gem! I booked it using Hotwire and was pleasantly surprised!!!!! The staff was fantastic, the rooms were clean and great size for NYC. Within steps of 24hr drugstore and subway. Would gladly recommend to a friend! 
26461 ci sono stata a novembre 2011 hotel x il mio viaggio di nozze vicino alla metro per raggiungere il centro gli interni molto spaziosi con cucina salotto con immense vetrate che affacciano sui maestosi grattaceli di new yorik e una vista formidabile.... ve lo consiglio 
26462 Nice older hotel....small rooms, but 2 bathrooms....wonderful beds! 
26463 Excellent carefull with persons even from The another country, making To fell in home even travelling with The long way from home 
26464 Stayed here for 4 nights 4-7 December. Room small but clean, staff helpful & friendly. Bed comfortable and bathroom fine. Handy location - this was our third visit to NY, first at this hotel as recommended by friends. Would certainly stay there again.Trevor & Jessean Phillips 
26465 Personale molto gentile, letto comodissimo, ottima colazione, belle camere con bagni spaziosi, centro fitness con attrezzi tecnogyn, la SPA e' fantastica! Occupa un intero piano! Arredamento e accessori raffinati e Made in Italy :) 
26466 Muy bien ubicado para todos los recorridos mas importantes de manhattan. Habitaciones comodas y bastante buenas. Servicio atento y rapido. Despistes en servicio de limpieza que no dejaban las toallas suficientes. Tienen que mejorar algo mantenimiento y control calidad (una habitacion apestaba a tabaco) 
26467 We loved the decor, staff, and location. It would help to have more dining options on-site, but the concierge desk did provide good recommendations and helped with reservations... kudos to them for last minutes ticket arrangements as well! 
26468 I went to NY in November 2008 and stayed at the Affinia Dumont. The hotel has a great location and facilities. The staff is friendly and it is very clean. The standard room is huge and spectacular!! I recommend this hotel. 
26469 This is a great place to stay! Convenient location, safe neighborhood, spacious and clean rooms, full kitchen (with dishwasher!), full baths, dining area. Great value. We'll be back. 
26470 Great location, nice view. Was able to walk to restaurants and shopping. Staff was very helpful. Would stay there again. 
26471 This is a great neighborhood - Upper West Side. Lots of local flair. Room was small, but ok, since we weren't there very much. Close to subway stop, too. Loved the local neighborhood, service was great. I thought it was very expensive, but I guess it's typical of NYC. 
26472 We stayed here for lollapalooza. The hotel was close to grant park, so we could just walk to the festival. There are also plenty of subway lines close to it. The hotel was clean, Great service from the staff. 
26473 I arrived here after having spent a night at an awful hotel nearby. The staff were friendly and extremely helpful. The room was small but neat and everything was clean. I had a wonderful sleep in a super comfy bed. I highly recommend this for the budget-conscious traveller. 
26474 Great little boutique hotel. Room was large, clean and very comfortable. Hotel is a 2 minute walk from Time Square. Staff were friendly - nothing too much trouble. Can thouroughly recommend this hotel. Will stay here again. 
26475 The hotel staff is nice and friendly and the rooms were clean. It was a great location to Time Square and great restaurants and shows. I would recommend this hotel to someone looking to stay in NYC. 
26476 Fui con mis hijos adolecentes y el hotel es muy comodo, pero lo encontre un poco lejos de los citios turisticos. 
26477 Eden at the Chicago City Center did everything she possibly could to get our reservations and turn our stressful business trip into a fabulous vacation. I have never had so much dedication in the 30 years I have been operating my business. Eden you are the best! 
26478 Nice modern hotel in great location; attentive staff, always helpful. Bathrooms a little small, but there is more important stuff to do in NY anway. 
26479 Fun-filled hipster vibe. Pbr's. constant nerd parties in the lobby/bar area. Great for drinking all day, peeing in your pants, and putting stickers on walls. Bunk beds were cozy. If you choose the top bunk, try not falling off. Overall, nice price for a semi-nice room. 
26480 This hotel and its staff really goes the extra "mile"to assure that their guests have a first rate experience. I would return gladly! 
26481 This hotel was wonderful and very well situated in NYC, easy to get around with the subway just steps away. Quite expensive however no complaints. 
26482 Just returned from a trip to NYC. I stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 3 nights. It is the best sleep I have had in many years. The beds were so comfortable!! The rooms were great and the service was superb. 
26483 Esta cerca del Time Square en la calle 48, hay una estacion del subway en la 50 muy cerca de la 7 av donde pasa el bus. Habitacion comoda para los 4. Limpio y bonito. Hay muchas opciones para comer muy cerca. 
26484 Perfect location. The rooms were very clean and the stuff was very polite 
26485 stayed for 2 nights, friendly staff ,room was a bit small for 2 double bed but nice furniture and bed 
26486 in the morning can be a bit noisy from the traffic but overall was great. 
26487 It was a good place to be. Near everything, just half a block from Times Square. I got a good price at hotwire, so I recomend it. It is a place that I can came back. 
26488 Very helpful staff! Nice and clean! Nice location near Central Park. I think you should have free coffee not just a few hours but 24/7. It was very good that you had free maps and other guides. 
26489 I didn't pay or 5th avenue, the place was clean & tidy after a long flight, room was what we asked for. 
26490 Best views! Most terrific gym. Not sure how anyone could say it has limited number of machines. The linens are superb. High parking rates but what tourist drives a car here. Will stay here again for sure. 
26491 The rooms are TINY here. So when you open the door you almost hit the bed LOL. But its good for 2 people if not staying too long. No space at all. But its good location. Quiet for being NY and clean. Internet also available 
26492 must go to the dinners accross the street, very good place for breakfast, great location. One of the best in Time Square. 
26493 The food is terrible - overpriced and nearly inedible. No matter how hungry you think you are, don't do it. Walk one block to 9th ave. and there are many better options. 
26494 Everything perfect during our last trip. Club lounge excellent and have to give special mention to Laza- a real character and great fun.. But all were staff excellent, friendly and elcoming without being in any way over th top. I wouldnt stay anywhere else in NYC 
26495 great location, very clean and modern. bed moves into a sofa for more room which is a very good idea.rooms are small but perfect. hot drinks and water available for free. muffins and drinks free for breakfast - hot breakfast has to be purchased. would defo recommend and stay again. 
26496 I stay at this brand all the time. These folks have it down pat. Clean. Efficient. Great attitude. I'll stay there again. They were all, to a very one, helpful, eager to make me feel at home and even accommodated my request for. Higher floor and better view. 
26497 Our second time staying at this hotel. It was clean and cheap ($140) compared to NY standards. Close to restaurants and shopping on 7th ave. the staff was wonderful and since I'm a gold Starwood Hotel member we were on club floor which was nice and quiet. 
26498 This hotel was perfect for us - excellent location, outstanding service and very clean rooms. Staff were incredibly helpful, especially Tom at the front desk. The breakfast was really good as well. What more could you ask for? 
26499 Perfectly comfortable hotel, good price, pretty good location. And VERY comfortable beds. 
26500 Excellent, folks were very helpful staff, really willing to accommodate one's needs. 
26501 The positives: great location, hip vibe, nice rooftop bar, comfy beds. The negatives: it feels a bit worn, slow elevators, the shower had mold, and very noisy doors. I did not think you got enough bang for your buck. 
26502 This hotel was nothing like it shows in pictures, Stinky hallways will ruin your vacation. Never book this hotel through eleisurelink(--) the reps will tell you its walking distance from downtown.Don,t spoil your vacation staying here. More info email me at sdilon@yahoo.com 
26503 My wife and I stayed here two days before Christmas 2011. The location is superb, 200 meters from Times Square. Rooms were nice and clean, and the staff was very friendly. 
26504 Just like every other Schrager. Which could be a good thing if you aren't bored of them. Good value. 
26505 I wasn't expecting that much - thought this place was a tourist trap. However, rooms were huge (for NYC) and the bathroom was great - water pressure was a bit blah though. Got a great rate online- given the location and the room size, definitely recommend. 
26506 Stayed at the Dumont with a group of friends over Thanksgiving. The rooms were spacious, with terrific views and the staff were so helpfull all the time. Great value for money and I would seriously recommend the hotel. 
26507 I attended a function yesterday and the ballroom carpet/chairs had a terrible smell, I saw bugs running around in the women's bathroom and on the ballroom floor, I didn't feel safe to eat! I had a terrible experience 
26508 Tiny rooms, dirty carpet toewls and blanket. The attendants do not cleaned the bathroom and the desk clerk was not even able to call us a taxi to the airport.... 
26509 de entree is erg mooi. De kamers zijn eenvoudig, wat verouderd maar schoon. De bedden zijn wat aan de korte kant. Elke dag schone badlakens en goed schoongemaakt. Een betaalbaar hotel, perfecte lokatie kortom alles wat je nodig hebt om een leuke tijd in new york te hebben. 
26510 Mattress felt like a pull-out couch in someone's den. Deal breaker for me--I wouldn't choose this hotel again. Small room, but efficiently designed and very clean. Good location just a few blocks from Time Square--close enough to the action, but not right in the middle of it. 
26511 stayed for 2 nights with teenagers. Overall great hotel for the value. They had great laundry facility and gym. breakfast was not the best, just okay. 
26512 Disappointed at the response on the part of management about the excessive noise, and being awakened by a 4:00a wake-up call I didn't request. Frustrating! Stayed one night and booked a different hotel for the second night. Not impressed with room or staff. 
26513 I have stayed at the Waldorf a couple of times now, very consistent with their service and a good location for your New York experience. 
26514 Very clean room for a great price. Great location : near subways, tourbus stops, Times Square, Broadway, etc. Great food available all around the hotel. I'd go back in a second. Only negative point is you may sometimes hear the subway pass, although not that frequently. 
26515 The Maritime's room have peephole windows resembling those of ships. The rest of the design, too, has a maritime flair. Rooms are a bit snug for two people inhabiting them, but still comfortable. The hotel's restaurant La Bottega has good food and service. 
26516 My daughter and I stayed at this hotel Jan 2- Jan 7. The hotel had everything we needed: Great location Nice size room Two queen size beds - very comfortable We looked forward to eating breakfast every morning in the restaurant - delicious. Great Stay! 
26517 Had a weekend in Chicago and stayed at the Fairmont. I loved it. The service was superb, the room was perfect and I was able to rest after busy days. Large rooms, excellent lay out, great accessibility. Great place to stay. 
26518 Came for a conference, and the hotel met my needs. Very clean rooms with comfortable beds. I also really enjoyed the workout facility. The only downside is that the area around the hotel was pretty dead at night. 
26519 Location is excellent. Staff is friendly enough. The bar is comfy and has decent food. BUT....the rooms need serious updating - they need better lighting...and the beds and sheets were terribly dingy and dirty. Yuck. 
26520 Weary and ready for a good night's sleep we arrived late...fast check in...front desk staff were very friendly and helped us find something for delivery for a late night dinner. The beds were incredibly comfortable. NICE! 
26521 We usually stay in this hotel because it is across the road from the Port Authority AND the location cannot be beat. 42nd Street! The rooms are a good size, The gym has good equipment. Breakfast was included which we quite enjoyed. Everyone was helpful and friendly. 
26522 The service was good, but our room was tiny, the bed wasn't clean and full of hairs, everything had a shabby look, and the power fell out during half of our stay. The wifi worked just fine. 
26523 the best rooms service and a short walk to seventy second street subway and short walk to central park the best.We had a supermarket across the road and coffee close by 
26524 The rooms were large all facilities including a kitchen would stay there again any time 
26525 This hotel is fine for an in and out trip but know that you are taking taxis where you want to go. Nothing convenient around. The Staff is great...the rooms are fine....If the price is right it is a safe choice. 
26526 Great hotel, newly renovated. Staff very friendly and helpful. Brian the doorman ia the best in NY. Always ready to help and warmly greats all guests. Facility has one of the best fitness centers for a hotel in NY. 
26527 I recently went to Chicago for business/pleasure and stayed at the South Loop Hotel. Hats off to the awesome staff, the customer service was out the box. The accomodations were great and the restaurant staff and food was great as well. I will definitely stay here again 
26528 Second visit this year from 24th -28th Oct. No problems at all.Booked because of its central location.Added benefits are tea and coffee always available.Staff helpful.Room was a little on the small side but not really a problem considering the advantages mentioned ie location,buffet breakfast etc. Will use this hotel again. 
26529 It was a very Good Stay at The Hotel. Breakfast was excellent, we will be there again. The nearby Washington Square Park allows to relax, at bleecker street there was good food and StuffIt. Very nice. 
26530 Everything was perfect. Elegant, great service, fascinating artwork throughout the hotel, and outdoor dining on the 6th floor terrace, facing Ground Zero. Only afterwards did I realize that the large outdoor screen adjacent to the hotel was part of the hotel. Extremely memorable. 
26531 Great hotel close to all the 'action'. Sexy looking room with nice views of the goings on the streets and rooftops of other buildings (such as construction workers doing pushups on the job or someone shooting a music video on the rooftop). I would definitely recommend this hotel! 
26532 good front desk service, extra care provided for supplementing the business center services. for a convention it was fine but located in a dreadful part of the city. town car services are helpful but have limited hours. room was more spacious than anticipated. 
26533 I went there for business trip and the hotel was clean, quiet and the room was comfortable. 
26534 un ottimo hotel in posizione strategica,siete vicinissimi alla fermata metro di canal street e potete arrivare a piedi, in pochissimo tempo a soho e chinatown.servizio eccellente e personale disponibile.da consigliare. 
26535 I have stayed here a couple of times, the price is right, it's easy to get to, the location is great, it's close to everything you need, Times Square, convenience stores, restaurants, etc. The hotel is clean and modern, the staff is helpful and accommodating and you can't beat that! 
26536 For two days I stayed while on business. The location is very convenient, connected to the Galleria Mall. The breakfast was very good. It was a very good choice 
26537 It doesn't get much better than this. 
26538 ideal location, first rate accommodations, incredibly friendly and professional staff. We've tried many other hotels in Manhattan, but always gravitate back to this one 
26539 our absolute favorite! 
26540 Excellent location and close to the subways. The hotel is new and very nice. Nice and clean, and great value. Highly recommend. 
26541 it was good.. staff was good,.hotel was clean, location was awesome and the food was really good. need a bigger bathroom 
26542 I would not recommend this hotel to anyone. The price is okay. The overall environment is not okay. 
26543 Great location, good price. Highly recommended. Rooms were larger than expected. We got Frette robes. There was a nice lounge to hang out in and free flow of fruit, coffee, and water. 
26544 Lovely hotel, quiet location and near some good restaurants, bars and starbucks. Lovely walks through central park to attractions and very close to subway station. Complimentary Danish and coffee in reception each morning and friendly staff. Lovely comfortable beds and good air-con. I would definitely stay here again. 
26545 everything about this hotel was top notch, friendly, clean, comfortable and a great pot of coffee!!! 
26546 It was smaller than I thought, but it was still great. The service was great, good food, and a nice enough room. It's in a great location, just a little difficult to find. 
26547 Perfect spot for your sightseeing. Clean rooms but no view, bathroom a little dated but perfectly OK. Staff helpful and attentive and got great deal on the cost. I'd go back! 
26548 Excellent hotel and staff evryone here was extremely friendly and helpful, woul definately recommend to everyone I know. 
26549 The staff at the front desk and in the bar were incredibly friendly and remembered me night to night. The room was clean and refurbished--all of the decor was in good shape--and the bed was incredibly comfortable. 
26550 The rooms are small & bathroom oh do tiny but the shower wad clean & comfy. Clean environment friendly staff. Conviniently located. Convenience store across the street. Very few restaurants very close bit some good ones within walk distance. Find your own car parking close by. Quiet neighborhood. 
26551 This hotel was great, large clean rooms, nice employees and great rates. This hotel was also very quiet for a New York hotel! 
26552 It was a perfect location and took care of all we needed. Corner bakery was great and so was cocopazzo cafe 
26553 I loved this hotel and the location was perfect. The rooms are very clean and the staff is super friendly. I'll definitely stay here again. 
26554 I've stayed a few times at the Hilton Times Square and each time had a very nice room and experience. The location is great and very convenient. Most of the staff is very helpful. 
26555 Central to everything. A great place to stay. Very comfortable and staff was very helpful with answers to any questions. Beds were very comfortable and views were great. I would stay there again. 
26556 Excellent choice. We stayed 7 nights. Bought a $27 seven day unlimited metro card and had a great stay. Express metro to Times Square and Penn (from 72nd street) awesome. Loved NYC even though we are in a heat wave. Great food shopping opposite. 
26557 seul hotel ou on fait la queue au PDJ salle de bains non refaite personnel peu aimable a la reception personnel restau tres irregulier on attend autre chose 
26558 The hotel staff was very accommodating. Went out of their way to make sure we had all we needed even though only there one night. Great location with many nearby restaurants. Loved the beds. Would stay again. 
26559 very attractive in location. it is very convinient for visiiors to travel around of new yourk 
26560 located in the central of the city. the hotlel is very flexible for checkout. i will still select this hotel in I will be New York next time. 
26561 Si no hay mejor presupuesto, en el piso 16 la hab estaba en condiciones,no funcionaban algunas cosas,que no nos eran impresindibles.El personal muy atento, seguro,excelente ubicacion.Nos guardaron equipaje antes y despues del chequeo, a 2 dolares la valija, tambien es importante eso!!! 
26562 The Regency is a lovely hotel with excellent staff. The beds are comfortable, and the bathrooms well equipped. Now that the hotel is non-smoking, there is no longer the worry of being invaded by cigar smokers. The breakfasts are the original power breakfasts, where the staff and food are memorable. 
26563 I have been staying at the secret gem for several years on business and pleasure. It is ideally located for business, pleasure, theater, shopping, sightseeing and food. Besides the great location the hotel and it's staff are wonderful. 
26564 About the 4th time I have stayed here. Busy hotel but great atmosphere. Helpful staff, very knowledgable concierge (and I've given them some tough challenges) rooms clean and well kept. Thoroughly recommend 
26565 A little hard to find at night, even with GPS, but a good stay. Evening reception lite dinner with beer and wine was great and saved over going out. Pool was closed for remodel. 
26566 Very nice rooms, not very spacious, but clean and modern design. Great bar with good music! Went there for a week-end trip with my girl friend and we had a very good time. the staff was kind and helpful. I would recommend this hotel to my friends. 
26567 Staff was nice and very accommodating. Good size room. Location was perfect The microwave was a plus. However the TV could have been bigger 
26568 Teeny tiny room, music EVERYWHERE. Apathetic staff. I wouldn't go back. There are much nicer places to stay in NY for the price. The only good thing was the VERY confortable bed. Inexistant breakfast, lousy staff. My advice would be to go somewhere else. 
26569 Thouroughly enjoyed my stay at The New Yorker Hotel. Location was spot on, couldn't have asked for better!! Would definatly stay here again. 
26570 Could not have asked for a more central location for everything. We walked everywhere. Hotel was clean basic accomodation and excellent value. Staff could have been a bit more friendly. Will return again though. 
26571 I was in Houston for a meeting and stayed at The Houston Marriott West Loop. I could not believe the level of service the staff gives! It truly made my trip easy and productive. From check in to my service at Breakfast, it was truly 5 star!! 
26572 The staff at this hotel was very friendly and helpful and the doorman went out of his way to help with the parking 
26573 About the only thing lacking was that there was no coffee maker in room. Would definitely stay here again. 
26574 Our stay was wonderful. We stayed in a beautiful corner room with the view of manhattan and the Hudson River. We loved the atmosphere. The service was great! 
26575 Staff at the front desk is sexy and sweet. Always kind and fast check-in. Should be known this is a no-frills hotel. But, unlike sofitel, the rooms are first class, and clean. 
26576 If you like small hotels on a good location at a reasonable price, this is the place to go. Good rooms with quite some space,, great diy breakfast, great location. I do miss the personal touch a bit... 
26577 Enjoyed our stay. Concierge was very helpful and gave us great recommendations. Really enjoyed our room and it had a large luxorious bathroom. Close to all amenities. 
26578 the lobby and the room was spectacular....with exceptional service from the multi lingual staff. 
26579 Double room was good size, clean and surprisingly quiet given location is buzzing. Very central location. Good value. Few frills. 
26580 Stayed there last night. Room was great. Lots of cool technology in them like a TV built into the mirror in the bathroom. Clean and cool ambiance, Staff very friendly. Lobby has a chiche look with huge fish tanks and cool lighting. I would stay there again. 
26581 I absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was phenomenal and the food was fabulous. I had a facial and the young lady was great and so gentle. The room was large and very nice. I loved everything about my stay. 
26582 Very nice hotel. The room was very clean and well appointed. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. Not too long a wait for elevators which is unusual in NYC. Good central location as we wanted to visit Central Park and Times Square. 
26583 Excellent hotel, great value for money, converted appartments so very big, small kitchnet with kettle, microwave and fridge small bathroom in need of modernisation but was good enough. 
26584 l got a good reception from everbody who worked the week l was there. Many, many thanks to ROSA at the reception who was smiling and made our stay good. Will be looking forward for our next stay in December or in near future. 
26585 I wished I had stay my first night in Chicago here, the rooms were large beds were comfortable and it was at a good location for shopping and the navy pier.. 
26586 We stayed one night at this new hotel. The rooms were nice and the shower was great. We would stay again. The only downside was there was no free wifi. 
26587 Wounderful hotel, wounderful staff from the front desk to the bar staff! 
26588 Our visit to Le Parker Meridien was again, great. The hotel and rooms are clean, quiet and comfortable. Just wish the pool wasn't an additional charge. 
26589 Very clean hotel,friendly helpful staff,really good breakfast not the same everyday.Location is excellent just down from central park.Nice area. 
26590 Friendly stuff, clean and comfortable rooms with great view. Would stay there again anytime! 
26591 The price was excellent value for money, the location can not be improved but the lobby felt like the hall of a train station, lots of going in and out. Lacks some warmth. Nevertheless to be recommended 
26592 excellent stay for long weekend, very nice hotel, excellent location, would definately stay again at this hotel 
26593 sejour 4 nuits en sept 2012 pour 3 adultes 
26594 2 grandes chambres spacieuses pouvant accueillir 5/6 adultes , kitchenette avec frigo et micro onde, literie confortable 
26595 prevoir boules quies , bruits de la rue 
26596 Mais dans l'ensemble tres positif 
26597 every thing is great , well and we really immpress, but little expensive 
26598 ideal for business trips and exclusive stay. it is a very close to chelsea , roof top bar is good.good hamburger steak. rooms was very clean and extremelly comfortable. 
26599 Trendy hotel. Great decor and bar but rooms are small and NOISY!. Bring your earplugs. 
26600 We lived in a guest room called, Fantastic Suite, really nice room which me and my wife shared with another couple we were travelling with. High standard and luxurious interior. Free wifi in lounge, extra cost to have it in the room. 
26601 Conciergeteam was extremely helpful in a big city with lots of restaurants choices 
26602 Good looking hotel, rooms are comfortable and very quiet. The staff is helpful and friendly. My only negative comment relates to the main breakfast/dining area: the place could use a lot more lights. I personally do not enjoy having breakfast in a dark room! 
26603 Rooms are in need of a face lift. room service way over priced. location is fine. you can fine a much nicer hotel at a 4star price. 
26604 Great room service, located super close to times square and the empire state building, with the subway right next to it. Super friendly and helpful staff, and they have a little shop in the hotel in case you forgot to bring your toothbrush or need some snacks 
26605 Very beautiful place, good spot in New York city, the problem you have to paid for the parking. 
26606 My wife and I met up with friends at the London for our wedding anniversary. We loved the rooms. The big showers and comfortable beds are great. Service was excellent. The bar is a nice late night hangout. We will stay at the London again. 
26607 super lage, extrem freundliches personal - tolles zimmer mit fantastischer dusche! 
26608 It is right near Grand Central in the heart of midtown. Near lots of shopping, including some in the building. The workout room is fine. There were some issues keeping the room cool. Fancy soap products. 
26609 All of the staff at this hotel were Friendly and helpful, but xiomara in the room and Mohammad at the reception stood out in particular.Room was lovely, clean and quiet. 
26610 We were first time visitors in new York and right from the booking and till we left the hotel we were very well comforted by the staff ! The hotel was very well located and was very close to all the action , would definitely go back again 
26611 Good location and nice sized room, all at a decent price. 
26612 Very clean and ncie hotel with good breakfast. The location is great for touring lower Manhattan. Close to Pier17 and close to tour bus stops.. 
26613 Always stay here on business, great location and service. Clean and quite rooms. 
26614 Excellent location, quiet comfortable rooms. Quick and easy check in and out. No complaints Other than the lack of beverage making facility in room 
26615 Lovely stay:) the location is great right near times square :) the room was clean and tidy. The only problem was the wait for the lifts in the morning but for such a big hotel it was expectable. The gym has an amazing view make sure you see it ! 
26616 Fantastic location - ideal for great neighbourhoods. Staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms small but very clean. Recommended. 
26617 I have stayed at this hotel almost weekly for the past two plus years and the outstanding staff treats me wonderfully. Front desk personel such as Nick are wonderful ! 
26618 Courtyard Downtown is very nice. Room Service was great and the food/drink was very good. I remember that Check-in for some reason took a long time, but other than that things went smoothly. I shall return on business. 
26619 We stayed here for a week, in october. The room was charming and spaceious for NY standard. Very polite starff, comfortable bed, nice bathroom with a tub (good after a looong day walking around in NY). We had everything we needed! Cleanliness was good, fresh towels every day, if needed. 
26620 We spent four night's at the Best Western president hotel in New York,very clean rooms and the employees were very friendly und polite.It was a good experience ,we will come back. 
26621 We had a great stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. It is located in a great location in mid-town, just seconds from Time Square. Nicole Cermele, the Guest Experience Manager, made our stay even better. We will certainly stay at this location again! 
26622 very nice hotel. clean, new, very, very helpful people working her. they were ready to help any way they could!!! 
26623 Great staff warm welcoming knowledge staff. Especially Raquel Ortiz! A haven for the business traveler. Good place to work, athletic facilities, fine dining in room service. High ceilings lots of light in the rooms. Terrific locale. 
26624 4 of us stayed here in May 2010. The room was clean, comfortable and roomy. The staff were helpful and friendly - especially Frank on the concierge. Great location, close to transport, 5th Ave etc. 
26625 Excellent hotel at times square.....upgraded to concierge level.....good service and food....front desk helpful...very comfortable rooms 
26626 We booked a private room with 2 full beds and bath You get: basic room with one English chanell on tv, great location in china town , free wifi and excellent rate. It is also small, dirty and a walk up. 
26627 The stay in this small Hotel was very nice. The staff is friendly and helpful. The Breakfast was ok. Only a small range of food. The dark design of this hotel was great and also the selection of furniture in the rooms! 
26628 This hotel is very conviently located, but isn't very clean and the rooms are mediocore. Valet takes 20 mins or so, and there's no wow factor for this hotel. Very average, or a bit below. The bathrooms are very small with some signs of mildew. 
26629 Location excellent Very clean rooms and bathrooms Restaurants very good Concierge staff helpful, but not especially friendly. 
26630 try the brunch there, that's so amazing! the rooms are a bit old but perfect for a romantic weekend in NYC everything is nearby staff very professional we will come back 
26631 Rooms were quite small, but very clean and modern, and a solid price for the location. 
26632 the hotel was very average,housekeeping not great and I didn't find the location all that great.$70 for 3 glasses of champagne was a bit steep. 
26633 tres proche de time square, de central park et de l'empire state building, a pied sans probleme, plein de petit resto pas cher et tres bon moins de 10$ par pers. , l'hotel est tres agreable avec un hall tres joli 
26634 Great location, right near Grand Central Station, and the subway. Very central for walking in NYC. The room was very clean, a little small but perfectly acceptable. The service is above expectations, we checked in early so were able to put our bags in the room and enjoy the city. 
26635 Internet deal of $160/night got me dirty room, dirty bathroom, poor service. Told to open window if I was too warm. Carpets worn and dirty. Was uncomfortable touching bedspread. Showering was terrible....temperature unexpectedly jumped from really hot to really cold. Other guest had shower head come off while showering. 
26636 It was a small room... but it's a great place. Great area, great atmosphere, VERY friendly staff, and quite clean as well. I'll be coming back! 
26637 Great place to stay before going on a trip with easy access to the airport. Prices on stay and park options can be very good for longer trips. Big rooms and nice hotel in the middle of the Greenspoint area. Staff does an outstanding job. 
26638 Friendly, clean and perfect position for downtown soho, Greenwich village and china town. 
26639 I stayed at the HGI for the third time. The hotel is clean and the staff at check-in, check-out, and at breakfast are outstanding. The location is close to everything and I got an excellent rate for a Sunday night stay. 
26640 Pro's: location, history, somewhat clean con's: tiny bathrooms (RV sized), shabby poorly done "renovation", poor service, noisy 
26641 A wonderful small hotel. The rooms are compact, but beautifully appointed. The staff are very helpful, the location is good. I love the small and cozy and friendly feel about the place. 
26642 Very good if yet slightly understated hotel at the foot of Manhattan. The modest location is brought to life with unbelievable views of the city from the rooftop bar. As an experience that I held very high hopes for I was definately not disappointed 
26643 Good Hotel half block from Times Square. The rooms are very small but modern and clean 
26644 Het Edison hotel is een prettig, gunstig gelegen toeristen hotel. Dicht bij de theaters, Times Square, en op loopafstand van Central Park. Lekker en niet duur ontbijten binnen het hotel. Verder goede koffer bewaar service en aardig personeel. Schone, nette kamers en een prachtige lobby. 
26645 Hotel was very nice, clean, and the staff were friendly and helpful. Just 1/2 block away from Times Square.

26647 Just stayed for 2 nights here at the Downtown location. I was happy with the Marriott as far as amenities, price, location. Did a prepay for about $215 per night. 4 of us in one room. Would stay here again. Jeff 
26648 Well kept, very clean and quiet rooms with perfect walking accessibility to best restaurants and attractions of uptown New York. Their reasonable rates and welcoming service will definitely bring us back. 
26649 Not that cheap.... parking was still $23/day with no in/out privileges, elevator smelled, paint and carpet very outdated.. musty smell.. room was spacious, but would prefer to stay in a smaller cleaner, more modern room. terrible view. staff was okay... keep shopping. 
26650 We recently visited Houston for a friend's graduation and had a very pleasant experience at this hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful, hotel room was spotless, the variety at breakfast was awesome! What more can you ask for! Great value! We will definitely be back. 
26651 I had a bunch of challenges and the staff, specifically Catherine, took care of everything! 
26652 Stayed here over New Years. Very easy walk to Times Square. We did not have to use transportation for anything except the airport Walked to Central Park, Rockefeller Center, etc. Exceptionally helpful and courteous hotel staff. Clean, comfortable room. Would highly recommend and would definitely stay again!! 
26653 This hotel is very clean and stylish, our room is very modern and spacious. The staff are all very friendly and accommodating. The location is very convenient to subways and close to some real nice restaurants. The hotel's restaurant,Plein Sud is also excellent,good food with French flair. 
26654 I really enjoyed this hotel. Loved the lobby/bar decor, found the room to be comfortable. Great location, great service. Loved such a classy pet friendly vibe. I see people complaining about room size, but that is what they should expect in NYC. 
26655 My family and I stayed here after returning from a trip to Florida, and were pleasantly surprise. The night before, we stayed in a Motel 6 that was just horrible. My wife was happy to move and was very comfortable with our stay here. Would stay again. 
26656 For the price, you would expect a 5 star hotel. The public areas fit the bill of a 5 star hotel, but the rooms and customer service are a disappointment. The location is great, right in Broadway district and close to Times Square. 
26657 I liked the atmosphere, I enjoyed the way the rooms are decorated, but I think they definitely are too small. 
26658 My wife and two teenage sons stayed for three nights. The staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. Conveniently located for Beverly Hills and Hollywood. Throughly enjoyed the Four Seasons. 
26659 Upon arrival Abraham offered free room upgrade. Every one at the reception very proffessional, helpful, friendly and welcoming. Rooms are clean, looks new and free from noise. Great loction walking distance to Times square, Central Park and many other places. Certainly recommend and will stay there again. 
26660 Service was excellent. Rooms are extremely small but very clean. Bed is confy. They let us leave the baggage before check in and after checkout at no extra charge. They have computers with internet free at the lobby. I will come back!!! 
26661 I would definitely recommend the Westin Times Square. The front desk staff is wonderful, and the hotel is a fabulous oasis of calm amid the hustle bustle of Times Square. 
26662 It was one of the lesser expensive hotels I had to choose from and I wasn't disappointed. The rooms were clean and it's in a great location. There were some good restaurants close by. Would definitely stay there again. 
26663 I stay here often for both work and pleasure and always find it a great reliable place to stay in NYC. This is always my first choice as a hotel in NYC. I refer friends, family and work associates here all the time. 
26664 great location, the lobby restuarant is superb, great view from the room, a great value for the money 
26665 My only complaint is that the ice and vending machines are on odd, high floors. Susan and Jeffery at the front desk were both very helpful and friendly. The hardwood floor rooms were immaculate, and the beds were middle-soft. 
26666 Ottimo hotel, la colazione al mattino e' presente in pochi hotel, quindi ottima, anche se la selezione dei cibi potrebbe migliorare. Unica pecca, solo un trasformatore di corrente in tutto l'hotel, quindi mai reperibile. 
26667 Very nice hotel, smallish room but very cozy and very nicely decorated. Convenient location, not right in times square but a $6.00 taxi ride will get you there. We live in NJ and wanted to stay overnight instead of drive home. Was very happy with this choice. 
26668 The location is superb, but it is now very tired and needs refurbishing. Our bath had mildew, the bed was lumpy, cleaning marginal. We've enjoyed it in the past, but it must be under new management now. 
26669 I loved my recent stay at the Hilton Garden Inn. The location and rooms were great but my biggest compliments would have to go to the staff for their friend and professional service. Andrew was suvh a pleaseure and was very helpful. Would definatley stay again! 
26670 We thought we'd have a more spacious room with two queens and a couch. Instead there was a little more than enough room to walk on both sides of a King bed. 
26671 The hotel is in a great location. The rooms are nice and clean although they could have washed the floor in the bathroom. The staff are very helpful. I would recommend this hotel to anyone and I would stay there again myself. 
26672 Would like to thank 48 and lex for a great stay. Particularly would like to thank the supervisor Jordan for great service. You made my stay in NYC exceptional! Thank you so much for the great hospitality! 
26673 I stayed here on a business trip and it was a good experience. The best thing was the location an quick access to I-10 freeway. The staff was amazing, they were very helpful and attentive and recommended good restaurants. 
26674 Old hotel done up nicely. Good size rooms, comfortable bed. Excellent breakfasts at attached restaurant. Convenient location to subway, Natural History Museum, Central Park, Filene's Basement, Zabars. 
26675 hotel idealement situe a un endroit strategique de NY, la literie est formidable aucun bruit. Rien a redire sur la proprete , seul petit bemole personne ne parle le francais !! juste ca sinon c'etait parfait 
26676 as for $85 for a dressing gown i wouldnt have taken it if it was free. no maid service in 4days. a/c broken on cold. dirty and stained upholstry and carpets. wont be rushing back! 
26677 on arrival check in quick,luggage taken to rooms, our 2 rooms were ready it was 1pm, hotel walking distance Times square,Broadway ,rooms clean quiet and large comfy bed. didnt eat in hotel went to a diner Smiths opposite for breakfast. subway nearby. lovely stay would recommend. 
26678 very clean, very nice staff, the location is very central............. would definetly stay again..................went with four other girlfriends, had a fantastic time......hotel was within walking distance to shopping and times square and many great restaurants.........allthough new york city taxi's are everywhere. 
26679 Everyone was very helpful and friendly. The room size was good for NYC and the bathroom was pretty spacious. Wine reception is a nice touch. 
26680 There for the start of a Route 66 adventure. Really comfortable room with a fast room service and delicous meal. I accept that we didn't use all the hotels facilities bur I would still recommend it. Parking is in a mult-storey attached to the hotel and is expensive. 
26681 Great location and price, room comfortable but small. Situated in China town or Tokyo town or some one of them towns so pretty safe at night. Walking distance of central park, 5th Avenue, Empire State building etc. Really enjoyed our weekend. 
26682 Super quiet even though its just a block from Times Square. And I've stayed in much smaller hotel rooms than this in NYC--for a much higher price! Only bother is that breakfast room (there is a free DIY breakfast) isn't big enough to accomodate everyone trying to dine. 
26683 I found the staff very helpful and friendly. No lift, which makes dragging a heavy suitcase up stairs hard, and stairs are quite steep. I would stay there again as it's very central. Yummy food not far away. Female - 47yrs Australia. 
26684 Everything was very well organized. The shuttle to the Medical Center was great and always on time. The staff was very friendly and always willing to help. 
26685 This was the third time that I have stayed at the Buckingham Hotel in New York. Great location ! Warm, and friendly staff. Great service and value for money. 
26686 Amazing hotel right in the middle of times square.taff where great,good food and wine and very spacious rooms 
26687 I booked this hotel and i have not got anything bad to say about the hotel or anyone concerned with the hotel. I would recommend to anyone and will 100% be back there soon. Had a GREAT stay and is a perfect location central too pretty much everthing. 
26688 This hotel is super conveniently situated if you need an overnight ahead of an early morning flight. Rates are good value when compared to a downtown stay, however, breakfast is grossly overpriced for a below average Hilton breakfast. 
26689 We were there for four days with our grandchildren and things could not have been better 
26690 We had arrival gifts for both rooms. The staff was very helpful every way. I was traveling with a walker and that situation was accomodated 
26691 Hotel great and good value 
26692 Plumbing issues but sorted efficiently 
26693 Did not have breakfast at Hotel ate at Edison Hotel just 5 mins away 
26694 Amazing corner room looked out on Times Square and Empire State Building 
26695 Thankyou Emily Rodriguez ! 
26696 hotel realmente para quem quer ficar no distrito financeiro e negocios,situado a frente do world trade center.possivel ir ao memorial com toda tranquilidade.Adorei o atendimento e disposicao dos funcionarios em prestar bons servicos,fica proximo a century 21,maravilhosa loja de departamentos,porem ir ao times square so de metro.valeu pelos bons servicos. 
26697 I've stayed in many NY hotels and this is one of the nicest. Great location, quiet (even though near Times Square, spacious rooms, very clean and the beds are extremely comfortable. All the staff is extremely professional and helpful. Highly recommend choosing this site. 
26698 Hotel room was recently renovated. Bedding was comfortable, carpets were clean, bathroom was clean. Lobby was unimpressive. 
26699 For the price, the hotel was very good. The location was great, & we were able to check in as soon as we arrived in the city. 
26700 Priceworthy, good location, decent breakfast although a bit unorganized, friendly (mostly) staf. Fairly cramped place due to the tiny ground area, but room spacey enough. Spent for night with family. A good holiday hotel. 
26701 The rooms are the tiniest I've stayed in. If you're not planning to hang out in the rooms, it works out well. The beds are comfortable and clean. The shared baths are also well appointed. A highlight for us was that bicycles were available to explore the area. 
26702 Prime location, cant get better than this! Walk to times square and shops 
26703 O Hotel eh bom, bem localizado, funcionarios muito simpaticos, mas o quarto eh muito pequeno, muito mesmo. De qualquer maneira, eh organizado e limpo. A internet funciona bem e eh gratuita. 
26704 Location is great, right in the middle of the city. Can't complain about the service. Room are clean and the staffs are efficient and friendly. They are helpful. Food are good, I especially like the roast duck. Modern style hotel, will for sure come back. 
26705 We had a fantastic stay at this luxurious and comfortable hotel. The staff were first rate and went out of their way to help us out. I can thoroughly recommend it. 
26706 Beautiful hotel. Luxurious accomodations. Attentive staff. Nice decor. Great view from my room faced river but co-worker room faced an office building. I rated four stars because I had to pay for internet service. 
26707 Great hotel, staff efficient and quick... love the bar and the rooms are huge for NYC!!! 
26708 Very well run property. The staff provides "resort" level service and exceeds expectations consistently. 
26709 I have stayed at this hotel four times now as it is in such a great location. It has been refurbished since my stays in 2004, 2005, 2007. Last stayed 2009 and I now see they have finished the refurbishment. Will definitely stay again 
26710 Ideal located, Old fashioned but clean, Ideal for travellers just wanting a clean room and bed whilst staying in the big apple. Good value for money-Plenty of cafes,eating places close by. 
26711 Just the usual sort of Holiday Inn. My room was clean and spacious. There was no info in the room about the hotel or local services. The room facing front can be a bit noisy with the traffic. 
26712 After reading numerous reviews, we booked at the Salisbury. For the price and location it was well worth it. We enjoyed going to Central Park after a long day and relaxing there. 
26713 A relaxing atmosphere and most comfortable bed in the busy bustle of the downtown city life. Wish the spa was a little bigger, but the workout facilities are great! 
26714 Door de donkere inrichting van de kamer, te weinig kunstlicht en het geringe daglicht is het altijd te donker in de kamer. Inrichting op zich is goed, schoon en ruim. De bediening is vriendelijk. Ontbijt relatief duur. Ligging van hotel is niet spectaculair. 
26715 Have stayed in this hotel for years. Always okay nothing special. Remodel on progress & rooms improved. Just logged on to wifi and astounded to learn that they charge $33 for every device you wish to connect. REDICULOUS! Highest price I have paid anywhere in the world. 
26716 Very nice hotel, spacious room. Seemed to be a convention spot - lots of conference rooms, attached to convention center. Staffed concierge room. Close to many restaurants. Only 15 minutes by car from Galleria area. Close to museums and theater district. 
26717 Loved this hotel. Great Internet Price. Hotel was way more than I expected. Manager was super nice. Great bar and pool area has a nice seating area. 
26718 Stayed at the Affinia Shelburne this past weekend. Spotless room, very friendly staff and great location. Ate at the restaurant attached to hotel for late meal, 11 pm, the food was very good. Over all, a great spot. Would definite stay there again. 
26719 A lovely hotel. Clean, quiet, comfortable and has character i.e. it;s been around a while. Staff are very friendly and helpful. Highly recommendend. 
26720 Very centrally located blocks from Times Square, Broadway and 5th Avenue shopping. Walking distance to MoMA, Carnegie Hall, Columbus Circle. Great, inexpensive deli and restaurants nearby. Especially recommend Fluffy's across the street. 
26721 Overall quality was average for a budget hotel, but the price made it a good value compared to the competition, and the hotel staff was attentive and helpful. 
26722 Very well maintained hotel, I found nothing negative to say about it at all. The room I stayed in looked like it was new and we were the first guest to use it. I will return to this Hotel again. 
26723 Customer Service Was Wonderful I Stayed for a week and had no complaints - the rooms were a little crammed I felt for the the price but they did have an in house restaraunt (kind of expensive) the location is perfect right in the heart of the city: downtown Manhattan 
26724 my husband was 40yrs in nov went for a treat ! will defo stay again hope to book gor my 40yrs birthday in oct !!!!! well done mary c. cork 
26725 The hotel was super, rooms for NY were quite a good size. Breakfats was pretty good, obviously for a tourist it's located in a great area. Not the cheapest but trying to find a reasonably priced hotel in this location in NY is practically impossibel 
26726 Excelent hotel, next door to the convention center. The rooms are great, service is very good, food (lunch, diner, and breakfast) is excellent and inexpensive, and the bar is great. The gym is very good. 
26727 Used Springhill Suites Chicago downtown/River North to block a group of rooms for a business event. Planning was a breeze, Staff were easy to work with and I've been told the hotel is great! Would highly recommend and I will definently use them again (this is our second time). 
26728 I stayed for one week while attending a business conference. Within easy walking distance to Navy Pier, Art Institute, theater district, etc. Grocery store and Starbucks both across the street. Clean, comfortable, and quiet room. Only downside...$15 for an in-room movie was steep, and a small selection of titles. 
26729 we only got to stay one night but it was great, beautiful hotel, close to everything we needed to be in houston for the next day. 
26730 we stayed at the New Yorker for a week during Westminster Dog Show and were pleaseantly surprised by the room quality. Location was fantastic, close to the subway, shopping, Broadway. 
26731 Great location, within walking distance of subway. very friendly and helpfull staff. could check my email in the business center, while having starbucks coffee proviede by the hotel. will book next vacation in the summer again at the hotel. 
26732 Had a 4 night stay here and is in heart of Times Square and is great base to see all this wonderful citys sites. Very clean. We where on a hih floor and you get a good view of the local area. Would stay again 
26733 We stayed here for one night and was very impressed by the staff and facilities. Everything in NYC is close to hand and we hope to return some day. Thank you x 
26734 Very good hotel with a good location & staff. Very clean close too times Square. Rooms were really noce & very comfortable. Very nice breakfast and relaxing area in lounge. Nice, modern bathrooms. nothing else expected from affordable place like this. 
26735 Hotel's stuff doesn't really take care of the rooms when it comes to maintaining it properly. They're not very clean either. However, most of reception staff are very helpful and friendly, Especially Seljuk. 
26736 After searching for a while I found this place through Hotwire and I was not disappointed. Very good hotel for this price. Liked: friendly staff, several computers with free internet access and printers, cold water dispenser in the hallway, close to the subway, decent size room for NYC. 
26737 My wife & I stayed 4 nights in total comfort. Rooftop deck (22 stories up) is amazing with views from East River to the Manhattan skyline. Large one bedroom suites (or 2 bedroom also) with 2 TV's & all the comforts of home. We will surely become regular visitors. 
26738 Camere molto rumorose e se volete accendere l'aria condizionata, munitevi di tappi per le orecchie o sonniferi altrimenti scordatevi di dormire. L'hotel viene sicuramente premiato per la fantastica posizione. 
26739 Great location, close to Penn Station, Macy's and Port Authority Bus Terminal. Rooms were small and in need of updating. Super lobby and Tick Tock diner had fab breakfasts in great style. Get to breakfast pre 8.30am or there are queues! 
26740 Wonderful hotel. The owner/ manager was excellent. Very clean, good hot breakfast, nice staff and very quite at night. They made a very rainy 3 days enjoyable. Their handicaped rooms were very spacey and were designed perfectly for a wheelchair. 
26741 Stayed here for 4 nights. Very clean hotel, extremely courteous staff, very friendly and they provide useful inputs when asked for help. The lobby, rooms, carpet, bathrooms are very clean. It is conveniently located in midtown and very close to very good eating places. I would definitely recommend this hotel. 
26742 Ottimo hotel. Comodissima posizione (a 2/3 minuti a piedi da times square, e altrettanti per le varie stazioni della metropolitana) collegato benissimo con l'aeroporto JFK, si arriva comodamente con 30 min di linea blu, senza mai dover cambiare!!). consigliatissimo! 
26743 Just awfull No atmosphere unless you count bus terminals Terrible service super slow check in Super slow check out! No mini bar in room and overpriced room service Bizarre elevators Oh good location 
26744 A good location. Average rooms but very nice and friendly staff. We got our room for a great price which made the stay well worth it. It was so easy to use the buses and subways from this location. UN and water tax very close. 
26745 Stayed here 4 nights in a good size and modern room with views on Times Square and Hudson River. Staff is very friendly. Bar gives fantastic view on Times Square. Would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again. 
26746 Fabulous location. Great rooms and bed was fantastic. Even comfortable conditions to work in. Restaurant is delicious. very friendly and helpful staff. Lots of great restaurants nearby 
26747 Its like home, the people that work her are great, I stay 2 weeks and Joyce do my room, every day check, how i was. Great place... 
26748 A good location but tired, dirty and shabby. The bed was nice to sleep on though and the view was not too bad. 
26749 Plus: - Micro-Fridge - Clean rooms - Close to highway - Good price (around $50) - Quiet Minus: - Staff descent, but not outgoing 
26750 idealement place.mais petits dejeuners trop chers et trop d attente avant de pouvoir dejeuner. je recommande cet hotel pour un sejour a new york avec des enfants. le personnel est competent mais parfois un peu rapide dans les explications ; 
26751 The W is great, the rooms are Wonderful but the customer service is second to none. I highly recommend. The restaurant is fabulous and if you are lucky enough to have Greg as your server, that is a bonus. 
26752 Nice new hotel with a decent cafe and close to great shopping and restaurants. the only bad thing I could find is not enough sugar and cream with coffee. Really good price for what you get. 
26753 Stayed here for the weekend. Great location for visiting all of manhattan. We were able to walk everywhere but a cab would be helpful for some of the more distant corners. Adequate breakfast and hey it's FREE. King size bed was great. Will stay here again. 
26754 Shuttle service is very slow. Staff not overly friendly. Will not stay here again. Bathroom toilets are very loud. Any one around you flushes it will wake you up. No privacy as rooms are very noisy. Breakfast was ok but very crowded. 
26755 We have officially fallen in love with NYC. The Waldorf=Astoria was awesome. 
26756 Hotel was excellent. Staff very friendly and helpful. Nothing too much trouble. Room very clean, bed extremely comfortable. High quality linen. Peaceful and quiet. Room very small but ok. Able to walk to attractions, e.g. Empire State Building, Maceys etc. A/C was a bit noisey. 
26757 Service = Great Location = Great Room Size = On the small side On-site Food/Bar = Great Decor = Very Modern - Great 
26758 fantastic location, awesome lobby and rooms. Perfect if you want to have a walk on Brodway or visit Central Park. underground station very close to the hotel. Excellent bar and restaurant. 
26759 Huge bed, tidy room. Free wifi No room service, no video on demand, slightly tired hotel, small rooms. Minute gym There are much better hotels in NY 
26760 The hotel is conveniently located in the center. The rooms are big emogh and conveninetly equipped. I stayed in a high floor rrom. Breakfast is a bit expensive but rich. The spa is well equiped and clean. Oveall it is a very good choice for business and pleasure 
26761 Buen hotel, habitaciones comodas y espaciosas y personal muy atento. Sin duda un opcion perfecta para tu visita a NYC. Sin pagar una millonada tienes un hotel nuevo y agradable. Cerca de todos los sitios y bien comunicado!!!! 
26762 This has to be one of the best locations in the city. Subway entrance nearby, Broadway, Times Square, Rockefeller Center. Magnolia Bakery FAMOUS for cupcakes (muffins, etc.) just a couple of blocks over. Across the street from St. Michaels Cathedral. Staff extremely helpful...can't get any better in New York City!!! 
26763 Nothing but problems starting with reservations and ending with front desk. Extremely unhelpful and uncaring. There are so many great hotels in NYC, so you should have no problems skipping this one. 
26764 From the 1st call to check out, the hotel staff was very professional and courteous. I was stranded at the IAH airport and the staff at Baymont took great care of me. I would recommend this hotel and will definitely stay there again when I have the chance. 
26765 I have staed in many Homewoods over the past few years and this is one of the best. Professional management, a great location, friendly and responsive staff in addition to an almost brand new hotel means that I will come back here every time. Their food was good as well. 
26766 A very large suite - large living room/dining room, full kitchen, big bedroom, 2 bathrooms - all in a wonderful location. I booked 2 months in advance and for just over $300 a night, we were very satisfied with our accommodations. 
26767 Very clean room. Very comfortable bed. NYC-sized room (about 4' space around a king bed) I'd stay again. 
26768 Although the Mandarin Oriental in New York City commands a hefty price, it is SO worth it. Every aspect of the hotel is wonderful - the view, the simplicity of the rooms, the food and the staff - all of them - fabulous. Can't wait to return! 
26769 Terrible!!! I will never return there. I have never stayed anywhere where the house keeping went into the drawers and medications. And the fact the management did nothing to make it right. Terrible service! I've never experienced this before and I do not recommend anyone to go there. 
26770 The Park Central Hotel is in the best location of NYC and the manager Elisabeth gave us a very good reception. The room was very comfortable and the furniture brand-new. The bathroom was very clean. When I comeback to NYC I will surely stay in Park Central Hotel. 
26771 Si trova in una zona residenziale molto tranquilla nei pressi di Central Park, servito benissimo, metro vicino. La nostra camera era molto piccola ma aveva la vista su broadway. Lo consiglio, nel complesso mi sono trovata davvero bene! 
26772 Friendly staff, great location, close to everything and easy access to the entire island. The studio was perfect and the price is so just! I loved it and will be back, for sure. 
26773 Escape from the bedlam of Times Square to a building drenched in literary history.. Beautiful room, wonderful, helpful staff and a lobby that sinks you back in time. We've been for many theater getaways to NYC and this newly reburnished gem gets our recommendation. 
26774 This hotel was amazing. The staff provides excellent service, the rooms are modern, clean and well kept. Housekeeping responds quickly to any and all requests. I would gladly stay here anytime I return to the Big Apple. 
26775 The staff is incredibly nice, the hotel is one of the most beautiful, artsy hotels in NYC, and the Rose Bar is a great place to begin or end your night in NYC. 
26776 Won't be back, manager refused to see me, and told the desk staff that I should write him an email addressing my concerns... whatever. 
26777 This Marriott is perfectly located on the Magnificent Mile with everything within walking distance. Rooms were clean, standard size for a big city with nice view. Front staff was pleasant and helpful. It is quite busy but it is a large hotel. Overall, perfect experience. 
26778 This is an excellent location, far enough from the crazy Times Square center , but very central to everything else. The rooms are very spacious. The staff very attentive. I would not hesitate to stay here again. 
26779 Nice up to date room. High quality linen. Quite big room for NY. Very clean. Effective air-condition. Good location. Paid 199 USD for a twin executive room-good price for being NY. 
26780 Gorgeous mid-town accomodations. Very quiet...no cabs honking...no subway noise during our stay. Room has beautiful decorative accessories. Very clean, fresh and new feeling despite antique building. Would definitely visit again! 
26781 We stayed here for 8 nights in July 05 - it was brilliant! The location, helpful staff, and extra space in the room was wonderful. For the money in New York we were very, very pleased. Highly recommend it! 
26782 Our stay at the Wheeler Mansion met our expectations. We were treated with hospitality and the staff went out of their way to make us comfortable. The building is beautifully restored and in a great location. 
26783 Basic accommodation however as a sight seeing holiday we were barely in the hotel therefore perfect for us and great location. Staff very friendly, nothing was too much trouble and our room was large and clean. 
26784 Absolute horrific customer service on arrival. Had to carry my own bags to my room. Rooms look slightly dated. No toiletries as they had run out. Incredible told to go buy some at CVS. The only plus is great concierge. Front desk and manager don't care less when you complain. 
26785 non e' il plaza,ma e abbastanza pulito, in una posizione ottima,vicino alla metropolitane e a decine di locali e ristoranto,per chi vuole risparmiare e' l'ideale, non c'e molto di meglio a new york 
26786 one of the best nights away from home...staff was very knowledgeable about the area and surrounding attractions..my only complaint was the bathroom in our room was very small and need to be updated. the room itself was very large and bed was extremely comfortable. 
26787 goede service en prijs kwaliteit verhoudign, schone kamers (niet super groot),een goed bed, heerlijke stortdouche, goede ligging, lekker ontbijt. Kortom een prima hotel waar we een volgende keer zeer zeker zullen verblijven. 
26788 Good location just south of the Chicago in Hyde Park. The lakefront access is just 2 blocks away. Rooms are a bit outdated--no microwave or refrig. Parking is free--staff efficient, helpful. Good wi-fi. 
26789 Everything you need: comfort, clean, high tech and good location 
26790 Really enjoyed my stay here, the rooms are very spacious with everything you expect from a 5 star. Brilliant service and in walking distance of everywhere we wanted to go. Our view wasn't great, but our friends staying on a higher floor had an amazing view. 
26791 Great hotel, Super customer service and the perfect location. Highly recommended! 
26792 This hotel continues to be one of our very favorites! Rooms are ultra clean, the service is very very good & personable and the food & drink are excellent. The workout facility is very nice & open 24/7 and the employees treat you like valued guests. The Best!!! 
26793 Stayed here just after Xmas 2006. Lovely room, good location. very good value for room, obviously as it sadvertised as a 5 star the restaurant, bar and room service are expensive but who wants to stay in the hotel when ur in new york?! 
26794 For the price the best kept secret in New York. You get location location location. The hotel is older but charming and undergoing changes. Located between Eight and Seventh At Times Square you are in the heart of the city, near food, bars, retail and fully walkable. 
26795 Great service, wonderful rooms (you should ask for park view it's very nice). Everything in place, on time. Wide range of felicities (restaurant, spa, fitness etc.). Great location very close to Central Park. I can recommend this hotel to anyone exception hight quality service, although it is expensive. 
26796 I was very pleased with my stay at the New York Palace. We were even upgraded to a much better room/suite in the Towers. The location of the hotel is perfect and the service is also good. Generally the hotel is in very nice condition. Would gladly go there again! 
26797 Old World feel, staff was excellent, room comfy, close to Central Park, a great Starbucks right around the corner. 
26798 i loved the way the rooms were decorated... very stylish. everything was very clean and comfortable. our room faced Broadway and was surprisingly quiet. 
26799 The rooms are quite small here, but expected for NYC. One time I had a bigger suite. The views are great and the bar on the 2nd floor is a great hangout area. If you want to be in the middle of times square, this is a great option. 
26800 This is a great hotel, and Sam in the fitness area was amazing. First Class service. 5 stars! 
26801 Top quality hotel, staff were professional, friendly and efficient. A little expensive but we'll come again! 
26802 From the moment our bags were picked up by bell caps, the service was first rate. Francesco and Annmarie at the front desk were especially helpful and courteous. 
26803 The pictures on the internet don't represent the shabby, dirty, no-elevator, condition of this hotel for $159 per night. Are you kidding me? Unless you just got out of prison or are hosting a bachelor party for teenagers I would skip this place, for sure. Skid row type of property. 
26804 If you want to enjoy the time square view, courteous front desk employee, and reasonable price take this hotel. you can't find better. When you get there ask for "Nebila" the front desk employee. She is the most cheerful and helpful employee you can find. 
26805 We stayed here for the first time and were not dissapointed. This is a fantastic hotel that has class all over. The entrance is superb,the food and the rooms. A must hotel to stay at you will not be dissapointed. 
26806 Buen hotel, bien situado, al lado de la catedral de San Patric 
26807 Great location, although our room was quite shabby. But at that price we didn't even expect more, so overall we were satisfied with our stay. 
26808 Just back from our stay in the Bedford NY,had a Tower suite which was clean, spacious & well laid out. Staff are pleasant but not overly friendly.Both TVs were broken in our room,thanked for telling them but no apology given. Quiet rooms,would stay again without hesitation. 
26809 Location, price, staff and cleanness of room was just all excellent. 
26810 idem 
26811 Just a short stay but memorable for the spacious, comfortable rooms, handy town car within a three mile radius and helpful staff. Lovely. 
26812 the hotel actually located in a strategic area, but the services that they gave to us very poor, especially when we have issue with the mold inside the mini bar. it was nasty and groose, the duty manager didnt make a good approach to solved our problem. 
26813 LA UBICACION ES MUY BUENA, LASTIMA DE LAS MALAS CONDICIONES EN GENERAL DE TODO EL HOTEL, PUEDEN HACER MAS POR MANTENERLO EN MEJORES CONDICIONES,..A MI ESPOSA Y A MI NO NOS GUSTO...NO LO RECOMENDARIA... LASTIMA, ESTA MUY BIEN UBICADO. 
26814 I stayed in a room for one night with no bathroom. The room was clean. The hall bathrooms were clean. The elevator was too small. It was worth the $80 I paid for it. Good location. 
26815 wonderful friendly helpful employees. rooms were clean decorated lovely and atmosphere was beyond my expectaions. 
26816 My 16 year old son and I stayed at the Hotel for 7 nights and found it an excellent and enjoyable stay. 
26817 I stay in NY quite a bit. Will only stay at Hotel Mela. There is nothing to complain about... fabulous staff, room, comfortable bed. Can't say enough good about my whole experience! 
26818 A very good location-- within blocks of several subway lines, a short walk to Brooklyn Bridge and Ground Zero. Good price, clean rooms, no problems with the staff. Just one fault: the traffic noise during the night. 
26819 The New York Palace is the perfect New York City hotel. The location is superb, the staff is excellent, and the rooms and public areas of the hotel are lovely. 
26820 my husband and i celebrated his bday here last year and had a wonderful time. they surprised us with a delicious cake and champagne. the room was huge and very comfortable. the staff was great as well! 
26821 Average at best. Restaurants and bar were well below par. Bar caters to wine drinkers only. All three times I left the hotel I grabbed my own cab with no bell service in sight. Choose other hotel for the money. 
26822 The only downside is that it is impossible, and I say impossible, to get a taxi from there to anywhere. 
26823 Not perhaps the best-known hotel in NY (my cabdriver hadn't heard of it) but a very comfortable mid-town boutique. Very helpful staff. The shower is fantastic - a great boon for those just off a transatlantic flight - as is the Starbucks round the corner. 
26824 We spent two days and one night at the Plaza and every moment was perfect. What a lovely place and location. All the staff were friendly and helpful, obviously well trained in hospitality. Hopefully I will return someday soon. 
26825 This is a nice clean place that is tastefull decorated. The location is quite central located in Times Square. 
26826 Nice enough hotel for airport convenience but current construction and the hotel banquet staff using elevator make the noise impossible for sleep past 7 am. Do not accept a room in tbe south tower below level 3. 
26827 End to end great experience. Best hotel stay ever. 
26828 We stayed here based on reviews in TripAdvisor. Room was as advertiesed. The only drawback was there is a fire station a block away, but it didn't bother us one bit. Overall great value on a reasonably large room for NYC. 
26829 probably one of the best hotels Ive stayed in! Staff was very friendly and professional! Rooms where clean and spacious! Bed was extremely comfy, i slept better than usual! Next time we travel, will make it a point to look for a Crowne Plaza! 
26830 The Houstonian is a nice place with great food, drinks, and coziness.The matresses feel amazing for any back. I wouldn't say it's a kid place but great for adults. I would definitely recommend this place to any family! 
26831 Great hotel! Exellent service! The rooms are marvellous, and the internet worked fine all the time. I also recommend the coffee in the rooms (a small coffemaker and coffeepods, also free.)No complaints at all. Will come back again for sure. 
26832 Very good place, the room are very confortable, noise free, with frigo and tv. Very good also the bathroom. The bed is fantastic.Breakfast is not inclued and the wifi is avaible only in the lounge room. 
26833 If you like classic furnishings, great service, and a little tiny step back in time, my two favorite places in NY are the Michelangelo and the Intercontinental Barclay. Note that the Times Square Intercontinental is very different - more like a modern "W" in decor and service. 
26834 The Marriott does such a nice job. Their staff is well trained and courteous. This hotel is right in the heart of everything. I wish I would have had more time to explore Hell's Kitchen...so many wonderful funky restaurants. The beds are very comfortable. The breakfast is nice...good selection. 
26835 Ideaal gelegen, zeer centraal. Goede prijs-kwaliteitverhouding, vriendelijk personeel en ruime, comfortabele kamer. In de buurt tal van ontbijtmogelijkheden. Mochten we nog een keer naar New York gaan, dan zouden we hier best weer willen verblijven. 
26836 Perfect location for all the major attractions of New York. We could see Macys and the Empire State Building from our bedroom window. 
26837 Except for the convenient location this place had nothing going for it - peeling paint, lights that didn't work, no Wifi unless you sat on the stairs in the hallway, TV in BR didn't work, dishwasher didn't work and mirrors everywhere (even on the ceiling) 
26838 I stayed there in december ,the room was fine and the location was spot on right next to time square .Would recommend and stay there again myself 
26839 very nice stay clean friendly. location, location, location. 
26840 The hotel room was clean, spacious and comfortable. You are not allowed to eat in the lobby which includes snacks or drinks!!! 
26841 We have stayed at several different hotels in Manhatten and keep coming back here. Great Location to the Theaters and subway. Friendly and helpful staff, good value. Rooms are clean and quiet. No complaints. 
26842 I reserved a room there 2 months in advance, and prepaid. Received a confirmation, and when I got there they didn't have a room for me and offered NO alternate accommodation. I was told that this is a standard practice there. I was left high and dry by them. 
26843 Nice, clean Hotel in a good location. Friendly staff. I recommend you request a high floor facing the courtyard as the street side canbe noisey especially on a lower floor. Internet is slow. Breakfast food is poorly prepared. 
26844 This hotel is a great old-style townhouse right in the middle of the city. Very clean with excellent rooms. I would also recommend the Granville Restaurant which is nearby. 
26845 Awesome hotel. Close to transport. Great dining optioms on site. Comfortable bed, attentive staff. Cant complain at all! Would pay a lot more to stay here again! Got room throgh priceline. it was a steal. 
26846 This is our 2nd time staying at this hotel. The staff is wonderful including Eden which checked us in. We were able to check in early, rooms are clean, staff is friendly, and the Acura services is awesome. 
26847 Stayed in Sofitel in a twin-bedded room for 3 nights. Location is good, but beds way too soft, with no back/lumbar support. Helpful staff are what you would expect in a hotel of this class. Overpriced and resting on its laurels. 
26848 Abbiamo alloggiato in questo hotel per una settimana 
26849 A due passi da Times Square, e' un bel hotel anche se il bagno e' davvero troppo piccolo e andrebbe rimodernato. Pulizia ottima.. Nel complesso, lo consiglio ! 
26850 Crowne Plaza Times square is a newly renovated, perfect loction and lovely city hotel...highly recommended. My tip is to request a room over looking Broadway/Times square...a corner room. We stayed in room 2511 and the views were awesome. enjoy 
26851 The staff is great, really nice! The rooms are really cozy, and the price was just unbelievable low at our stay. And the location couldn't be better. I hope to stay there again in the next time in NY. 
26852 Enjoyed my stay. Updated modern rooms. Great Location. 
26853 The Morgans is the perfect place to stay on the city. It's quiet, clean, and very comfortable. No noisy lobby, no gift shop, no nonsense. The staff is great. I never stay anywhere else. 
26854 Booked this room through JetLuxuryResorts.Had a great room at a great price.The staff was very attentive ,,the room was spacious and had everything you could possibly Would definitely book another trip using JetLuxuryResorts. 
26855 Friendly staff....soooooooooo quiet and peaceful. They provided complimentary breakfast in the morning...Customer Servic is great. 
26856 This hotel has very large rooms by NYC standards. Very clean. Only downside was it is a little far from most of the tourist attractons. 
26857 We have stayed at this hotel multiple times, the rooms are great and location is stellar. I will be back again next year and look forward to my stay at this hotel again next year (or sooner). 
26858 Plumbing noise. Dirty carpet. Items of personal clothing under bed. Beware. 
26859 ja estive hospedado por duas vezes, e levando-se em conta que esta em NY, os precos sao bons, limpo, cafe da manha incluso, facil acesso, equipe muito atenciosa. minha primeira opcao quando penso em retornar a NY, desde que eu esteja pagando a conta. 
26860 this hotel was great, evrything was shiny clean, the room was great, the morning staff was awseome, and the location was perfect. the beds were amazing and the room service was on point with everything. i would stay here again if i had too! 
26861 INK48 staff provided friendly service and went above and beyond for my family on our second visit to this hotel in the last 4 months! We will use this hotel again and again, for sure! 
26862 Close to hospitals in the area ( we were visiting family at Sloan Kettering), the Bentley provided a clean and comfortable place to sleep. Hotel is a bit worn and dated, but offered what we needed at a modest cost. 
26863 Een goed en zakelijk hotel in het hart van Manhattan. Zeer vriendelijke personeel. Een spec balie voor vragen en informatie voor toeristische trips. Nadeel is de opslag ($) van de koffers wanneer je s'avonds vertrekt. 
26864 Posizione semplicemente perfetta...visitare New York stando in questo hotel e' semplicissimo!camere buone per che non e' alla ricerca di un lusso "da ricchi".hotel semplice perfetta per famiglie...unico difetto bagni piccolini!!!! 
26865 This is a dinosaur and nees to be town down and rebuilt, but why?? The owner can gouge stranded travelers!!! the food was poor at best and of course its loud its at an airport. I should have saved the $169 and slept in the airport and ate at Subway. 
26866 once you get past the very narrow lobby, the hotel is good for the price. clean and comfortable. the the breakfast is not great - just coffee and bagels, etc. and in a very small room. ask for a room on a higher floor, the street is very noisy 
26867 It's a great hotel...but pricey and then, yes, they charge you for internet! The Bar was excellent as was breakfast. Very professional all the way around. The rooms and bath met my expectations 
26868 Beautiful corner bedroom awesome view over the Hudson River 14th floor , peaceful a calm after the storm of the hustle& bustle of NYC... Gorgeous comfy bed! Lovely hotel worth the price!16-21Aug 2012 we will be back room 1402 
26869 I've been staying at this La Quinta location for several years now and they are always consistant at maintaining high standards for the quality and cleanliness of their rooms. The staff is fantastic under the leadership of Mike. If you are in the area - STAY HERE!! 
26870 ThIs cute little property is in an ideal part of Midtown Manhattan, it has clean decent sized rooms that are more than acceptable. The Breakfast is a great way to start the day. Free WIFI and internet are all small things that make this property a winner. 
26871 Shared a room with my neice, tiny even by NYC standards but clean and had evrything you would need and a very reasonable price. An excellent location for theater, shopping. Free wifi! I'll be back. 
26872 I work for a Hilton Hotel and have had so much great customer service from this hotel! I stay there every time I go. The customer service, food and amentities were all worth it! A great place to stay for business or pleasure! 
26873 Room was clean enough (trash in can), but was clearly an old building. No issues or problems, evening reception was great, the guy pouring drinks was excellent. Food was good. Sorry we missed breakfast due to early flight, wish they had bags like Hampton. 
26874 great service,but the room could have been a wee bit bigger.The hotel is right in the centre of all the big sights. 
26875 Our family had a fabulous stay here. All staff were wonderful, place is gorgeous, walk to everything we wanted to see. 
26876 The title about sums it up. This place is definitely catering to a specific clientele. That being said, this place is cool. Great atmosphere. Great location. Everything you want from a hip hotel in NYC. I do recommend staying here at least once. It's an experience for sure. 
26877 I booked this hotel two months in advance via a Groupon offer. At present, two weeks after my stay, I am still trying to sort out how I got double billed. By Groupon and By the Yotel 
26878 hotel in una buonissima posizione ma non all'altezza del prestigio di cui si vanta per noi che viaggiavamo in quattro le camere erano dei veri buchi per non parlare del bagno personale molto sulle sue e scostante colazione carissima e mance per tutto 
26879 Great hotel, fantastic location about 100 yards from Penn Station 
26880 This hotel has an excellent service, clean and spacious rooms. Great location. We knew Jenny from our latest stay a year ago. She is very friendly and helpful! We will definitely choose this hotel next time, again! 
26881 Zentral gelegen, 10th ave ecke 51 strasse, nur 2 blocks bis zum broadway.. 
26882 Everyone has been so pleasant and polite. The hotel has exceeded our expectations! We have thoroughly enjoyed our stay here! When we first arrived we were greeted by a very kind and friendly gentleman. And the rooms are gorgeous with phenomenal views of St. Patrick's Cathedral. Just amazing! 
26883 stayed here several times now, as an alternative to the willowbrook location. Slighter better both good, bit only 1 restaurant with walking difference whereas willowbrook has many. drive 500 yards though and there are lots. 
26884 The Cooper square hotel is awesome. Loved the champagne greeting and couch inside the elevator. The staff is super nice. Location is great. Walking distance to Union Square. Would def stay again. 
26885 The hotel is really nice, the room service is great, The restraunt service is so good, that when we wanted some ranch for the salad the server went to the local market and got some. 
26886 This is my second stay at this hotel. First, was wedding night, then anniversary weekend. I have experienced superb service both times. Great views of Statue of Liberty, knowledgeable concierge, excellent wait staff, chilled champagne waiting in room. Hoping to spend future anniversaries here. 
26887 The staff went put of their way to make my stay excellent. The rooms were updated and very clean. The shittle service was good and the drivers excellent. 
26888 The Algonquin is a classic. Rooms are not large, but it reflects the time it was built. Very clean, in excellent condition. Everything works. Close to Times Square. Guests include folks from many nationalities, age groups. Quite comfortable ambience. 
26889 ideal emplacement and optimal confort for this hotel ! thanks for the breakfast included ! good value really! no hesitations! 
26890 Just 1/2 block from Times Square, good restaurants within walking distance, subways are just 3 blocks away and theatres are 2-3 blocks away. Rooms are okay, nothing fancy, and the rates are okay for NYC. A reasonably priced restaurant is adjacent to the lobby. Staff is friendly. 
26891 This hotel is convenient to work which is why I chose it, but I keep coming back because of the friendly staff who always go above and beyond. Raquel at the front desk greets me by name each week with a warm friendly smile. 
26892 Very good place, the room are very confortable, noise free, with frigo and tv. Very good also the bathroom. The bed is fantastic.Breakfast is not inclued and the wifi is avaible only in the lounge room. 
26893 We stayed for 4 nights and made very welcome with a free bottle of champers as we were celebrating 25th wedding anniversary. The beds are the most comfortably we have ever slept in. Stayed on the 44th floor fab views and quiet. Can't wait to go back.DJ York England. 
26894 What a great deal we had at this hotel. It is centrally located, very clean and more room than some. The neighborhood was very eclectic and welcoming. We had a great time. Definitely recommending this one. 
26895 Amazing hotel with impeccable service. It's like everyone knows your name. Their personal assistants are remarkable and the service overall is incredible. I would rate this one of the finest hotels I have ever stayed at in the world 
26896 Location excelent, if your main purpose is to go to Broadway Shows. Rooms are OK. Bathroom's door doesn't close completely, which is always anoying. Ddin't eat there (lots of alternatives nearby), so I could not say anything about their food. 
26897 The suite was beautiful and spacious, the restaurant quiet and intimate, the bar just enough life on a weeknight to enjoy a few drinks and conversation. 
26898 Chic well located hotel with some gorgeous views of the Lake. Thoughtful amenities including water and video system. Internet and exercise room are good but not great. Comfortable beds - good value. Parking is outrageous as it is everyone in the area. 
26899 Esperienza molto positiva in questo Boutique Hotel. Personale molto cortese e discreto, arredamenti stile pop art, camere piccole (ho scelto una superior) ma iper organizzate, ottima posizione vicino a metro e a Central Park. 
26900 we had a deluxe room on the 11th floor...the room was lovely, clean, very cozy...no outside noise, well stocked bar...the fatty crab restaurant on site was absolutely fantastic the front desk staff was very accomodating and warm 
26901 hotel is perfect gelegen, metro om de hoek, ontbijtbuffet zeer goed, kamers echt groot genoeg, gerenoveerd, koffiezetter, airco, geluidsarm( straatruis) verduisteringsgordijnen. Times square 10 min lopen, esb 5 min lopen zeer goed allemaal!!!! 
26902 Brilliant location, brilliant view, brilliant staff, brilliant hotel! 
26903 small but cute room only amenity not provided was hand lotion (little odd). Excellent desk and restaurant staff. Location is terrific -near the pony bar and 5 napkin burger - as well as times square. Will stay again. 
26904 Very nice hotel. Clean, medium size room with two windows looking out to city. Incredible location in Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown area. Great walking area in Soho, Village, etc. Bathroom clean, nice. I have stayed here twice and will stay again. 
26905 Great location for seeing around, close to macys, times square and central for tours. staff very nice and helpful, room was small but beds were comfortable, bathroom small but kept very clean, slight draught from window but was my only real issue... would stay here again 
26906 A very well run moderately priced hotel. The room was very well serviced with confortable beds. The food was tasty and freshly cooked. The staff did everything they could to make our stay in the hotel and our siteseeing enjoyable. 
26907 Tried it and kept it for subsequent travel. I usually try to have a room on 1st floor, not ground floor (to reduce the noise of A/C if you are unlucky). Besides: breakfast, pool, free snack in the early evening, .. all great! 
26908 Great location, The staff were friendly and helpful. 24 hour service which was good. Our room was small but clean. The showers a very small. The hotel is just behind the empire state building, and very close to macys and some major shops. I would recommend anyone to stay there. 
26909 Great overall experience. Terrific location. Great staff. 
26910 Very nice hotel. Clean rooms and helpfull staff. They privide shuttel to airport and extended parking while you gone. The return shuttel was there to pick us up in a very short time. 
26911 Rooms were clean, employees were courteous, but the best part was the location. Great for a long or short stay. My only complaint is that the wifi is extremely slow so don't even bother paying for it if you really don't need it and I wish they had a pool. 
26912 Recently stayed at Ink48 - What a place! Very clean, polite staff, and awesome views.... We'll be back for sure. It's also an easy in and out of NYC. 
26913 This hotel was for business trip. I spent two weeks there and was a very fair hotel. Good price. Good instalation and nice rooms. 
26914 Very happy with location. A short walk to Times Square, across the road from Macy's, close to the subway and around the corner from the Empire State Building. Continental breakfast and rooftop terrace with view of Empire State Building added to the appeal. Rooms were adequate size, quiet and comfortable. 
26915 Hotel was super nice, BUT SOOOOOOOO BUSY! Hotel is right in times square, perfect for tourist and those who want to sight see!!!! Rooms were small, but very nice, neat, clean and organized. Rooms gave amazing views of time square!! 
26916 Had some doubts about this place when we obviously walked into Prom. However, the room was great, servie even better. Asked for 2 towels, recieved 3 and great service. Recommended 
26917 My family and I, after much research, decided to stay at the Sherry Netherland Hotel. It was a fantastic experience. The rooms were fabuluous, the staff friendly and well trained and the location can not be beat. Do yourself a favor and stay at the Sherry!! 
26918 This hotel was very nice. It's in a great location, not very hard to get to, and is gorgeous! My only complaint is that parking is very pricey ($45 per night for self parking) although I suppose that is to be expected in a large city 
26919 Reasonably priced New York hotel, especially considering its location. Standard rooms not very large, but quiet. Friendly staff, very clean, expensive breakfast (30 $). Recommended. 
26920 stayed a few nights here staff are real good, very helpful and they work hard to get everything right for you the room i had had a noisy air-conditioner. which made sleeping a problem poll is real nice and outdoor chillout area is real nice 
26921 Not bad, but they didn't have free biscuits or hot chocolate in the rooms. They also only provided a basic breakfast for 'second-class' guests, and the rooms were tiny. Quite frankly, the Hyatt in Birmingham (a small town in the midlands of England) was better than this 'grand' hotel. 
26922 The rooms are very clean, staff is friendly and the free fruit is a nice touch. Conveniently located next to Willowbrook Mall and within walking distance of good restaurants. A great value! 
26923 Very comfortable, luxurious rooms. Not fancy, but extremely well appointed a comfortable. Prices a bit silly, especially for food and beverage, but this is the top of the heap in New York. 
26924 Did not want to fight traffic going across Houston to take son and daughter-in-law to catch morning flight out of IAH. Transpo to airport from hotel was especially helpful since did not have to drive my car inside airport and could still see family off. 
26925 Hotel completamente ristrutturarto ma con camere un po' piccolo. Posizione pero' ideale proprio di fronte a Penn Statio ed al Madison Square Garden. 5 minuti a piedi da Time Square. Personale disponibilissimo e gentilissimo. Quartiere tranquillo anche di notte. Consigliato.ci tornerei tranquillamente. 
26926 This was our third stay at this hotel and we will return. The rooms are large for New York size and always clean and tidy. The location is great and we walked to shows, museums, Central Park and Lincoln Center. Staff is always attentive and helpful. 
26927 Cool room, great view, close to park and museums, average service. 
26928 Located very conveniently next to downtown and broadway. Beds are comfortable. Staff was friendly and helpful. No elevator. No fridge or microwave. No closet. No guest laundry. VERY small rooms. No roaches though :) Crazy NY prices. Normally worth 50 bucks. 
26929 We hadden 4 nachten geboekt in dit hostel, maar wanneer we na een lange reis aankwamen bleek het hostel niet meer te bestaan!!! De buren wisten ons te vertellen dat de uitbaters plots vertrokken waren. NIET BOEKEN DUS, hopelijk is dit ook niet meer mogelijk... 
26930 En todo el midtown de Manhattan. A escasos metros de Park Ave y cerca de todas las atracciones prinicipales 
26931 The pod hotel was just right for our budget, location on west 52nd and 2nd avenue only 10 minute walk from all New Yorks attractions. Plenty of restaurants & bars close by, all reasonably priced. Would recomend this funky hotel for younger couples & single travellers. 
26932 Rooms were very small and shows the wear and tear of an older hotel. Lobby is shared with a restaurant that is not really part of the Sheraton. Stayed on points, so we didn't have to actually pay the rate. 
26933 Very nice hotel. The rooms were a great size, and hotel was clean. ( Bathroom was a bit tight but this wasn't a concern.). Hotel was in a quiet area, beside the police station. Safe location. Overall, we had a great time in New York and will return. 
26934 Excelente hotel, buena ubicacion y el precio muy bueno para ser NY. Los cuartos son adecuados y limpios. El servicio de "housekeepeing" y "front desk" fue excelente. Muy accesible y centrico. Definitivamente una buena opcion a un buen precio. Lo considero en proxima visita a NY. 
26935 Hotel was ok very clean...the two woman at the front desk sucked big time had terrible attitudes (hated speaking to them) and the bellman was even worse I hated him even more (think his name was Andy..stay away from him) they made my stay very unpleasant... 
26936 My room was typical NY small, which is to say, tiny. However, awesome location and great quality bed. A little loud at night but, you do not go to NY for peace and quiet! 
26937 Stayed one night here it is walking distance from the airport 
26938 Check in was efficient and friendly and our upgraded room comfortable. Would stay here again if in the area and catching a flight next day 
26939 Staff was very friendly and accomodating. Rooms were clean and comfy! The Location of the hotel was ideal being just off times square but not to close. I would highly recommend this hotel and plan to stay again in the near future. 
26940 We spent our wedding night at Zaza and it was a wonderful experience! The room was great, staff friendly and dinner at the Monarch was perfect! Thanks for making our day even more especial! 
26941 Had a hard time finding this place, but it was worth the struggle. Staff were very friendly and prompt. Parking is spacious and secure. Elevators were huge and clean. Hallways are very spacious and clean and quiet. The room was spacious. Beds are fantastic. I will definitely stay there again. 
26942 It fourth super small. For just sleep this good. For the price charging at least could follow breakfast. 
26943 overall great - the only issue wihtthe hotel is the $52/day car parking fee - overall the service was great and the employees freindly 
26944 Location, location, location. Close to everything, subway one block away. Reasonable rooms (quite dated, yet confortable), but average service. A bit on the slow and careless side. Better hotels for the same price in NYC. 
26945 This is a great location - within a block of the south entrance to the Park. But the rooms were postage stamp! Very uncomfortable, cramped and stuffy! Certainly not worth the high cost! 
26946 We booked at priceline,it is really a good value. the location is convienient. everything is good. 
26947 My boyfriend took me to New York for my birthday in Jan. We had a great time exploring the city, seeing the sights and basically being very 'touristy'. The Westin was the perfect hotel for our holiday. Amazing location, brilliant service from all staff and lovely rooms. 
26948 We stayed in this hotel because it was close to Times Square and was about $120 a night. A good price for the area. We were not disappointed. The rooms are small, but they were clean and the location was great! 
26949 We stayed there for an entire week for nye and the location is outstanding, near to canal st. little italy, great restaurants around safe neighborhood, close to sub stations at 10 minutes from times square... front desk is the best part they make our stay a nice experience... 
26950 This is my favorite hotel in Chelsea. Staff is great, location has lots of food choices, and it's a nice value. 
26951 From the moment you walk in to this lovely boutique hotel the staff makes you feel welcome. Rooms are small and so are the bathrooms, but this is New York. Very helpful staff. They've been my go to hotel for the last 3 years. Another amazing Kimpton Hotel! 
26952 Small, room (even for NY!), with old furniture -the drawers wouldn't close-, and the bathroom was really small and uncomfortable. The attention was ok. Location isn't what I'd reccomend, but if you wan't to be in the middle of the torist world, then it's an ideal location. 
26953 Spent one night at the Hilton New York before heading to the Staybridge Times Square (see separate review on that hotel). The Hilton is your typical overpriced, very large hotel lacking in true customer service. 
26954 Have stayed here several time and considerit a good value. Package deals can make it even better..We walk to most venues and enjoy the city. Consider the package deals. David and Jean Baskin 
26955 this is a great hotel. The rooms are spacious and very clean. The bed is very good. I found the front desk very helpful and quick in both check-in and check-out. The location is next to the UN.. I would stay here anytime. I bid on this hotel with priceline. 
26956 Molto soddisfatto della struttura e della locazione, nel centro di Manhattan, servita da bus e subway. La avenue retrostante offre una variegata tipologia di food concept. Io lo consiglio. Ottimi i cookies offerta alla reception all'arrivo. 
26957 OK, so it's an airport hotel and people stay there for convenience not for great luxury. That being said, the staff were extremely helpful and friendly. They seemed to really care that we were well looked after. 
26958 Very shabby. Place deserves to be torn down. For what they get for hotel rooms in NY, you'd think they could renovate the place 
26959 Such a nice, clean, and updated hotel. Our window looked north across the river with the Trump building and the "corn cob" buildings perfectly in view. The hotel staff was attentive and friendly. We were in perfect walking distance for Michigan Ave. 
26960 From our arrival to our departure, the stafff was extremely courteous and helpful. The room was clean and felt very relaxing. The location is great too!!! Just a few blocks from Broadway!! I will definitely stay here again!! 
26961 This was a very nice hotel with an unbelievable location. 
26962 Jessica is the bomb! I will come back just for her. The perfect front desk person. Cute, Nice, Sweet, Helpful, knows her business. I wish every hotel i stayed at had a front desk person like Jessica. And the hotel is nice too 
26963 I loved my four nights at this hotel. The location is excellent as has been mentioned before, the rooms were clean,cosy and safe. Reception staff; Alice and Zi were warm and welcoming, nothing was too much trouble. I will be back! 
26964 Great location and budget friendly. Rooms are small but stylish and clean. 
26965 This is a beautiful hotel with a perfect location if you are visiting New York! Walking distance or a short cab ride to all the attractions: Financial District, Island boat ride, SoHo, Madison Ave.,St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc. Accomodations were nice and service was good. 
26966 The pictures on the web site do not do this hotel justice. Eat at Ess-A Bagel in the morning. 
26967 This was our first visit to New York, and the Muse was absolutely wonderful. Clean, large(in comparison to others in New York) Very helpful, very comfortable bed and awesome location. 1/2 block off Times Square. Will definitly go back. 
26968 If you are looking for a sanctuary in NYC then this your hotel. It is a luxury hotel with a very boutique feel. The staff is extremely nice and helpful. I highly recommend Dream Downtown either for a business or pleasure stay. 
26969 I've been staying at this Drury for 5 months so I feel qualified to review it. The service is wonderful. Second to none. Rooms could use an update but suites are spacious. Free breakfast and happy hour plus munchies. Price can't be beat. Walking distance to nearby restaurants. 
26970 This hotel is gross. The rooms are miniscule. I switched rooms and upgraded to a suite but then I still felt like I was sleeping in a night club/frat house. It feels used, dirty and cheap. I left immediately the next day and would never go back. 
26971 Headline says it all. Rooms are on the smaller side. Often tend to be grubby or slightly worn. Service so so. Location is very good but I find the hotel very noisy. Its cheap but it has to be. 
26972 The room we got was far better than even waldorf towers rooms - and 1000 cheaper. The service was perfect and the space was amazing- it was about 3 rooms!! Unreal bathrooms-great design- I want to live there. It was my boyfriends birthday and they even left us a gift! 
26973 This is a nice small hotel located a few blocks from Times Square. The room was a nice size. The bed could have been a bit more comfortable and our room did not have a bathtub. Other than that, we had a good experience here. 
26974 The food here is great!! The Nave is a little bar, just perfect at the end of a hetic day. Service at this hotel just divine. The pool and sundeck a joy!!! 
26975 Location: incredible Staff: wonderful Room: lovely Food: to die for Extras: wifi, coffee & pastries, wine & cheese Verdict: you'd be mad to go elsewhere 
26976 Fabulous hotel. Ultra helpful staff and great location, but jeebus the beds are the most solid pieces back breaking hell I've ever slept on. Those electric flolding torture machines were so bad I was actually glad we were only staying for three nights. But hey apart from that, great hotel. 
26977 The hotel is conveniently located near the UN headquarters. The decor is somewhat dated, but the staff is friendly and efficient. A solid choice, 
26978 Situation fantastique de l'hotel, avec vue exceptionnelle sur times square. 
26979 This was a fantastic Upper West Side hotel. The staff was personable and professional. Every aspect of our experience there was top notch. 
26980 The employees of this hotel know what service is. They are very hulpfull and make your stay pleasant. They are friendly in any circumstance. The location is very goed between downtown and up-town. The sub-way is almost around the corner. I can recommend this hotel for a stay. 
26981 I think the location is so good, just 4 or 5 block from time square. The price was a bit expensive because of the location. But, there was no laundry room, the warm water sometimes not work, small deluxe room and too many people in lobby. Anyway, there was good. 
26982 At the first night we got small room with windows to big wall after i talk with the front desk they change my room to better and larger room but a little noisy. the staff are very helpful Overall not bad choice 
26983 Stayed in The Benjamin for the first time and found it simply perfect in each and every detail. With hotels like this you can figure out how much you miss in an "average hotel" for a similar price (especially in NYC). 
26984 Great location, most friendly staff, warm atmosphere in the small loby, the suite is very spacious and feels homy and it is relatively cheap. We come here every year on December and it never disappoints us. We will come again next year. 
26985 We stayed here a few years back it is in a Fab location in NY the hotel was clean staff friendly when leaving the front desk ordered a limo there is a fab little Diner just along from the hotel brill breakfast 
26986 I will not stay anywhere else when I go back but here. Loved the beds, pillow and the LOCATION. It was perfect and the door man is so nice. 
26987 This is a great hotel to stay at when in the Galleria area of Houston. It is not as pricey as some and is even fairly close to the medical district. 
26988 AMAZING location - easy walk to subway station at Times Square. Rooms were a decent size and clean. Street was quiet at night and there is a very large breakfast available. Definitely stay here if you are looking for a nice, affordable hotel at a prime location! 
26989 The ambiance and staff of the hotel were great. The rooms were very clean and tidy and room design was exceptional. Loved the elevators. I will definately stay here again and again... The surroundings was great and close to all amenities in downtown Chicago.. 
26990 Great value. Clean, modern, great service, terrific staff. Half a block to subway. Could not have been better. 
26991 Stayed here a couple of times for 4 and 6 nights. Clean, reliable and reasonably priced (this is NYC!). Plenty of eating options nearby, close to subway and of course Times Square and the theatres. Hotel service good, can be a bit variable in the attached restaurant for breakfast. 
26992 It is in the heart of manhattan and very close to times square , ESB, and even Penn station. Room was great and very neat. Breakfast was excellent. You make ur own waffle :). Overall highly recommended. 
26993 Het hotel ligt op 38 street dus niet ver van Time Square die op 42nd street ligt. Zo dichtbij het hart van New York en alle gemakken in de buurt zoals winkels, restaurants, boetieks enz. enz.. Bij de keuze van dit hotel was de ligging doorslag- gevend. 
26994 i love this hotel cause its big and the bed is comfertable 
26995 Very convenient hotel in the downtown area. Rooms were spacious and comfortable. Although, my room overlooked three abandoned buildings, could have been better. Breakfast was good for buffet. Try to get a room on a high floor, the street noise starts early! 
26996 Booked here through Priceline. Hotel is dated, yet functional. Great location with easy access to Central Park and midtown Manhattan. Room was large enough. Could have used an update in furnishings. Typical older NYC hotel. Would stay here again as long as the price is right. 
26997 Hotel is old. Nice pool area. Restraunt is probably the nicest thing in the Hotel. The Rooms are very dated and old furnishings. Staff is very friendly. 
26998 Had an apartment style room with separate lounge room and kitchen which was fantastic to have. Good value. Staff are friendly and helpful. Short walk to 5th Ave and Rockfeller Centre 
26999 Great nice small hotel. They make you feel at home. Great location. 
27000 Almost everything about this stay was great!!!! The only thing I would suggest is having breakfast stay open a little later...... We turned in late on Saturday so we missed breakfast by 15 minutes..... overall a great stay !!! Cant wait to be there again...... 
27001 Een geweldige plaats om te verblijven. Een mooie kamer met keukentje en een mega supermarkt aan de overkant. De ligging is rustig vlak bij Central park en een zeer nette buurt. Ook is het vlakbij een bushalte en metrostation. 
27002 A very nice hotel in the hearth of New York. Really close to Times Square. The atmosphere is very nice and the room has all the comforts a person need. The toilet inside he room is special and nice! 
27003 I have stayed here four times and find it to be my hotel of choice in mid-town. The rooms are comfortable for one or two and the service is excellent. The rooms are quiet and well appointed. 
27004 Amazing hotel in a great location for shopping on Fifth Avenue, Times Square, Theatre District and Central Park. Service was excellent. Spa is definitely worth a visit. Room was very spacious for New York and bed was so comfy. Cannot fault this hotel, very luxurious. 
27005 Perfect location and excellent customer service. It is a magnificent Hotel, the biggest in Timesquare. Complete with nice restaurants, nice gym and the best consierge label service in New York. It was such a great experience to have stayed there, love to go back soon. 
27006 Loved the St. Regis, truly beautiful. One of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in, wonderful staff, lovely rooms, excellent location for shopping, walks in the park, shopping... Pricey, but worth it. Would definitely love to stay there again. 
27007 Great location for Broadway shows. Quiet. Room was small but well decorated. Bathroom was clean and new. 
27008 Stayed at the Loews NY on November 10th. I was on the 4th floor and was pleasantly surprised at how quiet the room was. Also, the water pressure in the shower was excellent. 
27009 Recently directed here due to a cancelled BA flight. Rooms are poor along with the facilities. Using the air conditioning in the room is very similar to having a diesel engine in your room. No room service, no real breakfast. In fact you should avoid this hotel if possible. 
27010 Everything was wonderful. Good location. Rooms spacious with amenities. I recommend everyone to stay at this hotel. Very Clean 
27011 We had the romance package and got everything promised and more. We have found our new anniversary hotel. Room great. Area great. And staff went out of their way to make the stay great. We will definitely be returning. 
27012 The room looked just as they show on their web site, very clean. Our package was very reasonably priced and included wonderful breakfast buffet. I would definitely recommend when you need to be in a central location in Manhattan. 
27013 Was really disappointed that free Wi-Fi is not available. No dining lounge except breakfast. And still had to pay for continental breakfast. 
27014 What a great hotel - conceptually. Had a great stay. The staff could have been a little more friendly. The eating & drinking was great. I would be back (just a few more smiles) 
27015 Expensive, but tremendous. Great rooms, front desk, housekeeping, and the Gotham Lounge were great. Fantastic martini. 
27016 Great hotel, great location, best staff ever !!! Huge view on floor 30... Empire state building :D World's best sangrias in bar40 <3 And can you sent me that bed !!!! 
27017 Complaints: hot water sporadic in the mornings, internet slow, sound and smells travel between rooms. But overall great stay. I'd definitely stay there again. Thanks!! 
27018 From the views, to the service, to the breakfast, to the doorman, this is a grand place. The quick walk to the Macy's parade was very nice also. Loved the particular location between the Ritz and Plaza. Great shopping all around. Museums were only blocks away. 
27019 My first visit to the Big Apple and it certainly won't be my last. Would definitely stay at CP again and would highly recommend it 
27020 Very clean and spacious rooms, excellent service in the hotel and very centrally located. Thank you for living up to all of my expectations. 
27021 Fica em frente ao Central Park,muito perto da Quinta Avenida.Visinho do Plazza.E otimo! 
27022 We stayed here (Jan 2012). The hotel staff was awesome. When we got there to check in we were upgrade to a larger room, which was really nice. The room was awesome, with amazing views of the city. The location is great. It close to Rockefeller Center and Times Square. 
27023 This hotel is European in feel; nice breakfast, nice room on the small side, interesting location, good price 
27024 Very friendly welcome. Asked for quiet room, and it was! 18th floor room was spiffy, every cable channel possible incuding hbo and showtime. Free wifi and free breakfast. Across street from Herald square and Macy's. Very happy. 
27025 The hotel was wonderful...first class, goregous accomodations and a very friendly staff. My only complaint was there was only Valet Parking, not self park. 
27026 Breakfast included and lots of bottled water for hot New York days. Very helpful and friendly staff, especially Mary the Concierge. The best overall hotel in a big city experience I have had. Highly recommended. 
27027 Nothing better than walking out the front door of your Hotel and into the "Heart of the City". Close to Broadway, Subway system and a million other things. Hotel was nice and clean with helpful staff, especially Edith F. at the Front Desk. 
27028 YOU COULD NOT ASK FOR A BETTER HOTEL TO STAY AT WHILE IN NEW YORK. we stayed for a week and were treated like family. the rooms were clean and roomy. we are looking forward to staying at the same place every time we visit. 
27029 We stayed at this hotel in september for three nights. could not find fault in anything, great service, good location, huge very comfartable room. would love to stay here again. 
27030 It was small, clean and quiet! I felt like I was on vacation even though I was there for work. The staff was friendly, and everything was clean. For the price, it was a wonderful place! 
27031 The hotel is new, clean, and non-smoking. The staff was friendly. The hotel rate is one of the lowest I've seen. The rooms were small but cozy. The subway station was close by and it made it very convenient to travel all around the city. 
27032 Hotel was comfortable and clean. Close to subway station. Cafe's and restaurants close by. European cafe (hotel gives out breakfast voucher if required) on other side of Broadway supplied a very good breakfast for $6.50. Staff helpful and courteous. Quiet location. Would definitely stay here again. 
27033 het hotel is perfekt voor een stedentrip. dicht bij Times Square. Kamer is erg netjes, douche is super goed. Je moet alleen door de parkeergarage naar de lift, dat is wat minder. Maar er is altijd iemand die de boel in de gaten houd. 
27034 They are super excellent at all.near of all places,food,ect..... I will come back again soon.Quite rooms, the beds are great ,my wife sleep like an angel. The air conditioner cools great and quite. 
27035 Holiday Inn Express, in my experience never disappoints and Downtown Houston is no exception. The buffet breakfast is wonderful. The exercise room is small, but always available and, like room WiFi, is complementary. 
27036 The best holiday iv ever had new york is incredible and ten days was not enough, Coupled with the empire, clean rooms big bed bigger shower tv, but to be honest you only want to be there to sleep n clean up, your in new York right????!!!!! 
27037 Fabulous: customer service, rooms, breakfast, location, value for the money! One of the best deals going in NYC, and one of the best travel experiences we have ever had! 
27038 Nice Hotel except real bad elevator service at check-out time. I couldn't believe it when one of the hotel employees told me with a straigh face to take escalators from the eighth to the ground floor. It amazes me that Marriott Corporation lets this exist. 
27039 Big room, lots of space, comfy bed, work station for laptop, lots of plus-in areas, flat screen tv, large clean modern bathrooms, iPod docking station/alarm clock,wonderful staff, very friendly,walking distance to navy pier, breakfast buffet. 
27040 The hotel stay was great! Excellent stay and within walking distance of Times Square, Rockefeller Center, St Patrick's Cathedral, subway station, TKTS booth, and many great places to eat! Will definitely stay here again!!!! Kind of pricey, but it was December! 
27041 Upon arriving in our hotel room we received a red heart balloon and chocolate-covered strawberries for our anniversary from the hotel. The service was impeccable in all areas, including the restaurant. 
27042 The staff at the W Hotel Lakeshore is amazing. Every request was addressed promptly. I love the location. The rooms are a bit small and could use an upgrade. I was very pleased with the service. I would clearly stay there again!! 
27043 How cool and how NYC!!! Great location, old and full of history. Sink into one of the comfy couches in the lobby and ring a little bell on the table for some drinks. Perfect location, great price. Would stay there again in a minute!! 
27044 Centrally located, convenient to tourism hotspots.Comfy beds and furniture. Good lightinng and friendly service. Reasonable rates. I would definately stay here again in New York. 
27045 A little pricey, but worth it. Spacious rooms, close to restaurants and shopping. 
27046 Such a nice hotel!!! Great stay last week in rainy NY. Welcoming and knowledgeable staff, room very comfortable, every request answered fast. Bar upstairs really busy at night with amazing views. Perfect for a 3 day business trip. Will recommend and definitely go back!!! 
27047 LOVE being pampered...had a two room suite, sophiticated, elegant, wonderful dining..concierge got us fantastic tickets for the Phantom of the Opera..took care of our every whim Did I mention I loved this place? 
27048 My third time at The Time and it was great as always. Great Times Square location with excellent bar and restaurant on premises as well as tons of great entertainment nearby. 
27049 its the worst hotel iv ever stayed in please dont go ever and if you have booked it try and get your money back the hotel is sh-------t 
27050 Very nice boutique hotel, stylish and modern. Staff is very friendly and competent. Good value for money. only drawback is that there is not a metro station nearby. Best way into town by bus, then metro. 
27051 Great hotel value and service. Super clean room at a non NYC rate. Free breakfast in the morning. Rooms are small but execptionaly clean and just re-modeled. Tempur-pedic beds(great). Good location between downtown and midtown. Have stayed here bi monthly for over a year now. 
27052 Room was very clean and comfortable. They complimented us with champagne and a cheese tray for our 30th wedding anniversary. Very close to times square. Nice lobby that compliments you with coffee in the morning and a wine tasting in the early evening. 
27053 Don't stay here. It is overpriced and overrated. Stained, cheap, and terrible service. 
27054 VERAMENTE UN HOTEL ECCELLENTE, E' BELLO DOPO AVER GIRATO SU E GIU PER MANHATTAN ED ESSERE STANCHISSIMI, TROVARE UNA CAMERA CONFORTEVOLE MA SOPRATTUTTO PULITISSIMA. PERSONALE GENTILISSIMO E DISPONIBILE. POSIZIONE MOLTO CENTRALE PER CHI DEVE VISITARE NEW YORK A PIEDI E O MUOVERSI IN METRO. DA CONSIGLIARE SENZA ESITAZIONE. 
27055 Really nice rooms, cute decoration, great breakfast more than enough to start your day. This is a location perfect for the night before your flight is just a couple minutes from the airport. But is far from the Galleria area and downtown. I will stay here again for sure ! 
27056 Very convenient, great service, great views. The rooms large fir NY and acutely represented accurately from their website. Overall, great place with a hip scean. 
27057 I will stay here next time I go to NYC. Fantastic location, one block from the subway and Lexington Ave. 5 min walk to the major shopping around Bloomingdales. Nice breakfast restaurants 200 meters from the hotel, open from early in the morning till late at night. 
27058 A perfect combination of location, service and value. If Times Square and theatres are what you want choose the Novotel Times Square. 
27059 Went on a vacation trip with some friends, I was very excited about staying here. The hotel met all my expectations and it was a wonderful stay. Just 3-4 blocks away from time square, great view, rooms, service and rates. 10 of out 10! 
27060 Small but super efficient rooms. First I found a room where the design and functionality has been optimized to his best. I have to go back this summer to enjoy the Terrasse. 
27061 Friendly staff, great west side location. I was very pleased. 
27062 Good room, nice location. I was surprised at the size for NYC. I've definitely had smaller rooms. The lobby is a little too shiny and cold, but overall, the hotel is clean, comfortable, with good service. 
27063 We stayed here for a night while visiting NYC. The staff is very friendly, room was very clean and had lots of space. Battery Park is a short walk away. We had a great view of Ellis Island. Excellent place to stay!! 
27064 Pretty good hotel I highly recomend this hotel , very good location , very nice service , no complains at all !!!! 
27065 We loved this elegant, yet unpretencious, boutique hotel in a great location in midtown. The staff is excellent, the rooms (small) but beautiful with desirable amenities. Loved the coffee/tea bar in the lobby. Check the hotel's website for the best rates I could find, even compared to expedia and travelocity. 
27066 Location is perfect and central. Time square, central park and shopping all easy access all within 10min walk. Staff extremely helpful. Rooms cleaned well and large rooms especially in context of NY. Really would recommend and would use again!!! 
27067 For the intersection of room quality, location, and price, it would be hard to beat this place in Chicago. The hotel is right off the Magnificent Mile, but on a small one-way street that keeps traffic minimized. Service was prompt and attentive. 
27068 Had a great stay HGI Chelsea recently. This is a nice hotel for the price. The staff was very friendly and accomodating. The rooms are standard HGI rooms. Of course they are quite small which is normal for NYC. Subway in very close which is very nice. No complaints overall! 
27069 Clean hotel. Comfortable room and bed. Friendly staff. Standard breakfast. Would stay again. 
27070 Loved this hotel. Loved the executive lounge. It was a GREAT experience. 
27071 Spent 6 nights here Feb 11-17. Our suite was very spacious and furnished well. The staff were extremely helpful and responded to requests etc promptly. Kitchen was a little understocked with cooking utensils. Our suite was cleaned every day by the very friendly housekeeper. Would we stay again - absolutely. 
27072 This hotel is in a fantastic location and our room had a fabulous view of Time Square. The hotel decor needs an update but it was generally clean. Our only problem was with room service. The towels and bed were not changed/made daily. Otherwise a decent hotel for the price. 
27073 Muy buen hotel, buena relacion calidad-precio. Una ubicacion increible a pasos de Times Square. 
27074 I stayed at the Parker in early March for a business trip. The location is great, close to shopping, museums, the park and subway stations. The rooms were clean and large by NYC standards. All the staff were helpful and responsive. Overall a great experience and would go back. 
27075 Hotel was perfect location, right in heart of NYC, very clean, staff friendly 
27076 The Marriott was a great hotel in the greatest city. The value comes in its central location to Times Square/Midtown - theatre/restaurants/shopping. Everyone was very friendly and the hotel restaurant (The View) was amazing! Enjoyed our stay and would always recommend to other folks. 
27077 excellent hotel. have stayed in New York 4 times and this was the best hotel. very clean, quiet and cheap. great location with easy access to the metro and the Empire State. the inclusive breakfast was also a bonus. would stay there again. top marks. 
27078 Ok hotel-fab location, lovely lobby, I got bit very badly on my legs. Stay at the Wellington or Edison. Same price but no bed bugs 
27079 Man in gift shop very very helpful... The fairy on reception Is an utter jobs worth 
27080 This hotel is basic, but very close to the action in Times Square - let's face it, if you're in New York how much time are you going to spend in your hotel? Clean, friendly, free wi-fi, breakfast included. It was a great cost effective option for our NYE trip. 
27081 hotel un peu retro mais plein de charme tres loin des hotels d'affaires impersonnels .Clientel typiquement americaine (dans le bon sens du terme,joyeuse familiale et bon enfant) avec une situation extraordinaire (la rue a traverser pour aller voir mama mia au winter garden ) au pied de time square 
27082 Big rooms, great location, everything about our stay was wonderful. My daughter got sick during our stay and the staff bent over backwards to help. Everything about the hotel is great, but to me the amazing staff is what truly sets it apart. Will absolutely stay here again! 
27083 Its a great hotel and its located in a great area with nice views and a nice clean hotel 
27084 One of the best hotels I stayed in. On my next trip to NY, I'll make sure to check at the Sofitel. Breakfasts were more than expected and the pancakes were awesome. Check on the breakfast "a la francaise". Love this place. 
27085 The room was small, but very clean. The hotel is old, but in the heart of Midtown. The staff was constantly cleaning, and maintaining the decor. Overall, this was a very good choice for the reasonable cost. 
27086 great staff , fantastic decor and the restaurant BLU ......can't wait to go back on my next trip to new york. I was told that they will open the roof top very soon 
27087 This is the second hotel in I have stayed in that's a part of Marriott's new Autograph Collection. This one is nice as very nice as well. Beautifully appointed and very nice staff. Downtown location. 
27088 Easy walk Lots of restaurants Good service I liked the decor but small rooms 
27089 I don't demand much of a hotel, since when I'm traveling for leisure, I hardly spend any time at the hotel, except for sleeping. Beds were very comfy, room pretty clean. What I loved most of this hotel was its location 
27090 A nice and clean hotel near Soho within China Town. Even if beeing in a busy part of town the room was quitet. Staff was friendly and service minded. The room had free internet access that worked well. 
27091 We enjoyed a junior suite with a corner view. Very clean room. From our room you could see ground zero and out the side was the church. We will stay here again 
27092 This has got to be one of the most affordable luxury hotels in the world's greatest city. I just loved this hotel whatever little time we had at our stay in New york. The hotel has great amenities and good services 
27093 is an older hotel but for what i paid for and right across the street from the famous venue madison sq garden its not that bad 3 out of 5 
27094 This is undoubtedly the cleanest motel in Houston. The staff is friendly and willing to assist in anyway. Close to businesses. Other hotels could learn what wonderful customer service is from this La Quinta and Mr. Patel and his staff. 
27095 Stivbent og tilrettelagt for forretningsreisende. lite barnevennlig og ikke veldig hyggelig betjening i den grad man trenger det. Det er beliggenheten som er perfekt i forhold til shopping og opplevelser. 
27096 This was my 4th visit to Chelsea Lodge in 3 year and they have never let me down. Paul and his staff are helpful and the location is great for all the action that NYC has to offer. 
27097 I stayed at this hotel while in New York last week. The people at the front desk were extremely helpful and friendly, especially Amanda. The room was comfortable, and the bathroom, very clean.I would stay here again. Very close to Times Square, Bryant park, Broadway etc. 
27098 In addition to be in the best location in Manhattan, this hotel is clean, large (in comparison with NY standards), has a spacious entrance hall and the staff are pleasant. 
27099 Perfect location, just few blocks from Grand Central Station, Empire State Building, etc. few minutes walking to the nearest subway. Affordable price and good quality/price ratio. 
27100 Great location, rooms are clean, staff friendly. If you have the choice, don't take the rooms on the avenue cause it's noisy even at 3am. But apart from that everything was perfect. The next time I will take this hotel again! 
27101 Just a quick note to let folks traveling to NYC to check into the Dream Hotel. Great ambiance, great service, GREAT PEOPLE. 
27102 Quaint hotel with an ideal location! We walked everywhere. I love being in walking distance to the water, shopping, great restaurants and sites. The hotel is hip and as a bonus a block way from the crazy traffic and noise. I would definitely recommend it. 
27103 Excellent hotel, large room with nice new furnishings, wonderful location for seeing the sights, other guests all very friendly, great martinis in lobby bar! Concierge was very helpful as was reception staff. 
27104 The Best Western Bowery Hanbee Hotel is right on the border of Chinatown and Little Italy. The neighborhood was fun with lots of character. Our room was clean, unusually spacious for NYC, and the staff was friendly. Will definitely stay here again. 
27105 Front desl staff are friendly, rooms are ok but getting old. Bar really rocks on Tuesday night kareoke night if that is your thing. No breakfast except a little sandwich place and don"y bother. 
27106 Lousy hotel--awful staff--stay away from unless you do not care about the money you spend! Heat did not work and when reported to staff they could care less. There were no extra outlets to plug cell phone into. 
27107 Need I say more. Everything in this hotel is made to make guests feel at home. It has everything that a large luxury hotel provides, without the anonimity of a big hotel. A definite A+ 
27108 Excellent hotel. Comfortable stay. Big rooms considering it is NYC. Short walk to all attractions. And the bonus - Magnolia Bakery was literally a 5 minute walk from this hotel. Amazing. Want to return! 
27109 The Hotel Newton was quite far up on the west side of Manhattan, however it is conveniently located right outsite the metro station and therefore it is around 10min to get to midtown. The room and bathroom were clean although the airconditioning was a bit loud and not amazingly efficient. 
27110 Room clean but decor a little tired, we only used the restaurant once, for breakfast, good food but expensive. The best thing about the hotel is the location, central and very close to Central Park. We would stay again for that reason. 
27111 Loved the location. Small but quaint and served the purpose. Lot of little extras. Great staff. Very helpful and accomodating.Would stay here again if needing to be in the Chelsea/Gramercy Park area. 
27112 This place was awesome. It was clean, comfy and well laid out. You can even bottle your own water! Staff was friendly and the pub downstairs was good food. GREAT LOCATION and has an EL station close by. We will SO be back 
27113 beautiful hotel. great lobby bar, great lobby, great location, great library bar, great views. terrible restaurant (unless you miss high school cafeteria style) and rooms the size of oversized shoeboxes. 
27114 Just came back from a 3-nite stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown. Completely satisfied! Hotel is clean, quiet. Staff attentive and responsive (got a bathroom problem fixed in 10 minutes after the call). Excellent location to explore Manhattan. 
27115 Great location neat Bryant park, south side has empire state view clean, quiet room. Weekend deal with roomy kitchen was great. Nice breakfast buffet with very polite servers...all around great 
27116 Mijn kamer was netjes, maar het interieur was 30-40 jaar oud. Er schijnen ook gerenoveerde kamers te zijn. Leuke bar op de begane grond, ontbijt is niets bijzonders. Starbucks aan de overkant. Zeer dicht bij Times Square. 
27117 dirty room, broken shower, non existing service, the worst boutique hotel i have ever stayed in this place is an absolut no-go. next time i will book again one of the known chains. i am surprised that there no more bad comments 
27118 Great place, wonderful service. Convenient location to the major office buildings in town. Quiet and elegant and clean. 
27119 Stayed here for two nights. Extremely impressed from start to finish. Staff universally friendly & helpful - especially Harry in the Remington Bar who is a real star. Room great. Pool smaller than it looks on the website, but a nice sun trap for November. Difficult to find fault. 
27120 Great location - friendly staff - adequate breakfast (nice to sit outside on the small terrace) - noisy ice machine outside room was the only inconvenience. 
27121 Filthy Room, No Hot Water AND front desk said it was on the north, rather than the south side of Highway 10. I've never written a bad review before, but this place warrants one. Review must be 100 characters so I'm adding to it now: DO NOT STAY HERE! 
27122 this is the best hoaltal i have every stayed at i recomened this to all coming to newyork for the holidays 
27123 What I love about this hotel is that it is perfectly located to launch your NYC adventures. Essentially, every subway line you need to see Manhattan is available within a 4 block radius, including the NQRW which is quite literally out the front door. 
27124 This hotel was close to everything. It was very clean and the staff were helpful. Rooms were nice and the bed was great. 
27125 Me and a couple of my partners headed to the the midwest for "taste of chicago" and were really glad we choose your location. Your rooms were great and Your staff is very professional. Kudos to Bret Concierge!! Great service 
27126 2nd visit to the towers. Accommodation without fault, food presentations excellent, staff friendly and welcoming. This is one of my favourite hotels in the world and I look forward to returning. 
27127 Just like to say we enjoyed our stay at travel inn 42st. Nice clean room friendly staff. Good location. 25/3/10-31/3/10 
27128 The suite was great, and the staff and service were exceptional. 
27129 we love staying at the ink48 hotel. this hotel and staff always go the extra mile to make sure your stay is fantastic. this is the only hotel we will stay at when we come to New York! Ink48 is an incredible value just love it! 
27130 Large rooms and great service. The breakfast is good and the location is outstanding. 
27131 The Lucerne is a great hotel. The rooms were spacious, beds comfy, linens crisp, and toiletries aromatic. Its location is ideal for enjoying Manhattan, away from the throngs of tourists, and close to Central Park and tons of great restaurants and shops. 
27132 You couldn't ask for a better location to See broadway. Convenient to everything. 
27133 Great location near Times Square and Theatre District yet local area has a neighborhood feel to it. 
27134 The hotel is so near The Times Square, the main metro lines. If you want just a place to go to bed is good. 
27135 Overall is good, except the room is a bit old. The price is reasonable and location is really good!! 
27136 Very clean. Good location near Navy Pier. Nice manager's reception in evening. Crowed breakfast w/ long lines after 9:00. 
27137 great views and walk to everything. most comfortable bed ever! choice windows hot baths and clean!! got a deal online too. friendly staff and quiet rooms 
27138 Our room was complimentary upgraded to a deluxe suite on the 18th floor. It had 2 bathrooms, a living room, king size bed, and a kitchen with a table and chairs. Very clean, very comfortable. Wish we could have stayed longer! 
27139 Bagno in comune, stanze piccole ma in centro ho un bel ricordo nonostante una trappola per topi sotto il letto 
27140 This hotel is in a terrific location. Most of the attractions I wanted to visit were within walking distance. The magnificient mile, the art institute, millenium park, etc... and it was very close to the El. Rooms were nice, staff was helpful. 
27141 perfect location very clean great room No free Wi fi anywhere which is a minus 
27142 If you are looking for a hotel for a reasonable price in a great location, look no further! You are in the heart of the city just off from Times Square. You will find no extras or frills but the rooms were clean and the staff was friendly. 
27143 HOTEL BIEN SITUE.PERSONNEL TRES PROFESSIONNEL. PETITE DECEPTION SUR LA VUE INEXISTANTE ET SUR LA GRANDEUR DE LA CHAMBRE. MERITE PAS UN 4 ETOILES. RESERVATION POUR 2 ADULTES ET 2 ENFANTS ET UN SEUL LIT A L'ARRIVEE. 
27144 Awesome place. Great location. Fridge and microwave make it perfect. I love this place. Will be back again. 
27145 Lovely hotel in middle of Times Square, the hotel was spotless and the staff professional and very helpful with luggage, getting taxis etc, amenities very good in general , will stay again !!! 
27146 Nice place- very clean rooms, I can't say enough about the staff! Wonderful and kind. Very impressed! Will definitely stay there again and would highly recommend. 
27147 If you are going to work and you need a safe, clean, well located spot near The Galleria, this is it. Stores close by, The Galleria is very closed. The place is very well kept, clean, friendly, very good good breakfast. 
27148 Very disappointed by my stay (4 nights),poor service,room done in the evening. i think the objective of this hotel is to have private meetings and celebration which occupy the Mezzanine and lobby room on the first floor. 10 years ago,it was a different hotel. 
27149 Hotel tres correcte , frequente par une majoritecd europeensc et francais Demander chambreven etages eleves pour voir central,park Le gros plus c est aussi le celebre burgerjoin un restaurant de hamburgers super planqueva lavreception a droite derriere unrideau rouge Pscievsur le toit sympa restaurant et arvimpersonnel 
27150 A good value for NYC. Nice rooms. We got offered an upgrade. Would stay here again. 
27151 Friendly folks greeted us and checked us in. We loved our mini-suite and the breakfast buffet was great. Hope to return soon! 
27152 Dit hotel, gelegen op loopafstand van en aan de westkant Central Park is een hotel met een prima prijs / kwaliteit verhouding. Ligging is ook dicht bij meerdere metro lijnen. De inrichting voldoet aan de eisen van deze tijd en de service is in orde. 
27153 Nice and clean on lower East side. Stayed at the 15th floor, nice view over Empire State Building 
27154 We went during the Christmas season and it was beautiful the hotel was gorgeous! My husband is a platinum member so we had breakfast in the restaurant every morning complimentary! It was a great place to stay in the middle of everything! 
27155 Another great stay at the Four Seasons in New York. There is not one thing that I would change. Everyone is super friendly and helpful. We had a great view of Central Park from our room. 
27156 A very centrally located hotel in Manhattan. The rooms are large; though they can do with some renovation. The room I stayed in came with a fully equipped kitchenette, with fridge, microwave, basic crockery and utensils. The staff, especially the concierge, were very helpful. 
27157 Stayed 4 nights. Loved being so handy to Hop On Hop Off bus routes and many activities easy walking distance. Room was compact but quite sufficient. Very clean, and though less than 300 meters from Times Square no noise problems. Staff very helpful. Would definitely recommend Hotel Mela. 
27158 This hotel is like a Hampton in other cities so it was very acceptable. Rooms just a tad smaller. Would stay here again. It seems you have to spend $200 to $250 to get nice room in NYC. Great location. 
27159 Stayed there w/friends for birthday celebrations. Thought it would be cooler than it was. Kind of in the middle of no where. Rooms were clean, beds comfy. The staff was extremely helpful and friendly. The "rooftop" bar was just not cuttin it. 
27160 When we first arrived, we were greated by a friendly doorman and rececptionist at the lobby area. In no time at all we were in our suite relaxing. I loved it and would defiently go back again. Another good side was the restraunts and defiently the location. 
27161 I stayed for 3 days recently. The internet website cited a list of amenities provided in the room. But I found that there is no coffee maker or any other way to boil water in the room, no complimentary drinking water. For the price charged, this is a disappointment. 
27162 Affordable hotel in a great location. Staffs were very helpful and hotel is clean. I will always recommend this hotel to anyone 
27163 Stayed here for a shopping and sight-seeing trip and can thoroughly recommend it. Great quality decor and fittings throughout + super friendly and efficient staff. Good spot for museums, galleries and Central Park and only 10 minutes from 5th Ave shops. 
27164 from start to finish this hotel great staff couldnt do enough for us got room upgrade when they found out it was my birthday and a lovely present and card special mention to marlene caroline and agnes 
27165 Enjoyed the hotel 
27166 Staff eager to help. View of time square was great. Only mishap was the elevator had issues on a Saturday night and delayed us getting in our rooms for about. 20 minutes. Other than that wonderful experience 
27167 The hotel is located on 57th Street and we had a massive suite. I would definitely consider stopping here again. The only down side is the front desk. They are not very helpful but then again we found that with just about everyone in NY City. 
27168 Nice beds, bathrooms very new, can't beat the location if need to be down by Galleria. 
27169 I have stayed multiple times here and it's like being home! 
27170 Fantastic room, the staff was wonderful and the location was great. (next door to Grand central station) 
27171 This hotel was a great experience! Fun lobby & nice people... especially Jerry Mac who helped us with our late night check-in, clean room, no problems... I'll be back :) 
27172 The rooms are large and decorated with a warm homely style, the bathroom is a good size, the shower is hot, the beds amazingly comfortable, the pillows heavenly, the facilities extensive, the poolside relaxing, the staff worldclass. What more can I say! 
27173 Treated a Hilton Honors Diamond VIP horribly!! Staff attitude worst I've come across at any Hilton property. Stay at your own risk!!! 
27174 I found this hotel very good - reasonable price and good value. Room was not large but was very clean and quiet. Staff helpful. Breakfast adequate 
27175 This is an older property that has been partially remodeled. The staff works very hard to accommodate requests, but their hands are tied by a lack of space. The hotel stays busy with business travelers which keeps the rates up. I would recommend a different option in the Galleria area. 
27176 the staff at the econo lodge hotel was very friendly and helpful room was very small but very clean cant complain for the price 
27177 We booked as a package with flight. They upgraded us. Nice clean modern decor. Great location at Grand Central Station. Near everything and just a short subway ride to Time Sq etc. 
27178 I had the Starck fever! This hotel is totally beautiful! Gardens, lobby, rooftop, Bar, restaurant... Its an amazing environnement and ambiance! Highly recommanded to active people who love to have cocktails and chat after a long long day in the city! Love my stay!!! 
27179 This hotel was rated 4 stars but the hallways are dirty and room is tired. We had trouble finding the valet to park the car. Should be rated 3 stars. 
27180 This hotel grate for the price we paid. It's very clean, and that was the most important thing to me. The room is not that small 
27181 2 blocks from central park and 6 blocks from times square. It has 2 PC and printer free 
27182 Small continental brakfast 
27183 Si vous aimez l'animation de Brodway, c'est le must. Pour quelques dizaines de dollars de plus, demandez une chambre d'angle. 
27184 What a nice little hotel! Immaculate, friendly, safe, and in a great neighbourhood. I loved the Beacon and I will make it my "home base" whenever I am in NYC in the future. 
27185 Thanks to someone in reservations my one night stay was a total nighmare! The full details of the hotel's booking/reservation policy was not fully explained which resulted in an embrassing & frustrated check-in experience! Please don't stay here!! 
27186 I stayed in 373 for two weeks on a working visit to NY. The room was always clean, quiet, comfortable and well equipped. The location is great and there were no problems during the whole stay. Definitely worth the price and more. 
27187 Das Park Central ist sehr gut gelegen, aber wie immer der Service!! Wir kamen mittags, wurden auf 14h30 vertroestet und mussten auch nach 2 Anrufen zum Abtrocknen die Kopfkissenbezuege nehmen. Die waren neu, voller Appretur und nahmen kein Wasser an. Die Trattoria del Arte nextdoor in 900 7thAve war super. 
27188 Spent great fall weekend at this solid property. Good size rooms, great location to mid-town, Central Park...Great for kids. 
27189 this place is like a family run hotel.... the staff are great! 
27190 This hotel is amazing it has the nest location of any in SOHO. The staff is very helpful but definitely a little hipster which we enjoyed! If you are wondering where to stay, this is your place! 
27191 From the minute you drive up everything is "Let me get that for you" and "that is no problem at all". Great service and a very old uptown ambience. Loved it. Plus our room was amazing. 
27192 Large group hotel with unfriendly staff. Staff are extremely busy and every guest is just another number. Hotel has a great location however and rates are very competitive. Rooms are are rather small. 
27193 caro ma bellissimo direi ci siamo divertiti da morire 
27194 The hotel isn's as bad as it used to be. The renovations are a definite improvement, especially considering that this is the same hotel that Tom Hanks' character in the movie "Big" moved into when he first became an adult. 
27195 I've been at the Courtyard Oct 6-8. Friendly receptionists, good size and clean room, location is I-10 and Dairy Ashford, close to many company offices. Good breakfast buffet, good internet access, good price/performance. I've been there several times and I definitelly recommend it. 
27196 Nice people, clean hotel, close to everything by bus or train. Free Parking! 
27197 The location was close to macy's, empire state building, time square...good staff and our room was very quiet. 
27198 My husband and I had wonderful stay at the Sutton Place....great location, fabulous room, great bathrooms...terrific service. Everything you need and want. Would definitely stay here again. 
27199 Its nicely situated a block away from the action. The rooms are clean and bathrooms spacious. Go with price line for a great deal. There are 4 4stars in the loop according to them and 170/night is very fair. 
27200 This hotel is a gem. Reminds me of European hotels- quaint. I especially liked the lounge on the second floor serving coffee & tea all day, continental breakfast in the morning, and wine and cheese in the late afternoon. And the location is just great. 
27201 Excellent location, Clean hotel, Excellent service, Amazing room, 
27202 Dirty sheets and bathroom. If you are going to have white furnishings, dust once in a while. Dark halls and the renovations are not complete. Understaffed. 
27203 Anyone considering this hotel should think very carefully. The walls are filthy, the bath unusable and there are holes in the window frames. Maid service practically non-exsistent. I would not recommend this hotel, there is nothing to recommend. Stay there at your peril!! 
27204 Really good location - didn't eat at the restaurant - close to the metro and food emporium - small bathroom but sufficient. Small kitchenette includes fridge and microwave and sink. Coffee maker but no kettle - no toaster. Reasonable rates. 
27205 Stayed for three weeks. Rooms are small and the in dining options are very limited. Not much to do around this are over the weekend. Better stay in Midtown. AC/heating not very effective. Not worth the money. 
27206 A trip with my parents to see "A Little Night Music". The hotel is very well located for theater. Comfortable and classy. The restaurant was top rate and handled a family dinner of 10 people very well. Would definetely return. 
27207 Sales Manager Debbie Bunn has done a fantastic job providing SIII Baseball Academy's players and family with great rooms, breakfast and rates. Debbie makes setting up room blocks quick and easy. The kids love the big hotel lobby and full service complimentary breakfast! 
27208 I recently stayed in the Hilton Times Square and was extremely satisfied. The staff was extremely helpful; specifically Chad, who helped us get a room perfect for our needs and plan our itinerary in the city. The prime location and pleasant service greatly enhanced our stay in Manhattan. 
27209 Location is excellent, just across from Penn station. Service, everyone very friendly Room, excellent, 2 double beds in room with on-suite and storage, sitting room and kitchen. full 2nd bathroom Price, booked online very reasonable 
27210 Just returned from a great stay at the Hotel indigo, comfortable, fab facilities and great location. 
27211 Tout parait top jusqu'au moment de dormir... les chambres donnent sur les sorties de clim de l'immeuble mitoyen.... Ok pour un premier soir en venant d'Europe (e jet lag garantira le sommeil pour quelques heures) mais surement pas pour quelques jours.... 
27212 We hebben in Novotel overnacht met 2 volwassenen en 2 oudere kinderen. Hotel ligt fantastisch centraal. Vlakbij Times Square. Rockefeller center, 5th avenue en empire state building liggen binnen 15 minuten lopen. Absoluut een aanrader. 
27213 We stay in Marriott Courtyard time square for the weekend and really like this hotel very clean and modern room.. excellent location ..we walk everywhere I thinks this is a great hotel however it is very expensive but NY hotel are all expensive..it is hard to find deals in Ny 
27214 What a wonder experience staying at the Excelsior was. Decor is fabulous, rooms are beautifully appointed staff so obliging, and the location is wonderful. A true New York experience of the best kind 
27215 Sejour de quatre jours dans une chambre executive au dernier etage. Chambre pas tres grande mais decoree et meublee avec soin, tres propre, avec vue sans vis a vis sur Midtown...Service hotelier attentif. L'hotel est tres bien situe, pres de Times Square mais dans une petite rue calme. 
27216 Good value hotel, centrally located, and friendly staff working at the reception. Only annoying thing was that the room got really hot and it was impossible to turn off the heating. Good value for money in NYC. 
27217 Perfect location, beautiful room, friendly and helpful staff. Will definitely stay again! 
27218 For me its the best hotel in NY, i loved it....great view, the best service and location.....everytime that i go to NY, Mandarin its my choice...... 
27219 This hotel is incredible! Awesome view, service was great and the huge TV... Just don't pick anything up that is in the fridge or snack drawer it will automatically be billed to your room. Will deffinately return in the near future. 
27220 Top notch, walk out of your hotel into Times Square. Good service. Nice environment. Pricey but maybe worth it because of location. Top notch, walk out of your hotel into Times Square. Good service. Nice environment. Pricey but maybe worth it because of location. 
27221 The room was very comfortable and larger than the space at comparable hotels. The room was quiet and clean. 
27222 Clean, comfortable. Nothing really special but the location was great, the staff friendly and the rooms clean. Good deal for the price. 
27223 E un posto straordinario.. E un'albergo molto lussuoso.. Pensano a tutti i dettagli.. La colazione e stupenda.. Il servizio e' eccezionale.. La ubicazione e ottima per visita re i negozi sulla Fifth Avenue.. E perfetto per fare un viaggio di sogno a New York....!!!! Abbiamo trascorso tre giorni meravigliosi li.. 
27224 We stayed 3 nights and loved this hotel! The lobby is ultra cool, the rooms are very hip and the beds are comfy. The staff was very helpful and accommodating. You gotta love the location, too, it was close to everything. I would go back any time! 
27225 This is a nice hotel with the modern amenities like free water, coffee/tea, internet and more. The rooms are smaller than average but that is expected in NYC. This is a good choice for a person on a budget. 
27226 We stay in NYC for 3 days and found the location of the hotel very close to subways and steps from many NY attraction. The room was very clean and big. We love this stay and recommend to all. 
27227 The good : walking distance to Soldier Field and cheap cab ride to downtown The not so good: Got double billed...had to wait 5 business days for a refund, hotel staff would not give you a telephone number for delivery food and there was no phone book in the room. 
27228 Great value and great staff! We arrived to a nice surprise - an upgrade to a 2 room suite at no extra charge. 
27229 I want to commend Jocelyn for her great customer service. She works mostly night shifts and is the manager on charge. Whenever there is something wrong she takes ownership of the situation, coordinates with the morning crew, and works quickly to resolve the situation. 
27230 Un ottimo hotel, non grande ma accogliente con tutti i servizi a disposizione. Ottima posizione e personale sempre disponibili e sorridenti. Le camere sono abbastanza grandi e pulite. 
27231 For NYC found the room to be large, comfy and quiet. Especially loved the large bathroom and amazing water pressure in the shower. Great location! 
27232 Excellent location. Great service, especially concierge Roxie. Helped us a lot. 
27233 This hotel is a best value. Clean and Nice. Rooms are small but very clean and designed nicely. A very nice and casual roof top bar to enjoy the Empire State Building vue ! I had a very nice stay there and will recommend it and come back. 
27234 Love the location that this hotel is in. The service is always excellent. The hotel is very clean and comfortable. This is one of my favorite places to stay in NYC. I'm looking forward to coming back. 
27235 Great hotel- offered upgrade on check in. Room very clean, all staff very friendly. Hot breakfast great each morning. 
27236 This hotels deserve all of these compliments! Rooms are a little too small but a small room can only offer this much. Location is just perfect, rooms are clean, staff is unbelievably helpful! Breakfast was great and it was complimentary! l would definitely stay there again and again.. 
27237 Nice large clean room .Friendly staff.Had lots of trouble getting through to the front desk-phone just rang and rang-never answered on 3 occasions.Lots of slamming hotel room doors early am.Dark boring lobby-nothing very exciting for over 400 dollars a night. 
27238 I stay at a W Hotel whenever I am in NYC, whether for business or pleasure. The rooms are small, but well-appointed, with comfortable beds and extravagant linens, and Bliss products in the bath. The staff are excellent, and will do their best to accommodate any request. Location is perfect. 
27239 Close to most of the broadway shows and not far from Penn Station. Have stayed there several times and the employees are very friendly. Prices are very reasonable and they don't charge to store your luggage. 
27240 This hotel only hires happy people who really love what they do! YOU are the beneficiary in every way. I look forward to staying there in the future and I am buying two of their Pacific Cloud down pillows! 
27241 Great place to stay in NYC. location, room, breakfast all top rate. But the best is the staff...all courteous...asking if they could do more, and very polite. Ask for a room on 20+ floor...really quiet 
27242 The hotel has a great location and everything you need available. We arrived at ten in the morning and they allowed us to park early. It was a great value, we will definitely return again! 
27243 Decent room, very happy to have switched from a much worse hotel down the road. Nice lobby, helpful staff. Modern room, nice bar/restaurant. Seemed like a decent location. Overall quite decent. 
27244 Our room here was a mess! Old, stained carpet laid on top of older carpet, rubbish all through the room and under the beds, broken shower, I could go on! We definitely did not have one of the "rennovated" rooms The only good feature is its location. 
27245 Great Location for sightseeing and walking around New York. We stayed here for 4 nights and Staff were v nice and helpful. Rooms not v large, but clean and comfortable. 
27246 Location is perfect for NYC sightseeing, but rooms are not as luxurious as other hotels. In particular, our bed was extremely soft/lumpy. 
27247 Hi really enjoyed my stay at the Crowne Plaza. It is clean, peaceful and personnel is very nice and courteous. The restaurant was also very good, plus there is a good steake house nearby. Great! 
27248 The location of the hotel is perfect. And the staff is kind and professional. Jennifer was particularly helpful (and she thought I wouldn't remember her name). The room was beautiful. No complaints. Would book this hotel again in a heartbeat. 
27249 For a high class hotel, why all the extras? Like having to pay for the internet, 22% tip for a room rental?? 
27250 La situacion del hotel es perfecta con vistas a times square todo te queda cerca, Las habitaciones amplias y limpias, sencillamente genial. 
27251 If you are looking for spacious this hotel is not for you. But it is a great value, with free Wi-Fi and a wonderful free breakfast. Staff very friendly and helpful. Close to Hell's kitchen, and the port authority. 
27252 I have just returned from New York City. and had a wonderful stay at the Comfort Inn Midtown.Staff is very very friendly and helpful for everything you need.Location is wonderful.Rooms are a little bit small but who needs big rooms in NYC???The most important...clean, quite and comfortable.I really recommend! 
27253 Assurdo wifi non compreso per quello che si paga sistema minibar ingannevole se non parli inglese potresti avere problemi colazione non inclusa (event. cara) pagare ancora 1 dollaro x bagaglio in deposito condizionatore troppo rumoroso bagno vecchio 
27254 East gate Tower is in a fantastic location and many of New York's attractions are within easy walking distance. Rooms are a little dated but overall very clean and comfortable. Hotel staff were courteous and friendly. 
27255 Leuk hotel! Ligt centraal: veel op loopafstand. Aardig personeel dat bereid is advies en tips te geven. Als je hotel boekt, misschien slim om kamer op bovenste verdieping te vragen. Vloeren van kamers boven je zijn nogal krakerig en dat best vervelend. 
27256 Nice and clean place. 2 blocks away from subway(1-2-3 lines). Baths are sometimes not clean. But it is because of the people. A classic hostel, do not expect hotel comfort. Rooms are not big, as of any hostel in NYC. 
27257 Le petit dejeuner est compris dans le prix, c`est donc un excellent rapport qualite prix, tres bien situe. Chambres propres , agreables, sanitaires tres propres. je le recommande sans reserve pour une famille. 
27258 Beware of bad business policies. I stayed at the hotel in the very small rooms and terrible staff. I was there on business. The company I was working for was supposed to pay. Instead of billing them they billed me 10 months later!!!!!!! Be careful! 
27259 Had to leave Chicago a day early because someone entered our hotel room and took my purse and my husbands shorts ... we were at this hotel. It seemed a real bother to management to respond to our plight. 
27260 We could not find fault with this hotel, bar the need to update it. It is looking tired and threadbare. Great location and reasonable value for money compared to other new York hotels. clean and comfortable. Staff were friendly and helpful. 
27261 Breakfast at $35 seemed a bit steep; not surprising the room was mostly empty at prime time. Other reviews captured the rest - good location, reasonable rooms, expensive internet, not much personal service - but good functional place to stay. 
27262 Staying here from April 29-may 2. Hotel clean, rooms nice and clean Service no probs Street not best but safe enough (few adult book shops a few doors down with associated people around, but like anywhere in ny lots of police so no issues) 
27263 Right in the heart of downtown Chicago. The hotel is newly renovated and has a nice feel. The rooms are very small, but comfortable. The breakfast was fine and the staff were friendly. I would definately stay here again! 
27264 I've stayed at The Michelangelo a few times and love it. Big comfy beds, great location, elegant interiors. I highly recommend it. 
27265 Good: Timely shuttle to hotel. Breakfast buffet (for a cost). Nice fitness center but crammed. Flat screen TV's in the room. Black out shades. Plenty of free parking Bad: Thin walls and proximity to the runway. Older property, a bit aged. HIghest priced hotel in the area? 
27266 Great hotel if you want to be in the "middle of it all" in Times Square and Theater district. Lots of room for families. 
27267 Friendly and efficient reception staff, they are truly amazing. It's a great value of of money. The staff was very friendly and helpful. They were very willing to assist us in getting around New York City and even drew a map for us. Beautiful hotel and great location! 
27268 Very nice hotel. Busy. We had a corner room overlooking the river. only wish they had free wi=fi in the room. Walking distance to the parks, Michigian Ave....great location for sightseeing. Would definitely stay here again! 
27269 Stayed here five nights, friendly staff, great breakfast, clean and comfortable rooms. 
27270 good location vvery very nery noisy rooms and also quite small beds ok but nos sspace for luggage and clothes topilets ok ,but also noisy rooms near elevators are unaccpetable front office with limited service breakfast ok 
27271 Over priced and poor value. Snooty atmosphere. TV did not work, safe did not function. Treats in room past date and stale. 
27272 This place has the best location for the price in New York City. Very conviently located, lavish room, friendly staff. I would stay here again. 
27273 This hotel is old. The carpets, walls, everything, looks old. Most annoying thing is the airconditioning fan. The fan turns on and off throughout the night, and it is very noisy. It woke me up each time. Hi-speed internet was not free when I stayed. 
27274 I arrived at the hotel on 17.12.2010 evening and we were very badly treated by reception staff. I did not like the reception and treatment they give to customers. Definitely do not recommend this hotel to anyone! The location is good. 
27275 This was an amazing hotel. The girl at the front desk got us a high room so we had an unbelievable view of the park! Everyone was friendly and helpful and the location of this hotel was awesome. It was the highlight of our trip to NYC. 
27276 We didn't stay much in the hotel just a few hours, but the location is really excellent (5-10 min walk to Timesquare), the rooms were nice, quiet and clean, complimentary breakfast was really nice and all rooms had free wifi 
27277 Great rooms, great beds, great location. And great staff (Carl, in particular, was very helpful in getting us in and out), but thanks to all. 
27278 This hotel appears to have been updated and the rooms were very nice. Very quiet hotel, hotel staff was very pleasant and helpful. The hostess who watched over us at breakfast was one of the best anywhere! She was extraordinary. 
27279 When I went to check in there was no reservation for me. I had the confirmation number but was told that they had no rooms left. Try finding a room in New York on short notice. It cost me an extra $300. Thanks a bunch 
27280 Club Quarters in midtown NY is in a perfect location..It is quiet and quaint. The elevator and room space is small but the quietness of the room makes up for all that..I would definitely stay here again. 
27281 Ik heb in een helemaal ronde hotelkamer overnacht met 4 ramen rondom. Met een fantastisch uitzicht. De mooiste hotelkamer die ik in New York heb gevonden! De badkamer was mini, maar de kamer was helemaal geweldig! 
27282 First off this is an awesome hotel! Great rooms, easy access to all terminals, and all the Hilton amenities.They made my stay very comfortable, and were very courteous. I highly reccomend this hotel, whenever your traveling through Chicago O'Hare and require a overnight. 
27283 Nice, quiet, and clean. I had a really nice room / suite. They are small, but very cozy and well kept. I would recommend this if staying in Houston. 
27284 Staying at this hotel was the best choice for a weekend getaway in NYC Great location, fantastic staff - extremely friendly and helpful quite affordable while remaining chic and trendy rooms are clean, spacious and the beds are comfortable definitely a must return 
27285 Awesome hotel. I came in last minute and found this hotel. Very easy to check in, very friendly valet, doorman, and front desk receptionist. The hotel seems brand new, so the room was very clean and well designed! 
27286 The air conditioning was broken and I stayed there in the middle of recent heat wave. I would expect free water or even offer to move to another hotel in NYC but they did not really bother. Plus the place is very very noisy! 
27287 Very nice hotel and great location to everything! Close to subway and theatre district. Highlyrecommend! 
27288 evening we had a beautiful hotel and very pleased with the services of our hotel will be transported back here one day last 
27289 Not a good location at night! Rooms to small!! To expensive for what you get!!! 
27290 Such a breathe of fresh air in such a big city~a boutique hotel so conveniently located in the heart of the Gold Coast area within walking distance of great restraunts & theaters...will stay there next time we visit Chicago! 
27291 I am just here for a fun few days wih my athletic dad, and it is great! You can walk to anywhere from here, and it is has a very convientent Metro station extremely close by! Staff is great, style is cool, definetely a must! :) 
27292 My boyfriend took me away to New York for a romantic weekend and it was fantastic! The hotel was great, the staff extremely friendly and it just made for a great weekend. Now we know where we will stay next time we are in the Big Apple! 
27293 The staff was very nice. The room and bathroom were clean. The room was small but bigger than my last Paris hotel room. The price and location were great. I would return. 
27294 Perfectly located with great views, it is the best experience in NY (Have tried 20 hotels). The reception staff is efficient, personal and friendly. The room was perfect, nicely decorated, perfect temperature, perfect bathroom, perfect room service, charming atmosphere. 
27295 A four day trip to New York was greatly enjoyed with thanks to the staff at this hotel! Very close to the subway, walking distance to Macy's and fifth avenue. Hotel has well stocked bar, comfortable rooms and a good restaurant. 
27296 Concierge will get you anywhere you need to be and the service is second to none 
27297 Ideal location for family trip. Easy walking to mag mile, water tower, navy pier. Garretts popcorn right next door. 
27298 Ottima posizione vicino la 5th Avenue. Metropolitana vicina per raggiungere downtown, Harlem, Brooklin. Chiedete i piani alti (noi al terzo eravamo davanti alle macchine del condizionamento che non sono proprie silenziose!! 
27299 We stayed at the roosevelt hotel on 02/12 for 1 week ideal place to stay for getting about close to all sightseeing attractions ,hotel staff very nice and helpful rooms clean maid service first class. 
27300 Third time I stay there, first with my kids, a two year old and a four year old. Staff was very firendly. Got a fishbowl in the room. Concierge got us a babysitter. Overall, a great stay. Will return. 
27301 Our suite was well appointed, with a spectacular view from the balcony. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Enjoyed breakfast in Peacock Alley. Provided a fun, elegant and relaxing 2 day vacation, with exceptional surroundings and service. 
27302 I highly recommend this hotel if you are on a budget. Bunk beds served us fine. TV for each bunk. Tiny room but it was all we needed. Great location, friendly staff. Clean. Beautiful terrace on the roof. Coffee and orange juice in the morning. Fantastic!! 
27303 would always choose this hotel again. the location was great, near to times square. you have a good view from the hotel bar to times square. the hotelstaff was always friendly and the hotel was very clean. 
27304 The hotel location was brilliant. The staff were friendly and helpful especially Mohammad at the front desk. 
27305 I stayed for 7 nights with my two children aged 6 and 8. I had a luxury king which was a great size and very clean. We had everything we needed. All the staff were great and helpful. I loved the location, very easy to get around and very safe. 
27306 The staff is not so friendly and all rooms have shared bathrooms. Around two for floors. The rooms have free lockers inside. 
27307 Hotel perfetto per visitare NY a 2 passi da Central Park r a 3 passi da Times Square. Di fornte il locale migliore dove fare colazione, in vero stile NYchese...... (evitate quella dell hotel) Pulito camere grandi e letti divini....... 
27308 Hotel has good location, room very comfortable,bad points breakfast and number of lifts available for the number of rooms. 
27309 With all of the commotion in NYC at holiday time, it's wonderful to know there are still hotels to be found with this level of charm and comfort AND reaonable rates! I'd stay again in an instant! 
27310 We bid on a room through Priceline and received a very small room, but it had everything we needed for one night. Better not to be overlooking the construction site, since it's 24 hours of noise. Service was very good. 
27311 The staff was extremely helpful and they were always cheerful. A special thanks to Sheila who went out of her way to make sure that everything was perfect. I couldn't have asked for a better weekend. I would strongly recommend this La Quinta. 
27312 The location is great, hence the cost The rest of it is barely average Two good restaurants attached and a nice lobby bar 
27313 Hotel was great. Staff was nice. Even the housekeeping went out of their way to converse with us. Great location. Walking distance to most everything. Only downside was the pool was a bit small and shallow. Not really a big deal though. 
27314 Location is great, right in center city, easy access to everything. Rooms were very clean, and attractive although small, was still very comfortable. Quiet room and the staff was very attentive, helpful and friendly. I'd highly recommend this hotel. 
27315 Stayed at Hotel Sorella recently for conference. Excellent facilities, room nice and large, good shower. Continental breakfast was excellent with best fresh fruit ever!. City centre area really nice to walk around with plenty of restaurants and shops. Free covered parking. Very helpful and friendly staff. 
27316 Stayed at the Garden Inn for 6 nights. Staff was friendly & efficient. Room pleasant, clean an well equipped. Stayed on 15th floor, no noise. Price was right and considering the position saved on cabs. Nice breakfast facility at Pigalle. Highly recommened. 
27317 Staying there for one evening during our last trip to NYC. Noise level was superb. Rooms were large and staff was absolutely fantastic. Would highly recommend it. Used to stay for business, and it certainly didn't disappoint this time around either. 
27318 Vorig jaar MEI 2011 1 nacht verbleven in dit hotel met een perfecte ligging nabij Times Square en op loopafstand van talrijke bezienswaardigheden. Kamers beetje verouderd maar proper. Prijs kwaliteits verhouding is goed. Rechtover hotel een goed italiaans restaurant Osteria al doge,aan te bevelen zowel voor lunch als avondmaal. 
27319 Super small rooms, but they are clean and super cozy. The beds are comfy - which is the main thing, right? Who stays in their rooms in NYC but to sleep? Friendly, efficient staff. Great bar in the lobby. I think it might be my favorite W in NYC. 
27320 Hotel is paired with a Marriott Residence Inn (shared lobbies). Big pleasant public areas. Nice room with small kitchen area, flat screen tv, all new. Free no frills breakfast. Great location. Good value for business, nice views. 
27321 Old not very clean bathrooms 
27322 Would not stay there again. 
27323 we have stayed at this hotel several times but this is the first time since it has been renamed the Avenue. The room was updated and bed was comfortable. The location of this hotel is excellent.....right on the Mile for shopping and walking. We will definitely be staying here again. 
27324 old fashioned hotel,but with some unique features,central to most tourist attractions,Madison square gardens and Empire state building for example. 
27325 I have to say that this hotel is terrible!!!!!! the bathroom is dirty, old, awful. 
27326 Not in the best location, and no room service after 11. The lobby is pretty, and the rooms are nice. 
27327 When I visited this Hotel for the first time, I was surprized to see it. Such a big Hotel!!! I live this Hoel and then the room service and everything is really superb. Must stay in this Hotel once if you make a plan to NY. 
27328 Ottima posizione, personale gentile e disponibile, bella la struttura. Siamo stati qua per i primi 5 giorni del nostro viaggio di nozze e ci siamo trovati davvero bene. La nostra camera era pulita, ampia e silenziosa. Consigliato. 
27329 This is a small quiet upper east side hotel 
27330 It is close to a subway stop, and with in 2 blocks of several great resturants 
27331 The staff , including the desk people were very friendly 
27332 The room is quite large for NY style .The bath room/shower is VERY large 
27333 Affordable luxury in a modern hotel, with style but still comfortable. The lobby is like a disco, the rooms are well equipped and clean. Superb location in Times Square near everything. 
27334 Permitiram early checkin e me disponibilizaram 2bed twins. Quarto espacoso, nao pude avaliar limpeza pois fiquei apenas uma noite. Internet e cobrada tanto no quarto comk no hall, ridiculo para uma diaria tao cara. 
27335 I have stayed here a couple of times and have never failed in its service delivery. comfortable room in the heart of the city, close to central park and yellow and blue line for easy exit to JFK. 
27336 The Salisbury fit well into our budget, the location was wonderful..close to Central Park and easy walking distance to Times Square. Good places to eat close by. The hotel was clean and rooms were fine. We felt comfortable with the hotel, I would stay there again. 
27337 Nice little hotel, regular rooms are small, I had a superior room on ground floor which was nice, clean and roomy. The elevators are extremely small. Rooms are dark, need more lights. 
27338 The hotel is among the best hotels i have stayed on and the location is right on Times Square, which makes you stay where it all happens. 
27339 Amazing location. Right snap in the middle - close by Grand Central Station, Rockerfeller, Koreatown, etc... Staff was friendly and very accomodating. Stayed 10 nights and no dramas at all. Will be back real soon. 
27340 Stunning hotel with "Bliss"ful bathrooms!!!! glamourus bar but shame about some of the views. Great Location. 
27341 This is a great little hotel with a contemporary flair. The staff were very friendly and the doorman remembered my name for the length of my stay. I would highly recommend it. 
27342 The hotel is so conveniently located to the magnificent shoppings along Michigan Ave. Interior decor of the hotel is so luxurious and elegant. Service is excellent. I will defintely stay in Rafaello whenever I have to be in Chicago. 
27343 Couldn't have been located in a better spot. Close to shopping and subway. Rooms were very clean and service was excellent. 
27344 Stayed 5 days: half business, half vacation. Virtually part of Grand Central Station, easy walk to Times Square. Excellent service, NONE of the reputed "New York Atitude" everyone talks about. Not cheap, but made a great experience for us. John. 
27345 Enjoyed usual Marriott refinements all good. Had a shopping visit before back to Boston. Would return as a good base 
27346 Fabulous room with view over the cathedral. The service was outstanding and he rooms spotless. Cannot find fault with anything, the beds were the best nights sleep I have ever had 
27347 excellent location, great view of empire state building from the roof top terrace!!! our room was very clean and the breakfast excellent!!! although there isn't enough room in the dinning area to accommodate the guests for breakfast. 
27348 We visited in 2009 for Our anniversary and truly feel the hotel couldn't have been any better! An amazing location close to pretty much everything! Rooms are small but your says will be spent out and about so it's no big issue! Enjoy! 
27349 Very nice room, quite large, good workspace, on the Hilton Honors floor. Very nice & friendly staff. Excellent breakfast buffet. 
27350 Good location. Not noticeably dirty. Friendly service. Good size room. Nice quality buffet breakfast but not cheap. 
27351 The rooms were very nice, clean and quiet. We stayed here to see the Houston Air Show and this hotel was pretty close without being on the main highway. There was a small bump in the road, however the management made good on it and all is well. 
27352 This was my first trip to New York. The hotel was in the perfect location for my convention. The staff was courteous and took care of my every need. I will stay there again! 
27353 My brother and I always book this hotel in THE VILLAGE. it is absolutely charming. The old elevators; nice restaurant. It is close to the BLUE NOTE if you like to hear great (world.class) jazz. No mindless high rise for me, thanks. Enjoy! 
27354 I went to this hotel with my best mate ms22mm and have to second everything she has said. If you want a hotel which is close to everything with everything you'll need for a stay in NYC, then this hotel is for you. Loved it! 
27355 I stayed here for 3 nights. Amazing hotel. The staff and the amenities were great & the bed was so comfortable that I didn't want to go home. 
27356 I was very impress with the room size and how quiet they were. The stay was great and the service was very good. I can't wait until my next trip so I can enjoy the spa. 
27357 The room we had was small, with only one chair, so someone had to sit on bed. Breakfast was the worst we have ever had away for home. All together we made a bad choise of hotel. But it is situated in interesting area. 
27358 Excellent hotel with great staff. Totally lived up to expectations. 
27359 The service was excellent and the hotel was great. Enjoyed my short stay there and wished I had stayed longer. 
27360 Welcoming reception area with good staff and ground floor bar. Not on, but short distance from MM. Good size well appointed rooms. Did not eat in the restaurant as many options nearby. 
27361 As other reviews have stated the rooms are small but how much time do you want to spend in a hotel room. The staff were friendly and helpful without being intrusive. 
27362 the rooms are very nice and clean its quiet at night just wish i could get a higher level room to really get to use the balcony to bad you look at a freeway 
27363 Four of us in our party - 2 adults and 2 teenagers - the King Suite was perfect size and brilliant for NYC. Great space, great location, friendly staff, couldn't ask for more. Worth paying a little more for the suite, as it offers so much more space. 
27364 Great hotel and even better location! Great for shopping and experiencing New York City. Totally recommend it. 
27365 lindo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
27366 Great location and value for a weekend stay. The room was fairly typical size for NY. However, very modern bath and room accessories. The staff was very friendly. I would definately consider a return visit to this hotel. 
27367 Ho soggiornato in questo albergo una settimana. La posizione e' strategica, vicinissimo TIMES SQUARE. Per il resto, struttura che ha bisogno di interventi di ristrutturazione: moquette sporca nelle parti comuni, camera( situata all'ultimo piano) non all'altezza del prezzo pagato, per non parlare del bagno......nota positiva lo staff, cordiale e disponibile. 
27368 Bien situado y suficiente para poder ducharse y dormir. 
27369 Voor New York begrippen een heel net maar toch heel betaalbaar hotel (mits bij expedia of dergelijke geboekt) De ligging aan 7th av. is geweldig, loopafstand van times square, 5th av.en central park. Metro stations pal naast het hotel! 
27370 En pleno Times Square. Preciso. Cerca un buen "luncheador" y a tiro de piedra Broadway. 
27371 Erg leuk hotel, maar je moet geen 5 sterren kwaliteit verwachten. Personeel is erg vriendelijk, kamers zijn schoon maar erg sober. Maar je zit nog geen minuut van Times Square dus wat doe je op de kamer :D 
27372 Had a lovely business trip -- staff was very friendly and helpful with reservations. Even though very wealthy part of town, felt warm reception adn would love to return. 
27373 The staff is always focused on taking care of it's clients. We had a meeting at this location for two days and the food was better than anticipated. I'm sure we will be back in the near future!! 
27374 Conveniently on I-10. The friendliest staffs ever. Love the layout. Breakfast selection was awesome. Helpful and friendly staffs. Reasonable rate. Clean and roomy room. The only draw back was we checked in on July 13th and our room was 1308. Yes, this hotel has the 13th floor. 
27375 Rooms are slightly outdated (we were in the older unrenovated section), but the hotel atmosphere and the location are fantastic. Will definitely stay here again. (But I'd skip the brunch buffet....way better places for less close by). 
27376 Large room for the a value hotel in New York. Staff was always helpful and patient with directions. Rooms was well-maintained and clean. 
27377 Great hotell for business trips in Houston. Located in ciytcentra, with lots of resturants close by. At times difficult to get parking due to the are is starting to be more popular. 
27378 I got a nice Kingsize Bed which was really cosy. one negative topic is the soud of the metro next to the hotel, or the noise of shjowering people from the level above or below 
27379 Stained curtains, carpet, bed skirt Linens terrible Toilet broken Air Conditioning barely worked Elevator was broken most the time Staff un helpful, inefficient...actually..useless 
27380 Grand Union is een perfecte locatie vlakbij Emp.state building en Fifth av, metro op de hoek van de straat. Hotel is schoon en erg vriendelijk personeel, ontbijt mogelijkheid bij Silo (goede prijs).Een aanrader dus, voor ons zeker, als we nog `s terug gaan. 
27381 We stay for 2 nights and it was awesome. Everyone in the hotel makes your stay even better. We came with friends and we both were pleased with the room and service. 
27382 Great lobby, great location. Good rates. Get a suite if you can. Great response from maintenance and housekeeping for things we needed like an extension cord and more towels. Right across the street from Grand Central. I would stay there again as long as we had a suite. 
27383 Wonderful boutique hotel located next to Times Square. Subway is two blocks away to all of Manhattan. Numerous classic eateries within walking distance. Bathrooms are ideal with Japanese heated cleansing toilettes. 
27384 the front desk staff and room attendants are very friendly and helpful. the rooms were clean and comfortable. my stay at sun suites was a good one. would recommend to other travelers. location was good close to several restaruants. access to interstate was convient also 
27385 Great clean hotel, that has complimentary parking, and has 2 bed handicapped rooms with roll in showesr, which is not easy to find in other hotels. We stayed there numerous times and will return next time we will go to Houston. 
27386 good location, fair price, clean, good service - all we need from an hotel when we are looking for a place just to sleep in at night 
27387 Greeted with a bigot at check in. Room was way to hot in the winter. Had to have window wide open. Way too much noise on the street. Heard other guests complain about room too cold. Will never stay there again. 
27388 Nice Hotel for the price,nice clean rooms. Convenient shuttle to get to the airport and ride the train to the city. 
27389 Nothing wrong with it really, but not too good either. Rooms are small, location is very good, restaurant is poor, bar is nice but also not the nicest and staff is friendly. And that's it. Nothing more nothing less. 
27390 I booked this for my wife and daughter, who are quite picky about hotels. They loved the place, the location, and the staff 
27391 The rooms were big by New York standards and the price was reasonable. They would definitely pick it for a return. 
27392 I was very pleased with this hotel although the Front Desk Staff could show more friendly service. 
27393 Just got done with a long stay at this hotel. It checks all the boxes, clean enough, rooms not bad, good shuttle service. Best bits are free parking and superb service from ALL members of staff. I would gladly stay again 
27394 Hotel muy limpio, muy bien situado al lado de Time Square y cerca de parada del metro. Con spa y sauna gratis. Desayuno muy rico y variado y abundante 
27395 Excellent location, very close to Times Square. Really nice, modern, clean room (a bit on the small side by general american standards, but on the other hand I've sometimes stayed in much smaller rooms in New York City). Great service! Great deal, highly recommended!! 
27396 Location is excellent and so is the service but a little pricey so plan you trip accordingly. 
27397 I never acually stayed..I had original reservations but canceled way in advance due to a illness .Surprise it was on my credit card statement. I called and after much "research" they agreed I was well within cancellation status. and refunded my room..yea..hopefully get to stay in the future though 
27398 Missed some connections and found this to be far better than most that airlines provide to domestic travelers. Comfortable room and bed. Very clean, friendly service. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise for this level of hotel. 
27399 This was a great location for us to get around on foot to site and shows. We had an awsome time running in the city with our kids for a few days. 
27400 Great location, great prices. Rooms bigger than expected, friendly staff. Easy walk to Subway, theatre, and Times Square. Liked the coffee maker, mini fridge and laundry facilities. Stayed at several "big" hotels in the City- this is by far my favorite. 
27401 Very tidy rooms and a reasonable size. Good location with nice foyer. Slowish lifts. Simple exercise room 
27402 Excellent value for the money. Relatively (!) quiet street very near Times Square. Helpful staff and pleasant and nicely sized room. Much nicer than your average Comfort Inn. 
27403 O hotel e limpo , confortavel, o atendimento na recepcao e otimo, a localizacao e boa , perto de estacao de metro. proximo ao central Park, tem supermercado otimo , bem proximo, O elevador muito pequeno. A diaria um pouco cara. Casal, com filhos adultos -Brasil 
27404 Hotel was just perfect for what we wanted.....close to everything, very clean, large room and the staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to stay there again! 
27405 Reservation was made without incedent. Check-in experience was effecient and the clerk very helpful and professional. Our room was more than expected however, the bathroom needs more cabinet\shelf space. Check-out experience was expeditious and overall stay was very good for the price paid for our room. 
27406 Just stayed at Hilton Times square again and it was fantastic. Great location and great service and ammenities. 
27407 I had a wonderful two night stay. The bed was amazing better than my one at home. The room was small but big enough for the two of us. It a was clean, convenient and friendly place to stay. 
27408 Great service, very comfortable bed, quiet, nice room. We would stay here again next time we're in Manhattan. Location on Fifth Avenue puts this hotel in a very nice neighborhood. The restaurant also has real breakfast on weekends, not a pretentious brunch. 
27409 A fantastic hotel in a central location. My partner took me here to see NYC and it was just perfect. Large rooms, beautiful entrance and right near all the sites. 
27410 Good place for young couples.....bar/resturants ....great muffins in the morning! The area is not the best....althought it's very central...so it's easy to get around! Try the sushi ... It's quite good! 
27411 I stayed at the Gansevoort in August with my wife and another couple. We had a blast. Beautiful rooms and great service. We really enjoyed the area with all the great restaurants at the doorstep. We will definately return. 
27412 Great Place, Great location, Safe requied W Key after 10 PM room was clean staff was great. 
27413 Our stay was very good. The front desk staff made our stay very enjoyable especial mention to juicy fruit. I wont forget her name. You know why. This hotel is very near Times Square. For, us it was always the best time of the year to visit New York City 
27414 Our room looks like it was last decorated over twenty years ago. There are far better and cheaper places to stay in the city. I would never recommend this hotel. 
27415 Great base with good location and specious rooms for New York. Check in was kind of slow but very welcoming. This is a good hotel for what we paid. 
27416 New York was a lovely city and we all enjoyed the trip aged between 21 and 58. We would recommend it to our friends. 
27417 Great location, friendly, helpful staff, and clean, comfortable rooms. What more do you want! Our room (#72) was recently renovated and quite large compared to other reviewers. 
27418 I got a fabulous deal on their website. Hotel is good value and convenient location. I had a good time, wonder why there are so many negative reviews about it. 
27419 Een niet al te duur hotel en nee het is niet modern maar nostalgies maar het is goed, schoon en netjes. Metro is om de hoek, central park de deur uit en 3 straten lopen. Verwacht niet te veel het is netjes en voor dat geld erg goed. 
27420 Super, super staff. When we arrived at 8:15 A.M., tired after a night on the plane, they immediately managed to have a room available for us. So happy with that! The hotel has an outdoor pool, which is rare among reasonably priced hotels in Manhattan. Location is also fine. 
27421 This was a great hotel, never seen such big rooms in Manhattan. The service was great and the rooms felt really fresh...free wi-fi was a huge added advantage. Location is great with easy access to Hells Kitchen, Columbus circle. In good weather, one could even walk to Times Square. 
27422 Loved it. Loved it. Loved it. First class all the way. Loved taking in the history of the place and all the old photographs on the walls. Just loved it. Do it at least once in your life - after all, it is the Waldorf! 
27423 This was a quick small vacation, just to get away. This is a great place for a good price. It is somewhat far from uptown but close to the ferry for the statue of liberty & ellis island. I recommend this place. 
27424 Despite the fact that it's a hostel and not a hotel, I could have done without the cockroaches and the previous tenant's hair on my pillow cases. I can't recommend this place even though it's very affordable. I've heard good things about the YMCA, so I'll try that next time. 
27425 Very convenient location, nice clean modern room. Free internet. People were friendly and helpful. It worked well for my 3 day stay. The bed was very comfortable! Good value when you compare to other properties. 
27426 My girlfriends and I were in town and we booked the Exclusively Feminine package. Everything we needed was included and everyone took really good care of us. We will definitely be back. 
27427 "The hotel staff are grim and they were not very welcoming"......I agree!!! I will give them 5 point.....if they were friendly!!!! 
27428 My husband and I stayed here over the Easter weekend. We got moved from the Westin to this hotel and we were very impressed. The hotel was very clean and the locatios is great. It is close to Times Square and Broadway. i highly recommend this hotel. 
27429 Nice room, friendly service and inexpensive parking...what more can you ask for in the Big City! 
27430 Bed bugs!! Bed bugs!! Bed bugs!! Bed bugs!! Bed bugs!! Bed bugs!! Bed bugs!! Bed Bugs!! Bed bugs!! Bed bugs!! 
27431 Perhaps the weakest appetizers for cocktails in the Club lounge for Hilton Honors I've ever been to. No hot food, just cheese, crackers and vegetable crudites and dip. Continental Breakfast however was average. 
27432 I stay at this Wingate every 4 - 6 weeks. The staff treat me like (actually, better than) my family. My work is stressful and I am able to relax and recover from difficult days in this quiet hotel. 
27433 Exceptional value, clean, clean, clean. Right between 49th and 48th streets on 8th Avenue. 2 blocks to Times Square, 3 blocks to Rockafeller Center; 1 block to Red or Blue lines. Great restaurants in the immediate area. Favorites are Carmine's and Del Frisco's. 
27434 A New York ci ritornei anche domani e per sempre! Per L'Hotel: ottiima la location; si raggiungono facilmente tutte le maggiori attrazioni di New York. 
27435 Was there for a conference. The hotel has perfect location for organizing small meetings. The staff was professional. The main advantage is in value for money. The price is quite reasonable (apart from parking) for the amenities. 
27436 this hotel is really cool. the music is really nice, the staff is very helpful. they have the best muffins served at breakfast! the cabins are clean, and the beds are comfy. i'd stay here again! 
27437 Strongly recommend -- fine staff, comfortable room (double), good location. 
27438 Great hotel, with a large room ,a small but clean bathroom, with Aveno products. The service was wonderful and a always smilling staff. Perfect location with supermarket and drugstore nearby. 
27439 Just love this hotel. Great staff , reasonable prices ( for New York), great location and gorgeous newly decorated rooms. Lovely fresh interior design which is quite funky. The Affinia Manhattan will always be my hotel of choice in Manhattan. 
27440 Normally stay at one of the Starwood properties in Times Square for work, but both were sold out. Renaissance at the northern tip of Times Sq...however still in the middle of the hustle and bustle (both good and bad). Nice rooms, nothing overly memorable, but a solid choice nonetheless. 
27441 As others have said, great location but also great staff, particularly the concierge staff who can't enough for you. We had a 'no ask' upgrade to a suite and this is now our hotel of choice in New York, whether we get upgraded or not ! 
27442 My family and I just spent 3 nights at the Chelsea hampton. The rooms are samll but very clean. The staff is very nice. The location is excellent. Breakfast included is an added bonus. 
27443 We were very pleased with our accomodations. Having stayed in other New York hotels, we were pleasantly surprised by the attentive staff, clean rooms, and decent size rooms. We will definately be back! Overall, a great experience! 
27444 Great hotel, good service. Enjoyed my stay, clean. Friendly staff etc. The fitness is a little small, but well equiped. Wifi only one or three day package, which is disappointing. Breakfast ok, overly concerned staff, too often distrurbed during our conversation over breakfast 
27445 Everyone was very accomodating to us and our dog. We will definitely stay there again. They couldn't be more helpful. The only thing I might change was the riduculous price for coffee and bluberries(just a bowl) in the morning. We were on a special diet and that cost $30...was obscene. 
27446 We stayed for 6 nights and had a great stay. The staff was very responsive and courteous. Room was large for NYC and very clean. Hotel is in great location near Little Italy and Chinatown. Also very close to the Canal and Spring St subway stations. 
27447 We spent 3 nights at the hotel. Our stay was flawless. The room was big and had an amazing view of the St. Patrick Cathedral. The service was perfect and the staff was eager to help at all times. Would definitely stay there again! 
27448 Great spot, great views, rooms are too small and price is too expensive. 
27449 Thanks Staff and Daniela.... Alfredo M. Frontera 
27450 From the minute we stepped out of the cab we had a first class experience at this beautiful gem in Chicago. Everything was great from the friendly, helpful staff to the well appointed rooms and amenities. Would recommend highly! 
27451 The atmosphere of this hotel is absolutely incredible. The hotel epitomizes class and luxuriousness. They are always at the top of their game to make anything you dream come true. It is truly an experience that everyone needs to experience at least once in their life. 
27452 Great hotel - not modern but clean and friendly. Stayed in a 1 bedroom suite, and was perfect location for our needs. Easy walk to subway, central park, and museum of moder history. 
27453 These suites are very well located in Murray Hill neighborhood. We had the best room in the hotel, the only one with a terrace. Very comfortable. Service was good overall. 
27454 Easy check in-great location-clean-key pad gated entry-had an awesome time.-would stay again 
27455 I wouldn't go back. The rooms were tacky- horrible decorations and I found the staff at Olicia and some in the hotel very snobby. 
27456 By NY standard a good sized room and bathroom nice and modern. Staff could try harder I found them some what distant and not overly helpfull or friendly! 
27457 Spent the weekend there with another couple and we all were pleasantly surprised. Everything about the place is great--the comfortable bed, the surprisingly well-stocked breakfast buffet, the rate, the location. Cannot beat it, and we have stayed many places (Novotel, Sheraton, Marriott Marquis) 
27458 Location is awesome, service does not exist, breakfast was crazy at the marketplace. I will never stay here again, too bad because I did love the location, but waiting 10 minutes for an elevator is not fun every time you need one. 
27459 For the money just a great place to stay Staff very helpful. 
27460 nice clean rooms great location efficient staff reasonable breakfast 
27461 it just goes to show that its not always the bricks and mortar, but the people. Very nice staff through-out. Every housekeeper I passed and more said hello and asked how I was doing. Very nice! Restaurant was very good too. 
27462 Great midtown location obviously, close to evrything. But the hotel itself is big and standard. No personal touch. Nothing special about it. Breakfast at the Marketplace is very expensive ($37) , go outside and eat at one of the dinners. 
27463 Very nice hotel and great staff. Rooms were a little small, but it is New York and the location was great. Very good deal for the location. Will look into this again for my next visit to the city. 
27464 Nice location, confortable and clean rooms, good concierge's advises. Internet overpriced and very slowly. 
27465 Heel mooi hotel, niet te duur, proper, voorzien van tv, ontbijt inbegrepen en heel goeie service, allemaal in Chinatown in het centrum van Manhattan! 
27466 Spent a few days in the hotel with my wife and daughter. Was upgraded to the highest floor suite. All of us enjoyed staying there. Cannot complain about any issue. The location is a walking distance from the theaters and a short cab ride to the most museums. Highly recommended. 
27467 I stayed at The Chatwal in NYC recently, and I highly recommend this hotel. The rooms are immaculately clean, the beds are very comfortable, the location is excelent, and the service is great. Enjoy it!!! 
27468 Clean, reasonable price. Great service. In the middle of action. Great choice. 
27469 o quarto e muito bom, tem dois condicionadores de ar em cada quarto, um central e um local. o atendimento do hotel tb e muito bom. precisa melhorar o cafe da manha e colocar um exaustor de ar no banheiro 
27470 le indicazioni sulla posizione traggono in inganno.Le camere standard sono allucinanti per non parlare dei bagni,le dimensioni sono per lillipuziani.Parti comuni sporche e vecchie come la moquette e le porte delle "camere".Aria condizionata rumorosissima.Costosissimo.L'ostello in confronto una reggia. 
27471 albergo rinnovato, camere spaziose per lo standard di new york, prima colazione abbindante e compresa nel prezzo, gentilezza del personale, connessione interent gratis ,ottima posizione in quanto ha tutte le linee del metro vicine,zona tranquillissima si puo' tornare di notte senza problemi 
27472 Stayed for one night on a weekend. Front desk staff was warm, accomodating and efficient. 
27473 I don't walk very far, so I was worried about distances, but this hotel is central to everything. Rooms are spacious, and perfect if you have to do some work. Bedroom is seperated from living area and wetbar. 
27474 Personale gentilissimo ed efficiente. la camera era sufficientemente spaziosa ed il letto comodissimo (avevo scelto un king size), con vista sull'Empire State Building. Silenzioso. Il ristorante (Rare) molto valido. Ci tornerei. 
27475 Comfortable lobby. Great place to sit down and rest. Arranged for refrigerator in room. Hotel tried to meet all requests. Very pleasant place to stay. 
27476 Very good rooms, clean and confortable! Great location and helpfull staff. 
27477 Though room was small, it was very clean and nicely furnished. The hotel had a very euro feel. It was definitely nice to be across from Central Park. The staff was friendly and courteous. Would definitely stay there again. 
27478 This is a great new hotel right in midtown Manhattan. Had the pleasure of staying here for three nights in late October and I can't say enough good things about it. Impeccably clean, comfortable rooms, attentive staff and a real good bar/ restaurant. 
27479 Centrally located for travel to-from Penn Station. Small kitchen handy for self catering breakfast and pricey shop nearby for fruits etc. Fire brigade next door could wake you up every night! Also very central for walking to all major attractions such as Central park, Macey's, Times Square etc.. 
27480 Desk clerk made you feel you were doing her a favor by staying there. Coffee cup had a lipstick stain on it. Sheet clean but with cigarette holes in it. 
27481 From start to finish our stay was for lack of a better word, incredible. The design, location and especially the staff made our stay faultless. We will definitely be back. 
27482 Our recent stay at the W Times Square, was an absolute delight. It was fun, hip and exciting. The rooms were extremely quiet even though we were smack dab in the middle of all the Times Square activity! i was blown away by how fast room service was! 
27483 Nice hotel, updated rooms thought small, ours had a decent view of the Empire State. Only two lifts (elevators!) so very busy, could take 10 minutes toget down. Nice staff, quick and efficient check in and out. Quiter area, need to walk to busier areas, but like all NYC safe. 
27484 Close to all Broadway shows, close to a fabulous deli, close to the subway. Walking distance to great restaurants. Service and rooms are wonderful. Best deal for NYC. 
27485 Great location on north end of Michigan ave. Comfortable room, basic amenities. Excellent restaurant - food, wine, service. Typical big city rates. 
27486 This was my first time at the Marcel and I will be returning this week. The staff was very friendly and I had a large comfortable room. Great view of the empire state building... The bed was very comfortable and they have nice plush robes. 
27487 Great, great hotel! Great employees, great spirit - I would recommend to everyone to stay at the Westin in Houston or any other Westin when they have the chance. 
27488 Charmingly old fashioned with very friendly staff. I will definitely stay there on my next trip to NYC. 
27489 Quiet room in a smaller hotel, a few blocks from Grand Central. Caters to Japanese travelers, but certainly comfort for all. I stay here each year. 
27490 Greeting staff not friendly at all. The hardest beds EVER. The worst Air Conditioning system EVER. Smell from carpet (maybe new) overwhelming. The bathrooms are designed horribly. Even the reception on the TV leaves a lot to be desired. No room service or bar. HUGELY overpriced for what you get. 
27491 I've stayed there and appreciate the walking distance to everything/ the classic antiquity of it. I have letters written by Father-in-law when he stayed there which are on this marvelous old stationery with a CLASSIC LETTERHEAD logo featuring Samuel Clements' photo done in half-tone dot patterns. I'll include it here: 
27492 Stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in January .it is a nice clean hotel.friendly efficient staff ,rooms are smallish but all rooms I have stayed in NYC are small. 
27493 the hotel was in very good location near grand central the room was very nice and we had a real nice vacation 
27494 This is a very nice place to stay if you are going to New York. The rooms are a little bit small, but they are nice. It is right in Time Square and it is not too expensive. 
27495 Accommodating, friendly, warm. The front desk employee was always attentive and welcoming. 
27496 This Inn is clean and the staff are friendly. It is on the corner of Minute Maid Park and we walked to the game. 
27497 Saw Taylor Swift interview at ABC and saw her concert 200 yards away. The service ppl at service desk and all attendants were helpful. Room service can be improved a little bit. But overall enjoyed the staying. 
27498 I don't think I will ever be able to stay anywhere else in NYC again after staying here. From every amenity in the room to the accommodating staff and the peaceful sense of calm that comes over you as you enter the hotel...it is all nothing less than superb. 
27499 Great location, very friendly and welcoming staff. nice room, nice pool. Great place to visit with a young child! 
27500 A plus with one minus. Saturday PM "concierge" less than helpful and actually unhelpful when getting a cab. Feet were not happy to be told to walk a block in the slush and party shoes to get a cab at 7pm! All other staff at all levels were excellent! 
27501 Enjoyed the stay, great hotel in NYC. Front desk staff were incredible and welcoming. 
27502 always have a good experience at the Soho Grand; especially nice bathrooms with good amenities; be sure and check their website--often good deals there. 
27503 Large comfortable guest room with small kitchenette. No restaurant but a $6 continental breakfast is offered. Lots of places to eat nearby and central location. Some nearby construction noise could be a problem. 
27504 The hotel is very nice, very good location. Staff absolutely helpful and friendly. Kitchen is excellent. And at the 24th floor room 2420 has the best view to the Chatedral ever! 
27505 Perfect stay at the W City Center. The staff was all very polite, profressional and accomodating. This is from the concierege TK who was extremely helpful to the very pleasant housekeeping staff. All around very comfortable business stay. 
27506 This is the perfect place if you want a night with your girl and live with your parents. The hotel is kept fairly well, and the rooms ... Clean, neat, cheap and air conditoned! What more do you want? 
27507 Had a great stay, we did have a minor issue with our first room but we were upgraded straight away. Staff were great and never expected a tip. Ronny on the door was great and made sure we were looked after with taxis. Would recommend a stay, well done W 
27508 This was a girls getaway weekend and I choose this hotel because of the location. The hotel looked newly remodeled , the staff was great and wonderful location. You can walk just about everywhere from here. 
27509 Nice hotel, great location, easy access to subway!!! Also, excellent service!!! 
27510 Visited NY the weekend before Christmas. I have never had better service than at the Affinia 50. I will never stay anyplace else when I am in town. "Thank you" to Sid, your sevice was excellent. 
27511 the location is very good for shopping and dinner, don't expect a great reception, the executive lounge charge you for drinks-expensive is small, but is good for breakfast, 
27512 This is a very modern hotel with an impressive lobby and great service. The location is convenient, right by Columbus Circle/Central Park and subway. The room was very small, but a Priceline deal made it a great value. 
27513 I have stayed here on multiple occasions and frequently use it as my primary address in NYC. I always have a great experience and would recommend it to anyone. 
27514 Stayed 5 nights at the Edison and it was great. Rooms are small, but clean. There were 8 of us and we had 2 rooms. Staff was very friendly and the restaurant served a great, reasonably priced, breakfast. Location was terrific. Walking distance to everywhere! Would definitely stay again. 
27515 We used this on a family trip.Our main aim was to go around the city rather than stay in the hotel.This was a nice place though.Rooms were good. Staff were friendly.No complaints.We did not have food from the hotel though, since there wer plenty of good places around! 
27516 Yes the rooms were a bit small but you can't beat the location. Walking distance to Mag Mile without the heavy price tag. The hotel staff were ALL wonderful and cordial. The rooms were super clean and all updated. Sleek and modern. 
27517 I stayed in the Pod Hotel for two weeks. It's a nice place, stylish interior design, good service, good price. The only disadvantage: the rooms are really, really small. But that's OK, given all the benefits of the location and price. 
27518 Super comfortable rooms, modern but elegant decor and very good location. Just walk outside and a slew of great restaurants and shops are within minutes of walking distance. Front desk staff are welcoming and helpful. Direction to the place is a bit tricky 
27519 If you are traveling to New York City you HAVE to stay at this hotel, it has the best location, great costumer service, and good quality. I can say surely when I go back to NYC I'll be staying at this Doubletree 
27520 Been to NY a number of times and I truly think this is a great hotel. Free wireless internet and the free bottles of filtered water complete the great rooms. Definitely recommended! 
27521 We just got back from our stay at the W union square. Our fourth visit this year and it keeps getting better. Wonderful location and staff. Can not wait for our next visit 
27522 Pros: clean, trendy, modern, location, good staff, no harassment by bellboy Cons: breakfast not included in price and if you want, absurdly expensive; 2 PC for free internet only (and only to 10:30 PM) 
27523 For New York City LES close to SoHo this hotel was awesome. Clean, friendly and great location. For the price this place was outstanding. Highly recommend if you don't have a lot of $$$ but want to stay in the city in a real hotel. 
27524 Das Hotel ist wirklich sehr zu empfehlen. Die Aussicht alleine ist schon das Geld wert. Ausstattung der Zimmer, Service etc. waren ebenfalls einwandfrei. 
27525 Hotel is great for any need or purpose. You cannot beat the location and the service is phenomenal! In particular, Jonathan Roby was an excellent host and made sure our experience at the intercontinental was superb! Thanks for the hospitality and we will be sure to come back! - hyung 
27526 From the Fatwitch Brownies left on your bed in the evening to the attentive staff, I can't say enough great things. The location is great. It was the perfect spot to spend 6 nights in New York. 
27527 Un gran hotel, aunque algo postmoderno, pero siendo de los pocos que incluye la opcion de desayuno y estando muy bien comunicado compensa de sobra. El trato excelente con los conserjes y en el restaurante. En la azotea buenos cocktails. 
27528 We arrived days after Hurricane Sandy! No power but staff were friendly and helpful. Queen-size room was small...as expected...but we didn't need much more as we were only there to sleep and shower. Location in midtown good for sights! 
27529 The hotel is very good, however i fould that being IN times square (literally behind the coke advert) it was very busy, therefore 'popping' back to the hotel was a very exhausting experience! If you want to stay in Times Square this will be perfevct for you. 
27530 Hotel generalmente buono sia per l ubicazione abbastanza centrale sia per la cortesia del servizio. La camera, nonostante sia superior, e abbastanza piccola e sopratutto il bagno e davvero micro.molto scortese il fatto che su ogni oggetto ci sia il prezzo scritto a caratteri cubitali...bottiglietta d acqua sul comodino compresa!!! 
27531 Came here for an anniversary with my boyfriend. We were very pleased with the location of the hotel. The service was good. Bathroom was clean. Can't really complain. I'd come back again. 
27532 This week-end was our first to New York. We really enjoyed our stay and the Paramount Hotel was 2 steps from Times Square. This is one reason we selected that hotel. It has been renovated and the rooms look really modern. I recommand the place to everyone. 
27533 My wife and I found The Michelangelo Hotel on Trip Advisor and we are glad we did! It was everything as promised. Clean, comfortable, excellent location, great service, and a fair price (for NYC). We will go back to them every time we stay in NYC. 
27534 Perfect location, great staff, Rooms are very nice. loved it. 
27535 Very swift and efficient check in, the room was a bit tired looking but I was in the cheaper tower so I was expecting that, and even so I still think the rate I got was pretty good for such a good location. Would definitely stay here again, 
27536 We have stayed here several times when visiting Houston, for several reasons: convenient location near the museum district, Rice Village, good restaurants, and the freeway, reasonably priced, very clean and comfortable, with good amenities, including a microwave. Breakfast offerings used to be modest but are now expanded. 
27537 I contacted hotels in San Francisco, Boston, Washington and New York for confirmation of my bookings and the only hotel so far to reply is Hotel Beacon with a friendly message confirming my booking. Very impresed by their prompt response. 
27538 The rooms have been upgraded recently and, although small, are comfortable and clean. I had a room on the 36'th floor with a greeat view of the Empire State and Chrysler buildings. The staff was exceptionally accommodating. 
27539 Its really fun hotel for me and I like it more compared to the Resindence Inn. Neat and clean. Always I love this place. Its pleasure place for me in Houston. Good kitchen. Neat and clean Kitchen utensils. Good room service and they give me good rates too. 
27540 My wife and I spent 5 nights and the Staff was wonderfully friendly and helpful. Easy to catch subway, and walking distance to Theaters, Times Square, Rochefeller Center, etc. Would stay there again. Thank Victoria and Tyler. You made our stay a pleasure! 
27541 One of best places we've stayed in NY - we visit twice/year. Close to subway, theaters, good food. Meets my criteria: clean; good shower, comfy bed, quiet, nice lobby with AM coffee. A gem of a place. 
27542 I stayed at the Westin Oaks while in Houston, TX for the Final Four. I had a wonderful stay and the staff was very helpful and went above and beyond. I would highly recommend this hotel for business or a vacation. Rachel 
27543 The rooms are spacious - the jr suite fit easily two adults and two kids (inc. one infant in a crib) - could easily fit more. Good service, excellent value for money 
27544 The room was very nice and clean. No view and windows could not open. Breakfast was nothing special and just standard. 
27545 The rooms were great along with the location. Very easy to get to and take cab to the airport. Very quite area. The staff could be better trained, did not know much about their website promotions and offers. Took many effort to get the promotion. 
27546 Our room was comfortable and quiet. One minor quibble was the lack of space to hang clothes in the closet and absence of any place to hang a towel. Loved the shower, though! The staff was very friendly, and the sidewalk and curb were kept clear of snow and ice. 
27547 Perfect location for work. The hotel was delightful and staff was excellent. I will certainly return to this hotel many times. 
27548 nice place and location fit our need. the staff was kind, helpful and efficent. breakfast was held over the time limit to accomadate the last crowd, thanks 
27549 We stayed in the Iroquois for 2 nights even though the rooms were small the beds were luxuriously comfortable.It was convenient to Times Square,Broadway and fifth ave.and on a quiet street. 
27550 Excellent location, decoration updated but very well kept. Welcoming, friendly and very efficient staff. Many supermarkets, delis, restaurants nearby 
27551 i love this hotel, it may be a little bit expensive but it was in the middle of the fun and had many places to eat, at just steps. The service is very good and the staff is friendly, I really like it. 
27552 Beautiful rooms and the most comfortable bed I have slept on in a hotel !!! It was super clean and the staff was very professional and very accommodating. Extra effort can be seen and felt everywhere when staying in this hotel. Downtown and around the corner from everything!!! 
27553 amazing view to central park ! we loved the hotel. food was great.. service aswell. the staff was very helpfull for people that don't know NY.. they advise us for the best restaurants, bars etc 
27554 My daughter and I came into town on a Tuesday morning, fairly early. The staff was on the whole very supportative. We were in New York early and had nowhere to go. The Bellmen were most helpful. Thank you...... Frankie. The room was clean and affordable. 
27555 The room was smaller than my room in London. Nice staff, really noisy location. Hardly slept but again a pretty good location. 
27556 10/10 for location,the rooms were a good size for New York and very clean.The staff were more than helpful and there was security guard at the lifts which made you feel safe.I would def stay at The New Yorker again and would recommend it. 
27557 Last June one of the bellman lost my suitcase. The W Hotel refuses to acknowledge that anything happened. Horrible customer service. I've made 100 phone calls and still no response. Not worth the high cost! 
27558 The Radisson Lexington expects two grownups to share a twin bed. That is unacceptable in my opinion and the only answer the lady in the reception could give was "you get what you pay for". The bathroom was smelly and full of mold. Would not stay there again. 
27559 It was a very good hotel. In the middle of NYC. We just had to walk 10 or 15minutes and we were directly in at the Broadway. The employees are very friendly and helpful! 
27560 Excellent hotel & service. Beautiful rooms, very clean and quiet. Nice location. 
27561 The location is good, within walking distance of Times Square and even Central Park (if you don't mind a little hike). Two twin beds took up most of the floor space but I think that is normal for this area. The staff were friendly and helpful. 
27562 Das Hotel liegt in einer ruhigeren, aber dennoch recht zentralen Lage. Das Zimmer war freundlich und sauber eingrichtet. Im obersten Stockwerk befindet sich das Restaurant, von welchem man einen tollen Ausblick hat. 
27563 Good place to stay for indians, attached kitchen, good spa and pool. location is very good and people are good and safe place for business travelers and good connectivity to airport though bus and shuttle. 
27564 Buona posizione dell'hotel a pochi passi dall'Art Museum e dal Millennium Park. Albergo nel complesso vecchiotto ma camere pulita e bagno ristrutturato: forse nel complesso prezzo un po' troppo alto. 
27565 This is one great hotel. I have staying there for almost 15 years. Great staff! Neat boutiquey hotel. 
27566 My stay at this location was great! Staff was extremely helpful, the pool was clean and the room was spacious. Trees along the patio, gazebo and pool area made a peaceful environment. 
27567 A more frequent shuttle service to the University would have been helpful. This was a family weekend at the University. Many guests at the hotel complained that it was difficult to get a taxi from the University to the hotel. The hotel could have been more accomodating. 
27568 Had a wonderful getaway with my girlfriend. We would both definately would stay again! great location with lots to do - restaurants, bars, coffee houses - exactly what we were looking for. Got a great deal through PerfectEscapes. 
27569 Right in the middle of times square, as the title of this review suggests, the location couldn't be better. Hotel staff all courteous and helpful. Nice bar and Restaurant, if a little pricey... Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a great place to base themselves whilst visiting Manhattan! 
27570 Very good location and good value for price.,an ideal place for a short visit in the city .Unfortunately the rooms are very small and the mine was also sometimes bad smally. On the other had the staff is helpful and polite! 
27571 Stayed here due to the location and proximity to my business. Lobby and bar are beautiful Rooms were clean but very basic. Hotel staff was present at best. If you asked they would help you, but don't expect any above and beyond service. 
27572 This was the second time staying at this property. Friendly staff, great breakfast and manager's reception. The only place I'll stay when in Houston on business. 
27573 Good place to stay, clean room, stayed there in single room and got much more that expected. The room is not so small and very comfortable. Very close to time square and in good location that close to everything. Very recommended. 
27574 Agree with vacationer102. Really good location. Older accommodations but clean. We would definitely stay again. Staff was very friendly and felt safe the whole time. Walked to most areas. Loved the location to Central Park and loved spending time exploring there. 
27575 Rooms are very small, and not at all sound proff to city noices. Very little closet space, and bathrooms are absolutely basic. 
27576 Thank you for everything. We Will return with pleasure. See you soon 
27577 Booked just one night here when passing through NYC.... great location close to the shops and subway and the lovely Rockerfeller Centre. Rooms not huge, but who wants to stay in. Great cocktails at the bar... try the Cosmolini!! 
27578 Just stayed here for 4 nights. Great hotel. Got an amazing rate on Priceline $145/night. Rooms were really trendy, very clean and very spacious. Concierge was great had alot of great suggestions. If you have any doubts about staying here dont the place is fantastic. 
27579 This is relatively close to IAH. The hotel is clean and well kept. The owners are very solicitous and happy to help. 
27580 Our stay was perfert for our St Patricks Day girls weekend. Walking distance to most everything we needed. Loved the view & location. 
27581 This is a great tiny hotel! Staff were very helpful and the rooms were clean and the bed comfortable! Hotel very quiet considering where it is!! 
27582 We moved to this hotel from the Novotel. I love the Courtyard brand and should've booked there to begin with. Very clean. Very comfortable. 
27583 Terrific bargain hotel. Above average service and accomadations for a upper midtown 3 star hotel. Only exception to great service would be in the hotel restaurant. Slow service but good food for the money. 
27584 The Morningside Inn is a very good hotel. The rooms are clean. The hotel is really close to a subway, food outlets and is right next door to a Church. We all enjoyed our stay! 
27585 Great Location, Spacious rooms, courteous staff. Can't wait to go back 
27586 The Omni Berkshire is an excellent place to stay in Midtown. Beautifully appointed and maintained, friendly, helpful staff, thoughtful amenities (fresh fruit bowls in the lobby!). Pricey, sure, but worth it! 
27587 Das Hotel kann man getrost weiterempfehlen, bis auf Kakerlaken war alles okay. Schwierig ist es, das Hotel beim ersten Mal zu finden. Die Umgebung ist im Vergleich zum Hotel schlecht, allerdings fuer eine Nacht zu verschmerzen. 
27588 The Zaza Hotel was fantastic! The bed was extremely comfortable, the sheets luxurious , and there was a charging station in the room for phones and computers. A simple yet brilliant innovation. Free Internet was expected and appreciated. Friendly staff. Free coffee and tea in the morning. 
27589 This is the second time that I have stayed at the Hyatt Regency and it was a great choice! The staff is wonderful and the hotel is clean and in a wonderful location!!! It's a beautiful hotel and I feel like I have made a great choice! 
27590 My wife and I stayed there before our flight. The staff was nice and the rooms were clean, Yes they are going through a renovation but, they did a good enough job to make it a place where we would come back to. 
27591 Great location, near to the best atractions in NY: Central Park, Times Square, 5th Avenue, MoMa... Quiet street. Excelent space in rooms and bathrooms. Clean and silent. Breakfast could be cheaper. Certainly I will return. 
27592 Nice hotel, with great location for our thankgiving weekend trip, walking distance from Central park, times square, macy's etc.... Room are a bit small but in the NYC standards, Good staff. Would stay there again and would recommend. Free WIFI 
27593 Had an amazing experience. The lobby is beautiful and the rooms are fairly well decorated. For those who have hilton honors, they offer great heavy h'ourderves and snacks throughout the day in the executive lounge. Have stayed here several times, and plan on staying again. 
27594 The best thing of this hotel is its location. The staff is not very gratefull and sometimes rude. The breakfast is a normal continental breakfast and the breakfast room is veryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy tiny for a lot of people. 
27595 This hotel has clean rooms and comfortable beds. The staff is friendly and accomadating. The down side is there isn't much around within walking distance and safety is a concern off the hotel grounds. This is why i wouldn't rate it higher. 
27596 Services very friendly, great atmosphere and had a great time. Also beautiful, spacious room 
27597 Less then 10 mins from the subway on the river. The bathroom has a view of the Statue of Liberty. Bunk rooms are small and bathroom is shared - but perfectly adequate for the budget traveller. Close to Chelsea markets and plenty of restaurants in the west village 
27598 We stayed at the Sheraton off of 290 for an evening. The room was quite large and the bed was comfortable. The bedding was soft, clean and very nice. I would recommend this for a getaway. 
27599 Loved this hotel! We had a high rise room over looking Times Square and we couldn't have been happier. The room was clean and modern, quite large for NYC and we were just a short walk to everything Times Square and public transport. FABULOUS!!! :) Would stay again. 
27600 Everything was perfect ..... Fantastic corner room .... Great service 
27601 Really loved everything about our stay here, except the price due to last minute booking. We were able to check in early which was a bonus. The guys in the business center were so helpful to us as well 
27602 Will definitely stay again. Housekeeping was just okay. 
27603 A second stay at the Knickerbocker this year. Place is always bustling. Quick checkin. Nice room(though small) Nice bathroom with the big walk-in shower. Close to Michigan Avenue. Wife left some toiletries and we called. They have them and will ship them to us. Would stay again 
27604 Un hotel muy chic, realmente vale la pena. Estuve 3 noches y pague 30 dolares menos que en el hotel The Manhattan at Times Square donde tambien habia estado, siendo que el primero es muy superior. La localizacion tambien muy buena con mucho comercio alrededor. 
27605 Older hotel but very clean, comfortable with wonderful views. Staff was extremely helpful. 
27606 All the other great staff at the Bowery Hotel. Service is first rate. Comfy room. Charming decor. And a neat part of NYC. 
27607 Gente muy amable. Ideal para viajes, negocios y placer. Instalaciones de primera. 
27608 Midtown hotel is perfectly located to walk NYC and see everything. The room and barhroom were much bigger than I expected and the bed was so so comfy. Really clean boutique style hotel. Loved it, cannot recommend it highly enough. 
27609 GREAT Hotel in downtown Manhattan. Small, but clean and has everything you need, and the price is cheap for NYC! 3 blocks from the Empire State Bldg, 2 blocks from the subway. We've been there twice now & I would stay there again & recommend it! 
27610 I normally enjoy booking at Hampton but this one was quite mediocre compared to it's peers. Room smelled humidity, bathroom is not clean! Although night staff was nice, the day staff was quite cold! I will not return evev the location is quite good for a visitor to NY. 
27611 Room stank of stale cigarrette smoke and hotel refused to move us to another room. Bedding was dirty and rooms in despearate need of a refit. I strongly advise you NOT to stay here but to look elsewhere. 
27612 This used to be a good hotel, now its 3 star at best. No Airconditioning - well the room didnt get below 78 Phone didnt work TV fuzzy Manager totally incompetent. Used to be a cool boutique now its a waste of time. 
27613 Really quite shocking. Just don't bother!! Good location, but with the problems associated with Penn Station being on your doorstep. Horrendous rooms, with mould, mildew, noisy air con. Corridors are like something out of The Shining !! Don't get taken in by the lobby pictures!! 
27614 Very good location. Clean and comfortable with free breakfast. Rooms on small side with little storage/hanging space. Don't expect luxury but good value for money. 
27615 You can do better for the money. In a good location. Staff not friendly. Room smelled musty and paint peeling on the ceiling. Not very clean. 
27616 Top-notch hotel. Excellent service, friendly, clean, updated rooms. We splurged and took a room overlooking Times Square, which was a C-note more. Perfect view, except for the dirty windows, which interfered with picture taking. Pricey, but worth it. 
27617 The only thing i can remember from this hotel, was that a lady from the staff just shouted, hey you're drinking all the coffee, and serving all the food""". I was shocked to hear this and very disappointing since my family had barely started serving. Guests should be treated better!!. 
27618 Recession policies are obvious. Slipped maintenance, closed hotel shop, worn in room literature, missing doorman at times, luggage pileups, etc. Real nice roomy accomodations, excellent responsive service, great location are still in place. May be NYC market representative. Don't know. 
27619 Upon our stay the staff was welcoming. Their location is excellent, every thing is nearby and walking distance to the hotel. The concierge was very helpful. We will definately stay there again. 
27620 Stayed in this hotel for three nights.Was told not to expect muchfrom NY hotels but this was very nice. Decent sized room with modern fittings and all very clean. Not much noise from outside either which wasquite good. Would definatley stay here again 
27621 We were skeptical to stay away from our usual Times Square hotels; however, we loved this hotel and location.. so much bang for the buck! A corner room was given to us with no extra charge, and it was HUGE! Service, location, cleanliness, and staff were wonderful during our stay.. 
27622 it was located in the best place to be in newyork worth the stay price and helped in business activity. 
27623 I took my daughter here for Mother's Day - what a great time we had! Walking distance to Madame Tussauds and excellent shopping all around! The room was large and very clean. The lobby is beautiful and the bar area very nice. Great place & great location...would come back anytime! 
27624 Always very busy here, just as crowded in the lobby as on Times Square. Edison provides no luxury, but if you want the best location for tourism in NYC, this is the best. 20minutes walk takes you just anywhere in Midtown. 
27625 Check-in too late in the day. The foyer had not enough seating. No ramp at front door. Rooms need upgrading but clean. Great location. Great view. 
27626 We staid seven nights and everything was perfect. The rooms are comfortable and it is very clean. Best thing us the little kitchen in the room to make your own breakfast. Book it, you will love it. 
27627 This is a new hotel and it is very nice. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Each morning there is a full continental breakfast and coffee served all day long. The rooms are very nice and housekeeping does a great job. 
27628 Come back today from a lovely 4 day stay at the Benjamin!!!! a wonderful hotel!! better still, the service is impeccable!!!! every hotel could learn from this place they were superb!!!! thanks to Richard ! jeff and all the ladies and staff i've forgotten their names!!! we will be back!!!!!!! 
27629 Not since having to sleep at an EconoLodge in upstate New York have I stayed in such a dirty, dingy hotel. The absolute worst. 
27630 Well, where to start? ive stayed there 3 times and loved it, i met will smith there too. top quality butlers, rooms, service, etc etc 
27631 Great Mid Budget Hotel. No frills but very clean and cost friendly. 
27632 2 notti a NYC in quest piccolo hotel. Buona la pulizia e il servizio. Molto buona l'ubicazione. Abbiamo prenotato sftuttando una promozione su booking.com. Questo ha reso il rapport qualita' prezzo molto interessante. Consiglio di prenotare in anticipo e di cercare i deal disponibili.".......................... 
27633 Prima hotel: goede service, fijne locatie, prima onderhouden. Enige minpuntjes zijn de bedden (in de dormrooms dan) en het feit dat er maar 3 computers in het hotel te vinden zijn, waardoor deze regelmatig bezet zijn. 
27634 Good hotel close to subway. There are many different rooms - some are small and not very upto date. Hotel staff is very friendly and helpful. Finally they got the license to serve alcohol in the bar. Breakfast is not very high quality (compared to some other hotels) 
27635 Good location one block from Michigan ave. The rooms were big enough for two adults and two kids. The swimming pool on the top floor was a huge hit for our kids and was busy on a Sunday night. The view was really cool. Overall a quality stay! 
27636 Very pleasant stay at the Westin recently. Staff are very friendly and attentive to your needs. Room was comfortable, and location was ideal for my needs (business weekend). Would definitely recommend. 
27637 A very nice, clean property in a perfect location in Times Square! The price was reasonable for a hotel in Manhattan. I would go back to the Doubletree in Times Square for sure, 
27638 Lots of charm to this older hotel. Everyone was extremely pleasant and helpful. Location is perfect for all the great shopping and sites in this awesome town 
27639 Our stay was great. It was a good exoerience for the cost. Recommend it to everyone. 
27640 Have stayed numerous times and find it a nice place. Clean, quiet and comfortable. The area the hotel is located in is somewhere I would not want to walk around after dark. Breakfast is typical hotel food but worth it. Staff seems very polite and knowledgable. 
27641 Muito bom e bem localizado.Indicaria a amigos com certeza 
27642 I travel to Houston often and stay at the Crowne Plaza all the time. The front desk and room service staff are outstanding especially Henry and Ali. They are very friendly and accommodating. I would highly recommend staying here. 
27643 Had a gween size bed and great room!!! Location was fabulous and I want to go back ASAP!!! very safe lots of bars and restaurants only negative was the hotel did not have ice!! 
27644 Location, Location, Location. That's what this hotel offered together with good rooms and service to match up to it. However, I don't know if it warrants its extremely high room rates. 
27645 My husband and I stayed three nights for a college sporting event. We were upgraded as well as agree with MKS001 on the room. The location is great and the staff were friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend. 
27646 Great location and quite cheap too. The room was even smaller than I expected but it was really clean, the bed was very comfortable and there was no noise whatsoever. I highly recommend it. 
27647 Good Location, right in the heart of downtown shopping district and not too far from waterfront. The building is dated and the rooms are small. It is not up the usual standards of what I expect from SPG. No club lounge which was very disappointing. 
27648 It isn't fancy, but it is heaps better than a hostel. Clean place and efficient staff. 
27649 This hotel has a great central location. While the sidewalks in Time Square are packed with people and noisy, once you walk through the doors of this place you find a safe haven. Helpful staff and tasty cookies upon arrival. Our room was spacious, quiet and clean. 
27650 We really enjoyed this hotel. The staff is very friendly, especially the bell boys. Everyone is pleasant and welcoming. We ate at the restaurant, and loved it. The only complaint would be the parking fees. 
27651 The hotel entrance is dark and unwelcoming, but the rooms are huge (for the area), comfortable, clean and the hotel is almost litteraly on Times Square. What else to ask if you're a tourist in NY? Overall an excellent choice. 
27652 After discovering an issue with my hotel bill, I contacted Josette Pierre-Alphonse - the Credit Manager at On The Ave Hotel. Ms. Pierre-Alphonse was able to correct the issue and re-credit my credit card on the same day that I made the request. Excellent service, and much appreciated! 
27653 Very bad... i change room 5 times. This say all... 
27654 Hotel che sembra appena costruito, pulito e funzionale, camere piccole ma molto ben arredate, wireless e internet point gratuito, posizione ottima a 1 minuto dalla fermata della metropolitana. Quartiere tranquillissimo...Da tornarci, sicuramente. 
27655 Wouldn't think of a better place to stay at. Everything is within walking distance, food, shopping, you got it all. Great value for money, and very lovely staff. Heavenly showers in bathroom not so heavenly, but otherwise , a fantastic property. 
27656 Hat alles gepasst! Perfekte Lage, geiles Zimmer! Die Minibar warn bissl klein ;-) 
27657 Excellent location, on the corner of 7th and 31st. Clean and spacious rooms although tiny bathroom but clean and functional. Helpful, friendly staff. Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again 
27658 RS is a charming midtown hotel with unique accents that make each room unique. Rooms are clean, comfortable and surprisingly spacious. The staff was friendly and attentive without overwhelming. An excellent value. Breakfast was pricey, but there are good alternatives within a short walk. 
27659 We stayed (family of 5 in two suites) for a week and were vere happy. Clean well-equipped rooms, good breakfast. Upper West side location is perfect for families with good transport connections and a nice quiet area with good shops, restuarants and facilities. Would go back in a heartbeat. 
27660 Aktuell das Trend-Hotel in Chelsea. Stylisches Ambiente, umgeben von guten Restaurants, Gallerien und Bars. Sehr empfehlenswert. 
27661 The room was very clean and quite comfortable for the money. I really appreciated the professional staff and their courtesy. Will stay again. 
27662 I chose this hotel because of its proximity to a social function we were going to and because I am Hilton Honors member. The hotel is clean and the rooms are spacious. It has all the conveniences I expect for business travel. 
27663 very spacious rooms, bathroom was amazing! location is fantastic and just overall a wonderful experience. I would def stay here again the next time i visit the city. I was just amazed at how brilliantly everything was done! 
27664 A small room with one of the most comfortable beds I have slept in. Also able to use one of the computers next to the reception area free of charge, and able to keep up to date with the family. A quirky hotel with good staff. 
27665 Pues eso, en el hotel nos duplicaron la visa y hemos tenido sorpresa... y estomos seguros que fue en el hotel porque fue el unico sitio donde utilizamos esta visa...asi que cuidado.. 
27666 It was overall a very good stay, Hotel staff is very accomodating and prompt, would surely come back to stay, rates are very reasonable 
27667 I had a corner room with a great view but it smelled musty and showed signs of water damage. Just not really what should be expected at a Marriot. The location is great close to shopping and many places to eat. 
27668 Hotel sucio, viejo, desvencijado, y ademas huele mal!!! 
27669 An absolutely fabulous hotel!! Loved our stay and the brilliant location, right in the heart of Times Square! Hope to be back with you for Christmas!! 
27670 I know this hotel since 1997 and I love staying there!! The bedrooms are spacious, well decorated, very good location and the staff is already like family to me. 
27671 great location, great service. Just in the middle of everything 
27672 Staff and location were great, good value for the winter season. Concierge (Larry) was very helpful. 
27673 We spent five nights and loved our experience: wonderful location location near Fairway/Natural History Museum/great restaurants, friendly staff, comfortable/roomy rooms with a great kitcheonette to keep b'fast/snacks cool -- all in all, a hidden jewel and highly recommended for families. 
27674 The hotel was very conveniently situated and the room was very nice. The beds were comfortable and the staff friendly and helpful. The bathroom was also large and more than sufficient for our requirements of 5 adults. 
27675 Located just a few 100 meters from 5th Av. Great rooms with high comfort King Size beds. Great reception with balcony, bar etc. We very very pleased with the location, just a few minutes walk to Grand central, Times Square, 5 th Av etc 
27676 the cable tv was rubbish i couldnt watch monday nite raw. i got electric shocks of everything thing the lifts were atroucious i could go on for days and days. 
27677 We will definitely stay at the Benjamin again. Great hotel. Nice decor, friendly staff, immaculately clean and a good location. Our room was on the back of the hotel, so no view, but very very quiet. Fantastic mojitos in the lounge bar! 
27678 Overnight in this hotel was provided by Amtrak due to missed train connection. Lovely hotel, comfortable large rooms, very nice restaurant and sports bar. Staff very nice and pleasant even when accomodating a large group of Amtrak travelers early in the morning. Across from Rush University Medical Center. 
27679 Stylish, top location, great staff, super rooms, wlan 
27680 Had an amazing stay, staff are so friendly, service was great, food and amenities FABULOUS! 
27681 View of times square from the dining area, looked out onto 7th Ave. from our room. The rooms were clean and very nice, renovated a few years ago. Charges for wifi, but most hotels do.I highly recommend this hotel. 
27682 We were thrilled with the location, in the heart of Times Square! Spent three days there, in a double bed room, great view of the city, clean - EVEN A NEW MATTRESS! No hint of bed bugs! Very tidy room (and we're picky). Very safe area, even at night! 
27683 Assolutamente ottimo per visitare new york, anke dal punto di vista del prezzo! pulito e silenzioso nonostante si trovi in pieno centro a manhattan....una fermata di metropolitana da times square(ci vai anke a piedi). lo consiglierei a tutti!! 
27684 We stayed in the Lucerne Dec 28 through to New Years Day. Excellent value and service. Convenient transportation straight to downtown and close by many decent restaurants. Recommended overall, especially if you don't want to spend a bundle on a hotel and still get a decent place to stay. 
27685 We had a one bedroom suite that was just what we were looking for. The rooms were spacious, the bathroom was very clean and the beds were so comfortable. Everything you could ask for. I would definitely return. 
27686 We were in New York on business but brought our 2 year old and we had a wonderful time at the standard. The staff could not have been nicer and tried harder to make us feel right at home. We will absolutely stay there again next time! Thank you! 
27687 This is a really nice Westin in a great locations. Nothing bad to say about this hotel and the location. It has clean spacious rooms and a club floor/lounge...One of the rare Westin's with a club lounge which is always a nice bonus... 
27688 Great location on the Magnificent Mile along Michigan Ave. Rooms were clean with plenty of space, and the staff was especially kind and helpful. Starbucks conveniently located in the lobby with free Wi-fi. The hotel charges $14/day for wi-fi. 
27689 I stayed at this hotel with my family. Great location. Rooms are spacious and clean. Hotel manager Tara was very friendly and helpful. Thank you Tara! We really enjoyed our stay. 
27690 We had a wonderful experience while in NYC at the Novotel - the staff couldn't have been more helpful. Definitely will go back! 
27691 Many rooms are next to bars, impossible to sleep when they are open, if you want to party till early hours, this might be a good choice. otherwise stay away !!!! 
27692 This place is beautiful, clean, and the service is sensational! I highly recommend staying here for convenience, location, food, rooms and staff. The restaurant was to die for, the chef was helpful, and the service was great as well. One of the best , I ever dined in. 
27693 for the price in that area, I thought it was a good deal. The Guy at the front desk was really nice. I did find a few crumbs in the room though. (didn't complain about it) overall, it wasn't too bad. 
27694 Conveniently located hotel, close to great restaurants, walking distance to Times Square, Rockerfeller Center, Central Park, too. Great view of the city if you're on a high floor. Complimentary breakfast is wholesome, lots of choice, and eating area is comfortable and clean. 
27695 Etant souvent dans des hotels Hyatt en Asie, il n'est pas acceptable de retrouver cet endroit dans cette chaine. L'hotel est bien place, mais les chambres sont glauques les salles de bain sont d'un autre age et minuscules, la douche fait fremir. Bref a eviter. 
27696 its okay.. rooms are boring.. sort of stale... But not bad... Lobby is okay... everything is okay... Only real nice part is location.... 
27697 We stayed at the Warwick in June and this was our first trip to NYC. We loved the Hotel. It was clean, the staff was friendly and the location was excellent. We will stay here again!!! 
27698 The best thing about this hotel is the fact that the staff is great and the service is impeccable. Secondly, the location is great for Broadway shows and Times Square. 
27699 great location, small room, but perfect for new york few days stay. and breakfast too, would stay again. 
27700 The comfort inn at the LES, is a great value. The internet works , the room is clean. The place is not the Four Seasons, but if you want a clean place to stay with friendly staff and amenities that work, then this is your place in Downtown NYC. 
27701 Hotel was close to everything we needed. Easy access to subways and Times Square. The rooms were great. Quiet and clean. Could not have asked for a better place to stay during our short trip to NY. 
27702 Outstanding hotel with outstanding service. Rooms very large for NYC and well presented. You can not get closer to the city than this. 
27703 The room was really nice and very clean. Nice location within walking distance of most everything. The staff were very polite and helpful. It was reasonably priced and had parking nearby. We enjoyed our stay, and would definitely stay again. 
27704 this hotel is like something out of 1970's starsky and hutch! we had to put our cases against the door for security! it is very central but not clean and very very shabby! 
27705 Lovely hotel rooms tad small to be expected be prepared to que half N hour to check in and any other time you need to talk to reception and not that friendly at all!! 
27706 We stayed for 4 nights at this Upper East Side Gem. The hotel has great suites and absolutely wonderful staff. The evening reception hosted by managers was a great touch. Will definitely be back at the Affinia! 
27707 Rooms are quite large, bathrooms are small, but elegant! Bulgari amenities, comfortable beds-I could be happy living here! 
27708 I would just like to say that my experience at the Affinia Gardens was excellent form the bellman to the roomservice! 
27709 Fitzpatricks is a very good 4 star hotel with a great location, rooms are really nice and spotlessy clean, staff are all very friendly, only weak point is quality of food at breakfast. 
27710 The Salisbury Hotel was a superb location. The rooms were large and roomy, but in need of a lick of paint. Poor service and no facilities as such. Poor all round. Like I said, the best was the location. 
27711 This hotel did not live up to it's billing. A Cool and hip reputation is great but It was not clean or well cared for. Would never stay there again. Overpriced for a dirty, shabby room. 
27712 We had a good stay in NYC. The Sohotel was good. The rooms are a bit small but clean. Our room was quite noisy (a lot of traffic and bars near the hotel). For young people a very good hotel. For ealderlies find an other! 
27713 We loved our stay at the Four Seasons Beverly Hills. Of course the amenities were top notch but what we appreciated the most was the service. Every staff member, from concierge to pool attendant to housekeeping greeted us with a smile even when we passed them in the hall. 
27714 hotel excelente, 1/2 quadra da time square, receptivo e concinierge excelente fez todas as nossas reservas em restaurantes, quarto otima limpeza, funcionario excelentes, alegres, receptivos, super atenciosos, tudo que eu solicitei foi atendido rapidamente. 
27715 Thanks to All the staff for the friendly and welcoming way treated us. I 
27716 Enjoyed a wonderful weekend at this hotel. The service and location were outstanding. The staff and management of this hotel couldn't have been more helpful. I wouldn't stay anywhere else the next time I return to NYC !! 
27717 The rooms are large and comfortable and very clean. The staff is very accommodating. Good location. 
27718 Fab location, great value, and only round the corner from Times Square! Yes, the rooms were a bit tired, but it was very comfortable and clean. We would stay there again. Loved it! 
27719 Ottima posizione, camere un forse un po troppo piccole ma molto pulite e ordinate, dato che ho visitato la citta a gennaio e faceva un gran freddo aggiungo che la camera era molto calda... la colazione ottima e lo staff molto cordiale e gentile... ottima hotel. 
27720 This was the perfect stay. We loved our room very cozy, a little pricey. It was so handy to all the sites we wanted to see. very clean and comfortable. 
27721 It's a decent hotel to stay in the center of time square, easy access to everything and close to train station. If you stay in lower levels, the noise including siren can be disturbing, but overall the hotel service and the conditions are fair to the price they charge for. 
27722 Service good but not great, food excellant. view from room nice, room decent size. staff not as responsive to needs. Walked in and was not greeted right away, check in took a little longer than usual. location central to chicago, easy access to food and shopping. expensive. 
27723 Das ist Hotel ist sehr zu empfehlen. Sehr stielvoll , alter Flair NY 
27724 The room is small but sensually designed with a great shower, comfortable bed and many interesting adult items available on the room service menu. Because the hotel is on the upper floors of the building, there are great views of New York City. 
27725 Good stay. Asked for an upgrade and got the deluxe room. Still pretty small, but no complaints. Can hear everything in the hallway, but expected from a NY hotel. Front staff were alright, not overly accomodating but not rude like some people have said. 
27726 Great to find a hotel for a reasonable price, good location, nice staff, clean, sympathic, etc. The double rooms are a bit small but with a few dollars more you can get a two-bed room, These rooms are latge and great!. In summary, great value for money. 
27727 I hate this hotel coz it's bad and non hygienic and everything is on charge even the fridge/knife/spoon/tea bag is not available in the room And f you want it you should pay 5$ on each.. 
27728 Location fine to the Javits Center, Sightseeing, shops etc. 
27729 Went during spring break in april stayed two night with my children we all had a great time. Loved being able to take them downstairs to get a bite to eat and not have to leave to hotel grounds. We will be back again soon =) 
27730 Goede ligging om NY te ontdekken. Hotel netjes, recentelijk opgeknapt, kamer klein ondanks mooie foto's op site. Airco functioneerde niet naar behoren dus gewoon de stekker eruit als je wilt slapen. Verder tov vele hotels een aanrader. Wij hebben er een mooie week gehad. 
27731 Hi! We stayed at Newton hotel first time in New York. The hotel is just perfect, cheap and nice loaction. You can see som picture of the hotel in my review. For any1 who is going to NY, and want not spend to much on staying. Near the Metro too. 
27732 I found the President's Hotel to be in a great location (Times Square), the staff were friendly and helpful, a great lobby, complementary internet. The decor made me feel like I was in Europe and it also had an excellent restaurant in the lobby. 
27733 we were on a family trit, the hotel is situated in a good place and I think it was most valueble for us 
27734 me and my mam stayed here oct 2yrs ago it was 1st time,staff were lovely and hotel was great,we had to get cab in to times square but we didnt mind was only 10 dollars,was luvly hotel and helpful,staff were great checking on us:)would defo go back here 
27735 redelijk behulpzaam bij vragen, geven ook advies als je goedkoper uit bent door iets niet via het hotel te bestellen. Men vindt het ook prima als je tegenover bij starbucks koffie gaat halen en die weer mee naar je kamer neemt. Voor maaltijden geldt hetzlfde. 
27736 Small room , lousy view , not quite clean bed linen , bathroom small & old fittings , general scruffy state of room & hotel interior 
27737 However if you need a mid town hotel just to sleep in & get a good price then it might not be the worst. 
27738 goed gelegen, vriendelijke staff, kleine maar heel gezellige kamers (goeie sfeer verlichting) zalige rainshower met zicht op Manhatten, biologische badproducten. Alles mooi afgewerkt. Hangt een leuke hippe sfeer vanaf je binnenkomt. Echt geslaagd concept !!!!! 
27739 Super central, very chick hotel. I stayed at the Maritime for business and was impressed with the service & standard. Rooms are fairly small and has a (maritime) dark wooden look and an excellent bars/cafe restaurant. Clean, trendy place to stay when in NYC. 
27740 This hotel is clean, large rooms with comfy beds, great breakfast, and friendly staff. I give it a 5 star rating and will be staying there again when I travel to Houston. 
27741 Our room with two beds was very big. The beds and pillows were incredibly comfortable and clean. They gave us bath robes that were great. 
27742 bathroom so dirty, any kind of money is not worth it. bad experience 
27743 This hotel is perfectly located and has brilliant staff. I stayed there for 4 days and they did everything possible to make our stay plesant and well. I highly recommend this to anyone travelling to NYC. 
27744 Just got back during a Labor Day weekend stay. First time I had fun in Houston! Hotel is great, pool is even better. The gym is unbelievable. Definetly, get that country club feelling when you arrive. The staff is friendly and always available. Looking forward to coming back soon. 
27745 This hotel is the bomb. The decor is super cool , the bed is like a cloud and the neighborhood is fantastic. Love the courtyard view with a pool. You hardly know you are in NYC it's another world. Totally enjoyed it and would stay there again in a heartbeat 
27746 Great stay! As one reviewer said, it truly was a pleasant surprise. Will be staying again on my next visit to the Big Apple. Great location, great service. Rob, the restaurant manager was wonderful. Thanks Courtyard Marriott! 
27747 Clean large rooms, nice friendly staff. Nice helpful shuttle drivers. Wonderful hot breakfast, nice variety of items. Hot food hot, cold food cold. Hotel staff was cleaning the walkways, garden and pool area in the morning. Lobby spotless. Would definately stay there again. 
27748 Have stayed at Hotel Mela 5 times and will keep coming back. We've stayed at many NYC hotels but love this one. Clean, modern rooms, friendly staff and a Bistro and Pub next door that are terrific. Stayed there again this past Saturday night Sept., 1, 2012. 
27749 Ottima posizione, si visita tutto facilmente a piedi (ma davvero tutto!!). Nelle vicinanze numerosi posti dove mangiare, economici e non, specialmente Diner per chi vuole godersi appieno la vita negli States. Vi consiglio vivamente questo hotel! 
27750 Second time we choose to stay at the Hyatt New York and this time it's even better after the reform lobby and rooms. Give preference to upper floors because the view is amazing and so you can have breakfast in the hotel, service is fabulous. 
27751 We stayed here last Nov and we were very pleased. Right in the center of eveything. Rooms are clean and nice. Helpful staff. Would defiinitely stay here again. 
27752 Nice room. However: Exercise room was very dirty and the exercise bike was defective. This hotel is too expensive for what it offers. 
27753 The Blakely was one of the best hotels I've stayed at. The rooms and bathrooms were very modern and clean! It was like 2 or 3 blocks from times square. The service was also outstanding! I will definitely stay here again next time I go to the big apple! 
27754 This was a good hotel at a reasonable price. The location was super, the room was comfortable and it was very clean ! We requested a coffee maker and one was brought up to the room quickly. I would definitely stay here again. 
27755 Stayed at Essex House in New York in March 04. The staff are very friendly and rooms are excellent and kept very clean. Drinks in the bar are very reasonable priced. It is that good that we have booked the same hotel for over christmas. 
27756 Clean, comfy and accomodating...Although I hate times square (because its so busy and touristy) This hotel has a great location! The bar is lots of fun, rooms and staff are great and way better than the Mariott Marquee down the street. 
27757 Mooi hotel in het midden van Manhattan (vlakbij het empire state building en time square). Kamers zijn wat klein, maar wel netjes. Hotel ligt vlakbij verschillende metrolijnen en bij een groot treinstation, dus het is erg eenvoudig om vanuit daar de verschillende delen van New York te bereiken. 
27758 Yea the elevators are small and slow sometimes. But it has a superb location. Complimentary breakfast and wifi makes the price unbeatable. The stuffs were very friendly and informative. Rooms are clean. definitely will go back. 
27759 Suites are very spacious and clean. Staff are exceptional. Breakfast plentiful and free. Would be best to hire a car but be warned not for the faint hearted!! Cost of cab to downtown $25 - $30 each way. Minute Maid Park is worth a visit. 
27760 Ottimo per visitare la citta'. Comodissimo a Penn Station. Con la fermata della metro a pochi passi. I dipendenti sono cortesi e sorridenti e sempre disponibili. Molto buona la colazione continentale con ampia scelta! Assolutamente consigliato!! 
27761 A superb luxury hotel with all the amenities and then some; a warm and friendly staff, excellent location, and home to the Gordon Ramsey restaurant at the London. 
27762 Great location, super friendly and professional staff, and rooms were very comfortable. I've stayed in the past, and always get the same great service here. I would defiantly recommend this property if your traveling to this area (Tomball, Willowbrook Mall, anywhere near 1960 and 249). 
27763 Muy bien ubicado. Camas pequenas. Habitaciones amplias para NY. Personal muy servicial. 
27764 Absolutly the best location in New York City. Nice clean rooms,. i will be back. 
27765 This HI Express is new; the rooms are small but have all the amenities including frig, microwave, wi-fi, great bathroom fixtures. It's 2 blocks from the South Seaport (food court), close to the Brooklyn Bridge and the departing point to the Statue of Liberty. 
27766 Easy to get to many NYC attractions. Helpful staff, room nice and mostly quiet, considering the centralized location. Clean bathroom, slept great in this bed. Would stay here again. 
27767 Beautiful hotel, great location, good price and service. They even sent me a desert and champagne for my 30th birthday which was really, really nice. Great experience! Guido, Montreal. 
27768 Stayed for business, one night, extremely small rooms, bed, enough room to walk around it to desk, small bathroom and closet, for 159$ you should expect more. This place is nothing special. 
27769 Good price, convenient location, very clean, big room, friendly staff - what else do you want? Will definitely stay at the Salisbury again. 
27770 Camera accogliente, pulita, spaziosa e fornita di tutto. L'hotel e' situato n una zona perfetta, centrale e nevralgica. I taxi sotto sono comodissimi da prendere. Il concierge che parla italiano e' perfetto per chi parla poco inglese. Colazione buona e globalmente tutto perfetto. 
27771 Always looking for a reasonable deal in Manhattan. Got a good rate, though not a busy time. Great mid-town location, close to GCentral. Pretty good size room with comfortable beds. Nothing very luxurious, but clean and well kept. Small, quiet and good value for the money $209. 
27772 Older building was very quiet. Little or noise from surrounding rooms. Rooms were very clean, as well as the lobby and hallways. Location to the city resulted in noisy sirens from downtown traffic at night. We would definitely recommend this hotel to friends. 
27773 Great hotel with friendly staff. The rooms are small, perfect for those travelling alone. If I was travelling with children, I would have preferred more space. Central location and nice neighbourhood. 
27774 I stayed 5 nights at The Michelangelo Hotel and the Staff was very very unkidly. 
27775 Found the Shelburne convenient (close to Grand Central and subway lines), near tasty restaurants, staff helpful, quiet room (an inside one.) The room decor neutral, a little dreary, bathroom adequate, room and bathroom clean. The staff helpful and pleasant. The room temperature was comfortably and quietly maintained. 
27776 Located in one of the most exciting sections of the city, it is comfortable, clean, private and has terrific views of the theater district. 
27777 Location of the hotel was fantastic, 5 minute walk to times square! Close to a subway and stores. The hotel itself was undergoing some renovations but the room itself was very small with barely any room for suitcases. Would stay again it the price was still cheap. 
27778 Warme ontvangst, kleine maar schone kamer, rustige buurt 's nachts, warme wafels bij ontbijt, Central Park om de hoek, leuke eethuisjes en winkeltjes op de andere hoek en Metropolitan, Natural History en Moma op loopafstand.Volgende keer naar hetzelfde hotel, wat mij betreft. 
27779 I really liked everything about this hotel. The rooms were fabulous and the service was terrific. A great location as well. I especially liked that it was a small hotel , The beds were very comfortable 
27780 We were very satisfied with the hotel. We give note 10 for breakfast, room cleaning, bathroom, all the staff, especially Angel. He was kind and helped us in everything we asked. I certainly recommend this hotel, which, besides everything has a great location with many good restaurants and subway around. 
27781 we stayed there from 10/19/2010 to 10/26/2010 all family at on time we had more than 6 rooms and suites....everything was perfect good help from Latoya Gibbons ,very cooperative and helpful also Rhonda good attention.... all in all will recomend to my friends .. Maurice C. Sao Paulo Brazil 
27782 Even though the hotel was packed, it was still quiet and a great location in the middle of the city. 
27783 If you are staying in SOHO this property is in a good location. Its further away from Broadway than the Holiday Inn. It is also nicer but is usually more expensive than the Holiday Inn in SOHO. 
27784 Nothing impressive about this place. The hotel is huge and staff are in general rude. I have stayed here twice via Priceline ($100) and I wouldn't pay a penny more. 
27785 - very well arranged rooms, with lots of space - excellent value for a suite - terrific and helpful staff, eg Marianne McCann, Front Office Manager - great central location - helpful Concierge staff - very practical rooms, esp the desk 
27786 I have stayed at top hotels under virtually every brand in the business and I can say without hesitation that the service provided by the staff at the Paramount NYC was as good as it gets. They exceeded my expectations in several ways and I recommend them strongly. 
27787 My family and I stayed here our one night in NYC. It was an excellent location as it was only a block from Times Square, and within walking distance to many attractions. The room was nice and clean and the staff was friendly and inviting. 
27788 We have many Japanese business traveler and all requested to stay at St. Regis Hotel. The comfortableness and friendlyness are exceptional and further more the lady at in house reservation is very nice and very cooperative all the time. 
27789 My wife and I stayed at his hotel Aug 26-30. We found it clean, comfortable and quiet. As many others have posted, the hotel has a great location. We found all the staff to be helpful and friendley. Would stay there again without question. 
27790 Honestly, I think you will be hard pressed to find better value. Clean, modern and really central. Get up early for breakfast though, gets busy. 
27791 Why visit just New York, when you can visit Jeffrey's New York: impromptu Jazz, special seats at a Broadway show, a cozy cafe in the village and terrific dining everywhere ... this concierge delivers a great New York experience with more than a little flare. Top marks. 
27792 Si quieres estar en pleno corazon de la gran manzana... este es el hotel. Precios razonables, atencion excelente, y la ubicacion... que en New York es todo... no puede ser mejor. Lo recomiendo, y deben reservar con anticipacion, ya que vive full, precisamente por la ubicacion del hotel. 
27793 Perfect place in the middle of manhattan, close to the park, time square and everything inside walking distance. 
27794 From the front desk to the housekeeping staff, everyone was polite, helpful, timely and knowledgeable. They made our trip a comfortable and enjoyable one... 
27795 Stayed here for 4nights visiting our daughter who hasd been living in Manhattan. One bedroom suite with seperate lounge and kitchen - decent size accommodation , not "luxury" but well appointed clean and quite - 5 minutes walk to the subway pedfrect for a short break 
27796 We were booked into the Sheraton next door but they overbooked. This was a plus for us. Free breakfast, very nice bathroom amenities. Nice size rooms with great views. very nice staff. Everyone was very nice and friendly. Would gladly stay again. 
27797 We stayed at the Crowne Plaza in Times Square for four nights. It was exceptionally clean and comfortable. All of the employees were very courteous and helpful. The location is fabulous. I highly recommend it for anyone. 
27798 The location is perfect. Rooms are very clean, spotless and very spacious with comfy beds. VEry friendly staff. Dear Mrs.Maldonado, I am a repeated customer and would like to have your email, so as to send you a special request for my next stay at Affinia Gardens. Thanks. 
27799 They were always so helpful and very very willing to accommodate us in any and every way possible! They did an amazing job helping each of our clients with what they needed in a very quick and efficient manner. Very friendly staff! I very much enjoyed my stay. 
27800 We stayed one night after attending the theatre and could not have been more satisfied. The hotel was clean and service was outstanding. Very convienient to the theatres and restaurants. Only a 2 block walk thru well lit streets to get to Hobby Center. Will stay again. JB 
27801 We did business at the convention center, just two blocks away.We saw a ballgame at Minute Maid Park, just three blocks away. We had most of our meals in the hotel and every meal was very good.We also ate at a seafood restaurant across the street which we enjoyed. 
27802 This is a older hotel but the location To the subway, theaters and time square is great! The staff is fantastic! Everyone I came across from check in to check out were very helpful. The rooms have been updated and are clean. 
27803 We stayed here for a business event for executives, and it was perfect. Great location, attentive staff and quiet European-style elegance. Everyone was happy with our choice. 
27804 Right in Times Square! The rooms are small, but you aren't going to NYC to sit in your Room! The Staff is EXCELLENT! Clayton (in Baggage Claim) is one the friendliest people in all of NYC! Awesome service! 
27805 We stay at the Marriot Marquis whenever we can. The location is central to restaurant row and many attractions. The rooms are very specious and clean and attractive. Look for specials that come up now and then because it's pricey. 
27806 Great service, fantastic bed and nice room. Two blocks from the Rector Street subway station and Battery Park. 
27807 the best thing is the hotel is its location. The hotel is old, the staff is horrible they are rude, regular, with all the passengers share this view. They never responded to anything. There are many choices to go. 
27808 I stayed here for Christmas with my fiancee. The view from the 40th floor is beautiful. The bed was really comfy but for the price the room was rather small.- But you are paying for the hotel name and the plasma TV in the room. 
27809 You will not find an hotel on Manhattan for this price and this quality 
27810 If you are used to 5 stars hotel , don t come there , if oyu like 4 stars , come there it s better than all those marriot ; hyatt and others 
27811 The staff was very helpful and patient. My co-workers swarmed the lobby and restaurant like locusts but the hotel staff remained friendly and helpful. The room was comfortable. The view was great. 
27812 Very good location, near atractive places. Too many noisly students (groups of 30/40 boys and girls). Rooms are clean, but very old for 220,00 USD/per day, without breakfast. Very expensive. Staff and service - Regular. 
27813 albergo nuovo...molto pulito...tutti i confort e servizi come da categoria...personale che naturalmente non parla italiano...camera e bagno spaziosi... 
27814 Everything was great with the service, room, and location. I recieved superior customer service from Jason Jones. Thank you. 
27815 Hotel molto buono per la sua ubicazione a due passi dal Central Park e dalla 5th Ave. Camere piccole, ma comunque molto buone, con pulizia giornaliera. Complessivamente un ottimo hotel, comodissimo per muoversi, dato che molto vicino alle linee 4,5,6 della metro. 
27816 The Hyatt folks recently purchased this property from Wyndam and it needs work! You will be disappointed. 
27817 We had read some negative reviews about this hotel before staying here but found the hotel, staff, service and location very good. The rooms were adequate and on the whole thought it was very good value for money. 
27818 Gracious old world service if front desk is busy, check in at guest services. Walk to rock center, UN, central park and more., rooms range from small and stodgy to beautfully refurbished. Make sure you get one of the latter. Breakfast and lunch are fine. Go elsewhere for dinner 
27819 We shared an appartment with some friends, it had great rooms, and a nice livingroom. The bathroom vas a bit old, but clean. Great breakfast, but the eating area was a little on the small side. Nice staff and a short walk from fifth. ave. 
27820 Clean, confy and in a very good location. Great experience! 
27821 I have very good experience with this hotel. Mariel and specially Rapy were very kind, friendly and helpful during my stay. My room was clean and without bad smells and bugs. Every week new clean towels and bedlinen. 
27822 rooms very nice, clean and modern. service excellent and kind i can only say positive thinghs 
27823 I have never got a problem during my staying.Everything is perfect,the bar and the city restaurant very good. Elisabeth Cacovic from the customer service is very polite always giving me assistance always in case i need. 
27824 This is a great hotel for location and transport links. The rooms are very large for New York, clean, with large clean bathroom. There is use of an ironing board and a free safe in the room - would definitely return here when next in NYC. 
27825 very nice nice hotel (dont touch the mini bar) i stayed in a king room ... nice design.. but small ish room. 
27826 The staff of this hotel - from the bellmen to the housekeepers - were outstanding. Made my granddaughters feel like princesses. The location cannot be beaten. Just steps away from everything in the city. We walked to dinner, Radio City - general sightseeing. I would definitely stay here again. 
27827 This hotel is right downtown, beautiful, clean, actually quiet. I would recommend it to anyone. I hope to stay there again! 
27828 Great place for the price. Good location too. Beats the mayhem of staying on Michigan Avenue and good restaurants and bars are nearby. Clean rooms, helpful staff. 
27829 posizione fantastica metro a 300 metri servizi nell'hotel al di sopra delle aspettative.unico neo se possibile la mancanza della colazione compresa nel prezzo.terrazza con vista da brivido. piu' che soddisfatto 
27830 I loved this hotel. The staff were so helpful, you are central to everything. The room was spacious and the details in the hotel were breathtaking. I would highly recommend staying here. 
27831 This hotel is in a pretty central location and is a high end hotel, but the rooms are a disappointment. We could barely find enough room to fit our luggage. We also found a cockroach in the bathroom. Not worth the $ 
27832 Ive been here a while it's very clean the staff is courteous and helpful I'm enjoying my stay 
27833 I really appreciate the grab n go breakfast in the morning coffee is great and I would recommend this place to my friends 
27834 Thanks 
27835 HUGE room with kitchen Spotless Perfect location, a block from times square Front desk were like old friends Terrific breakfast, much better than typical hotel junk Huge by most standards, ENORMOUS by New York standards 
27836 Stayed for 5 nights, handy location if you want to be near Times Square, Starbucks, diner and convenience stores all close by. Rooms are large and the gym is great! We found staff to be friendly and helpful. 
27837 stayed for one night on business. we got to the hotel for check in at 9:00am (normal check in is 3:00pm), and they quickly accommodated us. service was excellent, bars downstairs had a great scene. neighborhood beautiful and close to everything. definitely recommend! 
27838 Great location, friendly staff, updated hotel near Grand Central and fine shopping. 
27839 The Westin was great. 38th floor offered nice city and Hudson River view. Would definately stay there again. Close to times square, theatres and 42nd St Subway station. Nice hotel bar too. 
27840 Nice hotel right in Times Square with helpful staff and decent, if somewhat dated, rooms. Overall I'd go back in a heartbeat -- the price is great, the rooms are clean and the location is in the heart of all the action. We'll be back!! 
27841 Nice Hotel. Very trending. Small rooms. The staff is very helpful. Good location close to central Park and transit station. Definitely recommend looking for specials pricey even for NYC standards. 
27842 Excellent hotel, location, and services provided. Very clean and up-to-date kept rooms. Very quiet hotel for the location. Great view from our window, spent three nights at the hotel. Would highly recommend a booking here. 
27843 Everything everyone has said positive about this hotel is true. I would definitely stay here again. This was the same price as a junk hotel all the way in Jersey that our friends stayed in thinking they were saving money. So glad we went with this hotel instead! 
27844 We stayed in a smoking room b/c there were no more non-smoking rooms, but it was not bad at all. Small but smartly decorated, modern rooms. 
27845 Held a corporate meeting here and really enjoyed the hotel. Staff was great, loved my room and older ambiance. As a runner, loved the fact that I could walk out the door and run along the lake in a minute as well as the great location on MI ave. 
27846 Todo queda muy cerca caminando y es muy comodo donde nos toco quedarnos estaba muy silencioso en el 8 piso y estaba muy comoda la cama. 
27847 Wonderful experience. Room was nicely decorated in updated theme. Very clean. Location was great for city touring.Had a great staff! The bellman ED was fantastic! He knew direction to everything and had wonderful recommedations! We will be back! 
27848 A bit loud at night but the room was comfortable. Convenient location to fun bars and restaurants. 
27849 I always choose this hotel when working in SW Houston/Sugarland area. Rooms are of nice size and always clean. Staff are friendly and attentive to your needs. Breakfast buffet has a great selection of wonderful food. 
27850 Prima hotel, prijs-kwaliteit uitstekend. Schoon, schone handdoeken, goeie en vriendelijke service. Let wel op: als je bij de receptie vraagt een taxi te reserveren krijg je geen reguliere gele taxi, maar een limo-taxi! Een ritje hiermee naar het vliegveld is twee keer zo duur... 
27851 This is a good hotel close to time square, they are rebuilding it at this time so you can get a bit of noice but its not bad. Room was good size, bed a bit small. Next time we will take a big bed to solve that problem :) 
27852 My husband and I stayed here for our honeymoon. While this hotel is quite expensive, it was well worth the splurge. It was complete luxury the entire time. The staff is fantastic, the location is perfect, and the shower is AMAZING. We highly recommend this hotel. 
27853 Good hotel to stay. Very accessible to times square and other points of interest. Food is bit expensive, good view from room, reception is very accomodating, if you are interested to watch broadway shows this hotel is the best location to stay. everything is just a stone throw away. 
27854 This was my first stay at a Radisson Hotel and really enjoyed it The location was great and put me in walking distance to all the places I wanted to go and I was amazed by how quiet the rooms were. I would definitely recommend it. 
27855 We enjoyed are stay and especially loved the Black Gold Bar. 
27856 This was the best place ever to stay in NYC. Quiet street and only 3 blocks from Times Square! Very very clean and being on the 4th floor was fantastic! We will be back! I have already recommended this place by adding it to my FaceBook! 
27857 Good location at excellent price. Very good bed, nice lobby and a real good free breakfast with startbucks coffee machine. 
27858 Small restaurant in hotel serves a full breakfast. Decent, well air-conditioned rooms. Close to all downtown attractions and to 'L'. 
27859 I prefer this hotel when staying at Greenspoint. Rooms are big and recently renovated. The executive lounge has breakfast and a buffet in the evening. 
27860 Excellent location in times square near a metro stop. Gentle and helpful staff. Trendy and chic atmospheric hotel. Comfortable rooms, a bit small for 4. Simple breakfast, no salad and cooked products, but excellent quality. We probably repeat. 
27861 We were in town for a few days of fun and shopping and found these accomodations very pleasant and comfortable. The staff is so accomodating and helpful. Loved the restaurant next door! 
27862 un albergo centrale-pulito e con camere elegantemente arredate-purtroppo il bagno aveva una finestra che dava su uno spazio comune ma per il resto tutto ok.Personale gentile ma non cordiale Mi hanno permesso di portare il mio piccolo cane.... 
27863 Was there for a business trip. Location seemed pretty good. But hotel was tired. Seemed a high rate for being a bit dinged up. But high marks for an attentive and friendly staff. Folks at the bar were nice enough to turn the TV to my game. 
27864 This hotel is a great location for walking around Soho, Greenwich Village and Little Italy. The hotel is modern and up-to-date. The room was small but tastefully decorated, comfortable and very clean. The hotel staff was very accommodating, friendly and helpful. 
27865 excellent Hotel. The staff and accomodations were exceptional. We will be back! 
27866 Good location and facilities. Helpful staff. Access to internet stations are hard. Rooms are very big for New York standards. Would stay here again 
27867 I travel a lot and have stayed in all the greats in NYC. I was booked at this hotel and was quite surprised. Great beds, service and even shampoo! This is now my favorite hotel in NYC. Oh yeah, the pasta pomodoro is to freaking die for. 
27868 This hotel was perfect. The location ideal and the service exceptional. I had one of the best sleeps of my life. I hope to be back soon. 
27869 I enjoy the New Yorker. As a lone traveler, I feel very safe. Staff is always friendly and helpful. I have stayed at the New Yorker the past 12 years for my annual Christmas shopping trip. I'll be back in 2013. Hotel is convenient to shopping and Broadway shows. 
27870 Thank you for starting our vacation off with the most incredible customer service. You truly anticipated all of our needs and desires. We felt welcomed and at home. You exemplify outstanding customer service. The view from our room and the excellent breakfasts ensured our days started perfectly. 
27871 The hotel personell are extremely friendly and eager to help. We stayed in a beautiful and comfortable room. Everything is very inviting and I would never stay anywhere else in Tribeca! 
27872 I stayed at the Majestic hotel in Chicago and I enjoyed it! The hotel lobby is very cozy and elegant. The staff is very friendly and helpful! I would higly reccommend this hotel to everyone who visits Chicago!! 
27873 Love this hotel, we stay at Eastgate Tower every year when we visit NYC. 
27874 Hotel is nice and clean. Staff is friendly. Room has the basics and is nicely decorated. Shower is nice, no bath tub. Bed is firm. A little too firm for my liking, but still comfy. I will be staying here again. 
27875 Fantastische locatie voor weinig geld. 1 Straat van Times Square verwijderd, precies wat we wilden! Hotelkamers zijn wat oud en ruiken muf, dus dat is niet zo'n fantastische entrance, maar voor de rest fijn hotel! 
27876 We loved this hotel. It was small but very nice. The rooms were big, esp by NYC standards. 
27877 3 70+'s (man and 2 women) found their suite comfortable, clean and huge. Their tip is to request a room at the back if you are not used to noise from the street. Breakfast at $4 was a bonus and there was an excellent choice. Location was wonderful. 
27878 The location of this hotel was perfect. It was walking distance to the Magnificent Mile (Coach and Ann Taylor on same block). The rooms were sufficient. Nothing to 'wow' over but clean and sufficient. Front desk was very helpful. 
27879 Free wireless is appalling and the ironing board is only useful if your ironing clothes for someone the size of a oompa - lumpa. Style over substance I'm afraid. 
27880 What a great hotel,was 10 out of 10 for us and would highly recommend this place and would stay here again next visit 
27881 I have stayed at this hotel numerous times and have always had wonderful service 
27882 The rooms are always clean and comfortable and a good size. I love the location, easy to walk up to Times Square or along 5th Ave. to the Park. 
27883 This hotel doesn't have fancy rooms. But it has good rooms and good prices and is in a great location. 
27884 I have spent a better night in a police cell. From the check in to check out was like pulling teeth. The room was disgustingly dirty. 
27885 This establishment knows how to do it right. Everything has been upgraded, the service is fantastic, they respond promptly and always try to do more for you. The owner is on site and is wonderful. This is a great value and I would highly recommend it. 
27886 Nice, clean, new looking Hotel! The area is not the best but it isn't dangerous! Good value for the money! Good Chinese massage just by the corner! :-) 
27887 Nice buffet breakfast. Great suites. Very clean hotel downtown Chicago walking distance to pharmacy and other local attractions. 
27888 Very friendly staff, well located in Times Square, close to everything. Has the restaurants you need close by and on site. Very good prices for the location. Evita was the best and is right on the spot. 
27889 Very close to everything, still you're in a more quiet street. Not bothered by any noise. Ok sized room. Everything fresh and clean. We got a good offer on our stay, not sure it's the best choice if you pay full price. 
27890 I booked this hotel through Priceline. They called it a 4 star. I'm not sure if that's %100 correct, but it's close. The rooms are really small, along with the bathrooms. However for the 1 night that I stayed there it wasn't bad at all. 
27891 Great great location, room is not always so nice though.Airport view rooms are nice, fitness room pretty awesome 
27892 It's a great location and the staff were very friendly. However, face it, you are paying for location. The room was a little worn and the view (10th floor) was worth keeping the blinds closed for. So overall, not worth the $600 a night. Would stay elsewhere. 
27893 Great location and rooms. Parking is 70 dollars a day. 
27894 Location is great, close to Times Square but not right on top. Staff was friendly and helpful.....excellent concierge named Larry. Rooms were large by New York standards. There are some really good restaurants close by. The staff has a list. 
27895 We stayed in the one bed room apartment and it was great. The apartment was super clean, nice and moder decor, huge, with a full kitchen, washing and drying machine, free wifi, we loved it! It is close to the subway and the walk is through a nice are. 
27896 Very easy access. Parking is next door. Staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel has a very chic decoration. My kingside bedroom was rather small, unfortunately, an upgrade was not available. However, it was comfortable and the property is well maintained. Definitely convenient for a weekend convention. 
27897 The staff could not have been more attentive. Derron the doorman went above and beyond. Great location - would definitely book again. 
27898 Walking distance to Times Square, Central Park. Old hotel with very small rooms, but who goes to NYC to stay in their room?!? This is great place for dropping the luggage and resting your head at night. 
27899 The rooms are very big and comfortable The is very helpful and friendly. Conveniently located and not far from the main shopping areas madison , 5th avenue, broadway. The conceirage service knowledge and information is upto the mark. 
27900 Friendly service at reception and nice bar and restaurant. However, for the price the room is sub-standard (at least for this price range. Everything is battered and almost looks second hand. If you are looking for a nice mid-priced (i.e $400+) NY hotel this is not it! 
27901 Atencion, calidad, comodidad, hermoso fue una experiencia maravillosa quedarnos en este hotel, 
27902 This hotel may have a 5 star rating, but it does not have 5 star service with the exception of Dwight at the concierge who was a big help to me. 
27903 Last year in the hurricane, my friend and I stayed it there. Caused by hurricane, water leak from roof, no towels change, no cleaning, unfortunately. Location is good, I recommend you choose here. 
27904 The service at the Barclay Intercontinental is always excellent. Ann Mara Gayle sets up our stay and does an wonderful job! She is gracious and helpful. She adds a nice personal touch to a big hotel. 
27905 For hotel in NY and with reasonable price, this hotel room is ample, location is great and on top of it Free Breakfast and Internet. 
27906 Excellent location. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Breakfast in the restaurant was a good option. 
27907 Small, dark room with a very dirty window. Terrible bathroom with mold and peeling walls. Daily houskeeping was good and that was the only positive thing. I'm not planning to stay there again. Major renovation and clean up badly needed. 
27908 We stayed in a suite that held 5 but had 6 stay and it worked well. Bathroom was modern and spacious 
27909 Kitchenette had a Kuerig and coffee picks that was complimentary. iPod dock, living room that was used as another bedroom for 2. 
27910 An excellent city hotel commanding a perfect location on Central Park. The Pierre delivers a 'boutique' feel combined with exemplary service by all members of staff from waiters, housekeeping to front desk. 
27911 If you looking for a good nights sleep may want to consider your comfort.... foam like mattress too soft and window air condition is less than 2 feet from bed...not an ideal place for a good night sleep. 
27912 Our family (2 adults and 4 kids) stayed in a one-bedroom superior suite. Fantastic value. Tons of space. Nearest subway is a good 10 minute walk away. But that is the ONLY prob. Alex at the front desk and Patrick the doorman were incredibly helpful! Will definitely come back. 
27913 I have been attending a weekly breakfast networking meeting at this hotel for the past 7 years and they give us all great customer service every week. The food is great but the staff is even better. I highly recommend this hotel. 
27914 This hotell is very nice. The service is among the best. Free wifi and good beds. 
27915 Rooms are poor. Beds are good. Television is 25 years old. No fridge on the room. Bathroom is too old. Free wifi. People at reception are very kind. The location is fine. But the hotel needs a complete renovation. I wouldn't go there again. There are better places on NYC. 
27916 Hotel Felix is a totally renovated hotel located in a wonderful neighbourhood. Rooms are rather small as are bathrooms. Lovely amenities and first class restaurant. 
27917 Very nice hotel, good location and the staff very friendly and helpful! 
27918 Position near Penn Station excellent. Friendly and helpful staff. Room smallish but very good value for New York. We would certainly return to this hotel and New York. Jillian. Australia. 
27919 Convenient location, upscale & artistic decor, beautiful bathroom with stone accents, interesting lobby. We had a corner room overlooking 57th, which was terrific, albeit a bit noisy. Everyone on the staff from Larry the Manager who greeted us when we arrived to the bellhops were friendly and welcoming. Good experience! 
27920 Great location! The on site restaurant has good food and with large portions. Extremely comfortable beds, easy parking, nice bar, great views......nothing bad about this hotel!! However, I rented my room through PRICELINE.COM, only find out from other guests that they got lower rates elsewhere. Will never use PRICELINE.COM again. 
27921 I quite enjoyed my stay here. The location is very convenient. Close to Time Square and the theater district. Subway right next door. Big lobby with free wifi. Rooms are clean and comfortable. I would stay here again. 
27922 Good Murray Hill location. Kitchenettes so yo can sleep late and have breakfast in your pajamas. Don't lie, we all know you like breakfast before you shower. Good rates. Knowledgeable concierge. 
27923 Nice, quiet room to relax in after walking all day. Staff was very helpful. Will stay there again. 
27924 Tiny, poorly designed dirty rooms with no amenities and no air circulation and cheap furniture. Terrible front desk service, poor housekeeping response, I could go on forever. Nice architecture in the lobby, though. So at least you got that going for you. 
27925 outstanding service, nice and clean rooms, noise free. Great location, close to subway station and about 20 minutes walk to Central park. Free wi-fi, nice continental breakfast. Estimate 50$/day for parking. 
27926 Die Lage des Hotels ist wirklich unschlagbar, mitten am Times Square und damit mitten im geschehen. Unser Zimmer war alles andere als schoen, aber es ist ja auch ein Stadthotel und fuer einige Naechte durchaus zu ertragen. Das Bad ist sehr renovierungsbeduerftig und die Sauberkeit im allgemeinen koennte besser sein! 
27927 Fantastic Hotel. Superbly furnished rooms. Bar area far too small. They might as well not bother with it. 
27928 Small room, but the best staff and stay in NY. Really, really clean and comfortable!This hotel is just one block from Times Square, the center of everything. Near the subway station and the Theater District. I'll come back soon! Highly recommended! Nothing bad to say about this hotel. 
27929 I was surprised that this place did not have flat screen televisions, but everything else was great. Front desk was nice and helpful. Maintenance guy was great. Driver was excellent. Always on time picking us up. I'll be back anyway, but come on Alden, i need the NFL in HD. 
27930 Hotel pulito, confortevole e in ottima posizione. Un quattro stelle a tutti gli effetti per gli standard americani. Lo consiglio decisamente. 
27931 Stay at the Allerton for a business meeting. The hotel was clean, the room was good. The lobby is very small on the 2nd floor with a small lounge adjacent. The employees were very helpful. I would recommend the hotel, based mainly on its location which was excellent. 
27932 Close to Central Park, Broadway Theatres and Times Square this hotel did not disappoint. Helpful staff do well with a product which is looking tired. Only disappointment was breakfast, following the latest trend of disposable crockery and plastic cutlery. Much nicer to eat out. 
27933 This place is great. The room was clean, good size for NYC and good location. Close to theaters and time square. Good subway connections. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay here again. And, the prices are very reasonable for NYC. 
27934 Great location and very quiet for being so close to Time Square. We took advise of the other reviews and requested a higher floor. Check in was a breeze. 
27935 Good location, near the Mall Gallery Comfortable rooms, but their lighting is a bit dim for those who need to work within. Breakfast buffet is very simple and unchanging, for long stays becomes boring. The staff and valets are courteous and gentle 
27936 Convient location with personalized shuttle service to mdanderson. Bedding,(pillows and comforter) very nice! Unfortunately room temperature was temperamental, and coffee maker was poor. Free bottled water was a plus! 
27937 Tutto bene. fantastica l'ubicazione dell'hotel, molto buono tutto il resto. 
27938 Stayed recently loved this hotel everyone very friendly and helpful The views amazing. Particularly from gym and pool In women's showers on 42 floor a full length window opening onto the lake magnificent Rooms spacious good bathroom great service Would stay there again without any hesitation 
27939 Located near to all the attaractions (only of I could get time), very friendly staff, makes you feel at home. Good service, convenient location and a home away from home. 
27940 Value for money. Airo a bit noisy, as usual in motels. Location on a busy street, but near I59. Clean, proper facilities. 
27941 Dingy old rooms,horrible staff...only good thing is that it is located right on Times Square 
27942 I stayed in an Atrium level room so I had access to the Atrium Club Lounge. there I was able to get breakfast, drinks and coffee, cocktails, light snacks in the evening. Definitely worth the upgrade. 
27943 We stayed here for 7 nights between 26th Dec and 2nd Jan and loved it. The rooms were clean and spacious, the staff were friendly and would do anything for you. It exceeded all our expectations, would def stay here again. 
27944 didnt like the hotel given the area and the crowds in the hotel. hotel was fine oncr it quiet down but could be on a better block 
27945 Dream downtown has a laid back and cool vibe which matches its unique decor. The staff, especially Vaughn Davis, goes out of their way to ensure that guests get more than their money's worth. 
27946 Slightly dated hotel, was rife with noisy tourists and had questionable amenities but the location was outstanding - right near Times Square. Was disappointed in lack of serviceable Internet (wireless unavailable and wired connection was spotty at best) and no room service. 
27947 This hotel is very centrally located, and within a minute's walk from the blue line that serves O'Hare Airport. I found it very comfortably, and would recommend it for business or leisure visits to Chicago. 
27948 Excellent location in Midtown. Updated, clean rooms and amenities. The rate was a great value. The staff and service put the whole experience over the top. 
27949 Everything I wanted in a classy downtown hotel but with a boutique feel. Small enough to be friendly, yet professional enough to serve my business purposes. And my room was heaven! Can't wait to go back.... 
27950 The staff is very attentive, professional and courteous. I have had experience with Martha, Juli and the front desk young lady Priscilla (?). Everything from the wake up calls to the fresh baked cookies. Great place and great location. 
27951 Bedroom and bath are small, BUT the price is right and it was easy to get around from this hotel. Subway right outside door. Felt safe in hotel and the surrounding area. 
27952 I travel a lot and this hotel was amazing! I attended for a week long event. The food was wonderful. Best hotel food ever!!! Staff goes above and beyond to ensure your satisfaction. Hotel is located in Battery Park. Great views! Great place!!!!! 
27953 I stayed here for a couple of nights and the service was excellent especially one of the ladies on front desk - Cheryl I think was her name and she is a credit to the hotel. I would definately stay here again. 
27954 I stayed here for a week and it was a positive experience. The room was very clean and the bed was very comfortable. The TV was outdated but worked perfectly fine. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. I would definitely stay here again. 
27955 Fantastic location! Spotless room, good size, good breakfast. Staff v helpful. Use of computer/printer throughout stay. Highly recommended! 
27956 I have loved in New York for years; when having guests to visit I always recommend Sohotel. No-where else in the city is as well located and affordable. I recently had my mother to visit, who has quite exacting standards (!) and she was extremely pleased with her stay. 
27957 Spent 4 nights here in a city view room with a king-sized bed upgrade. Room was large enough, comfy bed, marble bathroom all OK. View to ESB was amazing!! Convenient location very close to metro station, Broadway, Times Square etc. Good experience, would definitely recommend. 
27958 Loved this hotel it was in a great location, good service, clean rooms. The restuarant was fantastic and we loved the heavenly bed, it was hard to get out of it in the morning! Overall a great place to stay. 
27959 Great location, clean rooms, good price and fine breakfast included! 
27960 Cleanleiness - A Location - A Check-in - D Responce to problems - D Front Door staff- A They decided to test their backup power generator from 10PM to 3 AM - They really did not care that it just may have interupped their guests sleep. 
27961 i have no qualms with this hotel. For a traveler who does not plan on spending much time in the hotel this is a very acceptable hotel. Priced right and quiet. Again if you are looking for comforts of home. TV,ice in your soda, warm snacks try somewhere else. 
27962 My experience in the Hilton Garden Inn Times Square was excellent. The room was very confortable and always impecable. The breakfast buffet was deliciuos with a great variety of good choices. The personnel was so attentive, serviceable and respectful. Great location and great value. I'll definetly come back... 
27963 The staff at this hotel can not be beaten. Their advice was excellent, but mostly they were so friendly. The room was a bit small, and had no fridge but that was it. The location was great, and the hotel was in great condition. The staff make this hotel exceptional! 
27964 The price was excellent. The hotel is located on Broadway and surrounded by great restaurants. Clean rooms and accomodating staff. 
27965 I stayed at this Botique hotel recently and was very impressed. Excellent prices on the web, great courteous staff and lovely accomodaction and use of a great 24 gym 1 block away with a pool! Great location. 
27966 hotel muy bien situado,entre central park y times square a 5 minutos de este. totalmente reformado , con mucho gusto, y muy moderno.pedimos una habitacion cuadruple y nos dieron una habitacion amplia con dos camas de matrimonio comodisimas y un aseo.lo recomiendo totalmente. 
27967 Just stayed at The Muse in NYC and found it excellent overall...very clean, friendly and helpful staff, and location is ideal for mid-town Manhattan/Times Square. I would highly reccommend The Muse! 
27968 Coming to Soho Grand is a great experience : location is amazing, rooms are beautiful. Friendly staff makes you feel like a New Yorker. I recommend corner rooms for their breathtaking view, or floors above 7. 
27969 Great service, great location very helpful people and a LOT of space for the price! 
27970 Thank you to Asya and Talia, who made my daughters and I stay a wonderful experience! Our room I felt was not up to what we requesteed and they qucikly took care of us and all with a smile! Thank you Ladies 
27971 After a nightmare night's stay in another hotel, the Belvedere worked us in for the next 3 nights. They were sooooo helpful and kind to us. The room was extremely clean and quite. The location was great too. I look forward to returning! 
27972 After quite a few bad hotel stays I was happy to have a good spg stay at the westin river north. The staff was great and the manager responded very well after I made a small comment about the bed. Very pleased to be happy with Westin again. 
27973 I stayed for 1 night only but it was wonderful. Location is right on Central Park and 5th Ave. Incredibly comfortable bed and the bathroom was divine! I would love to stay longer the next time i visit NYC. 
27974 I had the pleasure of staying at the Marriott Westchase Hotel for 3 nights. From check-in to check-out the staff was very friendly, hospitable and showed they were happy I was staying there. Overall a great experience. 
27975 Avoid this, if you don't want to sleep with bed bugs. 
27976 Very friendly, clean and excellent location! We walked to see the Bull, Stock Exchange, South Street Seaport, etc. Mario H. is very hospitable in the concierge suite! Great food and service with a smile! He's professional and kind! 
27977 Price is a little bit on the high side but the rooms are quite spacious and the staff really nice, specially Evaristo who is kind of a character. The light dinner and the glass of wine is a plus. 
27978 This hotel is located in a great area. The staff is extremely helpful. The prices are very reasonable. The rooms are clean. The rooms are small, but who wants to stay inside in NYC anyway? I stay here about once a month. 
27979 Sauna was closed for renovation (December 2011); Air-conditioning does not work in winter. I was asked to open the window which was impossible (too heavy) and unpleasant (construction noise outside). Stay did not meet the expectations I had for a hotel in this category 
27980 the hotel' location is excellent. it is also reasonably priced if you look for a good deal (two of us ended up paying $70 each for the night !) and the staff was very kind. highly recommended. 
27981 Hotel Beacon was a pleasant surprise. Very clean and nicely decorated. Staff were helpful and professional. GREAT location for strolling, restaurants, etc. 
27982 Great Location, right on the train line. Walk to Ground Zero, Wall St, Little Italy and Chinatown. Train at the door. Rooms a bit small and lift very slow but otherwise good. 
27983 We loved the location with easy access to all areas. The staff were friendly & helpful. Rooms are small but clean with very comfy beds & linens. Great that you can open the window for fresh air. 
27984 Eu achei fantastico, funcionarios simpaticos, bem localizado ! 
27985 We thought this was an excellent value for the location. Rooms seem recently updated and very clean. Service was good and they are just a few blocks from the subway! 
27986 This hotel was okay. It did not have a traditional hotel bar area. The rooms were average. Hard beds and missing nice bedding. I would not stay here again. Pay the extra money to upgrade to a nicer hotel. 
27987 Room was so small that I didn't have space for my bag. The TV was literally at the foot of my bed. the "desk chair" wouldn't even fit underneath the desk! I had no bath tub. 
27988 Single rooms in the Chelsea Star hotel are quite small, but painted & equipped nicely and very clean. The noise from the 8th avenue is remarkable, but hey, it's the city that never sleeps! ;-) 
27989 This whole experience was great until a member of the housekeeping staff stole one of my checks. I didn't end up out any money - but still. The hotel staff's follow up was fabulous, and they caught the culprit quickly. 
27990 The hotel staff were very helpful and friendly. The James just opened on Sept 1 and we arrived on Sept 18 for 2 nights. It is a very nice cozy hotel! feel like home! 
27991 Yes a good base to stay in Downtown Houston. We only stayed 1 Saturday night. The desk staff were polite and helpful during check in/check out. Car Valet was a reasonable 12 dollars for the night. The hotel and room was clean, functional and efficient. 
27992 Great location, Room was clean, Staff friendly. Would stay again. 
27993 Awful - just awful! Carpets stained and disgusting! Bedding YEARS old!!! Tiles broken and tub all chipped. Walls all smudged. Curtains covered in dirt and dust. I have pics to prove it! Pay more and stay somewhere else. Management didn't care! 
27994 Love the junior suites. Great design. Nice upgrade, one of the largest rooms I've had in NY Lent me an umbrella in the rain! Breakfast always packed. Room service expensive! Bar was good, pricey? My go to hotel in NYC, although pricing very variable. 
27995 John - Worthing UK 25th Wedding Anniversary. We stayed for 5 fantastic nights. We absolutely loved the room, the staff were brilliant. The irish breakfast was to die for. We will be definitely going back to New York asap and will not want to stay anywhere else. 
27996 Great Location, beautiful room, however it needed a desk to work on. The breakfast is served in the Japanese restaurant and was not at the standard that I expected. 
27997 Clean,trendy,great loction. Walk everywhere. Nice staff 
27998 We've have been guest at the London for almost 20 years through a few different management and ownership changes. What has not changed is many of the staff, friendly welcome and great service. And probably the best bedroom for sleeping in New York City. 
27999 Great location...not far from Central Park and all the great shopping. Tea room was very nice. Rooms were 1st class...marble, wonderful bedding and great views. 
28000 AWESOME location and good service. Nice, clean, but fairly small rooms. All in all, everything was at least what we expected! 
28001 Ok, so their redecorating but it doesn't affect guests. The location is fantastic, the staff were friendly and for what we paid we really can't complain. 
28002 Excellent location in Chelsea, away of crowds. Convenient access to subways. Nice terrasse where we had free wi-fi access. Small and clean rooms. Comfy beds. Very helpful staff. Will go back! 
28003 2nd floor is above the bar area. Loud music and conversations can be heard until bar closes at midnight. I would only stay there again if I knew I was going to be out at night. 
28004 rapport qualite prix pour new york, tres interessant , grande chambre assez insonorise et propre. A 5 min a pied de time square, ce"ntral parc, grand central station, mets, mona. Metro a cote de l hotel. Rien a redire 
28005 Stayed over the holiday weekend found this Hotel to be in a great location. Blocks from Times Square and Broadway. Rooms were top notch never had a problem with noise and room was always made upon our return. Would rate as one of the better Hotels we have stayed in. 
28006 Als je hotel in het centrum van Manhattan wilt waar je hoofdzakelijk bent om te slapen, is dit hotel een goede keus. De kamers zijn eenvoudig maar wel schoon. De staat van onderhoud laat te wensen over. Personeel is vriendelijk. 
28007 Though the hotel is old, the room we were given on the 5th floor was "brand new". It was spacious and well decorated. The bed and all coverings were like sleeping on a cloud. The staff was very gracious and helpful. The location provided enjoyable walks. 
28008 great location. Very handy for times square and subway, but still quite quiet for downtown. good facilities, but beds very hard. 
28009 Extremely convenient if you are attending a peformance at Lincoln Center (Met Opera). I give the 15 out of 10 for the reservation process. The staff were great. Nice clean, recently remodeled hotel in central location. 
28010 Location location location!! It's not the most modern of hotels but the room was clean and when we asked to change to a bigger room they were very accommodating and we were not charged extra. 
28011 Great service, room service from Manhattan Diner across the street, excellent location on 77th West at Broadway. Very reasonable price for holiday vacationing. Regular double room is quite small but doable. Room for four (2 large beds) very appealing. 
28012 stay somewhere else in NYC... what a rip off... it was a terrible experience... unprofesional and low budget 
28013 Newer hotel inside and out. Renovated rooms are top quality and are very spacious. Hotel is in a great location on Rush St in the Golden Triangle area. Try Gibsons across the street for steak, and Original Pancake House for breakfast 
28014 One of the most elegant hotel swimming pools I know. Great for lap swimmers. Good sauna and facilities as well. 
28015 I would like to say excellent but am reserving my opinion to be sure after I see if we can return easily on our new membership or not...hearing good and bad things about that so what to see for myself 
28016 Great place to go for leisure 
28017 Had a really good time. Really enjoy the cheescake. We ate at the Hard Rock Cafe downtown Manhattan.. 
28018 looked haunted. no one around but i. nice rooms no help. 
28019 Great location close to the (Sears) Willis Tower....They supply free printing/internet service downtown and they also have free water, fruit and cucumber water in the basement.. Location is great. The rooms are small but for the value it is a good place to stay especially for a biz trip. 
28020 We had 2 rooms on the 18th floor. Rooms were clean & comfortable. You can walk out the door to the Metro. The staff was very helpful. We would definitely stay there again. 
28021 Every single employee asked if there was anything that would improve my stay....very impressive. Having the Acura (free if you book ahead) to run us downtown was so nice. I loved the room, the food, the bar and the Bliss products. It was my favorite stay in Chicago hands down. 
28022 this hotel was right where you could,walk to everything. shopping,subway,coffee shop.just a cozy little place to stay. 
28023 Good hotel, room not very large but very acceptable for NY. Perfectly located. Friendly employees; satisfactory breakfast. I will come back in this hotel 
28024 Loved this hotel; very modern, clean and comfortable. Within walking distance to shopping and shows, great location overall. Serafina's Broadway is also located in the lobby and has excellent food. 
28025 Had a wonderful time. The view over Manhatten from my Cabin in the 25th floor was breathtaking! WONDERFUL! Having breakfast on the Terrace was just great! Yotel was very close to Times Square and Broadway. The Cabins were very clean and The Galley is a great idea! 
28026 Right on Central Park - beautiful view of park. Service is spectacular. They didn't have the type of bagel I wanted for breakfast, so they went over to Whole Foods and bought it for me. 
28027 Nice and spacious room .Not nice view. Overall clean. Very poor breakfast. Old lobby. Good location. Good service. Poor wifi signal 
28028 what a great hotel staff very friendly clean service was great would stay again when going to ny also a great location really enjoyed my sta so close to times square and alot of great dining place thanks st. james 
28029 l'albergo si trova veramente vicino al centro nevralgico della citta'. Pulizia buona , quartiere sicuro,personale attivo ed attento, presente in gran numero. Unico vero problema il rumore assurdo dell'impianto di aria condizionata esterno. Comunque consigliato per soggiorni nella big apple. 
28030 Being stranded in New York due to the volcanic eruption the Pod Hotel could not have being more helpful allowing us to stay from day to day waiting for info. Very comfortable and reasonable rates, would recommend and would stay there again. 
28031 Location on 52nd and Madison was great. The staff was superior. I read some reviews on trip advisor and found it hard to believe that this hotel received some poor reviews. We stayed at LeParker last year and this place was better. 
28032 Stayed at the Sofitel from November 3rd to 5th. Great location. The hotel was spotless, the staff courteous and accomodating and the room nicely appointed. We will be using this hotel again for our New York weekends. 
28033 We were able to get a great price for our recent weekend stay. Even with the $25 charge for valet parking, the price was cheaper than most lesser quality hotels in the downtown area. Very nice job of keeping the rooms up to date. 
28034 This hotel is in a great location in NYC -- across from Carnegie Hall. The rooms were a nice size and clean with a modern bathroom. There's a bar and nice restaurant downstairs. It's a bit hectic at times -- but that's NY. 
28035 Clean, well-maintained, and providing a comfortable bed. Good shower / water pressure. Flatscreen TV; no movies. Tiny - and I mean tiny - room. Hard to walk around. No other frills. At $200-250, a good value. At $610 / NIGHT!?! You have got to be kidding me. 
28036 My wife and I stayed at the Jolly Madison in November 2002, and found it to be excellent value. It's comfortable, clean, friendly and central. The rooms feature internet access, video games, very comfortable beds and well appointed bathrooms. We wouldn't hesitate to stay there again. 
28037 ottimo albergo,a pochi minuti dalla metro (linea rossa),situato in un quartiere molto tranquillo,lo staff cordiale e disponibile.Ideale principalmente per gruppi di amici che hanno bisogno di una struttura solo per pernottare. 
28038 I am never disappointed with this hotel. It is the only place I stay in Houston. They treat me so well. 
28039 rooms (cubboards) are cramped. It has been ages since any maintenaince has been done. Serious doubts about fire safety. The supplied braekfast thru Subways is even worse. 
28040 I booked it thu expedia so I guess some rooms may be better than others. The hotel was clean and nice, rooms were big and location was excellent. Anyways that can only be a 4 star in NYC. Don't expect anything fancy. 
28041 Drivng into town was an experience in itself and finding the Hotel was a relief. It is perfectly situated for either walking to the attractions or for access to the subway. Room was small but perfectly adequate as we were hardly in it. Staff were extremely helpful. 
28042 Staff here are incredibly gracious and kind. From the complimentary lift to my short distance destination to the kindness of a one Miss Maida : ) who helped me without hesitation when I had questions about internet. She, and the other staff go over and beyond! Thanks guys! 
28043 My daughter Chelsea and I stayed for three nights. Extremely clean room...Friendly service and just a block away grom Herald square subway station. Nice and quiet street in the heart of midtown. We will definately stay here again. 
28044 Beautiful clean room. Great breakfast. Hot and cold choices. The service was exceptional! A phone call after check in to make sure that we were happy with our room. I have never received such attention... even in five star hotel. Will return! 
28045 Front Desk agent Donna was so nice Great hotel and excellent value 
28046 Although not a luxury hotel, the location was very convenient. Most things were walking distance from our hotel. The staff was nice, the rooms were clean and cozy, and it was quiet at night. It was a nice hotel to stay at. 
28047 Stayed there on business this week and was very impressed. All the extra charges like 17 dollars for Internet and 57 bucks for parking did not amuse me but overall a very nice property with a very interesting story begins it. 
28048 Superb location, helpful staff. Great suggestions of things to see, where to eat, shows, and transportation. Clean rooms. Friendly staff. Interesting surprize from Amanda Berman, a welcome bottle of wine. 
28049 Albergo in ottima posizione, tra l'altro a pochi metri c'e' una fermata della metropolitana. Servizio attento e cortese. ottimo il ristorante (black duck) annesso. La Camera e il bagno sono molto piccoli, l' armadio e' quasi inesistemte. La pulizia sufficiente. In generale buon rapporti qualita/ prezzo 
28050 Very clean , friendly staff, good cont. breakfast and great location. Chicago , the show was a fiewc blocks away as well as time sguare.Will stay here again next month. Took the train to Penn station then a subway up town very easy to get to. 
28051 Brilliant hotel. Good value for New York. Only complaint would be that the heating doesn't turn off so it can get very warm. Fantastic location near a subway. The shared bathroom was always very clean, 
28052 I really enjoyed my stay here. The room was very nice and the beds were extremely comfortable. The staff was friendly and the breakfast was decent. Within walking distance from Time Square. I will stay here again. 
28053 room very small but clean. You can not ask a palace for this price in New York City. Very good location. Recommended for small budgets and short stays. 
28054 My husband and I stayed here for a week. We enjoyed being away from all the tourists, and several metro lines were close by. If you want a quiet area with good restaurants stay here. The room was clean, cool, and comfortable. 
28055 I stayed this hotel for 4 nights for business. I reserved on the web page saying it had wi-fi, but it didn't. My colleague went to the nearby Starbucks for it. My room was clean but very small...though it didn't matter very much because I didn't spend much time there. 
28056 Clean, quiet and friendly. Hotel also has a fantastic restaurant (Bull Run). Too bad more New York hotels don't run like this one. 
28057 First of all,,Great Location. Hotel was Super...Hotel Staff Extremely Friendly. Beds Extremely Comfortable Niceeeee linens. Large Plasma TV with DVD Player. The Shower was Great !! Incredibly Powerful...sweetttttt. This is a Very Relaxing Hotel....Nice and Quiet....Will Stay here again and again. Free Internet........Hedge 
28058 My mom and I stayed at the Barclay October 12-17. The location is great, the service was impeccable and the staff was very friendly and accomodating. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
28059 excellent experience location is ideal, walking distance from 5th Ave , subway station, etc. loved the cleanliness, gym equipment fairly new. Enjoyed the Bliss spa as well and loved the green apples in the lobby at all times! Staff very helpful also. 
28060 Stayed at Chatwal---fabalous hotel--Elizabeth at front desk---the best----Have stayed many five star hotels --this ranks with all-----Richard-S.-----Pa. 
28061 Great location, small room (room 712), spotless. My only complaint was that it was little warm and I had to run the AC for awhile even though it was in the 30's outside. 
28062 Fint hotel. Ville oenske at vi havde fundet et hotel paa vest siden i stedet. 10 min til naermeste metro, 20 min til central park og 3 min til Ritz dinner hvor man kan faa morgnmad for det halve som paa hotellet. 
28063 I stayed here August 24/25 2012 for the Michael Jackson Fanvention. The room was great. I used the exercise room and the computer room. We had a dance party event in the restaurant, lots of fun. I felt safe and comfortable the entire time. 
28064 We stayed here for a girls weekend and it was perfect. GREAT location, good service, lovely rooms, reasonable prices. I would recommend to anyone traveling to Chicago who wants to stay downtown!! 
28065 I spent a night here and it was amazing. I loved it completely. From room service to the gym an bar, everything was perfect. Highly suggest it too :) 
28066 The Comfort Inn, LES is an outstanding destination. Tremendous value, clean rooms, good breakfast and a very accommodating staff. In addition the Lower East Side is fun and adventurous. 
28067 Looved the ambience - roof top and view of entire NYC from the balcony Food - delicious Drinks - strong but good Price - reasonable Service - could be better 
28068 Paid the extra $5 for a suite and was definitely worth it. King bed was great with the extra foam padding. Breadkfast was nice as was the staff. Very clean and well maintained. Only drawback was the hot tub was not heated. 
28069 The hotel is clean and kept up to date. There are two active bars and the rooms are a fair size for NYC. The price is great for the location and style. 
28070 Well what can i say....nothing really good or bad. It is big, impersonal and cold by Intercontinental standards. It is more like a big Marriott that attracts conventions. Good location, but for the price I paid, I will go to different luxury hotel in NYC. 
28071 My wife and I stayed for 5 days. Great location and access to transportation. The entire staff was very friendly and helpful. 
28072 This is, hands down, the best midtown hotel I've stayed in. The rooms are immaculate, the complimentary breakfast is superb, and our floor was extremely quiet. Safe and easy to access location, easy walk to Penn Station or Grand Central. Would definitely stay here in the future. 
28073 Great hotel, great location, middle Manhattan - close to everything, walking distance to all main attractions, subway station right in front, wonderfull staff!!! definetely comming back!!!! 
28074 localizacao atendimento limpeza custoxbeneficio estadia perfeita em chicago 
28075 I love the hotel- we had a beautiful suite-incredible design and quite comfortable. The staff was friendly and professional. 
28076 Location was great- soho, little italy, china town. I would recommend the hotel. 
28077 We had an absolutely Fantastic time at this hotel, the location (a minutes walk from Times Square) is great, the rooms, while small, are clean and modern though they can seem a little under lighted, the staff are friendly and more than helpfull. All round a great hotel. 
28078 The large and well appointed rooms are the highlight of this hotel. There are good Internet offers on the hotel's own website from time to time. 
28079 Staff really friendly, room was spotless. Stayed at the back of the hotel so no view but also no noise. Ideal location for shopping, sightseeing and dining. 
28080 Top notch. The girl who checked me in remembered my name days later. The room was super clean as was the bathroom. Being in Midtown it was a short walk to many, many things. The only thing it lacked was "Old NY charm," as it's a contemporary French style. 
28081 We've stayed at this hotel twice now and have enjoyed each stay. The hotel is within walking distance to Central Park, a subway station and many local restaurants. We love the quaint feel of the hotel and its location in a more residential area of town. Excellent hospitality. 
28082 Stayed for a weekend jaunt to NYC with the wife. Room was great, room service screwed up our order twice, but made up for it by genuinely apologizing and then either not charging us or cutting the bill in half. Irish breakfast was phenomenal! 
28083 The hotel was beautiful, staff very friendly. I found my bed to be very old, to the point that I sunk/rolled into the middle when 2 of us were in it. Breakfast was nice. The food hall under the hotel is fantastic. 
28084 The room wasn't bad but the service from front desk was horrible. Overcharged on my card for parking and no one wanted to assist me. I expected much more but got much less than ever expected. 
28085 Spotless room, amazing private steam baths. Great team at the front desk. The views are amazing. 1 block to trains. Stores, restaurants, clubs all in walking distance. Breakfast downstairs in Co-Op with Michelle is an experience all on it's own. Simply the best! 
28086 I am not allowed to use the words I would prefer to use to describe this place. They should be ashamed. Without a doubt the worst place I've ever stayed. It's like paying to sleep in a really seedy dorm room. 
28087 This is a centrally located hotel in the middle of the Magnificent Mile. Near restaurants and some of the best shopping. Hotel is spotless, and operated by capable and conscious staff. A great restaurant, The Grill< and awesome bar. A Starbucks in the lobby. 
28088 superbe chambre , avec vue sur central park a 3 minutes pied , faut essayer les amberger de la place , tres typique et pitoreste mais tellement bon je la recommande sans hesiter 
28089 This hotel is lovely. I recently returned from a 2 night business trip, and quite seriously the Eventi was the best part of my trip. It's gorgeous, impeccably clean, and the staff are very nice. Also the bed was unbelievably comfortable. Go! 
28090 I stayed at The Roger for 2 nights for a business trip in November and really enjoyed my stay. Very nice boutique hotel. Clean and up-to-date room. Very friendly and helpfull staff. Everything you need to enjoy your stay NYC. 
28091 Great hotel. Friendly and helpful staff. Only had breakfast in the hotel restaurant which was very tasty! Nice clean bedroom with tasteful decor. Very knowledgeable staff on concierge who provided honest advice on best way to book excursions and to see shows on Broadway. Would stay at this hotel again. 
28092 Prima locatie om Manhattan te verkennen. Een heerlijk rustpunt na een dag in de stad. Service is goed, alleen moet er wel overal voor betaald worden, zoals internetverbinding, bagage storage. Desalniettemin een aanrader. 
28093 Small marginally clean room with a large broken TV. Slow elevators with one not working. In spite of previous good reviews, the hotel is tired and over the hill. Would not stay there again. 
28094 We chose this hotel based on Trip Advisor feedback. Pro's - separate fridge, microwave & crockery for eating in. Complemantary NYT & USA Today. Very friendly staff. Con's - small room for a quad (we were 2 adults 7 2 children). We got room with no view, but was quiet. 
28095 Don't hesitate this hotel is clean, big rooms, and great location. I was on 15 th floor and was surprised how quiet and nice the room was. Excellent and courteous staff as well. 
28096 My wife and I found the staff to be very rude and decided not to stay. 
28097 We were upgraded because our room was not available(smaller) and the next day rather than move us they let us stay for duration. Living room and 2 bedrooms!. The people at front desk were wonderful and the location can not be beat. Very pleased with our New York experience. 
28098 It's different looking from a traditional hotel. modern, bold, good looking. excellent service, friendly employees and GREAT location to visit new York. Near Theater street, subway, public transportation. rooms are weird in a good way. not traditional decoration. sushi downstarirs is good as well 
28099 This hotel was adjacent to the training that I was attending. The amenities were great and the food was very excellent. 
28100 Excellent location.The hotel have everything that we wanted. 
28101 Stayed here oct 15th: walked in, got a comfortable room (spacious!), friendly service and a acceptable price (its nyc after all). Comes recommended! Negative point: shuttle service to airport was half an hour late. Not good when you have to catch a flight. 
28102 I live in Connecticut and i frequently travel to NYC for the weekend. I love the Wingate, it has very friendly staff and an amazing location in Midtown Manhattan. I highly recommend staying there, no complaints. 
28103 The hotel was clean, comfortable and well located. The staff was professional and the room was a good size - I was able to conduct business and use the fitness center without any problem. 
28104 Big, really big rooms, spectacular views, balconies, kitchen, more than 1 bathroom in your room. Where else can you get a balcony in NYC and pay less than $250 a night? Decor may be a bit outdated, but place is very clean and service is friendly. 
28105 This could be the end of your trip!!! don't go there!! it ids not worth the discount, you'll have the worst vacation ever - read other reviews... 
28106 Eden made my mom and other family members feel like roalty. The rooms look absoloutly amazing. Very modern and confortable. All the staff were very friendly and most accomadating. The location is perfect. Around the corner is willis tower (Must see). 
28107 Enjoyed staying at the Millenium Broadway. The location could not have been better. Reasonable price for Manhattan. Everything was in waalking distance. 
28108 This hotel is located very conveniently in downtown Chicago. Staff at front desk were also very helpful. But the bed was as hard as a rock and they are stingy with towels. Shower head was awful. No pay-per-view movies available. 
28109 Good location, 3 blocks away from metro. Rooms are pretty spacious with a separate closet room. Nothing too fancy, but all the things you need for a good night rest. A very comfy bed, clean room and good housekeeping service. We stayed facing the courtyard, which was nicely quiet. 
28110 I was very pleased with our stay. Staff was friendly and location was perfect. Hotel was well kept. The size was about what you would expect from a location a half block off Time Square. Just far enough off to quiet it down for a good nights sleep. 
28111 I have stayed at many Hampton Inn's and this Katy/I-10 West location is one of the best! Everything was perfect, including their very Texas friendly staff! 3 great restaurants next to hotel and is located close to very popular Westchase and Galleria areas. 
28112 The hotel was clean and nice. The staff was friendly but the rooms were DARK. Dark floors, dark shutters, dim lights. This is not a lady friendly hotel, since the lighting is so poor. 
28113 Nice place, clean, spacious, great bed. Temperature control was so-so. Neighborhood not elegant, but good Chinese restaurant around the corner. 
28114 Excellent service, very comfortable and pretty room with good sized bathroom. Enjoyed being on upper east side for a change, 
28115 From the great rooms to the fab lounge area its a great atmosphere and a great place to chill and to make new friends. 
28116 we spent 3 nights in this hotel and I can honestly say we were not disappointed. Ideal location, comfy beds, quiet and safe, all staff courteous. Always helpful with queries. It was truly our home from home and we will return. Highly recommend. Thank you ! 
28117 Very nice European style hotel with a good breakfast included. A great value. Great location and nice service. 
28118 love this hotel-Rooms were nice and the staff was very polite and helpful as well. Perfect location in New York!!! I would definitely stay there again 
28119 What a lovely, well situated hotel. Friendly staff, clean rooms and the door staff helped solve any issue. Stay on as high a floor as you can. Two reasons: a, the view b, manhattan is very noisy at night and the higher floor helps with sleep. 
28120 Booked two rooms and we got a refurbished room which is super comfortable and our friend unfortunately got the old rooms, and was unable to change as hotel full. So if booking definitely request refurbished floors. 
28121 The hotel was less than 2 blocks from Michigan Ave, located almost right in the middle. Room was large and spacious. Would stay again. Highly recommend the river tour of the architecture of Chicago. Staff helped arranged. Very accomodating. 
28122 They oversold. I arrived in the middle of the night, dead tired and waited 20 minutes before being transferred to another hotel 30 mins away. No offer of anything to make up for it. Do not stay at this hotel. 
28123 My business partner and I stayed at 60 Thompson for 5 nights and we are really impressed by the service, the architecture, the food, the beds...there's absolutely nothing to fault this hotel -although it took me a while to find the hair dryer;-) 
28124 We stayed in this hotel in December 2010. we thoroughly enjoyed our stay here, the location was perfect inbetween Katy and Galleria Area. Staff excellent, clean, comfortable and convenient. Parking wonderful. Laundry facilities, perfect for a family with kids. Nice family breakfast. Great atmosphere. 
28125 Stayed here during a 3 day road show, very nice hotel. Great food. Had a nice suite, which was spacious, and clean. Recommend this to anyone. 
28126 We had a two roomed suite for two adults and three children which was a decent size. The rooms were spottlessly clean. The staff were both friendly and helpful. Great location and breakfasts were reasonable. We would return without hesitation. 
28127 Good location. Clean Room and bathroom. Decent sized room with comfortable bed. What else do you need in a city where people go for shopping and visit sights not glued to their rooms/lobby/swimming pool????? 
28128 ...I would have loved it more. Overall a wonderful hotel. Navigating the hallways can feel a little maze-like after a few glasses of wine:) GREAT location. 
28129 We stayed here for a friends wedding. It was beautiful and very comfortable. Great location as well. 
28130 I've been stayed there for 4 nights. it's a wonderful hotel. It's a huge hotel, very friendly staff and great location. Nice clean room, good proximity to shopping area. Close to the park. Good ambience. 
28131 Stayed in this hotel last week including the day of the big snow storm, very comfortable hotel excellent value, superb location for Times Square and the Theatre district. Staff were more than helpful, making the unplanned extra nights accomodation painless. 5 Stars 
28132 This was a very convenient location and a nice hotel. Rooms were modern and clean although a little small. Hotel restaurant was excellent, good food and several choices on the menu. Staff was friendly and helpful. 
28133 This was our 1st New York experience and we weren't dissapointed. The only negative would be the reception staff, maybe they were just busy. Also concierge area always had queues, couldn't even get a question in. Anyway would recommend. 
28134 Our first trip to NYC and found the location of the Hotel to be fantastic - right at Time Square. Staff were very helpful and friendly. Rooms are small but well appointed and clean. 
28135 The staff was friendly and helpful and I really enjoyed the decorum of the rooms. The staff was very informative about transportation, local attractions, and restaurants. 
28136 Een veel te duur Hotel, echter wel op een mooie plaats. Het personeel is er zakelijk en heeft geen gevoel voor service. Ga ook nooit in het restaurant van het hotel eten. Ze serveerde mij beschimmeld fruit met yogurt voor 23 dollar. 
28137 Great location, very reasonable price, very clean and excellent facilities. Staff very friendly and helpful providing a pleasant homely atmosphere. Nice touches include free wifi, laundry facilities and free access to a computer and printer so you can print out online bookings, maps etc. 
28138 If you don't mind staying all the way downtown, this Marriott offers spacious rooms and courteous service. It's also near Ground Zero and good shopping (hello Century 21). 
28139 Stayed here for a conference. Very modern - renovations are wonderful. Only downsides were small size of bathrooms in the rooms & the pillows were too squishy for me. Common areas were great - love the lobby bar. Location is awesome with access to both Michigan Ave & Rush St. 
28140 Short walk from subway and Port Authority Bus terminal. Clean, modern hotel. Free internet terminals in lobby. Friendly staff; very gracious about getting me an early checkin after arriving very early from red-eye flight. 
28141 Love this new Westin. Great staff. Nice il mulino bistro 
28142 second to none in NY, the soho grand is a home away from home. its always a pleasure to come back and sad to leave. great staff, beds are amazing, views are incredible and its a cool place to hangout. 
28143 The Sweet Dream bed by Serta as advertised is very comfortable. Together will down feather pillows and duvets you will have a sweetdream sleep. The restaurants are average. Recommended for business traveller. 
28144 Colleague and I stayed in two Houston Marriotts on this trip and we're going back to the JW (The Airport Marriott is horrible). 
28145 Very nice hotel. Friendly employees. Room comfortable. Open lobby concept. 
28146 No problems at all here. The hotel is extravagant and quite beautiful. I would stay here again in a NY minute. I loved the historic touches and detail that the hotel provides. It's a side of the Big Apple that I have never seen before. Well worth it. 
28147 und wir hatten im Juni 2011 darin ein Doppelzimmer angemietet. Mit dem Zimmer, dem zuvorkommenden Service de Personals und der sehr zentralen Lage waren wir mehr als zufrieden - SEHR EMPFEHLENSWERT ! 
28148 Spacious rooms, free wifi and complimentary continental breakfast (with doughnuts). Great location close to time sq and down from central park. Wonderful place. Able to leave luggage after check out and they even arranged a private cab to the airport. Concierge couldn't be more helpful. We'll be back. 
28149 The Palmer house is an old, stately, ultra service hotel. All the service pople employed were extemely attentive, punctual, and informative. Great little lobby bar.The rooms are clean but the bathrooms are smaller because of the age of the hotel. We did not eat here but the menu looked passable. 
28150 Nice hotel. Good location. Very small rooms. I have stayed at the Hilton and Sheraton on west side and they both had much bigger rooms. I was traveling alone but I think the rooms are too small if you have more than one person. 
28151 We enjoyed the location at Times Square. It was also a great way to be front and center for the Thanksgiving Parade. Rooms are small, but typical for New York. 
28152 We recently stayed at The Casablanca Hotel and from the moment we were welcomed into the hotel we knew our holiday had begun. Great setting, great hotel, great staff, great experience. Thankyou very much. 
28153 Wife and daughter received the best treatment ever from Ivan at the concierge desk. A job well done! The personal service delivered was above and beyond expectations. Would highly recommend this property for its location and service. 
28154 I enjoyed this hotel, very nice deco, furnishings and design. Room was clean and with good amenities.Good Service overall friendly staff. Has a security deposit box in the room. Free shuttle service to major restaurants and venues in downtown. Good Breakfast. 
28155 Loved the location, been to NYC several times and chose this hotel for its central location, not disappointed! We had a great view down on Times Square. Friendly and helpful staff. 
28156 I have MS so am mobility "challenged". I had to travel to NYC on business with my wife. The hotel handled my needs adequately. The location (and cost) can't be beat. 
28157 Has the ambience of a fine European hotel. We enjoyed our stay very much. 
28158 Stayed here for a quick business trip. Our New York office is very close to this hotel. This is an excellent hotel with a very friendly staff. 
28159 We have stayed here several times (10+) and with the exception of when they raised the rate on me several years ago, we have never been dissatisfied. I would have to say this is my favorite hotel in the world. 
28160 El hotel tiene una ubicacion privilegiada, times square a la vuelta de la esquina, los teatros de broadway super cerca, las salidas de los camiones para los tours a una cuadra, me volveria a quedar ahi por la excelente ubicacion que tiene. 
28161 Ottimo hotel centrale vicinissimo a central park e alla 5 strada, fantastica vista dalla camera, se vi va provate a vedere sorgere il sole dalla camera la mattina... Consigliato vivamente PS bella camera grande e spaziosa 
28162 Excellent value, did not feel unsafe in the area at all. Bus #22 runs downtown 24hrs and takes around 30 minutes. Free coffee and donuts for breakfast, rooms are clean and well kept. 
28163 It's a perfect location because you're near restaurants. Suites are more than comfortable. Great hot breakfast. They give you discounts for local eateries. Staff are adequate. We like this hotel for business trips. Good value and a great breakfast. 
28164 The room was very simple, but a pleasant complimentary breakfast and the fantastic staff on the desk who helped me with a hire car that failed to turn up made it a wonderful place to stay 
28165 This is much more like a boutique hotel. Small and intimate. Staff like you find at the finest hotels. The only oddity, for as lovely a room, plastic cups. We asked for glass and they did provide us with some. Will definitely be back. 
28166 We stayed here for 3 nights and had a great experience. The staff were friendly and helpful -particularly Showtime and recommended some great restaurants and attractions. The hotel is in a great location a short walk from all the popular downtown destination, would definitely stay here again. 
28167 We just came back from New York and I had to say we loved this hotel. Room was very clean. Room and especially the bed was BIG! Only bad thing was the view, which was poorly (back yard). Satff was friendly and helpfull. The location was absolutely the best thing. 
28168 My family and I just spend four nights at the Mulberry hotel, in NYC Chinatown. The hotel has recently been refurbished ans is very comfortable, the location downtown is very convenient and the people are very friendly and nice. All that for very reasonable rates ! Congratulations. 
28169 Great hotel Great staff, only one draw back only booked in for three nights. 
28170 not impressed with staff, rooms kept clean,good location, try losing those few pounds you want to , just to fit into the rooms ! only person there with a smile and good day was doorman, 
28171 I stayed at the Courtyard Midtown east for one night on May 2012. Big rooms, very clean, good service. Very good location in Midtown East, if you would like to avoid the hassle of Midtown/Times Square. Bottom line - great value. Booked the hotel at Lastminutetravel. 
28172 I stayed on a Saturday night with my girlfriend to visit some friends of ours. Rooms are clean and efficient. The front desk staff is professional and pleasant. Our first room had a terrible smell to it and the toilet was running but they quickly moved us into another room. 
28173 This hotel is at a strategical location. You can visit Manhattan very easily. Staff is customer oriented, always smily. The rooms are bigs and the view is magic ! 
28174 Perfect location, courteous and friendly staff, our room was very clean, kind of small but very well appointed, love the Eurpoean vibe of the hotel, breakfast was wonderful. 
28175 Great choice for a New York City stay near Times Square. Clean rooms, staff very friendly and helpful, location excellent for a sightseeing tourist. Felt like me and my family got what we payed for here, would recommend to anyone looking for a NYC hotel in this price range... 
28176 Enjoyed a great stay recently. Was upgraded as a Platinum to a great room. Had a great workout in the gym with the very friendly Westin Workout manager Sam providing assistance. 
28177 great hotel clean quiet comfortable secure, nice bar, starbucks coffee at the bar each morning with croissant and yogurt. right in the middle of time square so easy walk to shows shopping eating etc. not inexpensive but nothing in that area is. 
28178 We stayed here for one night, night before the hurricane and the check in was seamless. Front desk was polite. We've stayed in Chelsea before and the location is great. By Macys, Bryant Park, close to Times Square and 2 mins away from the subway. Will be back for sure. 
28179 Great service, nice amenities and special service. Thanks to TK for the chocolate greeting. Also, the staff was willing to knock themselves out to help me when I needed it. I would definitely stay at the W City Center again. 
28180 Quick and easy access to train and subways. Price reasonable. Room service expensive. 
28181 Car got broken into along with four others the first night. Marriott had no cameras on the floor of the garage where my car was parked. They were no help and told me basically too bad and it's not their fault. Never again will I stay at a Marriott 
28182 This place offers a wonderful location on 57 between Park and Lexington. 2 Blocks to the subway on 59th. Very clean and easy access. A little on the Modern/Euro side. There is also a roof top bar. This is a Marriott, so your points can apply. 
28183 I stayed here one night for work. The rooms are typical of a city hotel - small. Very nice and modern decor. Nice bathroom. Staff was friendly and very infromative. Good location with many bars/restaurants right around it. 
28184 Allerton Hotel est tres bien situe sur magnificent miles tout est a distance de marche proche du metro et des lieux touristiques L hotel est bien entretenu et le staff tres gentil mais les chambres sont un peu petites 
28185 I have never slept better in my life! What more can one say? 
28186 I have been staying at the Affina for the last four years, it has improved every year. The location is great, the rooms spacious and the staff helpful. Maureen at the concierge is super, so are the bellman always so friendly. I highly recommend staying here for business or pleasure. 
28187 Stayed in the hotel years ago and it has been updated and is very nice. Showers and bathrooms are spacious and a very nice fitness center plus access to running trials in grant park. 
28188 I thought this was a great location, close to Herald square and 5th ave. Room was comfy and clean and staff was nice and accommodating. Thought pricing was good as well for a city hotel and since it was business I def would;d return. 
28189 I was on a business trip to Houston and had the pleasure to stay here. World class facilities, good breakfast and warm staff at the restaurant. A special mention about Domingo T Martinez Jr who was a great host during my breakfast. 
28190 Great service, fun atmosphere, rooms are gorgeous yet a little small but I would definately stay here again!!! 
28191 Flight canceled at 10 pm, called hotel from red carpet club and had room waiting for me - asleep by 10:15! 
28192 close to the bronx, I didnt feel myself secure. At night do not even try to go out! the pictures of the apartment have nothing to do with the real ones... Extremly expensive. Far away from downtown... taxi cost me 30 USD. 
28193 Probablemente una de la mejores experiencias en hoteles que he tenido. El cuarto, el staff y el servicio fueron de primera. Lo que mas me gusto fue el Bar, pese a que estuvimos paseando por varios en NY no encontre uno mejor al del Jumeirah. 
28194 A little off the beaten path in NYC but close enough to walk or catch a ride via subway. The front desk will help with catching a ride if you ask (make sure to tell them your needs). Hotel was decent and clean. 
28195 Perto de tudo! Tem ate uma Copa pequena na quarto com microondas. Cofre. Banheiro ok. Tem ate um Restaurante brasileiro com Churrasco! 
28196 Hilton hotels are the best. Never had a problem at any Hilton brand hotel. Great room with updated features. Def worth the price 
28197 Nice location, rooms were clean and staff was very friendly. Enjoyed the music in the lobby bar on friday nights. 
28198 Stayed here for business. Rooms are Hugh. Clean and well furnished. Valet parking was convenient. Didn't eat this trip but last time I ate here the food was good. The rooms are larger than most downtown hotels. Bath and shower are also larger than most all down town hotels. 
28199 I wish there is a selection to choose for "no star", because that's the score they are getting! We found roaches in the room, unknown bugs....and room service is bad too! I don't know why they are still in business? 
28200 Stayed the weekend. The staff was efficient , room clean and price fair. The exercise room and the pool are nice. The hotel is in the middle of everything. Everything you want ot do is in walking distance. 
28201 If you want Time Square then location is great, a large hotel that feels like designed for conferences. The upgrade to Atrium Club is probably worthwhile to get a larger room and apple mac with free Internet plus breakfast in the club, which is pretty good too. 
28202 Excellent design and location in Midtown. The best/ largest rooms I have seen in Manhattan. Excellent staff, great concierge. The bar/ public areas can not match those of other NY hotels. 
28203 At the front desk, Maddie and Rita, both, make us feel welcome, and happy to see us. That means a lot to us. jason, the bartender, is the greatest. 
28204 Lovely rooms with ample space 'no tea & coffee facilities which was a mino inconvenience and not allowed to take hot drinks to the room from the bar' But Cafe directly opposite the hotel - So no bother really,,, Most comfortable beds ever --- Would strongly recommend staying here :) 
28205 we loved staying at the westin times square! great location! awesome room! everything was great! i would definitely stay there again! 
28206 Wonderful staff that was very helpful. Great location with shopping and attractions within walking distance. Clean, quiet and beautiful rooms, we had a view over the Empire State building. Great breakfast with fresh strawberries and blueberries! 
28207 Great Location, clean rooms - however VERY small - I didn't even know they made rooms this small. 
28208 Dreadful service and 1hr25m queue to check in...only to be told it's our fault that we wanted to checkin now. 
28209 Location, service, value, consistency, quality ....... Time and time again it just doesn't get any better than the London. 
28210 Enjoyed staying there. Room was not updated, but was acceptable. Great location. Lobby was beautiful. Room was small, but it was a special deal. Bar was too expensive. I would stay there agfain with the same special deal. 
28211 I was very worried after reading the awful reviews, but our stay was great. The room was large and clean, with a queen bed and a pull-out couch. The staff was friendly and helpful, and the location was great. 
28212 I had my son's graduation party in their party/meeting room and everyone was so friendly and helpful!! I also had several rooms for guest and they all enjoyed there stay! Everything was nice and clean and again all the employees were so friendly and helpful. 
28213 My daughter and I stayed here for five nights, we loved evey moment, any problem we encountered was delt with promptly and efficiently! Brunch too expensive! 
28214 upgraded to park view, offered early check in, late check out, and fruit sent to room as gift for daughters graduation. Fantastic service and hotel. Location was perefect. 
28215 This is truly one of the best hotels ever! The service and staff have no comparison. This was my second time staying and I will never stay any where else in NYC. 
28216 Centrale e servitissimo, poca eleganza buona sostanza. Ottimo punto di partenza e arrivo per passeggiate senza meta nella mirabile Manhattan. Servizi essenziali stanze semplici ma confortevoli... e tutti i suoni della metropoli al vostro orecchio... la quinta strada comincia li... appena dopo il parco di fronte all'Hotel. 
28217 A most enjoyable stay. The room was clean and comfortable. The hotel is well situated. 
28218 Hotel senza troppe pretese, pulito e confortevole, situato in posizione strategica (zona Broadway) dalla quale si possono facilmente raggiungere luoghi di interesse come Times Squares e la Fifth Avenue. 
28219 Very nice hotel in the heart of Times Square!!! Nice renovated rooms with comfortable beds. Did not eat at any of the two restaurants but they look good. Would stay here agian!! 
28220 Our stay at the James Hotel was exceptional. We loved our accommodations so much we barely left the room. Staff was very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be looking to return. 
28221 Stayed at the Allerton for business great central location. The main downfall is the elevators they are slow and small during busy periods you may wait 15 minutes to get one. Overall this is a very nice clean older hotel. 
28222 Overall a nice hotel -- attractive, spacious, clean, extremely convenient location for McCormick Place. Unfortunately, our room was noisy due to an apparent wind tunnel-effect, which made sleeping difficult. The bellhops and valets were friendly and helpful, and made our return trip to O'Hare very easy. 
28223 The Astor was Excellent value. The staff on the desk were helpful and courteous. The rooms are very clean and comfortable for the price. I would recommend the hotel any time. Thanks to all for an excellent stay. 
28224 My husband and I spent our honeymoon weekend at the Morgans and I'm so glad we did! The hotel was lovely with great views. The staff was kind and attentive and most importantly, everything worked and the place was spotless. Continental breakfast was also great. I highly recommend The Morgans! 
28225 This hotel is moderately priced. It's in a good location, just two blocks from Central Park and less than ten blocks from the Metropolitan Museum.. The continental breakfast was quite good with cereal, yogurt, juices, bread and sweet rolls, coffee etc.. The room was quite clean and comfortable. 
28226 Affinia Hotel is a nice place to stay in NYC, it has an excellente ubication, we have an excellente room with a living room and the bedroom separate... I like so much!! 
28227 had a great experience at the Parker. Right next to central park, Times Square, Rockefeller center, and all the legal offices in Manhattan. Lots of great food and entertainment places within a short walk. Fun bar at night and great breakfast options right in the hotel. 
28228 fantastic location during our stay in NY. The staff at reception was quite unpleasant and the rooms are a standard level. Of course the view is spectacular. Sant Patricks is in front of the hotel which complements the view. A nice place to be. 
28229 Het Salisbury Hotel is centraal gelegen in Manhattan. Schuin tegenover Carnegie Hall. En op loopafstand van Central Park en Times Square. We hadden een goed voorziene ruime kamer. Het hotelpersoneel was vriendelijk en behulpzaam. We hebben een aangenaam verblijf gehad en kijken terug op een fijne vakantie. 
28230 very friendly people with very clean environment. we where flooded in with a weeks worth of rain and they where very hospitable. 
28231 Overpriced, too far down Michigan Ave. Not clean. OLD. No amenities. I will never stay here again. If you're going to Chicago, stay at the Sutton Place, Hilton Palmer House, etc. 
28232 It doesn't get any more uptown than this. The Surrey is the perfect size. The bar and restaurant are top notch. Rooms....perfect. Check it out, you won't be disappointed. 
28233 Staff was very attentive to all our request. They go the extra mile to make your stay very comfortable. I am already making this place my home away from home. Looking forward to the new restaurant and bar next year. Thank you :) !. 
28234 Ho soggiornato al nyma dal 30/6 al 6/7 direi che io e la mia famiglia ci siamo trovati bene sia come posizione ma anche come acoglienza in hotel 
28235 ha piedi ragiungi tutti i posti piu'inportanti di new york, se dovesi andarci ancora prenoterei lo steso hotel 
28236 Tres bon hotel pour visiter Chicago (a cote d'une station de metro et a 15min du centre ville a pied). Propre et relativement coquet (plus qu'a changer les rideau un peu vieux style). Pour point negatif, nous retiendrons le manque d'isolation phonique avec le couloir (pas avec les chambres). 
28237 El Hotel esta muy bien ubicado, las habitaciones comodas y limipias, el desayuno es bueno y cuenta con un Starbucks. Dentro del mismo hotel puedes arrendar bicicletas para recorrer Manhattan, buena relacion precio calidad, 100% recomendable. 
28238 I stayed last August while on a baseball road trip. Great view of the river. Large comfortable room on club floor. Room service was good. Near plenty of restaurants, I recommend Harry Carey's Steakhouse! 
28239 ....As fast as you can AWAY from this hotel. Dark, filthy, dangerous, crowded. HITCHCOCK on meth. Makes the chelsea hotel of the early 80's lopok like the RITZ. 
28240 Its fine if you don't mind sleeping with cockroaches and bad service. The place has tiny cramped rooms. Do yourself a big favor and spend a few dollars more and get a room without bugs in a quieter, safer and cleaner neighborhood. 
28241 these people will go out of there way to make sure you have everything you need. everyone i spoke to was so freindly. i actually loved the housekeeping ladies they were fab. i cant wait to go back to this stunning hotel and room service was to die for. 
28242 My daughter and I stayed June 2-5th 2011 in the city checking out Performing Arts schools. Staff was friendly and helpful, hotel was quaint close enough to major attractions, far enough away from the hustle and bustle!! Will definitely stay again and soon! 
28243 Perfect location close to Central Park, Fifth Ave and Times Square.The hotel has somewhat past it's prime but is still charming. The rooms are big. Try their American breakfast which is rather cheap and surprisingly well asorted. 
28244 prima hotel, midden in Manhattan Konden zelfs online inchecken en onze boardingpasses uitprinten. De ontbijtruimte is te klein voor het aantal hotelgasten, maar je mocht je ontbijt meenemen naar de hotelkamers. Zou een volgende keer ook weer dit hotel boeken. 
28245 Great hotel, very nice staff, clean, and great for the price. got hotel on priceline and got upgraded to deluxe room and it was wonderful, no complaints except that food at Raffles was not good. 
28246 Stayed here for a baseball game. Very easy to get downtown. Neighborhood could be better but no incidents. 
28247 A tiny lobby facing 34thE. The same street as Macys on the West side. A little walking and your into some great shopping. Our room was huge with a king bed. A grand desk. We were on the 18th floor which allowed for some good views. 
28248 Steps off Times Square, nice rooms, stayed 2 nights, great for a short visit. 
28249 stayed here for the weekend to drop my son off at college. It was a great location to the school. The staff was very friendly and helpful. Shout out to Will the bell hop! I plan to stay there again to visit my son this winter. 
28250 Nice stay-highly recommend! Great service-got a late checkout to sightsee-No problem. Clean room and bathroom. Had an IMAC in room!! Nice pool and buffet was well worth the $19.00 if you are hungry, I had a 20% coupon upon check in. AAA rate was under $260.00. 
28251 Spent the last part of our honeymoon here and can recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York just a 5 minute walk from Broadway and the hotel itself is clean and the staff were really helpful. 
28252 I stayed at DoubleTree for two nights from July 26 to 28. The Hotel is at a nice place near Wall Street and only 2 minutes to walk to the closest Subway Station. The Lobby is beautiful and staff are friendly. I strongly recommend this Hotel!!! 
28253 Just stayed a few days at this nice 'boutique' hotel in the center of it all. Just a few steps from Times Square and our favorite theaters. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Would absolutely stay here again. 
28254 Would recommend this hotel in a heartbeat. Clean room, priced right. Small but enough room that you don't feel cramped. Tub and shower. Soft big towels. Bedding plush and very comfortable. Will stay there again on our next trip to the Big Apple!! 
28255 I have stayed at this hotel a few times, and everything about this hotel is very good, with the one exception, that it can be a bit pricey, compared to other hotels in the area of the same caliber. 
28256 Got a free upgrade to a suite which was very nice. My co-workers room was average size. A decor is a bit old and dark. Staff seemed nice during check in. Free internet. 
28257 everything was good exept the size of the room,it was much too small for four people.it was so small ,we even couldnt put our luggage somewhere on a decent place. the beds were also very small.My advice: make it a room for two 
28258 Excellent location, close to Central Park and near good food options. Interiors were dated and in poor condition. Biggest negative were that all the reception staff were extremely unhelpful and plain rude. The pool was a great the kids, being in summer. 
28259 The location is great. Rooms are spacious and clean. it's furnished minimalistic. but has what you need. Very little noise from the street. The building is old and you can see this some places in the room. Friendly staff. Would not recommend breakfast at the hotelbar. 
28260 We took their Wicked Package. Fantastic deal. Our seats were center orchestra. Free Parking. Room was comfortable. Great location. Staff very helpful. 
28261 Good little hotel, clean, comfortable, friendly and just enough in the rooms for a short stay, ie tv internet access. Bit noisy due to air con systems throughout the hotel. but hey its New York who cares. 
28262 I loved the dream hotel but it wasn't a cozy type of hotel, it was more like a modren hi-tech sorta thing. 
28263 great budget hotel ,this hotel is a good base to see the sights ,not that expensive and has a good amount of food stops near it ,we seen loads of new york with this hotel as a base ,an older hotel but has a bit of 50s glamour 
28264 Small rooms but you are in NYC. Good location to Times Square, subway , bus theater district. Kitchen had everything you needed. Shower stall small if you are a big person (no tub). Free breakfast was excellent variety a great value. Would absolutely stay again. 
28265 If you are going to the south loop, museum campus, Grant Park or Soldier Field this is a great location to stay. The hotel is in an older building, but very clean and that staff was very good. No problems noted, I would stay there again. 
28266 From the moment we arrived until the moment we left, all personnel, especially the people at the front desk and concierge desk were friendly and so helpful. Our room was clean and a great place to sleep. Highly recommend a stay here. 
28267 Its walking distance from the park. Also very good access to public transport. The rooms are really very small and the space around the toilet was smaller than tat of a aeroplane. It was very clean. Some of the staff was extremelly friendly. 
28268 awesome location right near central station, great concierge, very clean. no complaints will go back again. 
28269 Got away for weekend stay that isn't far from the house and kids. This place is rather new just three years old and it was really clean. Enjoyed all the home amenities such as fullsize fridge stove dishes and flatware. 
28270 I came to the W through a recommendation, but was sorely disappointed. There's a lot of flash and attempts at innovative design, but it's without purpose. Add the fact that the staff were not particularly wonderful, and you've got the recipe for a disappointing stay. 
28271 great location. very large rooms for new york, clean and frendly, good value for money , best of all the pillows. tina from london 
28272 The staff was friendly, room service was great, and best of all - it was very clean. I will definitely go back. The only thing that could have been better - bed was uncomfortable - cheap mattress. 
28273 rooms are ok for the amount of time spent in them,clean and comfortable,the location is superb,on a return visit would stay here again. 
28274 I really liked this hotel, the location was great, they had a WI for my kids to play so I could get some piece of mind, and breakfast was included. Convenient location to the loop and the river north area. 
28275 For business travelers looking for the comforts of home in mid-town, this hotel is the best. Its always very clean, roomy and the hotel staff is friendly. The restaurant is excellent for the breakfast buffet which awaits after a warm and friendly greeting from the most gracious hostess Hannah McCauley. 
28276 albergo comodo hai servizi di autobus per il centro.(circa 30 minuti di bus) Situato vicino a supermercati, centri commerciali e ristoranti. Abbastanza facile da ragiungere.... Personale veramente disponibile per dare informazioni sui posti dove andare a mangiare e da visitare nei dintorni, nonche' disponibile per qualsiasi problema... 
28277 Me and my mum went shopping in New york and stayed here.Fabulous location,friendly staff and clean hotel.Will be returning next year.Thank you so much to transportation at the hotel who organised our return journey to the Airport.Amazing service would totally recommend to anyone and everyone.Happy holidays x 
28278 I paid only $170.00 for this great location hotel. The lobby is very small. The breakfast is standard budget hotel fare. The room is great. The bathroom and shower are very good. The bedding in Marriott hotels is always very comfortable. I would stay here again. 
28279 Tastefully understated, this is a wonderful hotel, excellent location, and the staff was delightful. I would recommend it to anyone....anytime! I can't wait to stay there again. 
28280 as mentioned is the other reviews, generally its ok for the price, but no free meals: small rooms no elevator somewhat of a maze on the other hand - a good location in a quiet area, near the park and the museum. 
28281 People - do not even think to go there - better rent a cardboard box on a Time Square. Woke up because there was a bug in my ear... Should I say more? NFW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Health is more important then budget!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
28282 Hotel staff were friendly , courteous, and helpful. The room was clean and beds very comfortable. A good value on Michigan Avenue. Within walking distance to many attractions. Great stay. 
28283 The Marcel at Gramercy is a beautiful hotel! I felt welcomed and at home thanks to the service I recieved by Raul. He was very friendly and helpful. 
28284 Older hotel with smaller rooms, but very clean and efficient. The price is right and the location is perfect for shopping and dining. I would recommend for people looking for a good value. 
28285 Near Times Square and subway. Small but clean and tidy rooms. Liked breakfast. Very polite reception!!! 
28286 We stayed at your lovely establishment for 3 weeks last year in September. Your staff were wonderful and friendly 
28287 A clean room is very important to me and the management of this facility ensures that the rooms are very clean. The work out facility is sparce, poorly equipped with cheap, non-commercial equipment. The front desk staff are knowledgeable and helpfull. 
28288 What a wonderful experience we had at your hotel! The front desk clerk, Nitin, should be commended for his excellent customer service skills. Thanks for making our visit to New York a memorable experience. 
28289 Great Hotel Location is excellent Service is very good and clean room 
28290 in the heart of manhattan is easy hotel with really small room, clean and well located.. few hundreds of meters from subway.. it's good saving money in nycity if you don't need much.. it's well security and well clean 
28291 The hotel was great the staff not so much. I love the cleaning staff and the check in staff. but the front desk staff were very childish!! I would def recommend this to MANY people and stay again!! 
28292 My three day stay was delightful. Doorman, bellman, front desk, concierge, and last but never least, housekeeping, were excellent, professional, and FRIENDLY. No attitude and super service oriented. Clean, quiet, and very very comfortable--I had everything I wanted. Complementary extras were most thoughtful. 
28293 What a nice location. Nice hotel with a few extra ammenities. Great rate savings through RSI. Pleasant staff. Clean rooms. Good breakfast. Close by a mall and dining. I can't think of anything to complain about. 
28294 Hotel is in a great spot close to NYC's finest shopping and top attractions like Central Park, Rock Center, Times Square. Service was outstanding. Although we we traveled with a 10 year old I would not recommend this hotel for families. Did not eat at restaurant so no comment. 
28295 I like everything about this hotel. It's great value, clean, the people are friendly, it's in a good location yet a quiet area. I'm telling everyone I know about this hotel. For one or two people this is the place to go in NYC. 
28296 Friendly staff, great price and great location! Had a wonderful stay. Simple continental breakfast and very clean. 
28297 After reading some of the reviews of this Hotel,we thought we had maybe made a mistake.How wrong we were.The Hotel is perfectly placed for Central Park,Time Square and Broadway theatres.Staff are very friendly and helpful.Rooms are very clean,and are cleaned every day.Would I stay there again? Oh yes,I,ll be back. 
28298 The least attractive part of this hotel is the street on which it is located. The interior is an oasis--clean, attractive, modern. The breakfast was basic but free. Room busy but not unmanageable. Staff friendly and efficient. Excellent location for restaurants and attractions. 
28299 Rooms & bathroom are way too small, noisy inside & out, power points don't work, heater makes loud noises during the night, shower looks dirty & takes ages to warm up etc etc etc....not worth what you pay for it! 
28300 This is a great place to stay--attractive, clean, convenient. At the center of the action, yet surprisingly quiet. Wonderful complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese in the evening. Very helpful staff. 
28301 Great location, very helpful staff, nice comfortable room, would definitely recommend and stay there again 
28302 Great, spacious room (suite); great service; great midtown location to enjoy Christmas-time in NYC. Will definitely stay here again! 
28303 My room was small but very well-appointed and as one person how much space do I really need? It was stylishly decorated. Loved the eco-bath products. They were having an event in their breakfast space but nicely laid out some pastries, coffee and juice on the ground floor. 
28304 Some night noise (this is a party hotel). Indifferent bar service. Westheimer is a busy street, so getting in and out is stressful. But the hotel itself is luxurious and I keep coming back here. Very W like although it is not related 
28305 This hotel aspires to be ultra-modern, but they fail at the basics. No hot water. Really? Give me a break. Very slow wi-fi speed, reminds me of dial-up. Cold rooms, won't let you go beyond 72F. Rock hard mattresses. 
28306 Just spend 5 memorable days in New York, wouldn't have been the same if we stayed anywhere else, room and bathroom was great, much bigger than expected. We had a lovely view down Park Avenue. Everything is close by. Staff very friendly and helpful. 
28307 Bottom line- had to sleep on the floor. The room, ammentities and property don't warrant its 5 star status. Better can be found in a better location for much less. 
28308 Good proximity to Medical Center. Staff very helpful and friendly, especially Maria, Vilma Chano and Don at the cafeteria. Thanks for such a wonderful stay! 
28309 nice hotel old but remodeled has a breakfast buffet but dont accept the rooms of the back 
28310 Great boutique style hotel. Good for those that have never been in NY 'cause it's located in times square near every most tourist attractions. Very clean. 
28311 cet hotel est tres fonctionnel avec son spa ideal pour les fins de journee de viste de la grosse pomme 
28312 les personnel est reactif et tres agreable 
28313 je le conseil a quiconque veut passer un bon sejour a new york ; 
28314 It's very hard to find a good hotel in New York for anything other than ridiculous prices, but Fashion 26 seemed to be quite good value in New York terms. Reasonable sized rooms and nice touches like an excellent coffee machine, free wireless internet and delicious cupcakes on entry. 
28315 Great location for visiting family in the NW/Willowbrook Mall area. The room was large and the kitchenette convenient when we didn't go out for meals. The bed was comfortable and the room was clean. Access via door keys and stairs was excellent. Staff were friendly and informative. 
28316 Stayed here November 2011 with my mum for her 60th birthday, it was a fantastic stay, especially the suite upgrade, which was amazing! Great location for shopping, and it's an iconic building inside and out....it's a must stay place in NYC! 
28317 great for shopping as it was at the end of fith avenue, close to everthing 
28318 This is a ghetto motel..they have hardcore porno movies streaming in TV, not good for family. Cheap but dirty, old, and indecent. 
28319 Hotel about seven minutes walk from Broadway and Times Square. The reception staff and Room service is very courteous and helpful. The rooms are clean and spacious And breakfast was varied and tasty. 
28320 Spotless room, execellent bed, good towels, freindly professional staff, great location, easy to get the subway and a cab. These folk went out of thier way to be helpful. I spend a lot nights out of town and this was a superior experience. 
28321 Whilst the location was ideal, the room was very dark as it had very littel natural light 
28322 Lighting was required to find your way to the bed - during the day! Service and general welcome were poor. 
28323 Hotel is in a great location, clean and customer service was exceptional!! 
28324 Book hotel for meeting. First class service. Differently recommend. NRG Energy 
28325 Great hotel - ideally situated, about 5-10 minutes walk from main attractions. Only stayed there for 3 nights so didnt really use alot of the facilities - staff very friendly and welcoming. 
28326 Fantastic location!! That's all I need, not gonna spend much time there anyway. And last time I did have the lowest price room, it was clean and just what I needed. I will go back. Thanks Wellington, I had super time in there =) 
28327 I previously stayed here before for a business trip last year and it was a no brainer to return. Like before service was great! Looking forward to my next stay. 
28328 The staff were great, accomodated for everything we wanted. The hotel is extra clean, and they do everything to make your stay pleasent. Certainly coming again. 
28329 The Belvedere was wonderful and the reviews have been absolutely correct. I loved the location and the staff!!! I will definitely be staying there again. 
28330 Dormimos en este hotel solo 1 noche, la de nochevieja, y estuvo genial.La situacion de 10 y el hotel de mucha calidad.Lo recomiendo como hotel de placer. 
28331 Nothing bad with this hotel. Nothing. Ok , the elevators could take some time during rush hour but we would never change this hotel only for that. It is worth it! Will absolutly stay here Next time in NY. 
28332 They gave us a free upgrade into a newly restored room but for some reason they didn't know that you couldn't shut the bathroom door. The location was great, no problems with staff. Downside was no free breakfast included and there is only an outdoor pool. 
28333 My family and I stayed here for 6 nights. The hotel was situated in an ideal spot as there was lots to do nearby. It was very quiet inside though. The rooms were fine and everything was very clean. I would return here. 
28334 Clean, great location, comfy bed. Room was small but big enough. Bathroom was too small. No place to even put a toothbrush in there! Would stay here again and upgrade to a larger room. I am a gold Marriott member and was not offered an upgrade either 
28335 Always a great stay at this hotel. Bernie and the rest of the staff know who you are and treat you like family nit just a guest. 
28336 We brought our daughter with us on this trip and had a lovely time. The hotel staff was very helpful and the concierge made sure we got to the right places at the right time. It was a great trip! 
28337 Have stayed here many times and each time was satisfying. The room prices have always been very competative for NYC. Central location is perfect for business and leisure. On the lucky occasion of getting a park view room the stay becomes very special. 
28338 Lovely hotel in a great location. Rooms were clean and a good size, but bathrooms were a bit small. Very nice inside and out (much niver than 4 star hotel in this country). Food in restaurant was nice, but a bit expensive. Would stay here again. 
28339 Friendly staff, conveniently located to Times Square. 
28340 I've been going there for business trips to NYC for 18 years now -- wouldn't think of staying anywhere else. Terrific rooms, awesome staff! OH and did I mention the breakfasts at Norma's and the food at the Burger Joint? First class all the way! 
28341 Elevators need to be fixed Hair Dryers need to be supplied in the rooms. If complimentary breakfast exists, guest should be made aware. Computer access in lobby should be complimentary with a 15 minute time limit. 
28342 My third stay at the Muse was in early December, and again a wonderful experience. The room was great, quite and warm, staff helpful and friendly, and once again the location can't be beat. I travel a great deal, and have made The Muse my hotel of choice in NYC. 
28343 Terrific hotel for the price. Very tiny room but good location, pleasant staff and great breakfast. We travel to NYC about every 4 weeks and would definitely stay here again 
28344 I stay here a lot for work, love it. The staff is very friendly and they recognize me now, which is nice. Occasionally get a cheese plate or snacks in the room after I check in. Nice but pricy bar downstairs as well. 
28345 We had a perfect stay at InterContinetal Barclay. Very clean and & comfortable rooms and a great view. Lee Tang / team was very friendly and helpful. Great location for sightseeing and shopping. Walking distance to metro, shopping, restaurants, central park and sightseeing Great airport transortation / Transfer to JFK. 
28346 nice big rooms, staff very friendly. smart chritsmas shopping in january we loved everything 
28347 The front desk clerk was very accommodating when I asked to check in early -11am- since I told her i wasn't feeling well. In fact, she went to the restaurant to get me club soda. The room was great - wonderful bed. 
28348 Just a mgreat place to stay. VERY convenient and comfortable.............and we live in New York. Will be back. 
28349 The Millennium Hotel Broadway was top notch. The service was excellent from the moment we checked in. The front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Housekeeping did a great job too. Our room was clean all weekend. Had a wonderful stay. 
28350 great service in general the staff was incredible great food and room service 
28351 We spent two nights at the Radisson in January at a great price. We had a king size bed, nice linens, a desk and a great view of the Chrysler Bldg. Bathroom was small but ok. Location is good for getting around NYC. We're going again in Feb. and March. 
28352 Room on 6th floor was noisy. AC fan terrible. The cleaner always forgot to do something. The two elevators were very small. Take a ticket to ride it on rush hours. Not acceptable! 
28353 Nice hotel. Directly across the street from Waldorf Astoria. Next to subway entrance. 
28354 HOtel was great! Staff was friendly, room was updated and very large and kitchenette was a bonus!! Beds were comfy, anything needed was delivered right away. Very reasonably priced.Close to Grand Central. Would definitely stay again. Ask for higher floor for a great view! 
28355 This hotel is flawless. Brand new and attention to every detail. The bed/sheets are incredible, TV setup is perfect, room service food is makes it hard to leave! I will stay here everytime until they price me out. 
28356 Great location, quality, and price point for college visits. The hotel is hopping with business and the lobby is large and good for people-watching. Thin walls, but excusable at this price. 
28357 It was a wonderful stay here with my colleagues. Everyone was so friendly. I had to stay here 2 weeks, which is long time away from my children. They made it mroe bearable. Thank you 
28358 Great location - close to subway and bus! Breakfast was awesome! Comfortable room and great staff. Would def stay again... 
28359 I have nothing negative nor have any complaints to say about this hotel. Staff are pleasant and overall hotel experience was very pleasant 
28360 Stayed at the Mansfield in November2005. The hotel was in a perfect location. The staff went out of their way to help us. Rooms were spotless and cleaned every day. Loved the bar area. Would stay again. 
28361 Great location and friendly staff. The property next door was under construction so the noise early morning and at cocktail hour was deafening 
28362 Stayed eight days at this hotel and was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness,neatness and overall treatment. Very pleasant and helpfull front desk attendants, relaxing atmosphere and by the way...no shortage of towels. Will definitely stay here again and reccommend my friends to do the same. Keep up the standard! 
28363 My wife and son and I spent 5 nights in this lovely hotel. The suite was very comfortable with all the necessary amenities and more.Extremely friendly and courteous staff who go the extra mile. Highly recommend. 
28364 Verouderd hotel met hele trage liften. Wij zaten in de noordelijke vleugel, wat betekent dat de 2 verschillende hele trage liften (1 tot de derde etage en dan naar de andere lift tot de 7e) moesten nemen. 
28365 there for work, schedule changed, stay at hiltons 30+ times a year, still billed me $300 for not being able to cancel within 2 days... poor service for Hilton honors members, per manager, no exceptions! 
28366 We operate several group tour series with this property. We have never had a complaint about the hotel quality or location. I would rate it at about 3-stars. Great people to work with! 
28367 Our stay at the Westin Galleria was very positive. The staff was helpful, very courteous and the room and overall facilities were very clean and a pleasant stay. 
28368 We stayed here dec 18 2011. Very nice hotel and I am extremely fussy. Very clean rooms and very very comfortable beds. Would definitely stay again! My only complaint would be I wish they had a little more lively bar area. 
28369 The Blakely Hotel is in a great location near shopping, Central Park and Time Square. The rooms are a decent size and nicely decorated. Only sheet and bedspread on the bed not giving much option for coverage. We will definitely stay here again. 
28370 The Bowery Hotel was a refreshing change of pace from the boutique modernist hotels that had sprung up everywhere by 2007. Its late 19th century/pre-Gilded Age decor was gorgeous. Drink service in the lobby was excellent. The staff were all top notch. Can't wait to stay here again! 
28371 Perfect Located in the centre of Manhattan, near to subway stations and at a safe area. The rooms were very clean, the bathroom too, newly decorated, but with a little bit rude personel. 
28372 Amazing Hotel, location is perfect as it's in midtown of Manhattan. You can easily walk to anything. Staf was very friendly and helpful, breath taking decor, room was stuny and very clean. Just perfect for my first time in New York City. 
28373 Fantastic hotel, immaculate and clean, very helpful staff and great price and location. Place could not be better for budget hotel and had a fantastic room with great view. This is in a great position for trains, biuses or walking. So good we got engaged on the rooftop garden!! 
28374 Stayed here for 6 nights over new year. Fab hotel, fab room and even fabber upgrades. Its well worth being a member of the Ambassador programme to get the most out of the hotel. 
28375 It was the first trip to New York City for me and my 11 year old daughter. The hotel was very clean and the staff is very friendly. Excellent location! 
28376 this is a new property that is a great ny value. the rooms are typically ny small but nicely decorted and furnished. the staff is exceptional. a good ny value. would stay here again. only downside is difficulty getting a cab. 
28377 Super ! Mooi uitzicht, 5min lopen van Times Square en goeie bediening 
28378 Room is not bad, but old furniture and bad odour. People in the reception very rude. I found an old blood stain on my sheets. I almost puked. This was enough to never go back there. I do not intend to stay there again. 
28379 Right in the middle of all the action in NYC. The rooms were spacious, clean and quiet. We even had a view of the river. The best part of the hotel was the extremely comfy beds, especially after a long day of sightseeing and walking! 
28380 We staied at this hotel for three nights and I must say that the service was perfect, the hotel and room wre nice and clean. Our room was spacy if compared to NY standards. I reconmen this hotel to everyone. 
28381 Excellent hotel. Clean rooms, not to big but comfortable. Friendly staff and convenient location to go into town and from and to the airport. Continental breakfast included, but is not so good. And the breakfast room is very small and not accomodated to serve all the guests in the morning. 
28382 Dit hostel voldoet niet aan verwachtingen. Natuurlijk heb je alleen een douche en een bed nodig maar schoonhouden is echt ver beneden de maat. De foto's die wij van te voren hadden gezien komen ook totaal niet overheen met de werkelijkheid! Locatie is echter prima. 
28383 A property that is feeling its age, but with spacious rooms and a good location. I had a great deal of difficulty on connecting to the Internet, and eventually gave up, using my I phone in stead of my computer. 
28384 great hotel, situated over the highline. cool smallish rooms, excellent views from both sides (meaning every room), and a great leased bar up top. skating rink in the winter. love this place. 
28385 Although still quite stylish its an older building and its not quite up to W standards. Had a corner suite looking out over the square but was relatively small. If you can get good rates then maybe worthwhile but at $900 a night it felt overpriced. 
28386 Switched rooms to get "closer" to the wireless, just to not have it work...nor did the ethernet in either room. Water running through pipes in the walls woke me up....2x. 
28387 In New york it's all about location. This hotels' location was perfect and made up for the average facility. 
28388 excellent hotel, gave value for money and a superb location only two blocks from Empire State Building. This hotel has excellent facilities including a roof top bar that gives really good views. It is close by to bus and metro links to which the later I would strongly use. 
28389 Excellent location, right next to the Handcock Observatory and a few meters from the Magnificent Mile, the Raffaello Hotel was a very nice surprise. We have to mention the excellent cafe at the ritz carlton across the street where we had very good dinners and breakfast. 
28390 Ja conhecia o hotel antes de fechar para reforma , que nao existiu , fui com a minha esposa e para minha surpresa quartos velhos , sem seguranca de subida para hotel e o pior de tudo o aquecedor fazia um barulho que nao da para dormir ! 
28391 Friendly front desk and housekeeping service- however starbucks service was not that great in there... coffee tasted like sour milk and barista said the milk was not bad- didn't aplogize, asked if i wanted her to make another one with the same milk! did not offer free breakfast 
28392 excelente hotel muy comodo super servicial el personal muy practico por su ubicacion y prestaciones muy recomendado 
28393 Excellent location, super clean,very warmly Is one of my favorite hotel in ny 
28394 Hotel room had two nicely sized beds. Staff was incredibly helpful and cheerful. The hotel had great style and natural light. The rate was quite affordable and the location was very central for many of the NYC attractions. I will be back! 
28395 Great hotel nice staff, great setup. Fantastic location to get to the entire city. 
28396 Looking forward to my next trip back! I truly enjoyed the meal and the service afforded me last week. I was very impressed. The presentation and the quality of the food was great. It was so fresh and I told many of my coworkers. 
28397 We stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. Overall the hotel is nice but you can tell it has been around for some years. It's clean and the absolutely best thing about it are the views of the city. It absolutely makes it worth staying at this hotel! 
28398 Great hotel! fast lift service, clean room, very comfortable bed although too many pillows!!! This hotel is fantastic for the broadway lover:) 
28399 The Hudson hotel deserves a 10! The staff was extremely helpful! From the concierge, Matthew recommending the best restaurants to James, a bellboy always helping us get a cab! The Hall, has amazing food! Our rooms were nice and spacious! 
28400 I have been there for 3 nights. The rooms are great and luxurious. we had an awesome downtown view. 
28401 Nice corner room (junior suite), a magnificent view. Ok breakfast and service. Weekends a good price quality ratio 
28402 great hotel in a fantastic location,, easy walking distance to most sights and plenty o bars and restuarants nearby.. just along the street on 10th theres a great old style diner for breakfast..will stay there again.. 
28403 Trevliga omgivningar och nara till sevardheter i midtown, latt att ta sig med metro till andra delar av stan. Hotellet kanns lite gammalt men har finns alla bekvamligheter och service du kan behova. Superfint gym! Rekomenderas! 
28404 un lindo hotel, con habitaciones espaciosas, limpio y con muy buena atencion del personal! un desayuno completo y esta cerca de todo. No es muy lindo de noche la calle, pero es muy segura. 
28405 Great boutique hotel in superb location. Service is outstanding. Great bar in lobby with great atmosphere. Not cheap but overall well worth the money. 
28406 No complaints about service and the junior suite was a real treat. Had a great view of Central Park. A little bit pricey but it is a Jumeirah and it is in New York City. 
28407 This was a comfortable place with well decorated rooms. The staff were friendly and willing to chat. The location was convenient and the price was excellent value. 
28408 Got a great deal at the last minute on booking.com and was blown away by the caliber of hotel for what we paid. The rooms are large and well appointed. The location is great and the staff cater to your every request. 
28409 We had a great time in NY at the Metropolitan hotel. We were in a newly renovated room and it was very comfortable. The staff is helpfull and friendly. The concierge is very efficient and guided us well on a lot of sightseeings. We highly recommend it !!! 
28410 Right in the middle yet quietish street, free breakfast (lots of cheap carbohydrates - always a pleasure in New York), good quality toiletries, tea and coffee on tap, a little bar attached with decent food and not too bad prices, hotel not too big and friendly staff...we would stay again! 
28411 We stayed and the room was clean and all the staff was friendly. Very good value. Will stay there again when we return to Houston in November. 
28412 Very friendly and helpful staff. Nice rooms. In heart of downtown. 
28413 3 adults and 1 child shared a 2double bed room and even though the room is small (normal for Manhattan) it worked out well...decent breakfast...good service etc. No problems getting the one elevator and we were on 7th floor. Great location..what else is there to say! 
28414 Great Hotel, loved the location close to subway. Dont stay here if you cant handle Chinatown markets and smells. Fabulous breakfast included. Only down side is that romm was very very small. 
28415 Very contemporary, and a bit different then we are used too, but we really enjoyed our quick overnight here. Gave us a European contemporary feel for a family that is used to more run of the mill hotels. Well done. Thank you. 
28416 Like all W hotels, a nicely styled room and bathroom, very comfortable, contemporary, great bed. The walls are a bit thin. I could hear normal conversation easily through the wall. It's a bit of a walk to Michigan Ave., and a good 15 minutes to get to the El. 
28417 Perfect location, outstanding service. Warm, comfortable lobby and lounge area. Grand room (one small window was the only negative). The Italian breakfast could use an upgrade. How about some juice and better pastry/breads? 
28418 I really enjoy staying at this hotel. It is always clean and the service is excellent. The hot breakfast's are alway delicious too. We used room service and it was on point. Thank you so much for your hospitality. 
28419 It was such a great experience. The staff was helpful and super friendly. Can't beat the location. Which really enhanced our trip to NYC. The room decor was very tasteful. What a cool place to stay. And we will return soon. 
28420 I've been staying at the W Times Square for years now, and it is my hotel of choice in NYC. The location is perfect, the staff is incredibly helpful and friendly, and the overall service is stellar. 
28421 Luxury like I had always dreamed of at this hotel. Great service and extremely comfortabke bed. The E train subway station is across the street and very convenient if coming from JFK. Great location in proxmity to lots of sites. This place did not disappoint. 
28422 Thank you to all the staff, most enjoyable stay, very clean, polite service, very helpful, great location close to everything and nice new rooms recomend the Hotel Beacon very highly.Thank you again 
28423 We were somewhat hesitant to stay here after reading reviews on noise at night and we did not have one issue with noise from other rooms or the street below. The rooms were clean and the service was great. Definitely would stay here again. 
28424 fantastic hotel very close to times sq offers complementary breakfast and free drink mid week very good size rooms with daily maid service better than expected and would stop their again. 10 out of 10 
28425 My stay at the Chicago South Loop hotel was a very enjoyable time, the rooms were big amd it wasn't overaly expensive. The service was great, especially the concierge Dave was very helpful with our questions about Chicago and helping us make sure our time was well spent. 
28426 This hotel has a great location, just a short walk away from time square. It's in the process of being updated. Rooms are small, and ours wasn't that clean. If you want a hotel right in the middle of New York City this is great. Very impersonnel and very busy. 
28427 Nice location, fashionable but very tiny room, tiny bathroom and tiny bed I prefer to walk a little further and have a larger room, a larger bathroom and a real bed 
28428 Het baliepersoneel is niet echt vriendelijk en de liften erg traag maar volgens een bord zijn ze die aan het upgraden. Kamers oud maar schoon met vriendelijk schoonmaak personeel. Dicht bij Broadway and Timesquare. Redelijk hotel in een mega-stad. 
28429 Stayed at London NYC hotel in August 2012 and brought home bedbugs as a souvenir. $1,000 and much anguish to rid my house of the problem. Outrageous. Do not stay here! The room seemed nice. The hotel seemed clean. But, it was not. 
28430 This is perfect if you're visiting NYC for a short period, or just passing through. Room and bathroom was clean and tidy. Daily housekeeping was good. A bit noisy at night, but not too bad. At least the street is relatively quiet. Will definitely stay here again. 
28431 Spent 4 nights at this hotel great location, Staff very helpful, Tony's next door exceptional experience.$50 cab ride from JFK this is the only place to stay in Manhatten 
28432 Beautiful hotel, very nice rooms , a great roof top bar! 
28433 clean big room. nespresso cofee machine in the room. Ask to be a president club member. No charge for that and you get free internet, free enterance to the gym and free local phone calls. I will come again to this hotel. 
28434 I stayed at the Barclay for a short business trip in September. The lobby area and restaurant were very comfortable and the food was outstanding. My room was comfortable and quiet, resulting in a great night's sleep. I would definitely book here again. 
28435 This hotel is beautiful, ideal location for all the main tourist attractions. The staff were most hopeful and accommodating. Can't wait to go back!!!! :) 
28436 This hotel was very clean, nice linens, new bathroom. A great location and very helpful staff. 
28437 Hotel was situated off I-10 which gave me quick entrance and exit 
28438 From the pictures, you would think this is a semi decent hotel, but step into the room and it is a disaster. 
28439 prima settimana del viaggio di nozze in questo albergo a new york; posizione fantastica dietro san patrizio, ottima camera, lussuosissimo all'interno. ottimo il personale, una stangata nei denti il prezzo della colazione (meglio farla fuori..) 
28440 This hotel really isn't bad considering it's location on Michigan Avenue,you could expect to pay twice as much. We were impressed on all fronts,and would certaimly consider it next time wer'e in Chitown. Good gym,clean,and comfortable rooms,and very helpful staff made for a very relaxing visit. 
28441 Another fantastic visit to New Yok City. The perfectly located Sherry Netherland is an oasis of calm perfection in the midst of the city that never sleeps. Its gracious European elegance and friendly, service-oriented staff make it the ideal choice for any length stay. 
28442 Came back one year in , this time in December. They upgraded my room to one of the new ones ( again!) and the room was big compared to new york sizes and clean. The staff are as friendly as ever and always very helpful. 
28443 We enjoyed everything about the W and the location was perfect. We were especially grateful for the W concierge, Eden! She was extremely helpful and made us feel right at home. Thank you Eden! We will definitely be back to visit soon! 
28444 stayed at the Hilton Times Square for 4 nights October, 2006. Rooms were very clean. People were wonderful. The beds were the most comfortable I have slept in for a hotel. They have nightly turn down service which was very nice. I would definately stay here again. 
28445 This hotel is a great New York hotel. Enjoy the bar on the lobby floor and be sure to enjoy breakfast on the beautiful patio. 
28446 I stayed 2 nights to enjoy Christmas in NY. I never even needed a taxi cause the location is perfect. Hotel rooms are lovely & spotless. Can't wait until next time! 
28447 I liked the hotel is was clean and resonable priced. I do not know what the other reviews are talking about. For the price no place had free breakfest 
28448 Excellent location, rooms that are clean and spacious, a restaurant that offers a great breakfast value and the best hamburger 'ever' for lunch. The hotel's staff is among the best in both in friendliness and service. The Radisson Martinique holds the number 1 position for NYC hotels picks for me. 
28449 This was a great small, sort of boutiquish hotel. It is located directly in the gold coast and the shopping/dining is within walking distance. 
28450 Great staff, great location. I have stayed more than once. 
28451 Wonderful location, rooms and STAFF! We have made the Parker Meridien our "home" in New York for the last 5 years and never plan to make a change! 
28452 Booked thru priceline -- paid $180 to stay in a men's business dorm -- parking 4 blocks away and no bathtub in the room. Supposed 3-star ! 
28453 A pleasant stay-very confortable and very good location. 
28454 Great location, safe with "buzz-in" entry, one lobby coin-op computer, clean, but main problem is NOISE which necessitated buying earplugs. Next time would not stay here but spend few extra dollars. 
28455 Fab stay as always. Early check-in was not a problem. Treated like house guest. 
28456 This hotel is in an excellent location however the service was very poor, staff at the front desk very unfriendly,rooms not cleaned. Pity cause this hotel is in a great location 
28457 I came in late on evening for an overnight business stay and the front desk thoughtfully upgraded my room. The room was gorgeous! All staff were friendly and efficient. 
28458 Great hotel close to all attractions. Walking distance to discount theatre tickets, subway one block away. First class view of the world trade centre memorial. Construction noise was not a factor. Would defiantly stay here again. 
28459 We enjoyed our stay. The room was very nice and clean with flat screen tv, marble floors and very comfortable bed. The staff was friendly and very helpful. And best of all, Time Square was only minutes away. We will stay here again. 
28460 The title pretty much sums it up. A truly beautiful hotel with excellent service but it still has a nice edginess. Fantastic bath tubs, excellent views, great beds and wonderful decor. My new favorite. 
28461 This is a hotel with great location. The room was very clean. The staff is so nice and friendly--I mean everyone. The Front Desk is always manned and ready to assist 
28462 Near Michigan ave. one of the main streets of Chicago, great rooms, free wifi in the lobby, great attention. 
28463 Rooms are clean and shuttle service excellent. They picked us up at the rental car return, so we could go straight to the airport in the morning. 
28464 We stayed two nights and we have no complaints. Front desk was friendly and prompt. Room was very clean as well as other hotel areas( hallways, lobby bathroom, etc) I am glad we were able to find this hotel. We will definitely come back. 
28465 I stayed here for 2 weeks in March. I liked the free breakfast, central location and free internet. The hotel rooms were a bit dark. Overall it was good value. If you get a room for $150 per night then book it. The street had a few good vegetarian deli's. 
28466 Very nice hotel in the Museum District just across the street from Herman Park and the Museum of Fine Arts Houston. Very nice spa and pool area and rooms are super clean and decorated very nice. Will defs be back! 
28467 We were upgraded to a king suite which was huge. Very cool hotel in a very convenient spot. 
28468 I have stayed here before and it was fine. This time was not! Day after just one night stay, I started getting welts and bites covering my arms and torso, itch like nuts! Me angry!!! Don't go here!! 
28469 prendre une chambre de categorie superieure sinon mauvais emplacement et beaucoup trpo petite.ai du changer de chambre a l'arrivee,elle etait a cote de la machinerie de l'air conditionne; ils m'ont surclassee dans les etages superieurs ce qui etait beaucoup mieux. 
28470 Ottimo soggiorno camera molto confortevole e ampia camera e bagno e sempre pulitissimi cena in camera con servizio impeccabile albergo in ottima posizione vicinissimo a Time square aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 
28471 Wonderful hotel - very convenient (for me) location. Cool suite, charming staff. best in NY 
28472 great location. front desk people were wonderful. room was clean on first stay. second stay was dirty. asked to change rooms and 2nd room a little cleaner. need to remodel some rooms. next trip will find some other place to stay 
28473 The staff was very professional and helpful and the room was adequate for a suite hotel. Nothing special though. 
28474 This hotel was so dirty. Plaster falling off the room walls. Used toilet paper on the bathroom floor. Hair in the sink. We got a free upgrade and the replacement room was just as bad. It was awaful. 
28475 This is my new favorite hotel in New York! Rooms were great, love the location and the staff is fantastic. Went to Gilt for drinks, worked out and got a massage. Could not ask for a better stay! 
28476 Great location, great service, great rooms, great beds... what can I say you can't go wrong at a Westin. I love staying in the Time Square area! 
28477 The Jewel is great value. Not the best price around, but a great location, and nice rooms. 
28478 Fantastic location just of Times Square central for everything. Rooms were basic but clean needed refreshed. Staff weren't to friendly could have been nicer. However location more than makes up for any issues. Would use again 
28479 Central location to downtown Chicago, nice breakfast, nice lobby with modern fireplace. It is also pet and kids friendly to the extent there is a Wii game in the lobby. 
28480 Excellent position downtown in Chicago, but noisy being close to the local fire department and with low quality personnel. The rooms are small and the bathroom is not separated by door! Useful free parking area for the guests. The specialties of the restaurant are absolutely not ITALIAN! 
28481 hotel vicinissimo a Times Square! massima pulizia, cortesia del personale alla reception (ci hanno prenotato ristoranti sempre pieni e irraggiungibili!!) ottima colazione e ambiente semplice e modernissimo!! da tornarci 
28482 Horrible customer service. The manager of this hotel Vic lies and does not put the customer first. They cheated us of $250 in show tickets and refused to do anything about it. While a nice location, I recommend highly you stay somewhere else. Will never stat at La Quinta again. 
28483 This is an average Manhattan hotel, located just 7 blocks from Madison Square Garden & Penn Station. I don't live far, but was working late and didn't want to go all the way home. This is a good hotel for the price. No issues. 
28484 if you want to see NYC and enjoy it walking....this is a good hotel...couple blocks from Empire State Bldg, 3 - 4 from Madison Square Garden, good area , great price. But there was not a printing solution / business center there for real work area... its only downfall 
28485 Basic accomodation in NYC, pretty good location with a 10 minute walk to Times Square and Broadway. Central Park also within walking distance. Good value for money, friendly staff. Small room with rather noisy (but effective aircon). Would stay here again. 
28486 Booked on priceline to get the best deal! Yes the rooms are small, but clean, friendly and professional staff, felt safe walking back to the hotel late at night. Parking was a little pricey but it's valet so we didn't have to worry about where to park. 
28487 The St. Regis was absolutely incredible. Every member of the staff was friendly, helpful and went above and beyond. They must have quite a good system for identification as the desk clerk knew our names before we mentioned our room number. 
28488 Het hotel is goed gelegen. Bereikbaarheid is zeer goed en NY is vanuit dit hotel goed te bezoeken.Ruime en moderne slaapkamers. Eten in hotel is duur. Ook ontbijt. Echter deze voorzieningen zijn niet nodig daar de restaurants en goedkopere ontbijtgelegenheden rondom het hotel te vinden zijn. 
28489 Stayed at this property at a travelzoo rate of $99, which is an incredible value for this property. Overall an excellent hotel, charming modern rooms, would stay again with pleasure. 
28490 Planned a girls weekend at Swissotel, Chicago. Could not have been more perfect! Great views, location, top notch service. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Would go back for another girls weekend, romantic getaway or with the kids--can't wait! 
28491 This is a large hotel but quite comfortable and quiet. Convenient location just far enough away from Times Square to avoid all the commotion yet steps away from restaurants, theatre and shopping. Very friendly staff. Will stay there again when visting NYC. 
28492 An outstanding balance of very friendly and highly knowledgeable staff, tasteful ambience, and superb upper east side location. The bed was supremely comfortable. Elegant but not too fussy decor. My new favourite Manhattan hotel! 
28493 Accueil tres chaleureux et efficace. Chambre confortable , bien decore et propre.situation tezs centrale pratique proche de plusieurs lignes de metro. Loby pas epoustouflant mais avec le petit dejeuner compris raport qualite prix excellent. Petite terasse sympa pour le petit dejeuner 
28494 Staff were very friendly and helpful. We had good size clean and comfortable room. We enjoy staying at Kimpton Hotels as we're always good for a doggy cuddle when travelling. Good value for money. Location pretty good too. Happy for the price. 
28495 Great price, great location, great facility. More of a Buisness hotel, but good reviews in all areas. Hotel had services for the Buisness traveler. Might find it cramped for a family. I dont agree with this having to be 200 charactersMmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm,mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm 
28496 Very good position...walking distance to central park...nice area. We had a two bedroom/2 bathroom apartment kitchen dinig/lounge area 3 flat screen televisions. Plenty of room for the four of us...very impressed...except for the Internet charges. 
28497 It was my second time at this hotel and both experiences were very good,nice rooms,very clean,friendly staff,convinient location,beautiful lobby. I really enjoyed my stay at this hotel. 
28498 Had another great trip and stayed at the Novotel. Had a clean and large room and everything we needed was within walking distance. Highly recommend seeing Wicked and Hairspray both within a one minute walk. 
28499 Besides an excellent location, the staff at On the Ave is among the best I have met. Always attentive, willing to assist in any way. The best of NY. 
28500 Although a small room, the location is outstanding! 
28501 We have stayed at this hotel probably at least 10 times. It is very convenient to a great number of Nyc attractions 
28502 We have stayed at some of the cities other fine hotels before , but continue to Return here. 
28503 Conveniently situated! Pleasant and accomodating staff! Huge rooms and comfortable beds! But, try to avoid rooms facing 7th Ave. -- pretty noisy! 
28504 Excellent location..great staff.. Rooms are large with nice comfortable beds! Decorated to give you and old school feel... My only complaint was the bathroom needing major updating. My family and I enjoyed ourselves and would stay here again! Excellent customer service! 
28505 One of the best place to stay in NYC. nearby all the facilities you need , shops, transportation, thearters...... Rooms are confortable and clean, you certainely will come again an again 
28506 Its a clean hotel ,its in price range and it offers free wi-fi. its one block away from michigan avenue and 20 min walk from navy pier. the location is very convenient. 
28507 The Michelangelo Hotel was comfortable, with larger than expected rooms for a position so close to the action in the theatre district. Staff were very pleasant and helpful. Highly recommended. 
28508 Great location, close to Times Square. Good and modern rooms, confortable and well decorated but quite small bathrooms. Nice staff. 
28509 I really enjoyed this property. The free wine and water were a great treat for an end to a long day. The location is great and near everything. There a few hotels on this street and they are all nice. This one is a step above the others. 
28510 This place is a great value for the location especially if you are relocating to Houston and need a place to stay for 30 days or more to find a permanent place. They accept pets and have a great 30 day rate. 
28511 Best hotel I've stayed at in the city! Beautiful and a fab location in Chelsea. 
28512 This hotel is very well located to the underground stations and all the other famous attractions as Times Square and Empire State Building. But the room was a bit small, eventhough it was clean and neat. I found the whole experience with this hotel very average. 
28513 you can stay here for 2 or 3 days to go out at night and return walking. The hotel it is fine, nothing great. PLEASE go for the back rooms, the front ones have a lot of street noise. 
28514 Great location, staff very helpful, room was a good size. Only complaint are the walls in the rooms very thin, could here the people in the next room talking until 4am. On complaining to the staff, more than happy to deal and offered a room change. 
28515 Fuer unsere Nacht nach der standesamtlichen Hochzeit haben wir uns dieses schicke moderne Hotel ausgesucht. Wir haben einen Obstkorb mit Gratulationskarte vom Haus erhalten und es wurde sich aufmerksam um uns gekuemmert. Das Zimmer war klein, typisch New York, aber wir haben uns wohl gefuehlt. Sauberkeit und Ausstattung top. 
28516 A nice hotel with great views, large rooms and very helpful staff. 
28517 Don't waste your time if looking for comfort. What were they thinking with the Bathroom design Dark and Tiny rooms, will never, ever go back! 
28518 the floor was tilted so badly , you'd lose your balance, the tub was popping out of the floor and paint was peeling from the walls. Room was crappy. The service, however, was good. 
28519 The lady at the front desk was so nice she helped us get a medical rate, which helped us greatly. I will stay again and tell my friends and family about this place. Thank you! 
28520 This hotel was perfect. Nice hotel very near Times Square and Central Park. Clean. Quiet. Great staff...Rachel was wonderful at the front desk. :-) 
28521 Check-in was a breeze. The room was spacious and very comfortable. The bed provided the best sleep EVER! The noise level was amazing -- heard no one and was able to sleep soundly. 
28522 What attracted me to the hotel was free wifi connectivity and breakfast. I was a little dissapointed with the latter, because I expected to be served at least eggs (I hate cereal). A little more fruits with variety would also have been welcome. 
28523 Was in New York with family on vacation. The rooms were very well appointed, comfortable beds, very clean bathrooms - lot of towels. Restaurant was not for teenagers but good menu. Staff always ready to help. 
28524 This hotel was in a great location. Rooms were ok, beds were too small (I'm 6 feet tall and my feet stuck out of the bed). Reception was often unoccupied and reception staff was not very friendly or helpful (exception: doorman and concierge). 
28525 On hearing the location of hotel u are bound to get excited... and believe me it is worth your excitement...v close to times square...a evening walk at TS can make your trip memorable...Hotel facilities are good... 
28526 Very European in feel. Rooms are small and plain. Warm, comfortable lobby. Great location. 
28527 The hotel was great, clean and mainly friendly staff. The rooms were small but yes, who needs a big room when you are alone. They basically charged me double and didnt say anything and they still have not returned my money. Well overdue. 
28528 Stayed here 4 nights with my wife and two teenage daughters.Location is perfect,right next to the Lincoln Center.We prefer this location over Times Square.Hotel is above average.Try to win it on Priceline, like we did and it becomes an excellent property.Would certainly return. 
28529 Very comfortable rooms, fantastic location, surprisingly quiet. Staff was helpful and the little bar upstairs a convenient way to end a great stay. Terrific value for the price. Will definitely return. 
28530 The location is great- quick walk to the El, sights, restaurants. The rooms have been used, but not terribly. The size makes up for the wear and tear, Would go again. 
28531 It's the second time we stay here and it's just perfect. So pleasant and very kindly service. We will come back that's sure ! 
28532 Always stay at this hotel when in NY. Fazel, one of the front desk managers, is the best. Great service, reasonably priced for NY, the location is the best in NY when you just want to be a tourist. 
28533 Nos alojamos 5 dias en este hotel y nuestra estadia fue muy placentera. Habitacion muy comoda, camas excelentes y la limpieza impecable. Perfecta relacion del precio con calidad. El personal se merece un parrafo aparte: sumamente cordiales, atentos y eficientes. Lo recomendamos sin dudas. 
28534 Small room, good location. OK for overnight stay in NYC during Fashion Week since all hotels jacked up their prices. Didn't have breakfast (included in rate) as the room was packed. 
28535 I stayed here over the New Year, and i liked the hotel, the rooms where clean, bathroom was okay, shower good, and had good beds. The free wireless internet connecting is perfect. The price of 200 dollars is great for NY and the product you get. Great price/quality deal. 
28536 Nice clean contemporary room but not big. We were two adults and two kids (nine and twelwe) and there where not to much space for luggage. Close to subway with easy connection to JFK. The breakfast room is on the small side - be early. 
28537 I really liked this hotel: *close to the GRB Convention Centre *free wireless *staff were very friendly and very helpful *free shuttle to downtown *my very nice room was large, clean, and everything you could expect *nice bar 
28538 I stayed here with two friends for three nights recently and we had a great time. The location is great, the concierge very helpful and the rooms spacious. 
28539 La atencion del personal es muy buena. Las habitaciones tienen un espacio apropiado, son comodas y limpias. El hotel esta muy bien ubicado, cerca del Central Park, 5a avenida y Rockefeller Center. 
28540 2 adults and 1 child stayed at the Omni Berkshire before Thanksgiving. The location is unsurpassed...walking distance to Rockefeller Center, Broadway-Times Square, and Central Park. Hotel staff is extremely helpful and knowledgeable on local sites and restaraunts. Rooms are a little small, but very well kept. Will stay there again. 
28541 My wife and I just stayed here while visiting Radio City Music Hall's Christmas Show. The hotel is conveniently located extremely clean and the staff was very friendly. I highly recommend a stay here! 
28542 Again we stayed at this hotel.. Our room in the 38 floor with superb view over the Hudson river. Enjoyed very much our stay.. This is a hotel I always recommend in NYC. Staff is very nice. Pitty wifi is not free. 
28543 Nice quite hotel close to Gallaria and Reliant Stadium. Would highly recommend King Suite if you are looking for a weekend getaway with spouse 
28544 The location of the hotel is perfect for all of your mid-town fun. Roof top bar with an amazing view. Attentive staff with a wine hour every day at 5pm. Rooms are clean & spacious, also with great views of the City, if requested. 
28545 Excellent location, excellent room condition, and very satisfactory service from the staff, what else do you expect? 
28546 Eastgate Tower is only a 10 minute walk to Grand Central which gets you everywhere in the city. The hotel is surrounded by all kinds of restaurants, delis, and convenience stores. For the $$$, you may not find a better deal in Manhattan. 
28547 Thought this hotel had changed, it was rated 4 stars, it still is not. small lobby, unlevel floors in the halls and rooms, dirty rooms. Only thing that works is a nice staff and a grea location. Stay here only if nothing but location matters. 
28548 we really enjoyed the parker meridian. It has a cool, funky atmosphere yet is great for families. Located just north of times square, south of central park and west of 5th avenue, it gives you great access to many of the tourist spots. 
28549 From the moment you check in you are treated great. The concierge (David) was wonderul. The room was lovely. We also took advantage of the spa and it was first-rate. I recommend it highly to everyone. 
28550 location is great, very close to Grand Central and the metro. Rooms are very spacious and service is nice. Concierge was helpful assisting us with tickets for musicals and also suggested nice restaurants. 
28551 I have stayed at the Westin NY Times Sq many times and it is consistently very good. Smooth checking process, no waiting at elevators, convenient location. Amongst my business colleagues this is our hotel of choice in NYC. 
28552 ha sido el mejor hotel en el que me he hospedado, pueden apreciar su imponencia y belleza por todas partes, incluso y hasta el los asensores... me senti como todo un rey sin serlo jajaja 
28553 Perfect location, friendly staff, it is very close to central park, and it really deserves ***** level, bathroom is just awesome 
28554 O Hotel e muito bom, eh proximo de tudo em nova iorque. Os quartos sao gigantes. Foi uma experiencia muito boa. O unico incoveniente do hotel eh que ele eh meio velho, mas esta em bom estado de conservacao. Recomendo e voltarei. Bom custo-beneficio 
28555 hotels OK. A bit dingy but it's cheap. Good location, but let down by very unfriendly staff. 
28556 I have Stayed at 20 hotels over the years in Manhattan and the comfort inn is exceptional. The hotel is run like a 5 star hotel probably the best service I've had from Kumar and his team. Rooms are great free breakfast is great. 
28557 hotel perfecto en todo el centro de new york en manhattan donde se compra buenoo, cerca de todos los edificios altos y los mejores centros nocturnos de la capital del mundo. 
28558 good location, near subway, perfect room with facilities like microwave and refrigerator; very clean and a good price 
28559 Clean. Short walk to Times Square. Staff eager to serve. Nice bar and tapas in the lobby. Excellent breakfast. Police station next door. Very new. Wifi works fine. New TV. Very comfortable bed. Staff was not so familar with local restaurants, but were very good at getting us transportation. 
28560 The Hotel Beacon is a great place to stay in New York, walking distance to Central Park and the subway was only a few metres away. The supermarket across the road is really handy too. The rooms are quite comfortable and spacious. 
28561 Excellent lodge. 
28562 I come because I used to watch gossip girl. And I now just going to stop watching this soap drama. I don't have any happy memory here. The only positive thing about this hotel is the location. 
28563 nice hotel rooms very clean cleaned every day staff very helpful and friendley breakfast excellent good selection of food hot and cold would stay there again.well done holiday inn and staff 
28564 On a limited income, the cost and service made my first trip to New York City and exciting and enjoyable one. Room coffee Pot did not work. Maybe a good idea to check everyday to make sure they are working properly. 
28565 Yotel was a very pleasant surprise. Facilities are extraordinary, we even enjoyed the free (!) bike rental. The rooms are very nicely designed, everything you need is there, even an iPod-connecter! The Crew was outstanding, all of them. I can recommend this to everyone! 
28566 Muy cerca del edificio de la ONU... de las mejores avenidas... zona muy tranquila. Estilo Tudor... estupendo!! Ah el bar muy muy bueno y excelentetrato 
28567 Google dirstiest hotels in america and this one wins. Hope you have fun but i think your taking a big chance. I was thinking of hotel pennisavan but it was rated # 2. I think i can afford this city. 
28568 Not a fan of the check in machine. The cleaners also missed some things in my room before I checked in. The bathroom was also small, but the rooms are very nice. The 24 hour Duane Reade and the subway across the street is also a plus. 
28569 Location could not be better, you can walk to Times Square, Rockfeller Centre, Empire State. Rooms are large and quiet (views aren't great, but who cares) and in great condition. Don't hesitate to stay here! 
28570 Only stay here if you want to experience the down and dirty! And like bugs/rodents mold! 
28571 Love the location of this hotel, it's about a block from Times Square and very close to most theatres. The staff was really helpful & friendly. We will definitely stay there again! The rooms were a good size and very clean. I highly recommend this hotel. 
28572 I would recommend this hotel to anyone. The service was above and beyond. The staff was knowledgeable, fast, and super courteous. Room was GREAT and located right at the 2/3 subway station and a block from the 4 or 5. This hotel gets top ratings from me. 
28573 First time here and must say we were pleasantly surprise. Celebrated our 24th anniversary in NY and was glad we picked On the Ave. Great staff, friendly and helpful. Very clean rooms. Comfortable beds. Highly recommend this hotel. 
28574 very convenient location and friendly staff Especially ORQUIDEA she make us feel at home the all stay.........We will recomend this hotel 
28575 I hosted for a few weeks before buy my apartment. Wonderful hotel! 
28576 hotel carino, camere pulite, anche il bagno, colazione compresa e ottima, molto abbondante, importante scendere entro le otto, posizione comodissima, mete vicine time square, brodway, 2 fermate della metro vicine 
28577 Our new choice for hotels in NYC Large, clean, and well appointed studio with two two queen beds and full Kitchen. A bit run down (chipped desk surface, stained carpet by window, chipped tiles in bathroom) but clean. Very reasonable rates for large rooms. Staff was helpful when requested. 
28578 funky hotel in horrible location. who wants disco ball lights in middle of business district? tiny rooms. overpriced amenities. constant noise from L tracks. too small exercise facility for number of rooms. everything you want in a hotel and less. so many better options all over this city. 
28579 Really enjoyed our stay at this hotel, the location was great, the rooms were clean, everyone was polite. If you want a nice clean hotel that is reasonably priced then look no further then this hotel. 
28580 Would need some renew. Large room , good location close to Rice but standart price too high for the quality. Breakfast buffet is not really attractive 
28581 We had a fantastic experience here. The staff are gracious, plentiful, and ready to help any way they can. The hotel itself is well-kept and cozy. Loved having refreshments available throughout the day and evening. Couldn't think of a thing we were lacking. We will definitely stay again. 
28582 Si possibilite de changer les serviettes de toilettes 2 fois par semaines, mais uniquement si cela ne change pas le prix, sinon ce n est pas une necessite. Mettre des couverts et verres si besoin 
28583 Stayed a few days here. Great hotel !!! Awesome location. Upgraded to newly remodled one bedroom suite on the 18th floor. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Can't wait to go back. 
28584 The hotel was extremely clean. The staff was very helpful. The complimentary wine,coffee , and tea was very nice. 
28585 My husband & I stayed for 5 nights. The location is great, our room was clean & comfortable. We found the reception staff all to be very helpful & polite. 
28586 Great hotel. We couldn't fault it apart from the breakfasts which were a little basic. Great location, clean and comfortable and the staff were always helpful.We really enjoyed our five night stay! 
28587 Stayed for 2 night .Great location between Time Square and Central Park, also near subway station. Room very very small, with older decor, but clean. no view, easy subway ride to Yankee Stadium. recommend Grey-line City Tour bus. Great location for all types of food and drink 
28588 Terrific, conscientious service by front desk, doormen, housekeeping staff! Comfortable beds - large room with mini kitchen/eating area. Wonderful price/value ratio! Excellent location for transportation, shopping, dining! 
28589 Rooms are just good enough if you don't plan on spending time in the room. Close to lots of great downtown attractions. 
28590 This hotel is a great getaway with the family. The 2 room suites are very spacious perfect for a family of 5 or more. Kids love the pool, nice workout facility, bar and restaurant area is nice. All the ammenities you can think of are there. 
28591 Excellent choice for anyone staying in NYC looking for upper mid scale limited service hotel. Free Breakfast, consistent brand, freindly staff, excellent value, and perfect location. Would stay again any day. Highly recommended. Rooms were clean, nice, modern, and well appointed. 
28592 Great location, walking distance to times square/fifth avenue/ Empire State Building and theatres - comfortable rooms, clean and tidy! great hotel! 
28593 Service was excellent, environment was classy and relaxing. I would stay here again anytime! Mike the bar tender was friendly outgoing courteous and responsive. We loved the Benz shuttle, we were ridding in style! 
28594 It was a very good experience staying in this hotel, the location is excellent which is in times square, and over all the experience was good, I would like to stay again in this hotel. 
28595 This was an amazing stay at a very fine location. Make sure your room faces the water! We had a telescope that was pointed at the statue of Liberty. a must if you want to be impressed with quality. Make sure you get the breakfast! 
28596 Nice small rooms, clean shared baths which were well available. Very excellent deal for New York! 
28597 Not one bad thing to say about it. Fatastic location and internet deal... dollar for dollar- a perfect hotel near times square and the shows. Will do it again. 
28598 We had a wonderful experience at the Park Central NY, staff is friendly and efficient and we felt extremely welcome. The location is perfect, with a subway station right next to it. We are already planning our next stay at this hotel. 
28599 I've come to this hotel a number of times on business. It's a very average room, and the elevator system takes some extra time. Of course, the location can't be beat. To me this room is OK at $200/night, but not nearly worth the $400 I've seen quoted. 
28600 Had the pleasure of staying here for a weekend for a friends bachelor party. The staff was great, the drinks were amazing. Room was on point with downtown feel. Will come back again. Rock on guys! 
28601 Camere troppo piccole per permanenze di piu giorni, mancano armadi,per il resto tutto bene,bellissima la terrazza bar panoramica 
28602 This is a very good hotel, location services and price is more then correct 
28603 Ottima posizione, si trova circa all'altezza dell'Empire. Hotel pulito e personale molto gentile e sempre pronto ad aiutare l'ospite. A venti metri un market aperto 24h su 24 con tutto il necessario. In zona diversi locali dove poter mangiare. Colazione nella media, niente di eccezionale ma abbastanza varia. 
28604 I love staying at this hotel. very convenient to penn station, shops and food. Staff is great, fitness center is good. My last stays have had great views. Loved the apple cider! nice touch! 
28605 We stayed here in April and loved the hotel, so we returned at Christmas and were given a room on the 41st floor with brilliant views of the city!! Amazing hotel, can't fault it!! Hope to stay again soon! 
28606 Hotel staff friendly and efficient. Great lounge overlooking Times Squares serving good drinks and food. Good breakfast bar and The View restaurant is excellent! 
28607 Stayed at The Hotel at Times Square for three nights and found rooms to be very clean, ample room, pleasant desk and concierge staff and housekeeping staff. Will definitely stay there in the future. 
28608 Mit exzellenter Lage in New York ist dieses Hotel schon weiterzuempfehlen, solange man nicht allzu grosse Ansprueche an Service und Raumgroesse stellt. Im Winter koennte es im Zimmer recht kalt werden, da sich unser Fenster nicht ganz schliessen liess. 
28609 Very nice room, clean up to date style. Small but comfortable. Would stay again. Very nice staff. 
28610 We spent a week at Affinia Shelburne and had an absolutely fabulous time! The staff was extremely professional, helpful and courteous, the studio and the hotel left no wishes open, and the location could not have been any better! Thanks for a most wonderful stay! ......................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................... 
28611 Beautiful, clean rooms. Close to everything, within walking distance. Will come back again. 
28612 A localizacao (perto do Central Park e de varias estacoes de metro) e o atendimento do concierge e equipe sao os pontos fortes deste hotel. Apenas o mal humor do pessoal do restaurante e que deixa a desejar. Recomendado! 
28613 Great location, reasonable price, clean, no frills. Polite hotel staff. The bed was comfortable. The bathroom was functional but really outdated. If you are looking for a budget hotel with a great location this is a good bet. 
28614 Excelent Hotel, excelent location. I and my wife are happy. Thank you !! 
28615 I think this hotel is GREAT! Its location is AWESOME! The room was very beautiful and had an amazing view. The employees were very polite and helpful. The person who took my reservation was very helpful and attentive to my needs in terms of allergies and such. Thank you! 
28616 Had a wonderful stay at the Holiday Inn Express before catching a train to Montreal. The nice ladies at the front desk upgraded us! The room was clean and comfortable and the location was wonderful! Definitely recommend! 
28617 Although the rooms are small, the hotel is nice and is in a great location. We were even able to find parking on the street right in front of the hotel! 
28618 the rooms need a complete makeup,all the stuff is crashed by the touriststampede in the times suare area,find a special rate under 200$$$$$ !!!!!!! 
28619 Enjoyed about a week at the Essex House. The new renovation is lovely with lots of interesting little touches including motion activitated night lights. Very comfortable rooms and a friendly staff. Great central location - perfect for business and for pleasure. 
28620 Incredible service and stunning views of the lower Hudson River.... 
28621 The rooms were spacious and very clean. The staff was responsive and very helpful. This hotel is perfect for a Girl's Getaway because you can shop at the Galleria, dine in some incredible restaurants and relax at the spa. All without fighting Houston traffic---it's awesome! 
28622 Good size for NYC standards. The best part is the location that can't be beaten.My windows were facing the Macy's in Herald Square. Perfect shopping spot. 
28623 My family have stayed at this hotel about once a year for the last eight years. We love it. It's perfectly located, luxurious without being stuffy, clean and quiet. Only complaint would be the charge of $10 a day for internet. Otherwise don't think twice... book today. 
28624 espectacular ubicacion, impecable limpieza, cama , colchon, sabanas y almohadas de primera me encantoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo, no le ponen mucha garra a dialogar con los que no saben ingles como mi caso en fin 
28625 Highly recommend. Friendly staff, clean updated room. A little pricy and a slim breakfast offering, but it is included in the room along with wifi. Great location also! Enjoy! 
28626 Cannot fault this hotel. Excellent location, polite and helpful staff and immaculate, comfortable rooms. 
28627 Service was wonderful! Clean rooms nice free breakfast. Only complaint was the elevator was down and I had leave because I had a meeting. I had to take 17 flights down with lots of bags, otherwise I loved the place and would stay again! 
28628 SoHo Grand is top notch. As native New Yorkers who now live elsewhere, we travel to NYC frequently for family obligations. We always stay at SoHo Grand. Service is wonderful, rooms are nice size, location is terrific!! Great vibe to it as well. Highly recommended!! 
28629 Perfect location in midtown Manhattan. Hotel has a sleek, modern ambiance like a more grown up Hotel W. Service is friendly & outstanding.On site restaurant is great for breakfast or lunch.Rooms best for singles or couples; not much storage space & lighting needs improvement. 
28630 Just stayed here for the second time this month. The rooms are great an of an ample size, IT is close to just about everything. I would recommend bringing or buying your own coffee for the morning. 
28631 this hotel is perfectly refined in its design and look. The bar and restuarant was an experiance in it self and even if you would not choose to stay at this hotel I warmly recommende to visit the bar and restaurant. 
28632 Room was small but come on it's new york. Nice helpful staff upon check in. Didn't spend much time in room traveling throughout the city. 
28633 The location if you are traveling by train can't be beat. Just a few steps from Penn Station make this hotel ideal. The service is always top notch and the rooms are really beautifully done. Modern rooms with great amenities. I will definitive be back. 
28634 I loved that it was in the middle of Times Square. Just step outside and you have so much to do. We got fresh cookies when we checked in. Was a bit noisy at night because of all the traffic outside, but nothing unbearable. 
28635 Rooms were in poor condition. Water stains everywhere, very musty and damp feeling. Linens in poor condition. Only provided two towels for four of us and wanted to charge $5 for each additional towel. Management was rude. Decent location, for the price. 
28636 Awesome hotel. Clean and close to subway. The price was unbeatable. The breakfast was delicious every morning. Staff was super friendly. My second time staying at this hotel. Do not think there is another hotel in NY that can beat the price and the quality at Park South. Definitely recommend!! 
28637 Brillaint hotel. The staff were really friendly and helpful. The rooms were really big and very clean. Excellent location. 
28638 I truly enjoyed our stay. Vic Freeman and his staff made us feel like a princess. The room was gorgeous and the staff helpful. 10 stars!! 
28639 Stayed in two upgraded rooms with my family...bedroom plus sitting room and kitchenette. This is a clean, comfortable, spacious hotel with a friendly, capable and helpful staff. The location is very centrally situated for Manhattan. We would gladly stay at the Benjamin again 
28640 abbiamo soggiornato in questo albergo al 31esimo piano dal 29/12/2011 AL 03/01/2012, POSIZIONE CENTRALISSIMA, comoda per qualsiasi spostamento direttamente tra la 5 e la 6 avenue! e...... di fronte a central park !!!! camere molto accoglienti e pulite , personale cortese e disponibile! molto bello...lo consiglio! 
28641 Hated the location. Hated the pseudo-hipster vibe (in New York? are they kidding?) Friends dropped off a package and I never got it. Nobody was polite at the front desk. 
28642 good value for a 5 star hotel booked last minute, very nice size room, attentive staff, bellman/valet parking, prime location, wished we had more time to spend in the room, will definitely stay again, easy access by car 
28643 Hotel was just off Times Square in a quieter street. Well presented hotel, with helpful and friendly staff. Room booked was a double, double with small kitchen area. Very comfortbale beds and quiet for sleeping. Would recommend for any age group. 
28644 The accomodations are splendid. Many foreign travelers know a good deal when they see it, judging from the people choosing the club lounge level. Tasty food at all hours of the day. The staff were hard-working and courteous. I felt 
28645 excellent hotel prompt service with polite and helpfull staff room was clean beds were great and the view of times square was something we will never forget 
28646 Ho soggiornato due volte al Park central!!! L'ubicazione e' a dir poco fantastica ! A destra hai time square a sinistra il central Park ! A due strade dalla quinta:D !!!! Pulitissime le camere ! Bar e ristorante all'interno di livello!! Hall modernissima !Bagno moderno! Staff cordiale! Assolutamente ritornerei li'!!! 
28647 Take eye covers if you wake up early with the sun, as the curtains are nylon only so you cannot block out the lights at all. Room clean, bed comfy, everything so no problems really. 
28648 I have stayed here three times now and the service is remarkable and facilities clean and welcoming. The food is excellent. In particular, the check in experience is worth the price alone. I also like the large, modern rooms, which are difficult to find in NYC. 
28649 Dark, small rooms, absolutely nothing to recommend it. 
28650 We booked our room on line and when we got there they didn't have a handicapp room for us. Therefore we had to pay extra to get a room on the bottom floor.0 
28651 Great location, renovated property that still has old world charm. The hotel staff could not have been more accomodating. The room was large and comfortable. Beautiful bathroom. 
28652 A good value hotel in an excellent location. Rooms were spacious and very clean and we found the staff to be courteous and helpful. Only downside was no free tea and coffee in the lobby as advertised, although there was a coffee maker in the room. 
28653 My biggest complaint about the hotel was that the room was quite small. No issues with the room facilities - bed etc. The gym is great - weights separate from cardio. Very nice club loungs and prices that are extremely reasonable. 
28654 The La Quinta Manhattan was a great value with nice rooms. The staff was very friendly. If you're looking for a hotel with a decent rate, and also a nice place to stay, try this one. The complimentary breakfast was filling. 
28655 Great price for a clean, newer room. In a bit of a dogdy neighbourhood, but right on the bus line and close enough to walk to Convention Centre. No internet, only downstairs in the lobby. Good enough if you are here on business for a few days. 
28656 Have just returned from a week end in New York and had a fantastic stay in Marriott Financial Hotel. The location was great and the breakfast in Roys hotel was a good start to the day. The staff were very helpful and everything was very clean. 
28657 Very nice hotel in downtown Houston. Large comfortable, well appointed rooms. Check in and out very smooth. Good lobby bar and breakfast also. 
28658 I stayed there for one reason and one reason only - Chuck Bass "bought" it. What a let down!! small room, tiny bathroom, narrow hallways, super slow elevators, lousy AC. Though the bed is nice. DO NOT GO UNLESS U REALLY LIKE CHUCK BASS 
28659 My friend and I just returned from a 5 day stay at the Hotel Mela. Great location, very helpful staff. Reviews we read on line made our decision to book here. Glad we did. A tad pricey for the amenities available, but we would return. 
28660 the place was fair and very clean the service was good and friendly 
28661 arrived10/10/03 from the minute we arrived we were made so welcome. staff so helpful rooms comfy and clean. going back next year and will be back at the grand union. june & dawn. 
28662 + localization!!!! + good burgers in the restaurant behind the curtains next to reception desk - small room - quite old hotel (should be renovated!!!) not like 5 stars hotel - small swimming pools 
28663 Very clean comfortable and close. We loved our 2 day theatre and french resturant getaway. Great staff!! 
28664 Die Lage des Hotels war super. Der Service war sehr gut. Die Zimmer waren sauber aber schon sehr abgenutzt. Leider hatten wir einen kleinen Mitbewohner im BAD. Hotel ist auf jedenfall wegen der guten Lage weiterzuempfehlen. 
28665 This is a tourist hotel. Do not go here if you are there on business. You will be annoyed after a minute on the 4th floor. The elevators are packed and stop on every floor. It's excessively neon. I'm still fuming at the price. Microscopic rooms. Grr. Don't go. 
28666 Good hotel but parking was ridiculous at $55 a day. Hotel added a lot of personal charges to my card that my company had already paid for. Staff wasn't anything special. Too costly for the benefits received. 
28667 Great little hotel with helpful staff and close to all the sights and scenes of NY. 
28668 Okay...could be cleaner. I tried not to think about the dirty situations. Each day I thought the areas that were dirty from before I arrived, would be cleaned. Did not happen..I have definitely stayed in worse places. Great location and will probably stay again if I get a good price. 
28669 Good value hotel, close to Grammercy. Rooms are typically New York small. On two occasions I have been moved to a sister hotel The Bentley on E62. Whilst the rooms are much larger the location is not great. 
28670 Rooms Pretty Good, Close to Times Square, Service at the Bar was not good. Seems to be living off it's location. Next time I will stay at the W or any one of the other hotels that are of equal or lower price - and closer to broadway. 
28671 Although a bit pricey, I was very pleased with the hotel. As its name implies (Grand Hyatt) it is located next to Grand Central Station. Getting to all areas of the tri state region - and within Manhattan - is a breeze. Excellent rooms, meeting space and staff. 
28672 I lived in NYC for 17 years and this is the only hotel I stay in. Location, location, location -- in addiction to comfort and class. Next time, I want to try the champagne tasting. 
28673 I was in NY only for few nights, so I had to stay in the city centre for accessibility. It was in times square so was easy to shop and walk. There are better Hiltons around the world though. 
28674 Stayed here for 2 days in end July. Great location only a few minutes walk from all the shops on Michigan Avenue. Good value for money. Unfortunately the hotels internet and business centre was down during our stay. Overall I had a great stay here. 
28675 Terrible hotel. Front desk is rude, restaurant is under renovations so it is closed after breakfast while no vending machine is to be found on site. Room is not really clean given that it smells. Heating was not working on the first night. Not recommended., 
28676 Stayed there with my wife while we took in the city for a few days. Great Place and Great Location. Awesome beds and large bathroom. Olives restaurant rocks!!! Incredible location. Excellent for young professional looking to get away for the weekend or a longer stay. 
28677 Having driven all over the world, New York City driving was a breeze to me, but the GPS does not reflect construction sites and re-routes. However, I do recommend Marriott Rewards membership to be able to enjoy comfortable accommodations like these at reasonable prices or great upgrades. 
28678 Really good stay. Will definitely be returning. Having lived in Midtown Manhattan for a year, when I was coming back for a holiday I wanted to try downtown and this hotel was ideal. 
28679 Perfectly located in Chicago. Shopping and attractions just minutes away. Small rooms but a nice wiew from our windows. Nice but confused employees, no breakfast at the Hotel. If You want to be in the middle of Chicago with affordable price. Stay here. 
28680 Great location, service second to none, rooms recently refurbished,etc, etc 
28681 The hotel was veyr nice & so was the staff. Especially the concierge, Eden Bernal! 
28682 Best place to stay in Spring Tx! Very clean. Service was great as well as the location. Will be staying again in the future. Had tried 3 other hotels and was very disappointed but love Super 8. 
28683 Besides being noisy and exspensive, I made the mistake of calling my wife to let her know I got though the blizzard. Big Mistake Called a nearby area code on room phone $40 for a 20sec. phone call They don't tell you about access codes WHAT A RIPOFF 
28684 Eventi is a clean, modern hotel on 30th and 6th Ave within walking distance of NY Penn station and Times Sq. The rooms are small, but clean and quiet. The staff are friendly and helpful. The new restaraunt, Brighton, offers reasonably priced pizza, burgers and fish in separate 'shacks'. 
28685 Ottima sistemazione sia per quanto riguarda il costo (praticamente imbattibile) che l'ubicazione della struttura sita nel cuore di Manhattan (sotto l'Empire State!). Camere non grandissime ma sufficientemente confortevoli. Sicuramente da consigliare per una vacanza con amici. 
28686 Friendly staff, managers happy hour was nice and the breakfast was the best I have ever seen for free...mDe to order inlets ... Would highly recommend. 
28687 We've stayed at Yotel twice in the last year. It's mod and comfortable. Location is mediocre in terms of proximity to subway and "destinations" except the Theatre district. It is located in Hell's Kitchen, so there are some great restaurants. The terrace is lovely and has wonderful views. 
28688 The staff was friendly and courteous, they couldn't have been more polite. We loved the lovely sitting area upstairs from the lobby. Best of all was the wonderful nights sleep we had every evening while being right in the heart of Manhattan.... 
28689 The staff is really great.. But bieng an express you cant expect large rooms.. Was clean and nice..must say for an express the bed was really soft and comfortable,..location formdowntown NYC? cant beat it.. Walk to the battery park. Wallstreet.. 
28690 Had a great experience at the Eastgate. Basic but clean room and a very convenient location. Surprisingly quiet given proximity to all the attractions. We were on the 6th floor, had windows open and had no traffic noise. Would stay there again. 
28691 Nice, clean, convenient. Recommended. Downside: Not the most charming, more for business. But if you seeing the sites, it doesn't matter. Location is great. Advice: Don't pay for breakfast downstairs, head out the exit to 43rd St, there is a great deli there. 
28692 Very clean, very comfortable, great price 
28693 I will stay there again for sure. 
28694 Rooms are small and dated. Hotel charges extra for EVERYTHING (toothbrush, gym, pool). Thermostats in the rooms don't work and you have to call front desk to send up an engineer to adjust the temperature. View of central park for the room I had was very nice. 
28695 This hotel is especially good if you're travelling alone. To get a room large enough for two people is pricey. HOWEVER, this is hotel has a great location, smart, courteous staff, and is very service oriented. I would stay there again in a heartbeat. 
28696 Free WiFi in room, coffee maker and coffee provided, small refrigerator, and ironing board and iron in each room. Great location - walking distance to all Broadway theaters and never more than a block from a subway stop. Good linens, clean, efficiently run. 
28697 The first time I came here was ten years ago. Returned not to be disappointed. Certainly there have been changes, but none that interferred with a comfortable and pleasant stay. I was pleasantly surprised. 
28698 We had a local mini-vacation at the Four Seasons and it was wonderful. Beautiful, clean, great service, stocked refrigerator. I was very happy! 
28699 A very polite staff and understanding manager when my wife and I were stranded due to the blizzard. We would recommend this place and will stay when next in NYC. 
28700 febuary 7 2005 we spent a girls weekend in new york,first time in new york. we really ejoyed our room, it was very nice, staff were really nice. I will stay again when i visit ny again. It is close to alot things. I really recommend this hotel. 
28701 The service was superb! Everyone was friendly and extremely helpful. Loved the happy hour and availability of several newspapers. The rooms are on the small side, but this is NYC, so not a surprise. 
28702 I stayed for 7 night here and I found it incredible!!! Great Hotel and Location!! Also service. 
28703 We spent a week-end for our wedding anniversary: everyone was very nice, hotel is very nice, room extremely clean and comfortable. Bar and room service are very expensive - be careful! We loved it! We really want to go back! 
28704 O tamanho do quarto eh muito bom, apesar do hotel estar necessitando de uma reforma... A localizacao eh boa, apesar de ficar quase em korea town, esta do lado do empire state, times square e macys. Recomendo 
28705 Excellent facilities. Free Wi-Fi. Very clean. Not too far from Times Square (about 15 min walk). Lovely view from the room over the Hudson River. Friendly & helpful staff. Great food breakfast and dinner menus. 
28706 The location is fabulous. the staff was very helpful. Normas and The Burger Joint are great. We loved The Nave to for drinks. 
28707 Stayed in this hotel during my first trip on NYC. Couldn't believe the location - near 5th Ave; Grand Central and Chrysler Building. Were on one of the lower floors so no few, but really only slept in hotel. Room was comfortable; cleaned daily and staff were efficient and quiet. 
28708 Pleasently surprised by the very friendly staff. Very helpful info for how to get around on foot. Great location for the must-sees. Go right out of the hotel and it is a 5 min. Walk to art museum. Starbucks and pub on premise, Potbellys next door. An overall great experience! 
28709 Just back from 3 days in Chicago. We found the hotel blake in our lonely planet guide book. Excellent location, nice big room and friendly staff. Unfortunately the wi-fi connection was not working properly and breakfast was below our expectations, but on the whole it was a good choice 
28710 Would stay again. Very clean rooms and comfortable beds. The hotel staff were quite helpful and friendly. This hotel has it all. 
28711 Good service,,great restaurant attached..rooms were clean quiet..good security and overall a great location close to the Theaters and Times square.. Overall service of the staff there was wonderful and they were elpful and went out of their way to assist you 
28712 Very accommodating, was still under construction at the time, but they did their best to make us happy. I would stay here again, but I usually like to stay in a more quiet side of town. 
28713 Veramente notevole sia la posizione, collegato benissimo e a due passi da Broadway, sia la pulizia ed il comfort delle camere. Personale molto gentile e disponibile. Sicuramente torneremo l'anno prossimo. 
28714 Stayed for a week, good location. Clean tidy room, not the biggest room ever but what I would expect in New York. Not situated directly on Times Square but just a short walk. Staff helpful and happy. Would stay again and would recommend. 
28715 This Hotel is in a great location, furthermore, I am always pleased by the personal care that the staff provides to me as well as my employees that stay there. From the Upper Management, to their Housekeeping. When our ventures call for NYC, there is only one hotel of choice.......PARAMOUNT!! 
28716 Fantastic value.....fantastic....friendly and caring staff. We come to nyc often and have found our hotel now.....breakfast and strong coffee are the bonus on this nice hotel.....you should not be disappointed.....ask for hatanachi or jennifer at front desk....super nice... 
28717 Our international non-profit just put together a one-day meeting at the On the Ave hotel - can't say enough about the combined great pricing and service. Working with Bindia from the sales team was a pleasure. 
28718 Great value. Clean and tidy rooms.. Pool was a bonus also. Staff were polite. Helpful and not too in your face. Handy location. Just 3 blocks from Times square. 10mins walk. But Taxis pass every few seconds. About 6 dollars gets you to times square etc. Would go back. 
28719 Emplazamiento privilegiado, trato perfecto, calidad alojamiento 10. Realmente excelente, con encanto, realmente un descubrimiento genial. 
28720 Zeer net hotel dat centraal in Chicago ligt. De meeste dingen zijn lopend te bereiken. Voor Amerikaanse begrippen ook zeer goede bedden en als je lekkere koffie wil... Star Bucks zit beneden in het hotel. Het is wel redelijk prijzig en het personeel bij de frontdesk was niet bijzonder vriendelijk. 
28721 Beautiful hotel, excellent staff. We received a nice upgrade to a spacious junior suite when we arrived. Very nice sized room. Helpful doormen, excellent location. Truly a gem. Would stay there again. 
28722 Hotel 17 is excellent value for a Manhattan hotel. The rooms are small and fairly basic but it has plenty of character and is kept spotlessly clean. The staff members are extremely polite, discreet and helpful. Finally, the location is second to none. I'll definitely stay there again. 
28723 Hotel Indigo was a very nice place to stay. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. Also, the entire hotel was VERY clean. The rooftop bar was very entertaining as well. We'll definatly stay there again and recommend it to anyone visiting New York City! 
28724 Essentially a family hotel. Minimal lobby, inadequate exercise room, and somewhat noisy. Suite only fairly furnished but does contain two separate rooms. There is only one bathroom. 
28725 Great Hotel, very nice employees, with a modern 50's - 60's design and next to Central Park. For a first time in NY it's the best place to stay, Uptown. 
28726 We stayed here on our first trip to NYC. It was conveniently located, the staff was fantastic, the rooms were excellent. Staff were very accomodating. Excellent experience - would stay there again. 
28727 Nice hotel for the price. Found a deal in my entertainment book. $40.00 daily and the room was clean with renovated bathroom. Parking may be a hassle, and restaurant/bar prices are too high for me. 
28728 The outsdie Valet Service at this Hotel was extremely engaging and very professional. Best part of experinece. Location was perfect. Rooms clean with great views! 
28729 The front desk clerk Lidia was very helpful. She gave me execellent service. Also the shuttle driver very helpful. I wished you had more shuttle trip to Uchicgo (specially when there are events) Bath tap is clogged. But informed frondesk when I checked out. 
28730 Will be great location once construction in area completed. Large rooms, clean. Would return. 
28731 excellent hotel. big rooms. good location. the GYM and the SPA are really good also. Highly recommended!! 
28732 It's everything you would expect from a 5 star hotel. We spent 5 days there and I have 0 complaints. Room was very nice, so was the bathroom, hotel staff was more than kind and friendly, the restaurant is very good, breakfast was amazing. Location: right on Michigan Ave!!! 
28733 Great hotel, very big and clean room! The breakfast for 20 USD is very tasty! 
28734 I really enjoyed this funky hotel a block from Central Park, and the subway. Visually stimulating, and reasonably priced with a flare for drama. 
28735 Sucks big time. If you want to stay alive DO NOT go. 
28736 Excellent Location, the view of Time Sqare is awesome 
28737 This hotel is close to all - Beautiful rooms - Luxury. All employees were friendly and helpful. Rooms very large and reasonable for NYC. Cannot wait to stay again. 
28738 renovetaded rooms and the location is perfect. You can take the subway to almost anywhere. The staff hotel is very kind. I intend come back here. 
28739 It is not cheap. I paid C$240 (tax & services charge included) for two nights. The carpet was dirty and the bed sucks! There was water stain near the window. The bath room was a joke. I am glad I only suffered for two nights. 
28740 I stayed at the hotel back in December and had such an amazing experience. I tried staying there again in February, but they did not have any vacancies. I definately rec. this hotel. MT 
28741 reception on arri was very good, although rooms were smaller than i was used to it was very clean and comfortable,ideal for Time Square (50yards)no noise. overall i would recommend and give it 4.5. 
28742 I asked in advance for a room up high with a view and they certainly gave us that on the 31st floor with a beautiful view of the Empire State building. Very clean, very friendly and very central. Not one complaint!! 
28743 Wonderful hotel, swank. Great staff. The hotel has as luxurious feeling and all rooms have a balcony. The executive lounge had a fantastic breakfast (high quality bakery and plenty of fresh healthy options).Hilton offers also high end toilettries that make the stay even more enjoyable. 
28744 Just stayed here before flying out in morning. Solid, clean hotel with pleasant staff. Gated parking lot which was cool. Lots of freebies, internet, business center, happy hour, snacks. Quiet. 
28745 Great location!! Quite a dated hotel but has what you need as a base. No tea/coffee facilities in room, only in hotel lobby.. But it does have a Mountain Dew vending machine!!! And free internet access if needed. 
28746 Great hotel - stayed here for business several times. Good location with lots of options close by for food. Rooms are clean and beds comfortable. Work out facility and lounge on top floor decent. Eggs downstairs are okay and you can order fresh eggs directly if you wish. 
28747 We went for our anniversary. The hotel liaison, Patrick Armano was excellent. He emailed us before, during, and after our stay and was extremely helpful. The rooms are also very spacious and clean. Thanks for a great stay! We will be back. 
28748 Can't beat the location of this modern hotel. It's just south of Central Park and close to literally everything. The service could be a little more personable, but the quality of the hotel is excellent. Love the platform beds and the toiletries...the exfoliating soap is great! I miss it! 
28749 Great location just off the Broadway hub bub with small but very comfortable rooms. The lobby pool is really nice and the service is excellent. 
28750 and clean place Stayed here for a week with family. Not as bad as I thought with all the bad reviews. It was actually really convenient. Not much amenities, but who cares, didn't spend much time in the hotel. Shopped and toured nyc, so why not. 
28751 Advantages: LOCATION, comfort, cleanliness and air conditioning. Disadvantages: price, small room and samall bathroom 
28752 I loved the W Hotel in Manhattan. It's a very trendy place to be in the heart of Times Square. The lounge on the 4 floor was a great touch too! 
28753 Hotel ZaZa has top notch service, gorgeous rooms with all the imenities, amazing beds and great staff. I wish I could just live there. I was upgraded to the That's Entertainment suite and boy did I feel special! 
28754 the crowne plaza in times square has all new beds. it was extremely comfortable and the staff was wonderful. if you want a great hotel in the heart of times square this is a great choice. the rooms held two adults and two kid quite well. 
28755 Stayed here twiice, love the area. Also love the separate bedroom & living area with a small kitchen, very handy considering the great food stores across the street. The rooms are quite spacious, nice furniture & artwork. Clean & well maintained. 
28756 The hotel was hard to find and difficult to get into the grounds. The desk help was not friendly, not rude but not customer oriented. Certainly not the quality of La Quinta we have been accustomed to. 
28757 I stayed here overnight and the property is remarkably quiet and unassuming. Staff were extremely pleasant and accommodating and the room was spacious and very quiet with a garden view to the back. Good internet. Would have benefited from in-room coffee maker. Otherwise it served all my needs. 
28758 Hotel tres covenable bien situe mais il est un peu monotone pour un Sofitel, emplacement agreable en plein centre de new york, le service etait bon, les employes en general etait a l ecoute et surtout un certaim Mr Bassim un concierge qui parle un tres bon francais 
28759 Horrified at this place! Found bed bugs upon check in! Checked out and counter guy said he couldn't print a receipt but I refused to leave until I got one so he got the manager to print one out. I got a picture of them just in case! 
28760 Comfotable, modern, near the Moma and central park. Liked it! No in room coffee though. hate that. 
28761 I really enjoyed the breakfast, excellent service provided by Domingo! 21 
28762 Great location, staff not particularly friendly, reasonable size rooms. Dissapointed with plastic plates at breakfast. The location makes up for the down sides. 
28763 Vi likte denne hotellet veldid godt. Hyggelig og hjelpsomt personale, god frokost... Ganske store rommene. Alt er i nerheten... Kan tenke meg og overnatte der flere ganger. Passer godt til familier med barn 
28764 Anbefale.... 
28765 This was a centrally located hotel: 2.3 miles from Soldier Field and the Shedd Museum and just steps away from Michigan Avenue shopping. We spent the weekend walking to a football game, museum, shopping, and dinner. We never needed a car or a cab. 
28766 Armando was intelligent and provided great service. He was knowledgable about the rooms in NYC. Great food and location. Highly recommend this hotel in NYC. 
28767 Excelente atencion y servicio. Quiero agradecer ampliamente a Cindy Cabrera por todas sus atenciones que tuvo con nosotros. Muchas gracias por hacernos pasar una excelente vacacion. 
28768 Super hip hotel. Love the rooms, LOVE the lobby, LOVE LOVE LOVE the Breslin! Stumptown coffee right downstairs. Good bar scene, awesome food. Dig the thoughtful design of the rooms. 
28769 the thing i like most about drury hotels is knowing that i will have a great experience when i stay at their hotels. there is a level of consistency - cleancomfortable rooms with sparkling clean tub/shower and bathrooms. great kickback and breakfasts and friendly staff. 
28770 It's a very good hotel, well placed , VERY BIG ! The location of the hotel was good and close to Central Park, Times Square and many of the big shopping centres. The room service is not 24 hours 
28771 good breakfast. 
28772 stayed in new york three times,this was the best location.Speedy checkin.Very friendly staff.No extra charges for safe deposite box.The only problem was a hard bed,but when exhausted from all the sightseeing,I managed to sleep.Price was very good for location and the time of year.Would definately stay here again. 
28773 The Belvedere on W. 48th St. was extremely convenient to the Broadhurst and Eugene O'Neill theaters and many others as well. Unpretentious but lovely and accomodating, historically elegant, and resonably priced, as New York goes. 
28774 Had 2 rooms for one night. Booked the rooms through hilton.com. Had a view over a parking garage. Check in was quick but staff but not very friendly. Small rooms but comfortable beds. 
28775 Very comfortable room, great service. High floors have fantastic view of NYC. Union Square is a great location for walking down to SOHO and the subway. The W has complimentary car service from Acura which was fun and convenient. Glam crowd. 
28776 This is my third stay at this hotel and am always pleased. Clean rooms, perfect location, and helpful staff. Even though there was a problem with my reservation, it was resolved quickly and easily. This is where I always stay in Manhattan. 
28777 Per girare New York, l'hotel si trova in ottima posizione, proprio al centro dell'isola! Le camere sono pulite e non grandissime, ma comunque adeguate a 2 persone. Recentemente ristrutturato. Nel nostro pacchetto era incluso solo il pernottamento, i servizi extra non li abbiamo pagati, ma erano piuttosto costosi... 
28778 See above....the review is written in the title box. 
28779 Quiero dar las gracias a Miguel Vega y al equipo de reservas del grupo affinia por haber sido tan comprensivos ante nuestra imposibilidad de visitar nyc en el mes de abril y poder cancelar la reserva sin gasto. MUCHAS GRACIAS 
28780 Hotel 41 is the best hotel in NYC. The staff is wonderful, the rooms meticulously clean, and the location is superb. It is our home away from home when we are in NYC. Try it, you won't find any better!!!! 
28781 Everyone is looking for an experience when they travel. The Hotel is in an A+ location and classic New York style. Joanna at the front desk was truly amazing and attentive and followed up with our special request. Great hospitality spirit. 
28782 This is a newly renovated hotel that has a well led staff. Every staff member is attentive and friendly. The surrounding area is not very nice, the hotel is like an oasis in the desert. I would certainly stay here again. 
28783 Stayed 5 nights and Hotel is perfect for main NY sights. All in walking distance.Everyone was really pleasant and rooms were good. Had minor problem with shower on/off lever and fixed within minutes after contacting Reception..Overall we were very pleased with the Hotel and location. 
28784 Our room was great, we enjoyed it very much. The service was great too, they were very helpful and kind. The restaurant was a little bit pricy and the bar was quite empty when we visited it. 
28785 Ink 48 is a great, new addition to the Manhattan lodging scene. Trendy design combined with roominess makes this hotel an NYC best bet. Close to great restaurants on 9th Ave and within walking distance of the Theatre District but well away from the touristy dreck. 
28786 we had a great time, and a great place to stay for the location. the only compliant would be the small elevators, and the hotel trying to decide if at night.. if it is a hotel or a bar with its rooftop bar available to the public at night. 
28787 La ubicacion del hotel es extraordinaria, el personal atento y agradable, ademas que no tienes problemas para entenderte en castellano con ellos jejjee. El precio es muy asequible y los servicios que ofrece son de alta calidad. Si estais dudando esta es una opcion realmente segura. 
28788 We stayed here for four days. This hotel is average, and could use some cosmetic updating and bathroom renovating. As was said previously there was spotty cell service from our room. Great location and friendly staff. I didn't care for the beds. 
28789 Very good value and lots of room! Our room had two rooms, lots of closet space, a fridge and microwave, and pull-out couch. Great location, friendly staff. Could use another elevator - but who cares to wait a few minutes. Great find! 
28790 The hotel staff was very informative and friendly. The room was available upon arrival and it was very clean. The location is in a great spot...within walking distance of Museum Campus as well as other attractions. I would stay there again. 
28791 Excellent hotel, very good value......Large rooms, pleasant new design... 
28792 Yes, the rooms (I stayed in a "premium cabin") are relatively small but the space utilization is the best I've seen! The rooms are very quiet, climate control is excellent, and I felt comfortable and cozy, but never claustrophobic. The smallest rooms are great for an individual or couple. 
28793 The location was great! Close to times square, broadway, shopping. The hotel have a great lobby bar. The rooms are a bit small, but it was okey. 
28794 The rooms are nice enough and the location is great, but the wait for an elevator can be excruciating. 
28795 ...to most locations around Times Square, Rockefeller Center and Central Park. Very clean hotel with friendly staff. Rooms are standard size but a little weathered. Free breakfast in the mornings and coffee served in the lobby most of the day. I would recommend staying here. 
28796 Stayed at the hotel for a week on business. Centrally located with great views. One may checkout the lake by taking a quick walk. Restaurants are good and the staff is warm and courteous. Concierge services are very good. 
28797 The MAVE we found to be a delightful small hotel in a fine area of Manhattan. The staff was very attentive, the price reasonable, and the rooms extremely comfortable. We will definitely stay there again. 
28798 I visit this hotel twice a month while on business. I am always delighted with the room and the service. The rooms are huge, clean, and well appointed. The workout room is above average and clean. The staff is friendly and very helpful. You cannot miss by staying here! 
28799 The Icon Hotel was very comfortable. The bathroom was spacious even though I did not have time to take a bath it was nice to know it was there. So many times now hotels opt to build shower only bathrooms. The sleeping room was large and quiet. 
28800 First time staying at this hotel and very pleasantly surprised. Quick and courteous check in. Room quite spacious with enormous L-shaped desk, full kitchen, super comfortable bed, nice lighting, and great iPod dock for music. The Subway is 2 blocks away which makes getting around easy. 
28801 Excellent hotel, simple, beautiful, classic. It makes people feel calm in the middle of Times Square. But what really made a difference was the kindness and attention of the hotel staff. Every single one of them deserves a 10. 
28802 Super convenient. Subway half a block away. Rooms very clean and well appointed. Didn't try the restaurant at the hotel. If you are planning to see some Broadway shows this is a great location. Just a few blocks from Times square so a bit less congested 
28803 Super central, super hyped decoration and a great smiling staff makes this hotel one of the best choice to stay in N.Y! 
28804 The Belvedere is an excellent find - great location for theatre and shopping and dining. The staff are amazingly accommodating and it is neat and very clean and in good condition. I have stayed there at least ten times and have never had a problem. 
28805 Like a museum, the Herald Square astounded me with it's artwork and magaizine cover displays. A very clean and comfortable hotel, with cozy rooms. I couldn't believe I got such a great hotel for under $100 per night! 
28806 This was a great place, enjoyed the whole trip. Loved that is was in between Chinatown and Little Itlay. So much to see and do. 
28807 Place was clean and staff friendly. Walking distance to subway and time square. Not the cheapest hotel but definitely value for money. This hotel is under the starwood group of hotels. So compare prices on expedia and starwood. If both the same, book thru starwood for the reward points. 
28808 I have to say you can walk or get to any tourist destinations in a heartbeat! The room was small but not as small as a lot of the ones we stayed in NYC. The staff was polite and easy and I couldn't beat the price in the city. 
28809 I went with my 2 sisters and we loved the hotel. Suzie at the Concierge desk was very helpful and made our trip a success. She suggested places to see and eat and took time to help us book our shows. She took extra time to help us every day. 
28810 I have stayed at the Milford about 10 times for Broadway show trips...PERFECT location. While not fancy, it's kept up well, the service is good, the staff congenial, & the price is right. I've recommended the Milford Plaza to many friends, who all agree with my assessment 
28811 We chose the Westin for its location near Time Square having stayed on Central Park and 5th Avenue on previous trips.Also for the comfortable beds having stayed at the Memphis Westin last year.We were not disappointed in either respect.The staff were all helpful,nothing to complain about really. 
28812 Great location at Time Square. Rooms were clean, bed was comfortable, breakfast adequate start to the day. 
28813 This is a great Marriott property. Really nice staff; we had a program glitch and they were very helpful to us with business services. Location right across from the Galleria...easy to get to from the Houston expressways. Little cafe and bar in lobby had great food and service also. 
28814 We stayd at this hotel for 4 nights. Great location, great rooms, great service. Only minus is the breakfast - far too expensive. Forget it and go elsewhere... 
28815 Excellent hotel close to Times Square. Best bed I have ever had in a hotel. Full breakfast and excellent service. We would stay here again. 
28816 A great little find in Chelsea. Clean & comfy with friendly staff. Nothing fancy but perfect for travelers on a budget. 
28817 Got in late. No trouble finding location. Quiet, beds were awesome. A/c worked like a charm. Nothing wrong at all. 
28818 Tatty decor, but good service and great downtown location, great value too. 
28819 Loved the hotel, love the neighborhood. It was perfect. 
28820 Loved this property and loved the location. Great central place to see things. Located near subway so this place was great. Higher floors have great views of harbor. 
28821 Loved it! Amazing rooms, perfect location. Close to subway and times square. Staff is friendly and breakfast is delicious! 
28822 un numero impressionante di comitive, mai trovato posto al bar,accoglienza necessariamente frettolosa,e per uno straniero non troppo cordiale,per la cifra spesa per 5 notti in tre si puo' trovare di meglio 
28823 Great hotel. Very good location. Ask to be in a higher floor with St. Patrick view. 
28824 This hotel is amazing, clean, well located, rooms are very large, staff is unbelievably helpful and friendly...breakfast for $3.00 is great - what else can I say... do not hesitate to stay at the Salisbury, you won't be dissapointed! 
28825 Excellent attentive staff. Great location with easy access to restaurants, transportation, etc. The room was large enough with two queen beds. The bar was a fun gathering place. Breakfast was reasonably priced and delicious. 
28826 cheapest hotel i could find in manhattan for a business trip at last minute. excellent value for money (~100$/night). clean rooms with decent/acceptable (free) wifi. large rooms! recently remodeled room. convenient transportation links. markets nearby. cleaners respected "do not disturb" sign... excellent service! 
28827 Excellent hotel! couldn't have wished for anything better. staff super nice, checked in immediately, rooms lovely and comfortable and spacious! location couldn't have been better, few blocks from penn station and from macys! book it now 
28828 Everything was excellent! All the staff was incredibly sweet, helpful, and out going. 
28829 We had a wonderful stay at the Grand Hyatt. The location is fantastic! Staff were friendly and helpful, and the rooms are modern and beautiful! Looking forward to a return stay :) 
28830 I stayed here for a week in early november while in town for business. Overall nice experience as you would expext from a hilton. Perfect location on magnificent mile with a friendly staff, clean large rooms, and a nice gym with a view. 
28831 This was a great hotel all around. The staff were incredibly nice, the view from the room was the best! Very comfortable bed. Very clean. Large size rooms for NYC. 10-min walk to Grand Central Station. Highly recommend! 
28832 Great Hotel, Great Service, Beautiful rooms with Terrace views of river 
28833 Camere pulite e gradevoli. Ottima la posizione vicinissima a Times Square, alla metropolitana e hai numerosi ristoranti della 46th, 8st. Utile il frigorifero il micoonde e la macchina per il caffe. Il bagno e' un po piccolo. Il servizio in camera e' migliorabile. Da preferire la camera executive. 
28834 This hotel I would recommend to anyone. The staff are friendy; the ambience is nice; the rooms are spacious, clean, and well taken care off. You are only 12 - 15 minutes from downtown which is pretty close. Highly recommended. 
28835 We stay here when visiting md Anderson. Very quiet room! Once when I did not feel well from chemo I called room service and they made me a sandwich I requested that wasn't on the menu. Great customer service!!!! 
28836 Stayed here over Easter with the family and really enjoyed our stay. Rooms well equiped and large, staff friendly and location very convenient. Although the reception does not appear to grand and the breakfast is very basic. 
28837 Would definately stay again! The gentleman who greeted us at the door when we arrived made sure we got taxi's, got our luggage to the room, greeted us every day. Felt like honored guests! Thanks 
28838 esta situado en el cruce de chinatown y el soho,inmejorable,a un paso del down town,soho,y las mejores zonas de tiendas,restaurantes .muy grandes y limpias las habitaciones.estuvimos genial 
28839 We stay here with my friend one night the room was little but it was compensated with great location, few steps for times square and broadway and many shopping centers, they helped us to keep our baggage after check out Thanks everyone it was awesome 
28840 My husband and I stayed at the Affinia 50 over Columbus Day Weekend. The staff was friendly, courteous and informative. The room was meticulous and inviting. We would not hestitate to stay there again. 
28841 We went for 4 days we have no complains, just the soda machine at my 4th floor was not working but its many places to get drinks & more. Room very neat ,clean & big bathroom. Subway Station at the corner, also a pharmacy downstairs. I will go back. 
28842 All reception staff very rude and ignorant, together with breakfast restaurant staff. We sent a letter, dated 15 September 2003 to the management detailing our experiences but as expected we have not received a courtesy acknowledgement let alone a reply. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone. 
28843 We are very picky about hotels and we figured that this would be a standard Hyatt hotel, which are typically nice. However, this hotel really is exceptional. Their renovation is extremely nice, very modern and chic. I would absolutely recommend this particularly in light of the very reasonable price. 
28844 My stay at the Parker Meridien was great. Room with a fabulous view of the park, fun and tasty Norma's Restaurant in the hotel, and amazing service upon check in. Really a great experience! 
28845 El hotel es lindo, atencion mas que correcta, muy bien ubicado y Limpio!! La habitacion es amplia y el servicio permanente de cafe en el segundo piso, interesante. Volveria sin ninguna duda La estadia fue Excelente! 
28846 Spotless rooms, extra-comfortable beds and pillows, decent work space, good location. Would definitely stay there again. 
28847 Everything about this hotel was amazing! Definitely exceeded my expectations. Had a modern, trendy room with an amazing view. The bed was so comfortable, and definitely needed after a long day traveling! 
28848 vicino a central park....tra la columbus e brodway....comodo 
28849 If you are doing business in the Medical center or there as a patient or relative with a patient, this is a great place to stay. Patient rate are available and there is a free shuttle to all the medical facilities in the area. Highly recommend. 
28850 Spacious rooms with a nice wam modern design. Walking distance to all the luxury brands. Enjoyed morning walks at central park which is just around the corner. Breakfast was very enjoyable. Another wonderful experience at Four Seasons. 
28851 Gorgeous lobby but then you get in elevator and you end up in an old "best western" style room. Nothing wrong with that as long as you know it upfront and don't pay Hilton price. 
28852 From the minute you walk in to the minute you live you feel at home and there is nothing more you can ask for out of a hotel. 
28853 Very nice place to stay. The employees were very nice and helpful. Rooms were clean. We stayed there for the Cubs convension and it was great. When we got there they offered us an upgrade for no extra charge. 
28854 I stayed on one of the most expensive weeks in NY, and this hotel was not cheap! It was stylish, and had big comfortable chairs in the lobby which came in handy for some long conference calls. Comfy room. Quiet. Pleasant service. 
28855 Absolutely the worst hotel I've ever stayed at. The price of the room is VERY misleading ($225). TOTALLY overpriced.....this hotel should be condemned. PLEASE check around before booking here. I would have been more comfortable sleeping in the park. Filthy room. Disgusting. Poor front desk service. 
28856 I heard, there's a new Chef in town named Chef Adams. The food is delicious. The stay was great. Now, the food is the real deal, "Fine Dining" indeed. 
28857 This is a solid, handsome place to rest after running around midtown, going to plays, etc. Food and shopping is steps away. 
28858 I cannot think of one complaint about this hotel. The location is perfect for a first time visitor. The rooms are roomie and clean. I picked this hotel based on the reviews of this website and I was definitely NOT disappointed. 
28859 My expectations were exceeded by the Belvedere's service. The staff was very kind and efficient. Thank you all. 
28860 I loved the hotel location and the quality of the rooms. The front desk service is excellent. A little bit crowded during the summer. It is closed to the lake and in one of the most nicest areas of downtown chicago. 
28861 OK, it is not luxurious but it is cosy, very clean and the location is spot on! I cannot believe how lucky I was to find it! I highly recommend it! 
28862 We got a deal at booking.com and therefore it really paid off to stay in Holiday inn at 6th Ave. The rooms are small (but it is the same in other hotels in Manhattan). It was quite clean, great location. The service was averare. Overall we were very satisfied. 
28863 The level of service here (I write from my very-much run-down room) sets a new low standard. Try calling reception, or the concierge.....50 rings....no answer. Try taking an elevator.......you MAY get one today. The rooms are old and tired. For over $500 a night this is an absolute travesty. 
28864 Abgesehen von dem absolut winzigen Zimmer war alles ist Ordnung. Sehr sauber, sehr freundlich und eine prima Lage. 
28865 I found the grace hotel through Travelzoo.com.As i lived in manhattan before, i knew their location was great.During our stay,any concern or request was resolved right away.The bed comfort is better than the Westin.I will always recommend to my colleagues and friends and choose for my upcoming trips as well. 
28866 Great bar, great pool area and superb concierge. The spa is really wonderful and the poolside service and drinks/snacks are excellent. Room service perfect. 
28867 Hotel is a little old compare to the new ones nearby. Room is clean and pretty standard. What surprised us was the good service and a first class restaurant. Lots of airline personels stay here. 
28868 From the moment we arrived, they treated us as if we were home. Welcoming staff are friendly and very helpful. The rooms are not huge - they are however very efficient (and the bathrooms are very well appointed). Look closely or you will miss the entrance.Feels very private and secretive. 
28869 I have stayed here on 3 seperate occasions. The rooms are very roomy, clean, and modern. We've also been upgraded for free to a suite. Other New York hotels are so small. I preferred the Affinia to the Plaza. 
28870 Terrible place! Paper-thin walls, the whole hotel stank of fast food, the staff were obnoxious and crass. Really really unpleasant environment. I will never go back. 
28871 Hotel in ottima posizione .... a due passi dal madison square garden !! Camere pulite e confortevoli e staff molto gentile !! Consigliato vivamente 
28872 I really enjoyed my stay at the Warwick, the hotel was beutiful and the staff was terrific. I only wish I could have stayed there longer than the one night. 
28873 I stayed at the Carlton and I thought it was a great hotel. The space is beautiful and the neighborhood has a lot of great restaurants. Staff was wonderful to everyone in my group. For the value it was excellent. 
28874 Pleasantly surprised by this Orel in a really good location. A short walk through Manhattan to Times Square, 5/6/7th Avenues for shopping. There is also plenty to do in and around the hotel with good eateries and pubs a stones throw away. 
28875 The room size and quality are great for the location of the hotel. The staff is friendly and eager to serve the customer. The location of the hotel is about 2 miles from the airport which makes it very convenient and less stressful in traveling to the airport area. 
28876 Stayed here for my 30th birthday for 4 nights superb location right on times square easy walking distance for all attractions - really most amazing hotel and best holiday ever!! Rooms spacious clean and beds comfy staff friendly and helpful 
28877 We were there for my daughters make a wish and everyone was so helpful, Jackie the concierge especially, bless her. Thank you for making our trip wonderful and full of memories 
28878 I was very pleased with my stay at Hyatt Summerfield Suites in Houston's Energy Corridor. I was welcomed by a friendly staff and my room was very clean. The pillow top bed and 32" flat screened TV were awesome. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
28879 Rooms are standard for Hilton Group. Art deco themed hotel seems a bit fading. Staff and service good. Bar very expensive. Lower floor rooms very noisy. 
28880 Stay 1 street over if you can instead at the Sheraton or the other 3 hotels on 40th.. better hotels and more amenities... 
28881 Incredible location, location, location! Great hotel. Very comfortable. Great bed, bathroom and services. Enjoyed our stay a great deal! View from room was stunning!!! Staff was very helpful and very friendly. 
28882 This is the best value of the hotels in the area. Reservations easy to make, front desk is very friendly and helpful with directions. Parking is free, morning coffee is ready, meeting room is nice with tables/chairs, sofa, TV, books, etc. On-site manager is available to assist with problems. 
28883 I just called the hotel to inquire into availabilty and prices, after transferring me around, I finally talked to a very rude, rushed staff member. She was rude enough that I did not even pursue staying here. Bad Form. 
28884 Great hotel, staff and management are excellent. Good location close to NASA and baybrook mall. 
28885 Wonderful hotel. Great restaurant if you can get a table. Staff helpful and great location 
28886 great. very nice design, great location, awsome pool, bar, comfortable bed, clean and stylish shower/toilets, delicious breakfast. i wouldn't call the room rates cheap, but i guess reasonable for NYC, the location, and the interior. just a little bit cold in our room. anyway, i would stay in grace again! 
28887 We celebrated Thanksgiving in NYC and stayed at The Conrad for three nights. Greeted by a great ambience in the lobby upon arrival, we were meet with friendly service. The rooms are so nice and modern with touch lighting. The huge walk in shower was the most amazing shower ever! 
28888 If you are travelling to NYC for business reasons this is highly recommended. You have variety of options with respect to dining, travelling and activities after work. Based on whats the reason for the trrip it is at the Center/ Heart of Manhattan - perfect ofr busines stravellers. 
28889 Was this really in NYC? The suite we had was so spacious ~ it was like two room in one with a fun decor. The staff was extra friendly and helpful especially Todd. I would definitely stay at the Morgans again! 
28890 If you buy this hotel on hotwire or priceline you will get a great value because it is in a primo location--- just off 5th Ave at 44th street-- But the rooms are unbelievably tiny-----If you pay....."full" price you will feel totally ripped off.. 
28891 Voor mensen die van Central Park houden om daar heerlijk te wandelen of te sporten ligt Excelcior op een top locatie 1 min en je staat bij de ingang van het park. Metro en bussen stoppen voor de deur. In de buurt voldoende gelegenheid voor je ontbijt. Zeer nette buurt 
28892 I don't recall ever staying in a hotel more conveniently located for exploring the city. Traveled with my granddaughters. Everything we needed was within a few blocks: kid friendly restaurants, Times Square, theater district, fashion district, subway station next door. Hotel was lovely, staff helpful. 
28893 Pricey nice hotel for a different experience. It's more It's worth the price if you have a big room (not the smaller studios) for its stunning views, if you ask for them. Just a 2 minutes walk from Central Park. Location is just perfect. 
28894 I've stayed here a couple of times for business. I've stayed other Places nearby; but this is the best pick: great rooms, Internet, accoutrements. It's not perfect, simply the best choice. 
28895 I really like this hotel. I've been here two times and I will probably come back. It's a design hotel, with very spacious rooms and a great bed, I think one of the best beds I've ever sleep in. Totally recommended. 
28896 The location is not great but alright. This is located right smack in Chinatown so the smells are undesirable. The rooms are fairly small so you have to be comfortable with the people you are staying with. The bathroom is very clean :) which is a big PLUS in NYC. 
28897 I booked this hotel on Priceline and got a great deal. The hotel was definitely worth it. Nice spacious bathroom with a great shower. Comfortable beds. Friendly staff who stored my luggage while I was out in Chicago for the day. Nothing bad to say. 
28898 Wij waren erg tevreden over dit hotel, de prijs-kwaliteit verhouding is erg goed, de kamers zijn basic maar voldoende groot en de badkamers zijn schoon. Personeel is behulpzaam. Ligging vlakbij Broadway, Central Park en metro naar de rest van de stad. 
28899 Great location and iconic hotel to stay at whilst in NYC. Public areas absolutely top notch but the rooms are just standard and nothing to write home about. All in all a great choice in an ideal part of town. In hindsight I'd do EXACTLY the same again. 
28900 Bed Bugs. Got three bites in a few hours of sleep there. Nothing worse than bed bugs at a hotel. ITs an absolute nightmare waking up in the middle of the night now to check and see if any followed you home. 
28901 great view of World trade center, clean room, great restaurant, very friendly informative staffs. 
28902 Clean, friendly, new room decor, right at the airport. Cost way to much but all hotels are in this area as the demand is high and supply is low. I would stay here again. Plenty of plane traffics between 6am and 11pm. 
28903 Great value and location.. but beds are very uncomfortable...cardboard would ne better...and if you are not a heavy sleeper,then prepare to not get any sleep.you can hear everything through the Windows..and sat night at three in the morning.when the bars let out is like the movie fast and the furious. 
28904 For the reputation and price you could rightly expect much better. The rooms are small, the Internet is poorly serviced and needlessly expensive and the walls and hallway door are thin so that unwelcome sounds penetrated and woke me at 3 AM. 
28905 This hotel is located in a great part of town! Right by Soho, Little Italy and Nolita which are all very trendy. Great places to eat out at near by. The hotel is very cool and the rooms were great! Clean, comfortable beds and quiet. 
28906 Centrale, pulito, tranquillo, personale disponibile. Vicinissimo all'ONU e al Chrisler Buildinig, 300 mt. dalla stazione centrale metropolitana, 700 mt. dalla 5.a av. e circa un km da time square.Consiglio vivamente questo hotel. 
28907 Who can go wrong with: - clean rooms - great location, close to Empire State Building, Macy's, Lord & Taylor, Time Square..... - Tassimo in each room - Number bed in each room - Friendly staff - Access to Subway 
28908 Este hotel esta muy bien! No hagais caso de la foto de la cucaracha porque esta muy limpio y las habitaciones son muy grandes y bonitas! Si pillais alguna oferta no dudeis en ir! 
28909 Staff were great. Room was excellent. Ideally located for walking around Times Square and other NYC attractions. 
28910 Stayed at this hotel for our friends sons wedding to an all American gal what a fabulous hotel staff friendly service excellent rooms to die for situation could not have been better for all around Chicago. Free wi-fi in lobby but is chargeable in room 
28911 Hotel 4* carinissimo tra 5av e Madison (zona centrale).Le stanze sono pulite, insonorizzate e abbastanza grandi. Giornale e connessione wi-fi gratuito.Personale gentile ed affidabile. Se dovessi tornare a N.Y., vorrei ritornare qui. Lo consiglio caldamente a chi vuole trascorrere una settimana alla scoperta della Grande Mela! 
28912 Staying here for 6 nights...arrived very early in the morning and Elizabeth was amazing, she helped me out and got me a very nice room. She made sure everything was taken care of and even called to make sure I was happy. Location is also excellent. 
28913 We were greeted and upgraded immediately to a larger room that included it's own computer and window seat. Great hotel with a gracious staff, large rooms for NY and the perfect location. In walking distance to everything. Would definitely stay here again. 
28914 My husband and I stayed here for four nights over the coldest weekend in NY in six years. The staff was great, and the hotel is nicely appointed and the bed is fabulous. Will look here first on any return trip. 
28915 Very nice room, great location to Times-Square & theaters and yet quiet. Excellent service. Room service expensive and steak overcooked. Room and bath were very nice; a fabulous value for what we paid. 
28916 The location was great. I really enjoyed the breakfast at The Webber Grill every morning. 
28917 This is a very good value and location for a NYC hotel. Rooms are very comfortable and large and the staff were very good. 
28918 We booked a long Easter weekend stay with our elderly parents from Florida. The staff was gracious and accomodating. The location was ideal for our purposes. The corner rooms were clean, spacious and comfortable. Highly recommended. 
28919 This may be my favorite New York Hotel. I'm thrilled Le Parker Meridien is now part of the SPG family of hotels. 
28920 The rooms and suites renovation is incredible. The rooms are very large for NY and well appointed. The Bar and Restaurant have the most amazing view. 
28921 Free wifi only in the lobby, rooms very small, with little or no ventilation. Aircon unit over the bed, too noisy to have on, too hot to have off. Certainly wouldn"t recommend this to anyone. Don't expect to get any sleep here. 
28922 I have traveled all over the world and I have never been treated better than in this hotel. EVERY encounter with the employees was positive and I will definitely stay here again when in Houston. My stay was medical related and this hotel made everything easy. 
28923 Right on Michigan Avenue, close to restaurants and shops. Step out of the hotel and you can see how vibrant Chicago is. The rooms are dated and tired. The service overall was fine, but sometimes felt animated. 
28924 Great location but a depressing and horrible hotel, I could not be in the only to sleep and wake do your self a huge favour spend a bit more, it really put a downer on NYC itself 
28925 Aside from a great hotel, kudos to your customer service team. Mariana M.was fantastic. She greeted us when we checked in and made sure that we had a great stay. The hotel needs a team of Marianas! 
28926 The Palace is just that. A palace in the center of Manhattan. the rooms are impeccable and the service is as well. But perfection does not come cheap. Expect to pay and arm and a leg, but you do get what you pay for. 
28927 Stayed there after a wedding reception. Excellent service and amenities. Highly recommended. The mattresses are wonderful. 
28928 Great hotel, the rooms a clean, comfy and modern - great budget hotel. Shared bathrooms are clean and modern, cool light system in your room to show you when they are available/in use. 
28929 I loved my stay at the Renaissance Times Square Hotel! Incredible style throughout; Service that was perfect; Great food combined with a killer view that overlooks Tmes Square in the RLife lounge; Functional fitness center; and I loved the guest room's updated decor, good size, and incredible bed. 
28930 It is easy access to & from the tunnel. Once you're there, you can walk or take the train to anything you want to see or do. Staff were very knowledgeable and helpful with getting around to see our list of "to-dos" 
28931 We will stay there again. 
28932 Location is perfect, the staff is great, rooms are very nice and clean, upgrades and free wifi for select guest programm members. What else can you ask for? And all these for a very reasonable price in New York. 
28933 Couch and Chair in room had worn out fabric. The showerhead was broken and did not work right. Bathroom has small sink with no counter. Pull out bed was no good. Save your money and stay in a regular hotel. 
28934 We were shocked, our room measured 9feetx14----feet. The furniture looked as if it came from a thrift store. You could barely turn around in the bath room. The carpet must have been there for years and the mattress were worn out. The room had two twin beds!! 
28935 Staff were professional/friendly. There was a Knicks game Friday night and it was pretty noisy (7th avenue side) but I asked for a different location and was moved. Kitchenette was convenient to have. Rooms were fair to good. All-in-all I enjoyed my stay. 
28936 Stayed with a friend over Veteran's Day weekend. Service was excellent, even though the place was really busy. The room was large and comfortable. The best Times Square Location! 
28937 Lati positivi: ottima posizione, buon prezzo, colazione accettabile (pane tostato, ciambelle, frutta) Lati negativi: Camere piccolissime, non particolarmente pulito, personale maleducato, consierge inutile e arrogante 
28938 booked the 'petite' room which was fine for my one night stay. free wifi, decent bathroom amenities, helpful staff. best thing was the price and location (5min walk to Times Square) and safe neighbourhood st - pretty quiet and relaxed. no fancy features but for the price it's pretty good. 
28939 I cannot praise The Belevedere enough. The room, the service, the cafe were all superb. 3 adults sharing a double/double room. Location is central to everything in Manhattan. No problems with the lifts (had read other reviews voicing concerns) Don't hesitate to stay here...we won't! 
28940 We stayed for three days. The overall conditions of the hotel are acceptable, but the buidling is relatively old and there is no centralized heating. The location is perfect, though. It's ten minutes walk from the Thanksgiving parade, and a few train stations from the magnificent mile. 
28941 It worth the money. If you are looking for a budget hotel, good location (waking distance to Empire State and Macy's) and easy acess to the subway it is the hotel. Simple and clean (shared baths always clean) but no sophistication. 
28942 Nice old Hotel. Clean, everone very helpful. The restaraunts and bars although good close very early during the week which for a hotel that caters to the business crowd seems a little strange. It's a little on the expensive side but still very good. 
28943 Very comfortable, lovely staff friendly and helpful. Amazing location. Brilliant breakfast. 
28944 We have stayed in many hotels in NYC including the best reviewed and highest priced. The overall experience at the Carlyle is superior to any of them. 
28945 I have been staying at On The Ave for years and I love the hotel and the neighborhood. Staff is always more than helpful and the rooms are great. 
28946 Pod Hotel was an excellent starting point to discover New York. All major highlights are in walking distance. Good and very friendly service and assistance when questions come up. Quite small but highly efficient equipped double room with a great rainforest shower. 
28947 My wallet was stolen while in a crowded elevator in the hotel. I am still waiting for a report from the hotel to claim on insurance, now 5 weeks since the event. They obviously don't give a stuff 
28948 Also took until 5pm before our room was serviced. 
28949 clean room but small bathrooms and not a fan of the rugs on the floor breakfast great for NYC and cool bar for late cocktail amazing location in midtown 
28950 You call this hotel Boutique? 24HR. concierge! They need allot more training. Rooms comfortable, but the furniture is so cheap. If your charging these rates, get some real service and more expensive furniture. 
28951 STRUTTURA IN POSIZIONE OTTIMALE, SERVITA DA PIU' LINEE METROPOLITANE, CHE PERMETTE ANCHE A PIEDI DI RAGGIUNGERE IN POCHI MINUTI LUOGHI DI INTERESSE SIA CULTURALE CHE DI SVAGO. IL SERVIZIO E LA COLAZIONE SONO SODDISFACENTI ED IL PERSONALE DISPONIBILIE E CORDIALE. 
28952 Highly recommend this hotel. very friendly check-in staff .super clean rooms and comfortable beds.location is excellent .pax next door is great for breakfast 
28953 This place seemed to have excellent reviews. Although the sheets appeared to be clean, the beds were barely made and there were blood splatters on the wall near the bed. The only nice part was that our shower had excellent water pressure. We changed hotels our second night in NYC. 
28954 Far and away the least expensive room in midtown manhattan and clean, convenient and friendly. Front desk was accomodating free breakfast uncluded But the room is dorm sized and amenities minimal. Would stay here again. 
28955 Spoiled milk for breakfast was the first time I have ever had in a hotel. This really crossed the line. Add to it a tiny little room, with a leaking toilet making noise all night, plus a naughty bellman and you have yourself plenty of memories you seek to forget. 
28956 The room was clean, the staff were helpful, the breakfast was good, the place is quiet, the price is reasonable and the location is great. What else could you want in a hotel in Manhattan? This is definitely where I will stay on future trips to New York City. 
28957 Was very happy with my break in NY. Very centrally located. Complimentary breakfast included Good value hotel. will be staying again 
28958 The bed and view were super. I felt very comfortable and the service was very good. 
28959 posizione ottimale, vista l'ubicazione direi silenzioso, personale molto cortese.prezzo ottimo e camera ampia e confortevole con utile frigo. colazione inclusa ma con poca scelta. consigliato soprattutto alle famiglie con bimbi. 
28960 What a great find this hotel was!! It is compact, but the rooms were a lot larger than we anticipated. New and very clean. Absolutely fantastic location...so close to my favourite avenue...5th...with Times Square 5 mins away. Couldn't be happier this is selection and a great price as well!! 
28961 Fantastic travelled with my 14 year old son...great rooms..great staff...great service...fantastic bathrooms..an art deco lovers dream!! I WILL BE BACK I loved it 
28962 Es un hotel hermoso, bien ubicado, con mucha onda. La ubicacion es al limite del Soho. Nos alojamos en un piso alto por lo que la vista de la ciudad fue espectacular, recomiendo a quien elija el hotel que tengan presente esa eleccion. 
28963 Every member of the staff was polite, solicitous and full of good humor. The decor was restfully lovely. Although we appreciate the minimalist approach, our only desire would have been at least one chair in our room. Hope you see us soon! 
28964 Good sized room, clean and cozy. Great helpful staff. We will absolutely stay here next time we go to New York. The back alley has some nice pubs, but the hotel is very quiet. 
28965 This is my favorite midtown hotel. Great location. Hip vibe. Super service 
28966 We had 2 rooms ( 2x teenagers with us) The staff you could not fault, so very helpful. We used the hotel car which the boys loved ( phantom ) Great location. Used the pool which was very tranquil. A great hotel to stay in Beverly Hills 
28967 This is my our favorite NY Hotel. The rooms are spacious with comfortable king size beds. They allow 4 women to share one suite that has plenty of room with a walk in closet. Quiet yet near Times Square. 
28968 ottimo ristorante, la palestra ed il bar con musica jazz, indimenticabile. 
28969 Had a great stay here for a weekend in NYC. Very convenient to Times Square, shows, subway, etc. Nice decor, helpful staff. Nothing bad to say! 
28970 Very Nice Hotel, good value for money. 1 Block from 5th avenue and walking distance to Empire State Building and 15 min. walk to Times Square. Free high speed Internet access, refrigerator in the room spacious and with nice view on Empire State building. Staff very nice. 
28971 Rudy, best bartender. Friendly, fast, excellent service.... and great drinks! Fun guy under pressure. Super service on the hotel as well. Choose city side view rooms. Highline views! Easy access to all areas. 
28972 Great personnel and service. Manager, Elisabeth was very friendly and efficient. I loved the breakfast in the lobby. You can get real expresso and do it the way you like. good price too. Had a very pleasant stay. 
28973 Very luxurious hotel, is almost as real as what you can see on the pictures... Great service and conveniently located and everything walking distance, I mean, it is NY. Rooms are unfortunately a bit too small. 
28974 The service has been incredible! The staff has done everything possible to accommodate my family and has gone out of their way numerous times to go above and beyond. My experience has thus been phenomenal. 
28975 Everything about this hotel was spectacular. Facilities and room were extremely clean, service was always courteous and helpful, and the location really can't be beat. We requested a 'high floor' and were upgraded to a corner deluxe room on the 42nd floor overlooking 42nd Street and Times Square. 
28976 Estuvimos 1 semana a principios de octubre en el Stay de NY. Exelente ubicacion, decoracion muy moderna y buena atencion. Volvere a este hotel si regreso a NY, sin la menor duda. Cualquier consulta no dejen de preguntarme. Saludos.- 
28977 its the first stay for me in the Affinia hotels; i stayed in the Affinia Shelburn hotel @ Lexington and 38st last week and liked it very much. the rooms are new/renovated and are clean and include all the needed amenities and other stuff. 
28978 It was great, but also expensive...If money is not playing a big role for you, you should try it! Very beautiful grand hotel and one of the oldest! 
28979 + Schone kamer + Perfecte locatie (dicht bij times square) - Veel geluid vanaf de straten (normaal in NY) - Prijs aan de hoge kant 
28980 I have stayed at this hotel from 9 till the 12th of april 2012, the location is perfect nearby everything, i recommend it for 3 or 4 nights, the hotel needs some furniture renovation other than it is fine 
28981 A very modern hotel that is perfect for the business traveler but would not recomend for families. I have stayed at the hotel at least 10 times and neverr had a problem or complaint about the room or staff. 
28982 Great location but some of the rooms have strange configurations. My bathroom was a big as my room. Elevators are tricky for the first couple times as there are no buttons on the inside. You baiscially choose your floor outside and get in. They seem to run faster though. 
28983 Nice, but nothing spectacular in terms of charm or beauty. However, we had a clean, good sized room in a decent location. Staff was okay - kinda lukewarm bordering on apathetic. 
28984 Enjoyed our stay. Concierge was very helpful and had a great trip to New York. Location was wonderful and the experience was all positive. 
28985 Located in a great area, we walked everywhere our whole time there. The rooms were beyond beautiful! Very cool design, very clean, high ceilings, down feathered blanket, polished concrete floors... I loved this hotel! Its probably one of my top picks up till now! 
28986 Stayed at the New York Palace Hotel for a weekend conference. It was an excellent hotel with every amenity one could require. Staff was extremely courteous and helpful. Will definitely stay there again. 
28987 Dirty room, heater doesn't work well. Concierge with bad education. Room so small. Localization great only 
28988 Hotel muy centrico 
28989 Al lado del times square. De los mas economicos q encontramos con una alidad buena ". Habitaciones muy cuidadas y limpias con decoracion moderna. Lo recomiendo!! 
28990 A good value for the price. The decor is a bit dated , but the rooms are clean. The staff is very friendly. The free shuttle to and from the airport is a valuable perk. 
28991 i really did want to write a review as i did have a great time.....i think the best service i have got in a very long time 
28992 Wonderful location as I enjoy staying on the West side. Hotel room was lovely with a garden view. Bathroom had great light for getting dressed and putting on makeup. Would for sure stay here again. 
28993 It's all you need for NY: clean, safe, bright, comfortable, well-located. My new favorite. Looking forward to the new Great Room opening. Small room so what? Much better than shared bath option elsewhere. 
28994 I prefer to stay at the Manhattan Hotel when in mid-town. It's consistent in the checkin, check out and room experience. And it's quieter than other hotels I've stayed at in mid-town. My room was available when I arrived and clean. 
28995 Great location. Traveled with 2 year old and found this hotel met our needs, except that from the main entrance you had to go up stairs/escalator and no elevators, so coming in on wheelchair or stroller required using a back entrance that often didn't work. Apart from that, great place. 
28996 The positives: Friendly and attentive front desk and room service staff. The not-as-positives: Tiny room and uncomfortable bed, the in-room phone was not working, the bathroom could have been more thoroughly cleaned, and the windows were open when i got to the room. Would not rush back. 
28997 The hotel has bed bugs they deny it and pay off an exterminator to avoid chomping guests and paying their medical bills. Never stay here when there are other better hotels in that neighborhood. 
28998 It's an older hotel that has been nicely renovated. The rooms are small but comfortable and considering the location, centrally located in lower Manhattan, the place is a great value. This ain't no day spa, it's true, but the staff is courteous and responsive and the rooms are clean. 
28999 Cannot recommend this place too highly. Fantastic location, great service from all the staff. Nice big clean rooms. What else could you want from an affordable city hotel? 
29000 I've been to NYC quite often, but this is the best hotel I've stayed so far. Great location (Herald Sq), friendly staff, breakfast included, free WiFi, big rooms and clean. 
29001 Bargain hotel for the able. Six steps up to tiny lobby. Bathrooms really bleached clean. Neighborhood felt safe to walk. Two blocks from bus and subway connections. Quiet. Victorian details could inspire a mystery writer. 
29002 My room was incredibly dirty upon checking in. Hotel staff was just "so so". Would not stay here again. 
29003 Thanks everyone for reviews about this hotel.it really helped to choose 
29004 Mela is in a great location.no view to NY though..windows are facing offices.Clean rooms, nice staff.good value. Doesn't smell. i had a bigger room after a little bit of discussion but still.....we paid 220 dol. per night. 
29005 The layout of this hotel makes it very noisy regardless of what room you stay in. It's not too bothersome during the day, but when people are at the lobby bar each night it's next to impossible to block out the noise. 
29006 Despite the small place, I liked how clean this place was. Great concierge service. The bar is awesome and the staff members very professional. 
29007 Thanks to all of you who make our stay at our home away from home so pleasant 
29008 We look forward each time visiting you. It is well worth the trip and knowing we get a good nights sleep there thanks again 
29009 Stayed in Aug., 2003. Everything was as good, or better, than expected. Would recommend to others and stay there again. Excellent location (44th Street is relatively quiet and close to theatre district - but not too close) Courteous & friendly staff. 
29010 Just back from Stay in The W, Times Square, it is a classy hotel, with great service and very central. The rooms were very comfortable, lovely beds. Would definitely recommend it to anyone, will stay again next visit to New York. The Staff were very helpful and friendly! 
29011 This hotel was recommended for Tripadvisor opinions and I hve to say that the location is excellent. The best bed that I have slept. The only inconvenients are they did not server breakfast and the room was a inner room. 
29012 Great Hotel for a weekend Getaway...Good Location, Friendly & Helpful Staff, Quiet Modern Rooms and inexpensive weekend room prices...for the budget minded, skip having breakfast at hotel, much too expensive..American Breakfast over $30.00 pp..lots of local cafes with "regular breakfast menu items and reasonable pricing,, 
29013 We were at the Marriot this past weekend the Hotel is nice and clean, rooms was specious and always clean, the towels so white and fresh. I deffinetly will be back to Marriott Hotel. 
29014 Great clean hotel, with big rooms. Free high speed internet, free hot breakfast, Very convenient to George bush airport and the Greenspoint Business District, Staff was very helpful and courteous. Awesome prices too!!! 
29015 Very good quality for price in NYC. Nice rooms. but not so ideal for Chinese- funeral homes around... 
29016 It had everything we wanted, Good clean rooms, comfortable bed, good shower facilities. Access to own catering if wanted. Complimentary breakfast good value. Just round the corner from Times Square, would stay again. Staff professional and friendly. 
29017 I really enjoyed my staying at royal sonesta Houston, very clean hotel with quality of service, I liked the location near the Galleria shopping center and major attractions places. Definitely will chose the hotel on my next travel to Houston. 
29018 I would recommend this hotel because the staff was attentive, it was clean and affordable. Enjoy! 
29019 Ok, it's hard not to love a spot on Central Park. The service was impeccable, the location perfect, I guess my only quibble would be size of the rooms.. was expecting larger but what the heck.. the carriage ride in the park made up for it. 
29020 Staff is very friendly and willing to help. Clean room. Hotel has a great location, close to Times Square. Good value for New York standards. 
29021 This hotel was fine for what it was. We were in down for UChicago drop-off and events. The room was always clean. Internet was slow and non-functional during peak times. The location was great for getting in and out of the city with ease. 
29022 The hotel which is grand but very cozy. The staff are very friendly. I met the sales director and she is so pleasant and very informative. They make you feel at home away from home.. 
29023 Centrally located hotel close to times square. Rooms were always clean and free muffins and te/coffee was provided for guests in a morning. 
29024 Our room was very comfortable. We were able to have rooms nearby to family members. After dinner )off-site) the kids wanted ice cream and even though not on the menu, the staff was able to satisfy their desires. Very accommodating and helpful staff. 
29025 Excellent location,first class rooms and facilities,excellent restaurant.The staff were very efficient and extremely friendly,nothing was too much trouble. 
29026 the absolutely perfect luxury hotel. the room was great, the service was fantastic and extremely friendly, the concierge always helpful. Hotel is in the middle of everything -great midtwon location, short walks to shopping, restaurants and the park. 
29027 A one night stay with sisters. We were impressed with the friendly helpful attitude of everyone on the staff we dealt with from the valet parking attendant to Daniel at the front desk. Good location for walking to many attractions. 
29028 This hotel is a great find in the area, Fabulous shopping is a block away! My only complaint is paying for the internet in the room when it's free in the lobby. It should be free period! 
29029 As Marriott Platinum, we were given a two bedroom suite. Good beds, clean, big bathrooms. Three TV's. Walking distance to Galleria Mall & its restaurants. Also many other restaurants walkable. Gated entry, secure parking. Better than average free breakfast. No complaints about this property. 
29030 Check into one of their suites and enjoy all that New York has to offer! Let Alan and Venessa take care of threstaurants and theatres. Rooms are large and luxurious. Staff is attentive and courteous! All together they helped make our January break-ation very special! 
29031 I love the location and warmth of this property! The staff is so very helpful. I have been staying at the Barclay for the last three and a half years for my business and pleasure travel and highly recommend it to all my friends and business partners. 
29032 Hotel with good location next to tIme Square and 5th Avenue, excelent services, rooms, king bed and with delicius breakfest. All employees are kinds and helpul. I recomend this hotel for bussiness or vacation in the Big Apple 
29033 Great hotel! I have stayed here multiple times! Wonderful staff.. Spotless rooms.. Great amenity kits.. Clean lobby.. And great location! Can't say anything better! I will use this hotel for all of my personal trips.. Makes work seem like heaven! Especially the beds!!! Talk about sleeping on cloud nine!!!! 
29034 All the reviews are true. This is a great place to stay while in NYC. Elevators are slow, so plan accordingly (10-20 min). Great breakfast buffet and free WiFi, highly unusual for NYC. Very clean, comfortable and convenient. Great staff. Great value. No doubt that we would stay here again. 
29035 It was a great hotel with large and bright rooms. The location was also great, walking distance from major attractions. 
29036 Small rooms (I mean small), clean bathrooms, amazing location, moderate night noise, no bed bugs (in our room), average staff. We just use hotels for sleeping, so we actually enjoyed it. 
29037 And the coffee in the lobby in the morning isn't free, which I think is a bit unnecessary at a $300 per night hotel! Still, the wifi is free (if you join the loyalty programme) and the services was very good, so will probably go back again. 
29038 Small rooms, getto service and nothing works properly. Try using a blowdryer in the bathroom while having 2 lights and the tv on. They don't seem to care about the heat either. The renovation looks much older than 2 years. Try doing it again soon. 
29039 This hotel was in a great location for shopping, dining and nightlife. Everything you need is within walking distance or a short cab ride away. 
29040 Buona location per lo shopping, a pochi metri da Times Square, ma l-albergo e- impersonale, 1000 stanze, arredo scarso, servizi anche (es. internet connection a pagamento e solo nella lobby affollatissima), rischio di file per il check in, specie nel weekend e nei periodi di punta. Buon servizio deposito bagagli. 
29041 This hotel was perfect for a weekend stay in NYC. The staff was friendly and informative, and the rooms, though small, were pleasant. The free breakfast was a plus. The historic hotel is situated in Mid-Town and just steps from Broadway. We would definitely stay there again. 
29042 According to website it was $29 + tax, which is around $33,5, but I paid $42. There are hidden fees!! It's not claen either not cheap. 
29043 Good price through Priceline for NYC. Rooms are a bit small, to be expected in NYC. Hotel seems clean, staff helpful. I've stayed a couple of times with no complaints. The breakfast is very good. Pleanty of space. Free wireless internet. 
29044 Decent hotel - nice reception and boutiquey ambience. Rooms were at the good end of standard with nice bathrooms. Fitness centre also fairly good and not overly crowded. Breakfast was excellent (although typical NY prices). Internet worked perfectly. Can't ask for much more for a business stay in midtown. 
29045 Zimmer war fantastisch. Ruhig, nur kleine Fenster, aber ich kam nach New York um die Stadt zu sehen. Habe super geschlafen. Bett war Klasse und die Einrichtung im Hotel auch. Sehr gut gelegn. 1.5 Blocks vom Times Square. 
29046 The Parker Meridien consistently delivers a high quality service, room and experience, all set in a great European Inspired blend of function and design. Great location, great service, and great ambiance. 
29047 nothing negative to say about hotel at all,great breakfast great staff ,rooms were really clean ,think we had a bargin from what i have seen of other new york hotels ,would go back anytime and reccomend to anyone 
29048 Fuimos con mi familia, y las habitaciones si bien son chicas, tienen una excelente vista de la ciudad. La atencion muy buena, lo mejor que tiene el hotel es la ubicacion. Muy recomendable. 
29049 The hotel is in a very nice neighborhood and within walking distance to many sights. The room was large and clean. The staff was very friendly and helpful. We loved the rooftop bar! 
29050 Great service, fabulous room, would definitely stay there again 
29051 I will forgive a hotel many things if it has water pressure like Chambers! Great location, polite staff, comfy beds, best shower I can remember. Stayed one night on business and it delivered everything we needed. Reccomended 
29052 Incredible location, not bad for a hotel in the airport. Rooms are a bit dark and small, but otherwise friendly staff and good service. 
29053 Everything was absolutely great as usual!! Never had any problem at London, my preferred hotel in NYC!! 
29054 i think this place is a little gem it's so reasonably priced for the area. The staff were really helpful and you can walk to all the main attractions. Another major bonus for me is the free wifi you don't get that in many places. 
29055 It was great fun staying at the YOTEL! We loved the location, the friendly staff, the design and the positive vibe it had! 
29056 I loved that it was close to the different subway lines and the room, but the standard room is a bit too small. I'll be back by the end of this month, but plan to get a bigger one. 
29057 Rooms were clean, except for the phone...The receiver was disgusting caked on make up. Rooms are VERY small. TV reception is bad except for CNN. Nice location. Subway just a block away. 
29058 large beautiful upgraded room in great location with fabulous view and every amenity. would stay there again without a second thought. 
29059 Flott, rent og hyggelig hotell, kun et kort kvartal fra Soho-gryta. Enkel, men god frokost, gode senger og bra service. Ligger ogsaa rett ved to t-banelinjer. gangavstand til det meste paa lower manhattan. Anbefales! 
29060 Stayed here for 3 nights. Clean rooms. Older building. Lakeshore Cafe attached to hotel had very slow service. Hostess miserable. Great Area Shuttle. John the driver was awesome. Definitely would stay again. 
29061 Stayed two nights to meet with our son. Great hotel, excellent service. 
29062 In town for family business and had a delightful stay. Full kitchen was a great plus! 
29063 The reservation service excellent, the room with great decor and the view from the room was wonderful manhattan allowed to enjoy the night, the bathroom and kitchen with good services. Very good cleaning. we are well treated 
29064 Good location. Trendy bar on the top floor and very accommodating staff. Door men are very friendly. Stayed here 5 times in the past year Check it out 
29065 the room was nice,big and clean but the shower had a drian issue the water backed up in the tub not good i recomend they get that fixed 
29066 *I miss the breakfast. 
29067 Yotel is in a great location. We had an amazing view from our room and the staff was always happy to help with anything and everything.it was clean and quiet. The best hotel I've been too. I loved the concept. I can't wait for my next visit! 
29068 Close to subway, Close to Columbus Circle. Room was a bit small, but I guess that's NY on a budget. Good food at the restaurant. Very nice staff. Outside courtyard area was very nice. However at night it was full of smokers. The rooftop veranda was great to look around. 
29069 Great location for shopping, dining and sightseeing! We stayed in a corner suite, on the 15th floor with an amazing view of the church. Room was clean, and nicely furnished. Enjoyed a wonderful room service breakfast as well. 
29070 Nice spacious rooms, friendly fast service and a great outdoor pool for 6am swim when you are still on European time. 
29071 Ottimo sia per la posizione che per il servizio..non riesco a capire come si possano dare giudizi negativi su questo hotel. 
29072 went for 5 days, lovely hotel was automatically upgarded to a room with a view of the empire state, very clean and tidy room, friendly staff, the only thing wrong is all the tipping everyone expects, really gets on your nerves....nice place to visit would be better in the summer... 
29073 In Murray Hill. Great location for events at MSG and Time Square. Clean, friendly hotel with intimate charm. Some rooms a bit tired looking, but for the money, can't complain. 
29074 It was a wonderful experience staying at the doubletree. They upgraded us to 41st floor upon check in. It was so much fun to be right on Time Square, and next to the subway. Highly recommended!!! 
29075 Dit hotel ligt ideaal voor toeristen die New York bezoeken. 3 blokken van de Metro en centraal tussen uptown en downtown. Met keuken faciliteiten op de kamers is het mogelijk om 's morgens rustig te ontbijten. 
29076 This was a comfortable hotel for my stay in Houston. The clean nice sized rooms, the free parking, the free wi-fi, and the complimentary breakfast was awesome. The hotel was close to shopping and various restaurants, and close to major highways. 
29077 The best hotel of my life. I would improve explanations about the use of the shower: it was difficult to understand how to open it and also the water stream was very strong, too strong, sometimes also dangerous for people not used to such a kind of device. 
29078 Absolutely great place to stay. Perfect location for the sightseeing people, quite inexpensive for new york too. stayed in the modonna room and i wouldnt stay anywhere else quite honestly. 
29079 Everyone from the time we checked in at the reservation desk to service by housekeeping, waitress staff etc were always friendly, efficient, and helpful.Can't say enough!My favorite in the city.Had a beautiful room overlooking Times Square! room was spacious and very clean. 
29080 Situated at the galleris mall this hotel is very boring. I didnt find the room to be in a good state especially the barhroom needs service e.g. The toilet would run if i didnt open the cistern and pushed the valve close. 
29081 The staff are very warm and friendly. The room is cozy, bathroom small but extremely comfortable bed! Location... Not the greatest but close to subway. 
29082 We stayed 3 nights and enjoyed Chicago. This hotel is in front of red line metro stop. Easy to get on subway or bus system. Great beds and pillows! We really enjoyed this hotel. 
29083 We had a wonderful stay at this hotel. The room was very spacious and the price was great. Great location in Chicago. Would definitely stay here again. 
29084 Discreet property, wonderful staff that remembers you from visit to visit. When visiting Beverly Hills, West Hollywood, the location is wonderfully convenient. I particularly love the breakfast fruit smoothies! 
29085 Friendly staff, great tribeca/soho-location, clean hotel, okay fitness/businesscentre and reasonably priced hotel. 
29086 We stayed in the Paramount Times Square for our honeymoon, its a fantastic hotel, very stylish, modern, clean and friendly and only a stones throw away from Times Square. It will be our first choice hotel when we return to NY! 
29087 We had a terrific time at thishotel during our recent stay. The staff was extremely courteous and helpful. We have already recommended this hotel to our friends and will definitely return for another visit. 
29088 Just an average hotel. Nice that it was close to Galleria, but pool disappointing. 
29089 I was expecting more from my room based on the price per night and the lobby. The room itself was not disappointing but the bathroom was not up to the standards of cleanliness one would expect from a 4 star hotel. 
29090 Literally the worst service I have ever had. Nothing personal. Just horrible service. MODELS W NO SERVICE EXPERIENCE. 
29091 Very economically priced with excellent location. It faces the Central Park. Service was very good. Friendly staff. Rooms need a little repair: wallpaper was coming off in a part of our room. Bar was a too expensive. Good breakfast program. Would come back again for the value 
29092 I have stayed at the Ramada Inn Eastside on numerous occasions. Ramada is an excellent hotel. The hotel is spotless. The accommodations are Superior! The people are Outstanding! 5-STARS! 
29093 Small rooms, but the whole environment is excellent. Great decoration, staff (concierge) and guests. 
29094 We started this year needing a place to stay while watching our son play football at Uof Houston. Close, clean, friendly people and great service. We feel well taken care of each week. Rick Kolster 
29095 Viajamos por primera vez con mi esposo a New York, habiamos reservado el hotel por internet gracias a las referencias de otros viajeros y realmente fue una experinecia excelente, todo muy bueno y realmente facilito nuestro viaje. 
29096 It has been a while since my visit to New York and this hotel, but I do know that this hotel was very comfortable and in a great spot, close to central park. No complaints whatsoever! Staff was friendly and cooperative, rooms were clean and well kept. No complaints whatsoever! 
29097 What a nice stay.overall this hotel meet all our expectation.the rooms are large and well presented.the service is all class and the restaurant food is delicious. 
29098 great hotel, small room but really clean (508), the view from the roof is amazing.Staff very friendly....there is no doubt that we ll stay there for our next trip in New York. 
29099 We stayed 3 nights pre-cruise and loved it. It felt like a good, grown-up New York hotel. Room was big, good housekeeping, excellent customer service. Had drinks and apps in the bar one night and that was good. Location is excellent. Got a good deal on Priceline. 
29100 Very comfortable, walk to everything! Clean, a little old-fashioned but that added to the charm for me. 
29101 Stayed one night on business last summer (June 2006). Nice neighborhood. Short walk to the Park. Covenient to business and theatres. Fine service, but not 'snooty'. 
29102 I booked this hotel for this Friday. And unfortunatly did not notice this. How does a hotel maintain a four star status with these basic amenities 
29103 I stayed at the Mave with my daughter - it was very convenient, great helpful staff. They gave us several restaurant recommendations which were excellent. Breakfast was nice but would have liked someplace to sit. Room was tiny but expected for NYC 
29104 Cool rooms and a great location. Great price for this time of year. Would stay here again! 
29105 We stayed at Seton hotel for 4 nights. Staff was very friendly and helpfull, location is good. Not far from times square and close to subway station grand central which was convinient. Room was not very big, but definetly sufficient. Bathroom was confortable. 
29106 Our room was near the elevators and the hotel gym. All night long, we could hear other guests coming and going. The staff was also very snobby toward us. It's a great location but there are other nearby hotels that I would choose instead. 
29107 Had everything we needed for a Houston vacation (5 days). Nice and simple and quiet. Liked a lot. Not the Ritz, didn't need to be. 
29108 Upon arrival we were given a free upgrade to a suite. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. For the price we paid you couldn't beat the value and location. I would definitely recommend to a friend! 
29109 Great experience didn't exPect do much from three star. Great location room not so small. 
29110 Good value for the money; clean and comfortable beds. Free internet, close to the subway, sounds from outside was suprisingly low. Perfect place to sleep at after a day of shopping or seightseeing in NY. 
29111 I stayed at The Jane for 3 nights,it was my first time in New York and I found the hotel to be Clean well run and they are happy to help you with any problems. This hotel would be my first port of call when I return to New York. 
29112 Estuvimos el verano pasado , habitaciones comodas , la kitchenette es un plus para sentirse como en casa. Sillones , heladera, en fin un hogar lejos de casa. Volveremos sin duda 
29113 Il mese di Agosto ho soggiornato qualche giorno con la mia famiglia in questo meraviglioso Hotel, personale molto disponibile e attento, camere spaziose, bagno magnifico, letto comodissimo, insomma tutto perfetto. ci torneremo sicuramente a dicembre. 
29114 We purchased a Groupon for a two-night stay. Our room was comfortable, clean and very quiet. An excellent location on the Upper East Side. Thanks to the management for the Groupon offer. We appreciated Sara Beth's, the museum tickets, and the Metro Card compensation very much. 
29115 New York City is very expensive. But Hotel 17 is reasonably priced. The location is great. Near Union square and with excellent subway access. The hotel is well run, friendly, and clean. Service is good. An excellent value!. AND we had no bedbugs :) 
29116 This hotel is located near the seaport, close to shops, pubs and restaurants. The room and bathroom were very clean. the staff was ver accommodating. Very comfortable setting, highly recomend for your NYC stay. 
29117 the staff was exceptionaly friendly. the breakfast was the best free breakfast ive ever had in NY. the rooms and the hotel in general was spotless. a very fun atmosphere. 
29118 You can not beat the location, close to everything with a subway station one block up. Beautiful, clean rooms and a very friendly staff. Very comfortable beds and the rooms are quiet. The bar in the lobby is beautiful but pricey, however they do have an adequate wine selection. 
29119 Great location, great staff, clean, safe, and feels new. Good value for any NYC hotel, especially mid-town. I loved the tall, good flow shower - a rare find in any hotel anywhere. 
29120 Stayed at The Wellington and it was amazing, New York is amazing. The hotel was great, really nice, comfortable and service was great. It is a massive hotel in a great location, close to Broadway and Central Park. I would defenatly stay there again. 
29121 Nice, clean & close to everything. Some of the staff could have been friendlier. Room was huge. Lifts were very slow & creaky. Would stay here again. Try Green Cafe a few door's down for breakfast. 
29122 Seriously. When you are in NYC, who stays in their room? If the people critizing this property are only concerned by room size, I say - "get outside and enjoy the city!" This property has nice amenities and great location. 
29123 Sparkled with great service, location, and some of New York's best dinning right on the premises. 
29124 The hotel is really great and it is beautifull from inside and outside. A big disadvantage was that we thought we would have the possibility to go in the nice club for USD 500 but this was not possible without bottled service. 
29125 Really convenient hotel being within walking distance of the terminal. Great room and good choice of restaurants. Staff really friendly and the rate was very competitive. Will certainly use again 
29126 Great location, spacious rooms. The bathroom is very small. Needs some updating- carpet, painting etc. Otherwise very clean. The breakfast in the executive lounge was disappointing- stale pastry. I was there the night before hurricane Sandy arrived so maybe there was a problem getting fresh pastry. 
29127 This hotel is excellent in it's location to everything in Manhattan. The staff was very courteous and helpful with all of my requests. The only issue is the construction at Carnegie Hall which kicked in at 7:00 AM every morning. Everything else was WONDERFUL. 
29128 Convenient location. Friendly staff and a great breakfast; awesome way to start the day. We'll be back. 
29129 Not a special hotel, but very clean (common bathrooms) and convenient location, good value for money! I stayed for the weekend as a single traveler and as such can definitely recommend this hotel. 
29130 The hotel is very nice and clean with excellent location to places in Manhattan, however the room is a little on the small side. 
29131 Rooms were large and comfortable. Staff was very friendly and helpful Really appreciated the Security before going up to the room. 
29132 Great location nice hotel. You can walk to many places like time square. The rooms are nice and clean. excellent room service at any time. I travel with my friend and have a wonderfull time. next time i will stay in the same hotel. 
29133 only reason to stay here is location, location, location. friendly enough staff but the hotel is tired and a cross between somewhere your kids would go for a prom or your exec buddies for a conference...not glamour. rooms not the cleanest, even after we complained...would not go back. sorry. 
29134 miren las fotos una imagne habla mas que mil pralabras. nuestras vacacines fueron una pesadilla gracais a este hotel y nuestro operador en Madrid Ven y Viaja. 
29135 Writing this for my husband who was beside himself with how bad this hotel was - even for a one-night last-minute stay. Place was dirty - hallway, rooms, bathroom in particular. Joke of a restaurant. To use his words "Nasty!" 
29136 staying in residence inn, 6th and 39th ave, great hotel plus location our room was nice and clean stsff is great.. 
29137 Halfway between 5th Ave and Times Square, 4 blocks South of Rockefeller Centre; an ideal base for seeing the sights. And the luxury of a comfortable bed for a smashing night's sleep after a hard day enjoying ourselves! Worth every penny. 
29138 Great location, very close to Penn station. Only thing is our room was noisy(there was a constuction on the street) and cold. 
29139 Has a fridge, stove & microwave so thats a plus, just not impressed with the room. Had peeling paint in shower, TV to small & bed not the most comfortable. 
29140 Our room was a suite in the Tower. it was very large and comfortable, and had a kitchen. The well appointed bathroom had wonderful Molton Brown products. The room was spotless as were the common area. The hotel is walking distance to great shopping, Central Park, etc. 
29141 In a nutshell: - spacious room - magnificient views - well appointed bathroom - very helpful concierge - not impressed by the service in the bar Unfortunately, the hotel is missing a bit of a soul and that essential wow factor. 
29142 Fabulous except for key problem. The location is perfect and construction will be a temporary problem. Hoping to come back in the spring 
29143 Great hotel! Amazing location, best staff at any hotel I've ever stayed in. 
29144 The staff are very pleasant and helpful. The location is great. Having a kitchenette can be very useful if one decides to just stay in one evening, also having a coffee machine is good, especially for the morning! I shall definitely stay here again! 
29145 Excelente ubicacion y los Martinis son los mejores de la zona 
29146 This hotel has it all. Don't let a modest facade belie it's interior. Comfortable, well appointed rooms - I had an executive King. Nice fitness center. Walking distance to everywhere I wanted to go and a great run in Central Park! 
29147 Fantastic place to stay away from the total madness of Times Square and mid Manhattan but still in a vibrant area 
29148 The subway was very close and easy to use and Canal Street and Chinatown close by. Super attentive staff, comfortable room with a fantastic power shower! Would highly recommend. 
29149 After returning home, discovered on credit card statement that bar bills were fradulently altered to increase the tip given. Complaint ignored and had to get money back through credit card company. Very poor customer service - and no apology - even though their employees stole from me. Unbelievabe. 
29150 Good location, low rates, ugly lobby, slow elevator, great beds. 
29151 This hotel is like a hidden treasure. Great location for the theatre, park, restaurants and shopping. Rooms are large, clean, well stocked with plush towels, quality toiletries, and a staff that makes you feel like your home. 
29152 Loved our stay at the TRYP! Clean, modern, BIG and comfortable rooms, courteous staff and great location! Great food! Will recommend to all my friends! 
29153 Good location - just on the edge of everything, taxis everywhere so easy to get around. Reasonable collection of eating places nearby. Friendly staff, helpful but not too over-bearing. Impressed how large the room was. Would definitely come here again. 
29154 This hotel rocks! Love it! Modern, sophisticated, wonderful ambience, great position and above all, the staff are fantastic! Health Club wasn't available due to refurbishment; an alternative was available around the corner, but we didn't use it, so can't comment. 
29155 Location is fantastic, heat for shopping and enjoying a run down Lake Shore Drive. WiFi connection is really weak, room service is ridiculously expensive and rooms are only so so good. Staff answer your questions, but less than friendly. 
29156 Booked this trip on Priceline for a good rate for Saturday and Sunday in August 2012. Nice room. Decor and mood Of the hotel was excellent. Parking is valet only for 19/day (a bit of a deal buster). Free wifi is good as well. 
29157 Tiny room, platform bed okay for 1 night. Would hate to stay longer. Hotel has style but very very small making a uncomfortable experience. 
29158 Just back from 4 nights at the New Yorker lovely hotel so central room very clean nice size only fault staff at reception not very friendly 
29159 Great hotel bad location just don't leave the hotel. Hotel airport transportation can be unreliable at times. 
29160 Third visit here and it exceeded expectations. Close to perfect. Breakfast was wonderful--must try dinner next time. Average to small room, as in what you would expect in New York, but well thought out. 
29161 hi, We stayed at hotel Newton four nights, hotel was better than we excepted. Staff was nice and room was ok. 
29162 The staff at this hotel are excellent. Its evident that they care about their guests. I have stayed there several times and never been disappointed. 
29163 The lobby of this hotel may as well be in Grand Central. The hotel is fantastic with service and very comfortable, clean rooms. We used our room as a sleeping place only, but the lobby has a great coffee kiosk...yet expensive. The concierge was very helpful with show tickets. 
29164 Ons zakelijk verblijf hier in dit hotel was prima. Makkelijk bereikbaar per auto (!) en toch midden in de stad. Tegenover het hotel konden we voor 25 dollar per dag onze auto parkeren. Helaas geen gratis WIFI maar dat blijft nog altijd een dingetje in hotels. 
29165 The hotel is very unique and provides a very interesting atmosphere for both business and pleasure. My business deals with creative as well as technical and the hotel provides a very good background for conducting meetings. 
29166 This hotel is walking distance to all Broadway theatres, Times Square, and 5th Ave shopping. Very large beautiful rooms. The staff was also very friendly and helpful. 
29167 Recently stayed at this Hilton Garden Inn for a long week-end. Great location. Very good service from the attentive and polite staff. Room was clean, comfortable and quite spacious. I have truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel and would not hesitate to return. 
29168 It was a big room, with two double beds, nice for the $, would so stay again! Nice staff, helpful and close to almost everything. 
29169 Enjoyed the view, the huge bathing area, full bar and turnback service, heavy hooded robes. I mean what should I had expect? Great time 
29170 Clean, modern, spacious room. Quiet! Excellent staff. Great neighborhood, many bars and restaurants. Easy transport, close to subway. Hard to beat this hotel at these prices. 
29171 This hotel was nice. It is right next door to the World Trade Center site. The only downfalls were that my bathroom had a bad mildew smell to it and that you could loudly hear everyone talking / closing doors in the hallway. The rooms were tiny. 
29172 I can sum up this hotel in two words; Fantastic stay. Nothing else needs to be stated 
29173 Very close to Broadway. My first impression was not very good, but it served to my propose of visiting new york and having a clean place for sleeping. 
29174 Have stayed @ The Thompson LES several times. If you're into staying at a small boutique hotel then this the place. Wonderful location and beautiful rooftop terrace. 
29175 5 wonderful days. Great staff, great room, great location! 
29176 Perfect location and wonderful staff all wrapped up in great price 
29177 The shoreham is a very stylish hotel. The rooms are small but is really clean. 
29178 I had a great experience. The staff was extremely helpful. The rooms were great for New York and I look forward to returning. Thank you for a great stay. 
29179 My husband and I stayed at the Bedford Hotel New York and were pleasantly surprised. It was very clean,staff friendly, and well located for all the sights - it could perhaps do with a little up-dating, however we would certainly stay there again 
29180 Got it on Priceline for $100 a night, which is a GREAT deal. Hotel is really nice. The bar in the lobby gets very busy on friday/saturday nights which is very fun, but far to expensive. 
29181 The location is great, at a good price. We paid 155$/night for two double beds, parking include. The rooms are fine, they are not brand new but they're ok. Would go there again. 
29182 it was nice frendley motel service is great room is good i will be come back hear gm was very nice hoskeping was very exceellent i will let my freands know it's good place to stay hotel look clean and safe thanks 
29183 The hotel is kept immaculate and the service is impeccable. The rooms while not very different from other great hotels, are very well maintained. Concierge service (thanks, Andrea) was top of the line as was valet. 
29184 We went to the hotel several times, excellent service from NILSA RODRIGUEZ, from the front desk. The worst was DAVID from the front desk, very poor treat, terrible DAVID!!!!! The worst experience with a front desk is called DAVID!!!! Regards, Marcio 
29185 overall it is good. I did not give 5 stars because of one night stay in smoking room. The smells made us sick. 
29186 this place was sick! Puke out front of the door, rude staff, asked for non smoking room and got smoking! Room was so dirty i slept in my clothes. i would have rather saved the 100 bucks and slept on the sidewalk in Wrigleyville!!!!!!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE EVER!!!!!! 
29187 The room was ridiculously small and noisy. The window-sill was dusty. The whole place looked run-down. The only saving grace was the location. Way too expensive for what it is. 
29188 We stayed at the Casablanca for 4 nights in May. The customer service was truly wonderful, facilities were excellent, coupled with cheese and wine each evening. Its proximity to shopping and entertainment could not have been better. All round a wonderful experience, The O'Donovans, Cork, Ireland. 
29189 Prima hotel, uitgaansleven in de straat dus kan wat rumoerig zijn in weekend. Uitstekende service erg behulpzaam en goede lokatie. Wel wat kleine kamer voor gezin met 2 kleine kids, maar goed je bent er alleen om te slapen. 
29190 Super convenient location. I stayed here for work and the location was perfect. But if it weren't a work trip and location mattered less, I'd stay elsewhere. Rooms were nice but not fabulous. Wouldn't be my first choice for a NY hotel. 
29191 The rooms were very charming and extremely cosy, made me feel right at home! The staff were extremely friendly and helpful, will definitely be back! 
29192 It is very big but very quiet. The rooms are clean, comfortable, and nicely decorated. The lobby is massive and has some modern art on its walls. The breakfast is good too! It is in a convenient location close to a few good restaurants. Try the pizza place nearby. 
29193 Location, attention to detail, size of room, cleanliness, staff professionalism, Harry's Bar. Just excellent and will return. 
29194 After having sticker shock from the hotels in NY, I got a great deal on this hotel through Priceline. It was absolutely perfect - clean, good location, and nice staff. I would definitely stay here again. 
29195 Nothing is better than this hotel.I have been to most that's why its number one.fitness room great to stay in shape while working.Lo.cation makes it to want to impress pull up here.Worth every penny when the boss is paying to ha ha 
29196 I planned a Valentine's Day weekend for my fiance and booked the Junior Suite with whirlpool and it was fabulous! The room was clean and whirlpool (jacuzzi) was awesome. Everything we needed was right to at our fingertips. We will return! 
29197 Albergo modesto, ma in buona posizione centrale. Pulizia della camera e servizio accettabili, ma non eccellenti. Buon rapporto/qualita' prezzo. Raccomandabile se si cerca un albergo accettabile a prezzi ragionevoli a Midtown East. Times Square e Fifth Avenue raggiungibili a piedi. 
29198 It will be hard to sum up my visit to the W Hotel City Center in a few sentences. The ambiance, wait staff, service and overall hospitality reached new heights. The friendly staff, especially Omar Pereda made the stay both enjoyable and effortless. I cannot wait to return. 
29199 This hotel was good and clean. The breakfast was a decent one, not just doughnuts. The bathroom was nice and updated. The staff were friendly. We have stayed here twice. 
29200 estive com minha esposa em outubro de 2011. o hotel e bom!!! proximo de tudo e facil de achar. voltaria la com certeza...o cafe na rua atras e bom 
29201 Had another great stay at the GEM hotel in Chelsea. Well appointed and efficient clean room with a great bathroom! Staff was always friendly and assisted with everything. Thank you! 
29202 If you want to see NY, the Crowne Plaza is where you want to be...great location, spacious rooms, friendly staff, it's all here. 
29203 Despite being only a couple of blocks from Times Square, this attractively renovated 1930s erstwhile apartment building offers an oasis from the bustle plus warm, competent, knowledgeable service. A coffeemaker, microwave and bar-sized refrigerator (NOT mini bar!) made for added convenience. An excellent value, especially for Manhattan's Theater District. 
29204 Room 800 has the best view of the Buckingham Fountain and Lake Michigan, will go back until they wreck the building to put up a higher tax base structure. 
29205 We stayed here for 4 night in April 2006 as part of our holiday. Fantastic hotel. Staff very friendly. The rooms were spacious enough. The location is great also..... 
29206 I just want to say that the staff was very helpful in getting my family an early check-in for a local wedding. Kelly was particularly helpful and I want to thank her very much! 
29207 Hermoso hotel, ubicacion excelente a una cuadra de Times Square 
29208 Habitaciones muy lindas con una vista fantastica 
29209 Spacious room with all required facilities. Close to Grand Central Station, Subway, fifth avenue and all other parts of Manhattan. Will be a good option for family as well. Good breakfast. Friendly staff. 
29210 Superb service, exceptional hotel. Is now one of my favorite NY hotels. Location is great to stay out of the midtown rush and still easily accessible to public transportation to get around the city. Staff is excellent, rooms are good size and beds very comfortable. 
29211 We stayed 3 nights. Great location. Between Madison and 5 ave. They had great attention for our kids. Superb hotel, room...Superb everyting. That weekend, the First Lady Laura Bush was there and the Secret Services were everywere. We have not been disturbed by there presence. I highly recommend this hotel 
29212 A wonderfully situated hotel, very friendly staff, surprisingly large rooms which are tastefully decorated. Within a minute's walk of a subway station and very safe at night. 
29213 Very nice little hotel two blocks from Central Park; clean, cosy rooms, nice people, helpful stuff, b/b... If you are not a spoiled guest, the most important thing in NYC is where is your hotel settled. We spent wonderful 4 days there! 
29214 Ridiculous size room for 2 persons. Slept parallel to headboard. Couldn't pass each other in such an insane small area. Noisy neighbors, people going to bathroom and shower all night long. Too expensive for stay. Many other hotels less expensiver have larger rooms Poor location. 
29215 Good value, rooms are small and comfortable/functional. Not the most memorable neighborhood in New York, the commercial heart of mid-town, but hop on to the subway and find yourself anywhere in a flash. 
29216 I don't need to add more than my title! Have stayed there many times...and love the Family Suite!! That suite is two rooms, with one king and two double beds, and one bathroom. Clean, close to Herald Square, roomy, and well-appointed! 
29217 Great hotel. I had a wonderfully decorated room with 5 windows and a view of the skyline! Great location - directly across from Penn station so it was easy to transfer to the airport. Good lighting, which is important. Overall, I would recommend this as a good choice. 
29218 The hotel location is very accessible to Times Sq, Subway station, Broadway shows, and basically everything. The service was ok and the rooms aren't that bad. 
29219 Good little hotel literally 2 or 3 blocks from Times Square. Free breakfast is a bonus, parking discount helped. Room size is about what you'd expect in NYC, not too bad. Would definitely stay here again, mostly for the location. 
29220 Wow.....we had expected great views but when we got there they were fab! Staff were great, concierge very friendly and helpful. Gym could do with some updating especially the free weights, but again views were excellent. Breakfast food was great and of a good quality. 
29221 The Sorella is a nice, contemporary hotel. Quiet for hotel traveler. The area where it's located is developing nicely, walk to shops and restaurants, convenient for business traveler. 
29222 Jen Breen of Suite Home Chicago really lived up to her promise. She did a fantastic job for me by organising my stay at Grand Plaza Chicago. Everything was perfect just as she said and it made our stay a great family occasion Eddie Fogarty Dublin Ireland 
29223 great hotel with a great location ..... very close to madison square garden and we could definitely walk to time square ... 
29224 Incredibly noisey at all hours and their 'double rooms' only have three quarter beds in them. You can touch all 4 walls at once the rooms are so small. Staff were friendly enough though and it on a corner to a subway stop. 
29225 I've stayed at many, many hotels in NYC. Not only was this hotel super clean, the rooms were very spacious and comfortable. And despite the construction across the street, it was pretty quiet, as well. We were traveling with our baby and it was just perfect. 
29226 This is an excellent weekend escape, the hotel and rooms are very stylish and the ambiance is really fun! The location is great; close to museums, Reliant stadium, and about 10 min away from the Galleria area. 
29227 Nous etions 4 dans une tres grande chambre (suite). Propre, deco simple et bon service. Petit dej pas top. 
29228 This is a great value for money hotel in a good area with large rooms and excellent friendly and helpful staff. The extras are very welcome eg tea and coffee supplied free all day and the wine tasting sessions. 
29229 This was the single worst hotel experience we have ever had. It was a though the Hudson was doing us a favor by letting us stay there. This hotel is a serious rip-off. 
29230 I was sent to the Crowne Plaza Houston Downtown because the hotel I orginally had booked oversold. I came in very frustrated, but the staff was excellent. They really turned my trip around. The room was great: clean, quite, comfy beds. I will stay there from now on. 
29231 Ottimo albergo, forse uno dei migliori a NY. Posizione perfetta per lo shopping. Magnifia vista su Central Park 
29232 Landor Moore set us up with all the best resturants and places to go in Chi - town - he was amazing! 
29233 Very nice hotel and close to Times Square. Some walking distance to Penn Station though I would stay at this place again. 
29234 Great hotel at the prices. Near Central Park, good location for overall sight seeing. Older spacious building with a large bathroom. Not cramped at all for a family of 4 unlike other NY hotels. Clean. Breakfast served on terrace. Have recommended this place to other friends. 
29235 unfortunately we stayed one night only, but i was fantastic! the room was beautiful, with a small balcony! the service was amazing! the location is great also with lots of things around, the chelsea market that is a must! 
29236 I stayed in the palace with my 4 kids and my husband and my kids wanted to play on the computer but it wasn't working of course, just my luck. So I complaned and they got me a better room(a much better room. Infact the penthouse.) 
29237 We booked the Casablanca online from Australia based on its location and TripAdvisor reviews and stayed there for a week in September 2012. It was a perfect, faultless holiday. Superb location, friendly, helpful and professional staff, great ambience. Highly recommended. 
29238 Oct 4 2006 What a magnificant veiw of the lake. Security a added plus. Athletic Club was top of the line. Will definately stay again in the future. Already telling friends about you. Thanks alot! 
29239 We chose to stay here to view the 4th of July fireworks display. Many of the rooms have an unobstructed view of the fireworks. The rooms are nice, and the hotel is located in a hip neighborhood. The room service is also tasty. 
29240 The rooms were clean, not the most spacious. Adjusting the heat was a nightmare, the room was extremely hot!!!!! Good Breakfast nearby are not that easy to find. Over Priced!!! 
29241 Very good hotel. Near the Times Square and Empire State Building. Friendly staff and the breakfast was good too! 
29242 The hospitality shuttle service to the surrounding area is a wonderful amenity. It takes the worry out of getting to appointments at the medical center. The coffeeand computer stations in the lobby and the smiling staff made for a very pleasant experience in the lobby. 
29243 Phenomenal attention to details, good food and comfortable rooms. Service in Standard Grill downstairs was great, but I can't say the same for the reception guys. 
29244 Small, dirty rooms. Much to expensive! After a room change I'm sitting here right in front of the rattling ice machine and the smell of a fast food restaurant at the other side. It's better to stay at home! 
29245 My room 114 did not have a hair dryer. Unfortunately, there were no other rooms available. That was an inconvenience. Other than that, the stay was great. 
29246 O hotel e otimo mas falta ter internet free nos quartos pois acho que todo hotel desse nivel hoje fornece internet free aos hospedes,e falta uma escrivaninha para se trabalhar no quarto. No resto foi tudo bem. 
29247 We stayed here for one night and loved it. The location was perfect, the service was great, the breakfast was nice and the room was surprisingly quiet. We can't wait to go back. 
29248 We're a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 kids) and we stayed in New York Sofitel for 3 nights. This is a great hotel, very conveniently situated and we absolutely loved the beds - rooms were spacious and we also had breakfast which was divine!! 
29249 Worst Internet experience ever... Stayed here several weeks on different rooms each week and I have to say that it is impossible to work at this hotel, the Internet is just horrible! If you don't need Internet, then it is a good place to stay! 
29250 We stay here about twice a year while visiting family. You just cannot beat the welcome from the staff (particularly the assistant manager, who has been there for years). Convienient to everything. Clean. It has just gotten better and better over the years with the renovations. 
29251 It is located 1 minute away from Times Square. I had nice customer service. Comfy bed and bedding. Breakfast have good amount of choices. Small rooms but it is in NYC. I will definitely stay here in the future. 
29252 Great location for all major attractions in Midtown. A real classic. Staff were friendly and helpful; room cozy, tidy and clean; just an overall excellent experience! 
29253 I liked this hotel very much... Very clean, organized space, and private... 
29254 Excellent hotel and location. Very accomodating and friendly. Provide chaueffer/car service within a 3-5 mile radius. Room was very comfortable. 
29255 You couldn't find a better hotel, right in the middle of Time Square. Location was excellent as was the service. Room was great. 
29256 Comfortable and quiet. Nice personalized service. I needed a few things that arent usually given to customers and this hotel had no problem finding them for me. I didnt see them on the bill either. Classy. I will be back. 
29257 My daughter and her three friends saved and planned for two years for their graduation trip to NYC. They stayed at Eventi and were treated like royalty! The staff gave them terrific tips and recommendations. A memorable trip was made more so by Eventi! 
29258 Stayed last week at InterContinental Chicago and we had a wonderful time. Excellent location, so convenient to everything. The concierge, Robert Rames, was a great help in obtaining tickets to baseball game and with other attractions. Highly recommend this hotel it has some great history. 
29259 confortevole ed ottimamente posizionato a Manhattan; accogliente, con la non comune soluzione di suite con cucina. Personale professionale attento alle richieste del cliente ed apparentemente cordiale, (anche se solo per motivi professionali non per reale modo di essere),comunque sicuramente sollecito ed efficiente. 
29260 Clean and wonderfully located. It clearly hasn't been decorated in a few years but our room was certainly nowhere near as bad as indicated in other reviews. Would certainly go back, but if you're expecting 1000 sq ft rooms this isn't for you... 
29261 I stayed there for 6 days with my brother, and we definitely got, what we expected - great location, nice neighbourhood (local feeling), friendly staff and clean room! We would definitely go back! Great value for our money! 
29262 the hotel was lovely, our room was very satisfying from the beds untill the size. the services of the hotel stuff were good.Best of all was location near Times Square.To sum up i enjoyed my staying and hope to return in the future. 
29263 Treated my partner for a long weekend trip to New York. Stayed here at the Renaissance Times Square. One of the best Hotels I've stayed in. Couldn't fault it tbh. 
29264 Everyone at the Hotel were very helpful. They went out of their way to help my sister and I while we were there. 
29265 We stayed one week and everything went well from check in to check out. Rooms are tidy and clean. Service is great and friendly. It is very near to key locations ans subway 
29266 Nice hotel. We got a corner room, which was really huge. Staff was nice and facilities like free in room coffee maker / coffee made the stay very pleasant. Room/bathroom was neat and clean. Would stay there again. 
29267 Worst hotel in the world. Great location, but it is simply rubbish!! It is so old and run down. You really can't believe how bad this place is unless you experience it. 
29268 Just back from a 5 night stay at Doubletree Lex. Room was very clean, however the bed was pretty rubbish, as was the linen and pillows. On the plus side: bathroom ideal,large TV, fast Internet, quick lift, free to use office facilities, good situation, and reasonable value. 
29269 Not bad....you get what you pay for. After a long day of touring the El stop is a bit of a walk. Front desk staff were the worst I have encountered in a long time, however. Very 70's interiors. 
29270 The hotel was in a very good area close to alot of things... The room was really Victorian and nice kind of gloomy though.. The bathroom was small and shower confusing had three handles But would go again 
29271 Prima hotel, comfortabel en netjes. Dit hotel heeft geen eigen restaurant en geen zwembad, maar ligt in een buurt vol met restaurants. Metro is 2 blokken van het hotel (Broadway & 79th). WiFi beschikbaar voor $10/dag. 
29272 Exceeded my expectations. Felt very welcomed and service was great. Will definately stay again. 
29273 Really poor for this normally excellent chain of hotels. Rooms although big are uncomfortable and you can hear everything in the hallways. Rude reception staff, I was obviously not a big enough mover or shaker for them. I will not return far more better hotels to stay in. 
29274 Please do NOT stay at this hotel It should have been closed a long time ago. Apparently its owners do not care about preserving it. Rooms are filthy. Bathrooms as well. Staff is extremely rude. 
29275 A wonderful location and good-sized rooms made this hotel stay memorable. Make the best of the location by not driving - use the subway and the cross-town buses. Some good bars and restaurants in the vicinity, plus the magnificent market inside Grand Central Terminal. 
29276 Stayed four nights - Jan 2011- close to metro, dining, times square and walking distance to central park if u don't mind walking. 
29277 Very clean, very quiet hotel in Tribeca, very close to the Chambers street subway station. Breakfast was delicious. The staff was very friendly. We will definitely look to stay here again. 
29278 they treat you well here and it isnt really too far from a lot of attractions in NYC! REALLY CLOSE TO SHOPPING 
29279 The rooms were spaciouys and the service was acceptable. Step above the normal hotel/motel but the reward points a little different than other hotels. Great location here at the Galleria. Also great resteraunts in the area. Will stay here again. 
29280 Stayed here one night during a business trip. Needed to have a couple of meetings at the hotel, so the office arranged a one-bed suite, it was superb. Very spacious and comfortable, tasteful decor, all amenities, spotlessly clean. Highly recommended! 
29281 Went to NY for a special visit and got lucky with a reservation at the Hilton NY on The Avenue of the Americas. Great location in walking distance to lots of great attractions and lots of reasonably priced places to eat around the hotel. 
29282 to be treated as well as we were on our trip in July, 2012. This hotel has been renovated and is just delightful. You will not be disappointed if you decide to stay at the Iroquois. 
29283 I do enjoy this NY oasis. Great location within minutes walking to best places in Manhattan; very friendly staff; good place to rest after a busy day. Great herbal teas down in the lobby. P.S. Latoya at the reception is best. Igor 
29284 Spotless hotel with very friendly staff. A diner right next door and only two blocks from times square and subway. Very affordable and great location. 
29285 excellent location... big rooms nice staff... walk everywhere... we had a great time and the reservations desk was very helpful that's all i've got why do you want more. bar has the tvs and the games too 
29286 Very bad check in experience, broken lock on the door, no robes in the room. Under construction. But the most annoying thing was very unapologetic response from General Manager and staff. Very arrogant and made it seem like it was my fault. Definite down-turn in quality. 
29287 The hotel caters mostly to business travelers, but was perfect for our family with 3 small children. The rooms are spacious and clean and you simply cannot beat the price. Our boys enjoyed the breakfast buffet every morning and the service was impeccable. I highly recommend the hotel. 
29288 Impressingly clean rooms. Expensive(close to 400$ pr nigth), as everything i NYC. Tiny, tiny rooms, but clean. Friendly staff. Ok breakfast, but a very small, crowded breakfast area made it a bit chaotic. Ok location, would recommend to others. 
29289 Loved the hotel, very warm staff and great location. Has the buzz of NYC!! Special mention to BRION for being NYC's Friendliest Doorman! 
29290 As a family visiting from the UK we booked two rooms via Travelzoo on their amazing deal - $169 a room. Apart from having to use the service lift on the first night because of maintainance everything else was first class. Would highly recommend this hotel to everyone. 
29291 Nice clean hotel and the location is excellent! I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone! 
29292 We visited Chicago to see the Cubs play the Red Sox. The proximity to Wrigley was great. The hotel was clean and interesting architecturally. The staff was super. Small but very clean rooms. I would stay here again. 
29293 Room was spacious and very clean. Staff very friendly and helpful. Located in a great location. I will be staying there again. 
29294 Ink48 is a wonderfully appointed, yet comfortable place to stay in NY City. I've stayed at a number of Kimpton properties and this is one of the best! 
29295 Room was clean and comfortable. Staff is average at best and is not what you should expect in 5 stars hotel. My impression is that it was once a very good hotel which is not doing very well now. 
29296 On the positives, the hotel was good value for money, excellent location (right off of Times Square), very modern/cool looking design and very clean. The only negative was that the rooms are quite small. 
29297 Great hotel with a perfect downtown location. Great views of the 9/11 memorial site. There are lots of subway stops nearby. An easy walk to shopping on Broadway and site seeing on Wall St. 
29298 The Whitehall Hotel has excellent service. OUTSTANDING CONCIERGE. The physical facility shows a bit of wear, but overall, staying at the Whitehall was an excellent experience. 
29299 A reasonable hotel with good value for money and a great location. Friendly helpful staff. Sure you could get better but it would cost you more. A ten minute walk from Times Square and five minutes from Central Park. I would definitely stay there again. 
29300 Great location...right by Times Square and Bryant Park. Extremely friendly staff and service. Free internet in lobby was a plus. Nice little cafe in lobby, too. Only slight problem was the 3 elevators were somewhat slow. The room was small, but very nice and clean and modern. 
29301 Located right in the heart of everything. We could walk to theatre, shopping, Rockefeller Centre and the Port Authority bus terminal. Thank you for your email 3 days before we arrived to advise us of the best way to get to your hotel from the airport. Everything went so smooth. 
29302 we stayd in a quad room which was incredibly spacious. Nothing bad to say... 
29303 Had a great stay seemed like an oasis in the middle of busy LA 
29304 The bar and Culina restaurant are fabulous 
29305 I definitely suggest checking them out .The staff are always attentive and there for your needs. 
29306 Loved staying at the Hotel Edison. The location is truly right in the heart of the theatre district. Enjoyed the great breakfasts each morning. A great way to start the day without leaving the hotel. Each staff member was most helpful. Best value for your dollar. 
29307 Very high class hotel. Worth the money spent. Great location, right in the middle of Times Square. Alot of activites to do. 
29308 A great location! A very small hotel, with very small rooms, but you don't go to NYC to spend time in your room! 
29309 The staff was great, the rooms were spacious, beautifully decorated and the beds were amazingly comfortable. Best of all were the bathrooms. Spacious, newly renovated and great shower. We loved everything about this hotel and the location is just the best. 
29310 Stayed here at the end of March 2011 with my partner. I knew it was close to ground zero but wow! Our room overlooked the now building site. It felt very weird but it was an amazing view of NYC and the Hudson! Rooms immaculate, staff helpful. An unforgettable stay! 
29311 I spent three nights in New York last week at On The Ave. The room was clean, comfortable and well appointed. The staff especially Joana Ramona at the front desk was really friendly and very helpful. I ighly recommend the hotel. 
29312 This is a beautiful hotel which is located centrally at Times Square. Across from Carnegie Hall. Walking distance from times square. Excellent 
29313 We stayed at the Warwick hotel in the summer and boy was it fabulous. They upgraded us to a deluxe room even when we didn't ask and treated us like we were paying for deluxe suite service. Awesome time! 
29314 200 sat night in ny city very good rate. bed was comfy, bathroom was clean, air did not work well when we arrived notified desk on the way out when we returned hours later air was working great. great location room was big thats it. 
29315 Yet another wonderful hotel of Super 8 group. The service was wonderful and so were the rooms. I dint really get to sleep much and the bed was just a little bit lumpy but apart from from that, it was really worth the money. 
29316 Just stayed this hotel 30 May for 2 nights. Rooms are large, bar area very comfortable service excellent. Would recomend for leisure or business based on the location. Easy movement around galleria 
29317 1) Faster turn around time 2) good room service 3) hot and well maintained swimming pools 4) Excellent gyming facility 5) Situated in the heart of NY financial district 6) cheerful and courteous staff 
29318 handy for city centre and the tram system stops outside. parking was just next door 
29319 This is an older hotel but very clean. Everything worked just fine. We did not have any issues. Basic hotel met our needs just fine. Breakfast at the cafe next door was great. 
29320 Great hotel. I recommend it to EVERYONE. four blocks to Times Square. Washed the ball drop in T.S. 
29321 Great service, great location; sweet rooms. I can't ask for anything more (within reason, that is) :) 
29322 Stayed 4 nights for my 50th birthday. Great service. Very enjoyable. There was a cake waiting for us in our room when we arrived. We never allerted the hotel that it was a birthday celebration trip but the travel agen must have. 
29323 Staff are great very helpful Rooms clean and tidy Great location would stay at this hotel again 
29324 Great location to the medical center..The carpets need attention and our room was so small that you could hardly get around the bed..The bathroom could have been cleaned a little better! 
29325 Overlooking ground zero, extremely convenient transportation with subway and Path train within 1 block. Clean modern decor. Quite room in spite of nearby construction. View of Hudson River. Nice lobby bar. Helpful staff. Restaurant onsite. 
29326 The rooms are tight, good location on 50th, no breakfast buffet, free wi-fi (at least for me) and a crowded hotel.The staff could not handle that many people. Overall, an OK 4-star, nothing more than that. 
29327 We were happy with our stay. Staff was very friendly and help full. 
29328 This is a great hotel, great price but also the room was very clean and nice. Bed was very comfortable and staff was friendly. We will definitely stay here again. 
29329 This was a small, friendly hotel. The rooms were not too large. Our window looked out onto an alley, but it was clean and well equipped. The cleaning standards and general upkeep were extremely good. The location was ideal for access to Times Square. 
29330 Hotel ligt op een prima locatie dicht bij Times Square, metro en busstation. De bus rijdt rechtstreeks van Newark Airport naar dit station. Ontbijt is inbegrepen. Verder 3x per week gratis drankjes en hapjes. Keukentje in de kamer is ook handig. Heerlijke bedden. Echt een aanrader. 
29331 So glad we found this place, great location, friendly employees, breakfast is good but could use more seating, free internet and wireless in the lobby a plus. 
29332 excellent location..near theaters...great price...would go back in a heart beat! 
29333 Great hotel! We received outstanding service and the staff went above and beyond the call of duty. The room was very spacious and clean. The location is also perfect. We won't stay anywere else. 
29334 Just a great location, great Marriott. The hotel is in the middle of everything, a good value for the money. You can walk to all the shops on Michigan Ave. I really liked the Elite check in at the frpnt desk. 
29335 this is absolutely an overrated hotel :very noisy at night, tiny rooms , the bathroom was a joke 
29336 PLease avoid this hotel the only positive thing to mention is the breakfast which is ok 
29337 I stayed four nights here for business, the staff was outstanding, from the valet when I arrived to the room service staff. My only complaint would be not having free wi-fi. I would stay again and recommend it to anyone. 
29338 Located just West of 5th Ave on 32ed it is close to stores and 2 blocks from Penn Station. However, the rooms are SMALL and noise form 32ed St comes right through the windows - especially the Trash pick-up at 3:00am. NYC breakfast included with room was limited. 
29339 We stayed at this Staybridge Suites Galleria during a wedding. It's great for a short or long stay. Large comfy beds, sleep sofa, and kitchen. The free breakfast is great. I would stay at this hotel if in Houston and would highly recommend. 
29340 very good location fine rooms not free internet and some problems with the luggages 
29341 Excellent one-night stay at the Four Seasons and a special thanks to Olivia at the front desk for making sure our special occasion stay was perfect. Stayed in just a basic King room, but it was very spacious. The bathroom is beautiful and the shower is excellent. 
29342 There is nothing bad I can say about my stay at the Hilton Garden Inn! Perfect location, very clean rooms, efficient staff, decent sized rooms. I would definitely stay here again (and I am very picky about hotels!). 
29343 Excellent & extremely professional staff. Concierge got us last minute dinner reservations on a Friday night. Statue of Liberty Suite had a view that was beyond incredible. Only negative issue was not being able to check in until almost 6 p.m. because of late check outs. 
29344 It was fun, good food, clean room, good view of the city, and nice employies. 
29345 This is a nice hotel that's very reasonably prices. Rooms have recently been refurbished and the needs are so comfortable. Also, the staff was friendly and the location is great! 
29346 They are RAMPANT in NY hotels- and apparently this one is no exception! See Nov 2009 pix of "ticks" from another traveller 
29347 When looking for a place to stay for one night, had a hard time finding something reasonable. This hotel was great,the room was totally clean, the staff were helpful and friendly and the breakfast was very good. I would stay there anytime I come to New York. 
29348 I had a lucky escape as I did not stay in the hotel as I looked at the room and left. You wouldnt put a rat in it. it must GO against all health and safety legislations. DONT GO THERE. Our you will surely be scared for life. 
29349 The rooms were spacious, good location, flat screen TV. I even had a balcony. Very good internet connection speed, though they do charge for it ($15). No bar fridge, but they did have an ice machine on each floor and an ice bucket in the room 
29350 Clean. Nicely furnished. Foyer was smaller than expected based on pics on their website, nevertheless, stay was comfortable. Staff was supernice. Rick's cafe was fantastic. 
29351 Stayed there and had a fantastic experience. Attention to details and service displayed by the staff was great! 
29352 The hotel was beautiful and comforting and the rates were good. I was booked at the different hotel and switched after the first night because it was a nightmare. Spent two nights and the Wellington. The staff was courteous and willing to help. 
29353 Needed a room to crash for a few hours. Found this hotel on a great deal and went with low expectations. The hotel neither exceeded nor fell short of expectations. In short it is good for an overnight short trip. The front desk was helpful and customer service was good. 
29354 locatie van het hotel is goed. het ligt centraal en vele bezienswaardigheden zijn in de buurt. het is netjes en schoon en je wordt vriendelijk ontvangen. ontbijten kan om de hoek. wij hebben met zeer veel plezier hier overnacht. 
29355 This hotel was near everything we wanted to see, so we walked to most of the attractions. including Broadway plays,Central park and a good pizza place a block away.Clean and friendly would go back again for sure. 
29356 We like the two queen beds, coffee all the time, doorman to keep people away. Near theatres, shopping and the on- off bus 
29357 Newly renovated!! And nicely done. Very comfortable, clean and quiet. We will stay there again! 
29358 OTTIMO COME POSIZIONE CENTRALE, PERMETTE DI EFFETTUARE UN SOGGIORNO PIACEVOLE E SENZA PROBLEMI PER LA VICINANZA DI MEZZI DI TRASPORTO PERMETTENDO DI RAGGIUNGERE TUTTE LE METE, CLASSICHE E NON, DI NEW YORK E SE SI VUOLE ANCHE A PIEDI VISTA LA SUA POSIZIONE EQUIDISTANTE DALLE MGGIORI ATTRAZIONI DELLA CITTA'. 
29359 You pay a high price for its location. all other attributes are subpar for the price. dated infratsructure, small rooms and no extras. high price for a good sleep when having to spend the night at the airport. 
29360 Great hotel! Nice really clean, nice rooms with fridge and microwave, you can open the windows for fresh air and walk to everything! Right near tons of outdoor shopping and more! I'm staying here if I go back! 
29361 The salisbury is a lovely hotel, very clean, large rooms, and helpful staff. The only thing I would have against the hotel is that it could maybe do with a bit of an update, mainly in the halls and lobby, but I would stay here again in a heart beat. 
29362 Stayed here for two weeks in October 2009 for business. The hotel had everything you needed - reliable internet connection, gym, nice rooms and great location. 
29363 Great Hotel..stayed for conference. Comfy beds..awesome customer service. I forgot my toothbrush so they gave me one at the desk. Ate at the restaurant that is in the lobby Oseteria Via Stato, and it was really good italian food. Would stay again in a heartbeat. Location was central to everything. 
29364 Grate location in nyc you can get everywhere by foot very clean hotel got evrything u need and the Starbac cafe in the entery to the hotel 
29365 Hotel soddisfacente, bellissimo il bagno, con sauna e mosaico nero, tutti i giorni pulizia efficiente, ben arredato, personale cordiale, un po' lontano da midtown, ma vicino alla subway. Vista non molto bella, su strada trafficata di notte particolarmente. Tutto sommato voto 9. 
29366 Even though the hotel has may rooms, it is very organized. Rooms are always clean. Chech in and out is really fast. Rooms are confortable and well decorated, but a little small. 
29367 Convenient location, fairly big rooms (for NYC). Otherwise, nothing much to complain or praise about this place. 
29368 In a society of were not responsible, this hotel assumed responsibility. Our car had water damage from a leak in the ceiling, The hotel management addressed the situaion with compensation and a solution to the problem.Truely refreshing experience ,great location aswell. The real NY experience at a reasonable price. 
29369 The Blackstone is beautiful. The rooms are clean and well maintained. The staff is very friendly. I recommend it without hesitation. 
29370 Wonderful location, polite and helpful staff and nice rooms, although ask for an external room when booking to avoid views of air conditioning units and the noise that goes with these. 
29371 The advantages; 1 - Cheap. 2 - Safe. 3 - Clean. 4 - Central location. The disadvantages; 1 - Rooms and bathrooms have seen better days. The furniture is looking tired. 2 - Unfriendly staff. 
29372 Stayed in the huge Penn Hotel for 1 night. Good room, good bathroom too. Not too much noise from the street in room 507. For NY pretty clean as well. Just the curtains were very worn down, but we enjoyed our stay. 
29373 localizacion perfecta para un seguidor de la nba como yo increible delante del madison square garden a 3 min de times square. pero la habitacion era del talego. para personas con presupuestos limitados la verdad es ideal 
29374 Recently visited NYC for business. Booked at the Standard and extended trip entirely on my experience at hotel. Loved it and location. Best staff at a hotel I've ever had the pleasure of encountering.Highly recommend. 
29375 Great location.....Rooms have an amazing view of the 9/11 Memorial. Not crowded like Time Square. The Staff was very helpful. Noise levels were OK except on Friday morning from 5 to 6am. The garage trucks were really loud. The management has white out noise machines. IF you are sensitive....get one! 
29376 What a lovely stay we had, for our wedding anniversary. Staff looked after us beautifully. And the location is awesome - this part of town is great to explore. Highest marks! 
29377 The hotel is basic but clean and the beds were very comfortable. It is easy to walk to Times Sq and lots of places to eat within 5 mins walk. There are no tea or coffee making facilities and the plumbing is very noisy especially at night. 
29378 The Carlton is amazing -- beautiful, immaculate, comfortable, convenient...couldn't ask for anything more. The staff is cordial and helpful. The beds are ridiculously comfortable -- highly recommend staying there! 
29379 Very comfortable beds and pillows. Something sticky on the carpeting. Hotel appeared dirty. Front desk had to go upstairs to check on the room before it could be rented. Very disorganized front desk. 
29380 1a Verkehrsanbindung, netter Neighbourhood. Sehr sauberes, aber auch sehr kleines Zimmer, gutes Badezimmer. Klimaanlage ziemlich warm eingestellt und leider nachts relativ laut am Brummen. Service wiederum war super. 
29381 The Marquis is a great large hotel. Our room was superb. Newly renovated and very comfortable. We had a room on the 40th floor with superb views of Times Square. Only drawback -- long elevator waits! 
29382 We love staying here. This was our forth visit. The location is great near shopping and restaurants and we always get good service. We like the modern decor. 
29383 Spent the Thanksgiving weekend w/my wife and was very impressed by the great customer service, cozy but contemporary room, and super comfy bed! We slept like angels! We had dinner at their restaurant located in the 1st flood (behind the lobby) and the food was delicious! 
29384 My sister and i shared a delightful night at the Royalton recently. What a great place to stay and feel cozy. Beautiful big room, fantastic soft bed, every amenity you could require and one of the friendliest hotel staffs I have EVER encountered in NYC. You MUST stay here! 
29385 The Eventi was one of the nicest hotels I've ever stayed at. Our bed was super comfortable, the room was always clean, and the staff was amazing to deal with. Great value, excellent location, best part of our vacation! 
29386 What a find! Good price, friendly staff, clean and nicely decorated room, located two blocks from the subway, and close to lots of reasonably priced restaurants. We parked safely on the street. First floor is under renovations: lobby, new eating area... It will be nice. We'll stay there again! 
29387 We stayed in this nice little hotel when it first opened and it was very nice. Being close to theatre, art museums, and even finding an excellent Italian restaurant next door was a bonus. We would go back. We were within walking distance of my friend's art studio, also. 
29388 I loved this hotel. It was perfect - not impersonal in any way. As a lone traveller, it was an oasis in the large city. Sit down and visit with Bernie, he is a gem. 
29389 Brilliant hotel, very clean ,very central ,not noisy ,felt very safe as it was on a busy street at 42nd street.,staff very helpful ..would stay there again ...Irish holdimaker 
29390 Everything expected from a top hotel. Beautifully decorated for the holidays, close to all the great shopping. Extensive gourmet room service menu and Norma's is an experience in itself. Upgrade to a Tower room for a spectacular view. Already planning our next stay... 
29391 Stayed at The Setai for a special company program. The hotel is beautiful, modern, clean. The rooms are very large for a Manhattan standard, the bathroom is simply astonish. The hotel is on Fifth Avenue, one block from the Empire State Building. 
29392 We stayed in New York Palace for 3 nights, with 2 kids and 2 grandparents -with adjoining rooms it was perfect. The courtyard is a beautiful place for drinks and dinner. It is definitely not cheap but hey, it's NY! 
29393 We really liked the hotel, modern, clean lines, good room seize, nice furnishing and nice, good lightning in the bathroom. Wonderful breakfast opportunity. Great area with very good selection of restaurant, good for happy hour and great nightlife. 
29394 but not enough staff on during the day for the star rating, but looks great. the roof bar is good, but a bit of a pick up joint after work. pool closed when I went, but had not said so on the website even on the days I was there 
29395 Good value for money. The hotel itself is basic, but clean and tidy. Hotel staff were helpful. It is close to subways, we used line 6 from Spring street a lot, 4min. walk. Pleasent, chinese neighbourhood, not too noisy. 
29396 The rooms were a little small. The service was excellent, the staff made us feel welcome Loved the location with easy access to the subway, museums, times square. We stayed for four nights and the breakfast was different not the same. 
29397 Legendary NYC old style...home of Randolph Hearst. Staff there for decades. Recently updated. Great location 2 doors from MOMA 
29398 Amazing downtown to location. Within walking distance of everything. Room, and service were great also. 
29399 I travel to NYC usually once a year for work and my family accompanies me. This is close enough for my business on 6th but close enough to everything else to keep my family entertained. We love all of the restaurants on 9th just behind the hotel. 
29400 We just spent an amazing 3 nights at Trump. It was the highlight of our trip, especially for our 16 yr old son. We had a one bedroom suite. 
29401 The location could not be better. is near of the best in NY and accessible transport. In the heart of the city and times square. 
29402 This is a great small hotel in midtown. The staff was great, room was very clean, and it was quiet, which is not always the case in midtown. 
29403 We just stayed 3 nights to see some shows and this location is great.The hotel is a wonderful place. It has perks most NY hotels don't. Free wireless internet. Free phone calls-local AND long distance(US only). Good continental breakfast. Meticulously clean room. No problems. Only wish they had a min-fridge. 
29404 looks old and does not feel clean. rooms can be incredibly noisy. AC did not work properly. would not stay again 
29405 Got a fantastic deal for a 5 night stay at the W Downtown this October. The hotel is very modern, the bar wasn't our cup of tea, but the rooms and service were all brilliant throughout our stay and we don't have a bad word to say about the place. 
29406 From the time we walked in at 6am (red eye), we were treated royally. Our room was not ready but they gave us great suggestions for breakfast! There's a great bar on sight. My only objection was that they charge for internet access. Really not necessary! 
29407 We stay here every year during the Westminster Dog Show. This is a very comfortable and accomodating Hotel! The Staff are very friendly and helpful! The new room renovations are wonderful! 
29408 Stayed there one night (we had booked for two). The small room wasn't an issue....the condom wrapper on the floor, stained sheets, and a toilet that didn't flush was....... 
29409 We stayed in a room with two bunkbeds and were very happy with the room, location and service we received from the staff! Would recommend the pod39. The beds were very comfortable and the hotel was peaceful. 
29410 This Doubletree was terrific. The room was very spacious. We unexpectedly had another guest stay in our room so we had to put a rollaway in and it still seemed spacious. Everything very, very clean. Loved the complimentary transportation. The breakfast menu was a very good deal. 
29411 Our only complaint was no coffee maker, even though we had a fairly well-stocked kitchenette. Thank goodness for the little deli-grocery next door. 
29412 I have always wanted to stay at this famous hotel, and am extremely glad that I did. The ambiance is incredible, and the service is certainly 5 star. If you are looking for a classic New York experience, the Waldorf is the place to stay. 
29413 A very nice, big, clean room, just steps away from O'Hare. It makes traveling all the more convenient and eliminates concerns about traffic delays preventing you from getting to the airport on time. 
29414 Nice Location, some staff with great attitude, but need a complete overhaul in rooms and facilities. Luis Rosales the best at this Hotel!...Great Executive! 
29415 I am a business traveler who stays all over NYC. This is the best hotel in the city. Marvelous room, especially the bed. But the best was the customer service. Great value for a 4 star. 
29416 Maze is great, and the rooms are among the largest in the city. Great location and service. 
29417 Lo Maximo. Concepto novedoso y moderno. Ambiente ameno , cordial , descomplicado, una propuesta exitosa 
29418 It was clean, new and really cool! The location was perfect and I loved the bathroom in the room. Especially the shower and the free products. I also was very happy to get a free breakfast just for signing up to be a Starwood rewards customer! 
29419 Great hotel overall. Great location and service. The Porsche is a nice touch. Michael in the concierge was fantastic. Looking forward to staying there again. Daniels restaurant also recommended. 
29420 Our first room was a real disappointment. We were given a second room on day 2 and it was better but not as nice as what we expected from the photos online. The staff was great and overall our stay was pleasant. 
29421 I had a room on 47th floor overlooking Time Square, couldnt fault it, was a large room, breakfast was perfect and a great selection, right beside many theatres, perfect location, will definitely stay there again. 
29422 the hotel was just across the road from grant park,very handy for the festival,and a very short walk to buddy guys legends club just round the corner on wabash street,chicago city centre i found easy to walk about. 
29423 Nice Marriott. Very helpful staff and quiet rooms. While not huge, they are comfortable. Subway three blocks away. Easy walk to Times Square. Concierge is extremely helpful and knowledgable on what and where to go. Had a super weekend. 
29424 Just stayed here last night and rooms are newly renovated and was very clean...we walked everywhere from here! Great price for being in the heart of downtown! & free parking! I would definitely stay here again! 
29425 Great B&B. Cozy warm fireplace. Great Coffee and muffins. Great shampoo & conditioner. I forgot my toothbrush and the staff provided me a new one in a matching box that the shampoo was in. The hotel staff was so helpful and friendly. I will defiantly stay here again 
29426 My other usual hotels were booked & I stopped in to see if they had a vacancy -- they did and I was pleasantly surprised. The room was very comfortable and nice for a great price. I would definitely stay there again for both business & personal travel. 
29427 I got a good deal and that's why I rated it high on Value. As any other hotel in NY it's all about the dates. Very nice rooms, amazing beds and the service is good. You walk 4 min to subway. 
29428 We just stayed at the Doubletree this weekend. I thought the hotel was fine. The location is very central, convenient to the subway, 5th Ave, Central Park and of course Times Sq. Work out facilities were average. Given it's a suite, the rooms are huge by Manhattan standards. 
29429 This is just off 5th ave, in the heart of the city. The staff is courteous and helpful. The hotel is comfortable. It's pricy. Forthe price,theroo could be better. A coffee machine in the room would compete it. 
29430 Stayed here from nov 20th-24th,decor and rooms a little dated but we found everything clean,check in was quick and found the front desk staff friendly at all times, Enjoyed the rum lounge pub and the cafe edison,we woild have no problems staying here again!! 
29431 With the subway system out the front door this is a great hotel and a must stay. Embrace the subway you will love new York! Beds are perfect, windows from top to bottom and full wall looking out on the world trade center it's amazing and a must see! 
29432 The staff was courteous,professional and always friendly to speak with. The rooms were the quietest I have ever stayed in,you could not hear a thing from the other rooms or even the hallway. Will be back for sure! 
29433 Booked on a Expedia - very cheaply. They let me check in at noon, not 3 pm. Enormous room! Very quiet, clean. Old fashioned doors and walls but so what? I like that. Wonderful location. A real bargain. Was there by myself. I felt safe. 
29434 Rooms are tiny, but location is fantastic. A couple of minutes walk to Time Warner Centre & Central Park. Skip dinner at the hotel and try the great Sushi a couple of doors down from hotel. 
29435 This hotel is one of the best I have stay in. The hotel has all the facilities when travelling on business. Stay 13 nights thanks guys. 
29436 Nice hotel,busy area better to walk than to drive. Rooms were nice bathroom old fashion. Lots of renovation around hotel is was a pain to find valet parking that by the way is fifty dollars a day.For the price in the middle of NYC is not bad 
29437 Realmente estaba un poco asustada de alojarme aqui por todo lo que habia leido, pero adore! ubicacion privilegiada, excelente precio (tratandose de New York especificamente), atendimiento cordial. Les recomiendo la habitacion 11. Se habla frances tambien. 
29438 good location across from penn station but that is the only positive about this hotel. rude staff, small outdated and dirty rooms, public spaces worn, smell of food prep seems rampant. never again!! 
29439 Poor customer service-only excuses. No amenities. Rooms are tired and worn out. Changed rooms due to cleanliness. Much better value for your money elsewhere. Never again. 
29440 I stayed here in October. Nice and clean hotel. Everything within walking distance. Good place to stay. 
29441 Excellent location and comfortable hotel 
29442 good-looking bar and lounge 
29443 excellent reception staff and valet service 
29444 very nice Marriott Club on 26th floor with great breakfasts 
29445 concierge / navigator service was friendly but could use a boost. 
29446 Good stay except for the fact that I had a handi-cap room (I don't think I look handicap). Small, but clean and staff is good. 
29447 We had such a nice time. I chose this hotel because of the location and it surprised me indeed. The staff were very polite and helpfull. Thank you all. 
29448 Comfortable and clean hotel in the hart of Manhattan. Its roof terrace gives you an amazing view on ground zero and Liberty Tower. Too bad the restaurant only offers a limited menu, otherwise it would be an absolute top dining experience. 
29449 A very friendly hotel clean comfy would stay again convenient to 5th ave and shopping the only thing I would have liked was to have tea and coffee making facilities in the room but when I go again would take my travel kettle 
29450 Stayed at the Wellington for 2 nights, and the location is GREAT! The rooms are small, but I viewed it as a place to sleep. I would stay there again... 
29451 We had a great time in this centrally located hotel, just off China town but near enough to all the best things in New York. We stayed for two weeks and had a great time. Staff were friendly, helpful...I'd go back again! 
29452 The Hotel Grace is an oasis in the middle of Times Square. Front desk staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms are attractive, comfortable, clean, and quiet. Plus, on a hot day, what can beat a refreshing dip in the pool? 
29453 I have just checked in and will be here for 4 nights....great location but rooms look totally different that what is represented on their website!!! 
29454 The stay was wonderful from the great smelling lobby, to the friendly, helpful staff. Everyone we encountered from the front desk to the maid was very friendly and helpful. 
29455 Pourquoi autant de difference entre les differents Sofitel Celu de NY ne presente aucun interet, decoration "old fashionned" mauvais rapport qualite prix A ne conseiller qu a vos amis ou parents ( plutot ages ) qui ne parleraient pas anglais ... 
29456 Wonderful experience. The staff was exceptional and the hotel was beautiful! It was also very affordable and located practically "in" times square! I will stay here every time I return to New York! 
29457 This hotel has it all. Location: close to theaters, restaurants, subway, businesses, and more. The staff is friendly and eager to serve. The rooms are clean and nicely appointed. Hilton Honors members are treated very well. 
29458 Great rooms with apartment size kitchens fully furnished as well as roomy desk & tv areas & great staff not to mention the cable tv & high speed internet. Also, the cleanest hotel I have EVER stayed in. 
29459 just off times square, good room, clean, people friendly, resaurant i would skip though. 
29460 Currently staying on the 24th floor and there is a roof top club/ bar playing loud music with a ton of bass across from our room. Even with the ac on there is so much noise. After traveling all day would love some rest. 
29461 Clean, very friendly, nice-sized rooms (considering it's NYC), lovely big bed, cosmopolitan look and feel to the place. Great value for the money! I wish we'd had time to try the bottom floor restaurant and bar, it looked very inviting when we poked our heads in. 
29462 Great value for money. When we come back to NYC we will definitely come back here. The staff were friendly and the location was amazing. 
29463 Very nice stay.The front door staff the best.Clean rooms and great service what more can you look for. 
29464 The hotel was wonderful,excellent location(1/2 block from times square), staff friendly, room not very up to date and definately will not fit 5 people like some sites say. Would stay there again! 
29465 For the money this hotel is worth it. The hotel is right near the entrance to the airport and the shuttle runs frequently. Kudos to housekeeping. 
29466 Ideal location for 4 of us for girlie weekend. (Shopping, Sightseeing and entertainment). From the moment we arrived we knew we made right decision, the Concierges, Doormen and entire staff were great and ever so facilitating. Everything was practically on our doorstep or easily accessible to. Will be back!!! 
29467 The burger bar was fabulous if a little expensive. The room was a standard 4* with ample space and storage. 
29468 Nice hotel convenient to Houston Galleria. Easy check in and garage parking. Rooms were spacious and very comfortable. Booked through Hotwire for $80 or so. Great deal. Will definitely return. 
29469 We booked a stay at the Sofitel for our 25th anniversary and my sister's 15th, after reading the reviews on TripAdvisor. What can I say? All the plaudits are well-deserved. Really nice ambience, friendly staff, complimentary champagne for our anniversaries - superb! Will definitely stay there again. 
29470 positive points : good location with acceptable price for downtown Manhattan but important negative points : it's a very noisy hotel ( roads, air co ), old fashion bedrooms, old bathrooms not adapted for business trip ! 
29471 The best part of the hotel is the Tempurpedic beds on the upper level floors. The fitness center is pretty pathetic and needs updating. The hotel is not in a great location. All in all not bed but there are better options nearby like the Magnolia hotel and Hilton. 
29472 This is a typical Hilton hotel, good for a business trip because you know what to expect. The room and bed were very comfortable, great air conditioning, very clean and the staff were pleasant. Nothing extraordinary, but no surprises. 
29473 The Lexington was great to stay in, the location was within walking distance of the subway, Rockafella Center and theatre district. staff very helpful, no delay in checking out or in, room very clean, 
29474 Second time to stay here, hotel has been updated since our last visit. Rooms were spacious, LOVE the family room with 2 bedrooms when traveling with family, bathroom with large shower was a nice surprise! Love the location & free breakfast, hate the slow, crowded elevators! 
29475 Rooms are fine. Service tries hard but does not always succeed. Great place if you are going to the Beacon Theater next door for a concert. 
29476 We attended a conference at this facility and it was fabulous! This place is definitely set up for conferences and knows how to do them right (at least from a participant standpoint). The room was clean and bright and the staff was very helpful. Would stay here again. 
29477 This is a great hotel in a relatively quiet district of Manhattan in a walking distance from the main midtown attractions. The service was great. On the block around there is a Rossini restraunt which offers and old-fashioned dinner in Al Capone style. 
29478 This hotel was in the heart of Times Square. Perfect for dining and Broadway shows. It was a reasonable walk to Central Park and other surrounding attractions. We would definitely stay here again. 
29479 The hotel is beautiful and in a great location!! I would have given it a 4 out 5, however the staff is what makes it magnificent!!! From check in to check out they take the extra steps to make sure your stay is as good as it could be. 
29480 Fantastic rooms, friendly staff and reasonably priced. I love the LES !! 
29481 comfortabel en zeer schoon hotel waar je echt voor je gemak logeert. centraal gelegen aan het drukke times square maar van de hectiek merkte je binnen niets. rust heerste op de zeer ruime kamer die van alle gemakken was voorzien. 
29482 This hotel is absolutely exceptional!! The service is outstanding from cleanliness of rooms to hotel management. The location is key. There are a lot excellent eateries and shops. I will definitely be back and will recommend to my family and friends!!!! 
29483 Just had seven nights here. Room was tidy and clean however a little dated. Asked for a room in the newly renovated west wing but "none were available" Views were great though! Used the pool and the tennis court which was fun during the US Open 
29484 Beautiful hotel and located perfectly near everything 
29485 I would love to stay again in this hotel ! What can I say more ? Room is being cleaned twice a day and have not seen any dust or something in the room 
29486 I was treated very well by staff at this hotel. My room was clean and comfortable. The bathroom was a little tired and in need of a refurbishing, but clean. Location is superb. Concierge service was topnotch. I will return. 
29487 Stayed here as the hotel I was supposed to stay in overbooked and put me up in here. It is in the perfect location for doing all the tourist stuff etc - i would definetly stay here again 
29488 This place is great. I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel. The room was clean, the staff are friendly and the location is great. The roof top bar is amazing with brilliant views. I would defo stay here again. No Complaints! 
29489 Ask for rooms without connecting doors - they were so thin I heard the entirety of "Marley & Me" from the next room at 1am Rooms are large and very 1980s. 
29490 The rooms are a little old and they have no free WIFI. The price to get WIFI was very expensive and you could only connect one computer. The front desk was helpful and nice. The location is excellent and the kitchen clean, complete and useful. 
29491 Big rooms, flat screens, clean, black marble bathrooms. A little dated but you are basically a 30 second walk to time square. Request a corner room with views of time square. The higher you go, the less view you have. Good noise block out. 
29492 This is a very nice and reasonably priced hotel. The rooms are pretty quiet, very clean and, for New York, my room was very spacious. The only thing it is missing is a gym. Overall it was a great stay. 
29493 The hotel rooms carry all luxury details in a compact way. Nice bathroom and comfy bed. The location is excellent, to drop off bags during the day or for a short rest, close to everywhere and inspite of its central locations the rooms are very quiet. Recommend it 
29494 This Hotel was fabulous! Great Location, friendly staff, close to EVERYTHING! The rooms were a nice surprise, great beds, linens and towels. We will be back and will definetely stay in this Hotel again!!! 
29495 this hotel was clean, had great service and was conveniently located. the breakfast buffet was good and plentiful. the beds were very comfortable. my only complaint was there was not enough counter space in the bathroom - but that was not a real problem. 
29496 Excelente hotel, muy bien ubicado, en una zona tranquila y todo lo que necesites a la mano: tiendas, restaurantes, estaciones del metro, etc. El servicio del hotel muy bueno, las habitaciones amplias y comodas. Super recomendado!! 
29497 Best place in midtown. Service was awesome. Beds were the most comfortable I have slept in in a NYC hotel. Also we were on 19th floor and it was very quiet. We did not eat at the hotel but did enjoy drinks in the lounge. Will come back again. 
29498 Fantastic service, suites, location, decor, etc! Excellent hotel, I will definitely be returning. 
29499 The room was very good and the hotel location, good not be better. Would stay here again 
29500 Fuimos mi pareja y yo... excelente el personal, la ubicacion, el desayuno... muy recomendable y completo... PARA RECOMENDAR calidad -precio 
29501 Good, cheap hotel near wrigley. Plenty of places around within walking distance to eat. Less than a mile from the el for easy access to the loop 
29502 The bedroom is small but very comfortable and clean, the private bathroom is relatively large and well equipped. The location is great: very closed to Times Square. No noise during the night. Breakfast is included. What could you wish more? 
29503 When we arrived 45th street was closed due to a street market ! We were a little upset but the Concerge, Eric, made us feel comfortable and cared for as we checked in...also Eric gave us great tour, theatre and restaurant suggestions!! Thanks to all....Rowen, Kevin and housekeeping, great job! 
29504 I stayed here for just one night and would stay here again for sure. The hotel was pack with a lot of groups but my room was quiet. Just what you would expect from a Hilton...nothing outstanding...just a clean, safe, very functional hotel. And the location is a plus! 
29505 Run down since opening ..had to move rooms even though i booked superior level, room was tiny and worn. moved to larger room which was not much better 
29506 YA know it was great! What do people (Tourist want for the price!) It was all good. I would stay here again anytine. If you want a bed to sleep on...Well 100%...If you want bells and and whistles then don't stay....Save the room for me! 
29507 The hotel was modern, with a good bar and friendly staff. I stayed here because of a conference at McCormick Place next door, but unfortunately, it's a cab ride or a walk and train ride to the Inner Loop and downtown Chicago's attractions. My room was clean. 
29508 Best location, huge bed, Nice bathroom, very nice staff ! From here new York can be visites very easily. I would go there definitely again. 
29509 This was my fourth stay at The Belvedere, and I can't wait to return. The staff was considerate and ready to help with any request. The room was clean, spacious and comfortable. Justin, the front desk manager, went above and beyond to make sure our stay was pleasant. 
29510 We wanted a photo in front of the hotel with our 6 month old son "Benjamin", the doorman Mohammad was extremely helpful and fun and ensured we had the perfect photo of our trip! Thank you Mohammad for your help. 
29511 Very adequate business motel. Limited-service (when staying less than a week) extended-stay suites. Clean, sterile. Breakfast okay, nothing more, perhaps will be better when they finish the breakfast area remodel. Very attentive staff and management. No Comedy Central on the TV ... What gives? 
29512 Terrible. No service. Furniture was in very poor condition. Noisy location. Door lock was very loose. Would never stay there again 
29513 westin always been known for their best bed. compare to hilton westin bed is always the best. location cleanliness etc etc is always perfect 
29514 Great location, no personal service though. Hotel was going through change at the time so I can forgive that. Rooms very comfortable 
29515 Will stay here from now on! Much better atmosphere and price compared to the Inn at the Ballpark and Magnolia. 
29516 I no longer fear hell. We spent 4 nights at the hotel Penn. The rudest place on earth. Don't dare pay cash for anything without a reciept or just kiss it goodby. The valet parking crashed our car and refuse to take any responsibility. 
29517 The hotel is in a great location. Walking is easy to shows and restaurants. Concierge was very helpful in locating things to do. But if u r a gold SPG member, you will b denied access to the club lounge. 
29518 We spent a couple of days in this hotel. Service was great, average but clean rooms. Good breakfast and great location. Walking distance from the Galleria mall and many other restaurants are available from a walking distance. Kids loved the breakfast and the pool. Great value for less than $100/night 
29519 Great location, walkable to Penn station. Not high end but nice and clean. 
29520 I realized that I had a reservation issues, however, hotel manager Mr. Tellez had my concerns resolved before my arrival. Stellar service, and exceptionally friendly staff. I could not have asked for a better expereince. 
29521 Great location but if you are looking for that nice comfy, warm, inviting hotel, this is NOT it. The lobby is like Grand Central Station and is busy all the time. The rooms are fine but no coffee maker.....can you believe a Hilton does not have a coffee maker!! 
29522 Stayed on the recommendation of a friend. Great little hotel - felt comfortable from the start. Staff very helpful and welcoming. Free breakfast plentiful, bed was even more comfortable than mine at home! Free internet and computer room a definite plus. Plan to make this my home in NYC. 
29523 We attended a wedding here. It was very well done and the food and sevice were excellent. The rooms are very small but the great location makes up for it. 
29524 A stylish hotel, with ample sized double double rooms at a reasonable cost. Staff were extremely friendly. Never disappointed with the Kimpton chain. 
29525 We were delighted to stay at the Doubletree Guest Suites and it far exceeded our expectations. Spacious, quiet suites with comfortable appointments...What a deal! 
29526 We booked a King Suite. There was just a king size bed with nothing suite about it. All they had was a smoking room and it did smell of smoke :-(. Breakfast was a B- - but there was a Starbucks next door which made up for it. 
29527 I really liked this hotel. The hotel staff was very friendly. I will definitely come back. 
29528 Arrived late. Staff was very friendly. Comfortable room. Breakfast service was so so. Not in a tourist area. On the northwest side of town off the I-610. 
29529 Friendly Staff,Clean room and Quality Breakfast Foods and Beverages. Had a great experience throughout the stay 
29530 Very friendly people. Beds are very comfy :) Room was clean and smelled nice :) Taking the shuttle is total blessing! With everything else to think about not having to worry about getting to and from M.D.Anderson is a great relief :) Plus the drivers are very friendly,kind,and considerate. 
29531 WOW what can i say out of all the places i have stayed this is one of the top hotels it had so many friendly people wanting to help you at all times! Room was decent and view of Sears/ Willis tower from pool is breath taking 
29532 We were able to check in early with out a hitch. Front desk folks are very friendly and helpful (special thanks to Marshal). Nice room with frig, micro and plenty of space This was not our fist time staying here and hopefully not the last.. 
29533 Small hotel with service that would rival any larger hotel. Rooms were typical Manhatten size but clean and quite suitable. 
29534 I left my laptop at the cab, when I arrived. The staff at the front desk was very supportive and finally found the taxi driver! What the TLC was not able to do, they did it. 
29535 This hotel is more like an old student dormitory with shared restroom/bathroom. The hotel condition is bad. The location is the only good thing. The staff was very rude when we asked if there is hot water available. 
29536 The hotel is well located right by Grand Central Station. Although comfortable, the rooms are small and the bathrooms are really small. The bed is very comfortable. Water pressure can be an issue if you attempt to shower during peak periods. The only reason to stay here is the location. 
29537 Een oud groot hotel. Ligging goed. Naast Penn treinstation en midden in Midtown. Prima vertrek om downtown of uptown de stad te verkennen. Prijs kwaliteit komt overeen. Kleine mankementen, fohn stuk en internet kabel stuk. Beddegoed schoon, douche prima. Beethe smoezelige indruk 
29538 Nothing special. I was here mainly for business during the NYC Marathon, which makes things a little bit crazy. Staff wasnt too friendly, big room (you dont get a small room for being America) small bathroom though. it' s okay I guess, it is clean and well located but overrated. 
29539 Rooms are great, service and location is second to none, close to the real NYC but a good starting point for overseas nervous Bristish visitors. Really good. Close to Times Sq, twin towers, water front and the coolest of local bars and street scene. 
29540 Besides the location, nothing much more positive. Very overpriced, rooms are average, everything costs extra, bathrooms need an imploding. Invite me back when the hotel has had a major refurbishing. 
29541 On a recent visit to Houston, me and my wife stayed at this Hampton Inn. It's a nice hotel close to the interstate, lots of restaurants and shopping close by. The beds are comfy and the breakfast is good, no complaints from me, will stay again when in Houston. 
29542 Chicago is always exciting and the Club Quarters hotel made our trip so very comfortable. Thank you for the incredible service and over the top amenities. 
29543 Beautiful, friendly, comfortable and in a historic building. What more could you ask for? 
29544 Relatively inexpensive for a good location. Room was small and basic, but that's life in midtown Manhattan. 
29545 One of life's struggles is to find a lower cost hotel in NYC where the rooms are comfortable. Park South totally met our needs. Yes, the room is small but this is NYC and it isn't about the room. The hotel is centrally located. 
29546 The Hotel Mela is nicely decorated and conveniently located. The rooms are small. The elevators are very small. I had one suitcase which barely fit inside the elevator. It was a nice, clean place to sleep in the heart of the city. 
29547 I just loved it. Comfortable, perfectly located, the nicest, sweetest, softest sheets I have ever slept in ! The staff was too good for words !!! don't let them leave you under any circumstances !!! I'll be back in September !!!! 
29548 We stayed here for the location and convenience of being right in the city. It was great for that reason but also for the comfort. We'll come back here for sure. Very nice. 
29549 Hi - Its a new hotel in Soho ,AAA location, just off Broadway ,The rooms are good size for NYC (book the king size room) , great and helpful reception team ,nice & small GYM ,Hip bar .reasonable rates for Soho. 
29550 This hotel have a very good location, in Time Square, because is really close to the many theaters of Broadway and all the stores. The rooms are good, with space. The only bad thing is that they don't serve breakfast, as many hotels in New York. 
29551 Comfortable, contemporary decor, extremely clean. Friendly staff, shopping, restaurants in walking distance. Overall great Chicago location. 
29552 No hot water for showers on Nov 20 with no notification, reason or alternatives. Prevented from bringing all guests to rooftop to take in spectacular views as advertised. Extremely disapointing experience. 
29553 Nice hotel, clean rooms. Rooms are not very spacious, but if you are exploring NYC, it is a perfect place to return to after a busy day. Free WIFI. 
29554 het hotel ligt op times square. Hotelingang naast metro. Comfortablele twee kamer suites bleken zeer geschikt voor 5 personen. Kleine probleempjes (te weinig handdoeken, koelkast die niet werkte) werden zonder omhaal en onmidddelijk opgelost,. 
29555 Rooms were neat and very quiet. I really liked the room the onl,y complaint is that the lavatory was too high because I am short. Everything else was very clean and nice. 
29556 Excellent hotel. Very clean rooms. The staff was amazing. Not too far from the galleria mall. 
29557 Great location (safe), great breakfast, great customer service at the front desk. The rooms are large and clean. We will be back!!!!!! 
29558 We zijn 8 dagen in New York geweest en we vonden het verblijf daar geweldig. Voor de kinderen was het de eerste keer en de stad is erg bij hun in de smaak gevallen. We hebben wat uitzonderlijke dingen mogen meemaken. 
29559 My last review was about the Roosevelt nearby (dreadful). The Barclay is elegant, clean, staff is attentive, and will help you whenever possible. The rooms are small, recently upholstered, and it is the best value for money in the sector. Good for businessmen. 
29560 Cpontrary to advertising done by Starwood this property refuses all Starwood gratitudes. It is a bummer because the hotel has a decent location now that the Essex House has left, but they will not honor any Starwood benefits, although the are aStarwood property. A truely bad place for frequent guests 
29561 Muy agradable estancia esta cerca del Reliant Stadium y la habitacion muy limpia con suficientes toallas , se respira tranquilidad y comfort. Muy adoc para un fin de semana e ir de compras .Excelente Servicio 
29562 Functionele, schone kamer en badruimte, vriendelijke service. Matige bedden, maar beslist goed te doen. Voldoende om fris elke dag New York weer in te stappen. In de lounge 3 computers met internet tegen kleine vergoeding. Bijzonder goed gelegen. Diners, restaurants, shops, theaters, musea binnen loopafstand. 
29563 The hotel was a wonderful find! Our room was comfortable and well laid out and the amenities were thoughtfully selected. Staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful at a very busy time of the year. Great value! 
29564 Best hotel experience. Period. Stayed here with my Mom for IBS Beauty Expo. Superior staff. Superior rooms. Exceeded expectations. Accomodating down to the very last detail. Special thanks to Jamie, Sasha and company. Will definitely be staying here again! 
29565 Great Friendly Staff, Clean Rooms, and great Service. They also provide shuttle service Downtown, which is a very short ride. 
29566 Staff was super nice and went out of their way to make me feel welcome. Only a couple of blocks from times square and the hotel rooms are really nice. Granite sinks and the beds are sooo soft! 
29567 hilton garden inn new york - chelsea is right place to stay in NYC no matter of business or personal. NO 
29568 The staff was really cool and dressed up for Halloween. They gave me awesome candy at the door. Mmmm, Swedish Fish. Carla, Amanda, and Sarah were super friendly and hilarious. 
29569 Just got off the phone to make reservations..the guy I spoke with was incredibly rude. I changed my mind on the spot and didn't make the reservations. Now off to find another hotel! 
29570 The view, simply magnificent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! only public transportation is not that convenient. 
29571 The rooms were recently renovated, and larger than the average NYC hotel rooms. Perfect location if you need to get to Penn Station The staff were also very friendly and helpful. 
29572 The andaz hotel is a very good hotel. Pros Clean Kind staff Great food On 5th ave Great gym Near the empire state building Cons No 'proper' jam at breakfast. You get conpot! Poor lighting in cuboards Overall a very good hotel 
29573 I have been here over 60 nights in the past year and I absolutely love the staff, they are amazing and accommodating, the facilities are well kept, the entire place is clean. Great Hotel worth the trip. 
29574 Room witg terrace is awesome! Small rooms, but the location is excellent if you dont plab to spend much time inside. 
29575 Thanks to Peter when checked in on 27th Dec were given an upgrade that made our stay the best experience our family will ever have. Hotel is at the heart of everything that New York has to offer. Would recommend to anyone. The Beaumont family e mail beaumontderek@hotmail.com 
29576 I stayed here with my 15 year old daughter in December '05. The hotel is lovely, nicely decorated, very clean, brilliant location. Quiet at night. We couldn't fault it, the staff were very helpful and the doormen too. Can't wait to go there again!! Two satisfied customers. 
29577 Es un hotel con una muy buena situacion, en un barrio tranquilo, muy limpio, silencioso y bien mantenido, con muy buena tarifa. Los banos estan siempre limpios y desocupados, y el servicio es muy amable. Realmente recomendable. Volvere sin lugar a dudas. 
29578 Thank you to the entire staff, who made our trip to the city a pleasant one. From the check in to the check out, every staff member we encountered were polite. A true example of service.Thank you once again - Willie Mae Williams 
29579 Stayed through priceline - 2 rooms. They were nice and got us adjoining rooms. Rooms were nice. Location is in the middle of a business highrise park hard to find the first time, nothing nice nearby, no grounds. Valet parking only, expensive, but not as bad as downtown. 
29580 Stayed one night at this best western and it was a great stay, the staff was very friendly and gave me some great spots to eat at around the area. Hotel was very clean and had internet in the room and in the business center. Great stay overall. 
29581 Loved the location, great staff, wonderful room. Will definitely book again when we are in the city. I was pleasantly surprised how nice the room was. I was thinking that the FREE parking would be the only real perk. Staff bent over backwards to help us with every inquiry. Thank-you! 
29582 It's been my first time at your Hotel, April 24 to April 28. I really really appreciate all the services we received at your hotel. Special Thanks to Eden Bernal for everything she made for us. Great, great, great services. I really recommend 
29583 We had a nice stay here. Staff was nice and rooms were clean. I would definitely stay here again. Very quiet when we were there. 
29584 Rooms needed updating, shabby carpeting. Heater didn't work well. 
29585 If you are headed for Chicago, on a budget, and do not need to be on a train line or on the Magnificent Mile, this is a nice neighborhood hotel. Most cab fares to downtown locations are about $15. Great breakfast place, Anne Sather's, across the street. 
29586 Clean and quiet. Good location. Try and get a corner room. 
29587 Perfect location, I was impressed by the great and friendly service, Lindsay, Zack & Mark make a difference in my stay. Romms are small but nice furnished and clean. I go to NY every six months and definitly this will be my option from now on! 
29588 Nobody does it better. The Ritz-Carlton Central Park has mastered the perfection of its art. If you can only experience it once, it's worth a life-time of waiting. Thank you Ritz-Carlton. 
29589 What a Place. Lovely & clean. The beds (I want one of them) the best I've slept in. Coffe on tap downstairs really good. Staff very friendly & helpful. Superb location. Would definitley stay there again 
29590 Very popular spot with locals and travelers due to Pump Room Bar. Hotel is very nice; modern renovation means all is fresh and modern. Rooms small and tight, but bed is excellent quality. Quiet room, bustling downstairs restaurant and bar--especially appealing to young professionals. 
29591 We spent 2 nights here and were completely satisfied with our stay. It was clean, rooms were confortable, staff friendly, free breakfast was good. Might be a little hard to find without GPS. 
29592 The comfort Inn was a real surprise to us. Booked because of location and price. Small but very comfortable rooms. Suggest rooms in back of hotel because of busy street out front. Great location, friendly staff, nice continental breakfast. What more could you ask for. 
29593 A great place to stay on a budgeted trip to NYC. Very friendly staff, very close to subways, and walking distance from the west side of central Park. Getting to the City is very easy by subway. The place is great value for money! Loved my stay!! 
29594 Si kieres moverte por NYork es perfecto. esta justo en frente del madison square garden y cerca de todo. el hotel es enorme. 
29595 this is the nicest place i have ever stayed. rooms were clean and beds were comfortable. i would recommand to my friends. 
29596 bello fandastico,le camere ,ristorante, hall, la terrazza..... ed il design in posizione bellissima vicino a metro , pochi passi da times square e central park.... 
29597 We have used this location for our trips to Houston for the past 2 years. We go to Houston about 7 times a year for business and stay 2-3 days each time. Every time is excellent,great service,hot breakfast and large clean rooms. I would recommend this location to everyone 
29598 The hotel is very visually appealing. The staff is courteous and efficient. And there's a Starbucks in the lobby! What more could you ask for. I just wish I would've had more time to try out the swimming pool and workout room!! 
29599 What a great hotel only half a block from Times Square! The staff was very helpful and every night I looked out my window I saw the reflection of signs in Times Square. Upgraded to the slightly bigger room and it was perfect for two people. Definately recommended! 
29600 Stayed for 3 days in may room was clean staff are friendly and very helpful is in a good location would definitely go back to the Carlton didn eat there so can't comment on the food had a blast in New York :) 
29601 Nice hotel!! Good size of the rooms and clean bathroom. And perfect location!!! 
29602 My room had huge cockroaches in the bathroom. The A/C- heat was loud. Lots of street noise. I was on the Lexington side. 
29603 I was only there one night, but I had a great stay at this Hampton Inn. It was convenient, comfortable, and clean. There is construction next door, but I wasn't there during the day and it was quiet in the evening. 
29604 A very modern hotel in a great location. Rooms are very clean with comfortable beds. Staff are friendly and really helpful. We really enjoyed our stay here and would definitely return and recommend to others. 
29605 My wife and kids stayed here for 4 nights and the service was amazing. The staff were very helpful and the room service did a great job. I'm defiantly coming back next season. 
29606 Just a block from the subway. Nice rooms but not luxurious. This is a Sheraton not the St. Regis. Starbucks in the lobby w/o the hotel markup. Best of all - you can actually open the windows for fresh air! 
29607 Great Location. Easy to get to Time Square and the nice end of town. Room was spacious, so plenty of space for luggage. Bathroom was very roomy also. Only disappointment was the way the room was cleaned each day, very basic, bed was hardly made. 
29608 The locations is great. My biggest complaint is the elevators. One was always out during my stay. After having sushi at the bar one night, I was up all night ill. Rooms are OK, typical of a Hilton. Staff was friendly and accommodating. 
29609 An ideal location. A bijou hotel on a quiet street. More European in style than North American. Small ,comfortable ,quiet room. We shared bathrooms but they were impeccably clean. Helpful, pleasant staff. Good price. Elevator. A very good experience 
29610 Beautiful and spacious suites. The beds are very comfortable. The staff is friendly and helpful. I will book again for my next trip to Chicago. 
29611 Perfect location-near it all but not on top of it all. Extremely friendly staff!! Nice breakfast. Spacious room for midtown, or anywhere for that matter. Definitely a great pick for midtown!! 
29612 Stayed here during a business trip. Location is great, lots of restaurants, nightlife, and people watching. Convenient to many business offices. Room was very clean, and I thought the price was terrific for the area/quality. 
29613 Allow a little extra time for Sunday brunch as it is a very popular restaurant (Norma's) and a very yummy and unusual food selections. We ordered an extra breakfast to share and purchased the menu which has recipes. 
29614 Found a great corporate rate (that included wifi and breakfast) so I decided to give it a try. I wasn't disappointed. Enjoyed the funky deluxe king room and the friendly staff made me feel very comfortable. Don't miss the roof top bar. 
29615 Felt very comfortable. Did not use the the facilities/services and didn't have a chance to eat on the premises, but was glad to know they were accessible. Thank you. 
29616 first time in new york. was upgraded to a executive room excellent housekeeping spotless staff very friendly. could not fault it. will return. 
29617 Just spent long weekend and it could not have been better. Quiet, clean, great staff and a coffee bar with excellent coffee. Close to great restaurants, subway and buses. 
29618 Loved the location, 5 min. walk to Penn Station, 2 mins to subway on 27th st. The staff was excellent, hotel was very clean and comfortable. Breakfast bar was very crowded and too small for the amount of people using it, though. 
29619 The first time we visited was to celebrate my daughter's birthday. The second time was to take my husband and daughter to see the Broadway play "The Color Purple". We also enjoyed the Hotel's famous Sunday Brunch. 
29620 i recently stayed at the sutton place hotel for my birthday. what a great hotel! the room was small but brightly decorated and artfully designed. the bathroom was awesome. the staff was helpful and courteous. the location is amazing i would stay here again and again. 
29621 We had theater tickets and this hotel was in a great location for our show. Our room was very comfortable with 2 beds and the bed linens and pillows were also very comfortable. The bathrooms are a little small, but over all the room was well worth the price. 
29622 Old run down. Noisy neighbors banging on doors 2:00 am. Close to university of Chicago 
29623 Poor Internet 
29624 excellent hotel and very centrally located. Spacious rooms, very clean, family hotel. 
29625 We spent 4 nights at this boutique hotel. They were very friendly, helpful and even hosted a happy hour with free wine nightly from 5:00-6:00. The location is great for shopping, dining and other activities. Very comfortable beds, great TV too. 
29626 I stayed at the inn at the ballpark for business for over a week. I like the vintage high end feel decor of the room ...not really my style but I got the theme and it works. The room was very comfy (bed was great). Staff was outstanding. 
29627 clean and good hotel for ourfamily 
29628 Warning - do not book this hotel - you will not be able to reach anyone to cancel the reservation!! As soon as you call them and tell them you want to cancel, they hang up or put you on indefinite hold!! 
29629 Ac wall unit made loud noise every time it turned on. Pillows were small firm fan type. Very uncomfortable. Has flat screen tv but not hd so picture quality is not that good. 
29630 My wife and I have stayed here on two separate occasions. Had great experiences both times. The hotel is beautiful and clean, the staff is friendly and efficient. I'd say it's expensive, but it's New York, so relatively I really can't complain. 
29631 Excellent value, for the size of the room and convenient location. It was spotless. I loved the amenities especially the French-milled soaps and Neutrogena products. I was there for my birthday and the staff went overboard to make me feel special. 
29632 Noise from the streets, trains and from the rooms near you. Rooms are very small and need more than a shine up. 
29633 We found the hotel to be very nice. The view of Grant Park, and the Lake was beautiful. The room was clean. The staff was nice and helpful. Room service messed up our breakfast order, but fixed it in minutes. 
29634 Recently stayed at the Belvedere Sept 2004 and really enjoyed it. The location is excellent, less than 5 minutes walk to Times Square. Although the hallways are a bit tired, the rooms and the lobby are glistening and very nice. I would stay again and definately recommend the Belvedere Hotel! 
29635 Excellent service and food; the wait staff were knowlegable and courteuos and the menu choices, both in the bar and the restaurant. 
29636 Hotel room very nice, not a lot of wardrobe space, only a problem if you take lots of clothes. The bar very modern and relaxing,bar staff very friendly. If I visit New York again I would definitely stay in the Affina. 
29637 We have stayed at the Wellington now 3 times 
29638 Its comfy,convenient and kind of nice but the noise from the heaters and the pipes rattling were abit too much. Also the heater mechanism never worked and was beyond me. Still, we are going again this Xmas 
29639 A pretty standard Holiday Inn. A little tired decor, but comfortable beds. Away from the congestion of Michigan Ave, but close to everything you want to do. Get a corner king, as these are nice, big rooms. 
29640 Stayed at the St Regis in New York for 3 nights and enjoyed every moment.Outstanding service,spacious rooms and the best location.I only had breakfast there and it was delicious.I can't wait to go back. 
29641 We had our 2 month old baby and our room thermostat was not working. Upon informing the manager, Charo, she immediately took care of our situation and even gave us a discount for our stay plus free breakfast. Great customer service. We will be regulars at this Doubletree location. 
29642 Me and my friends stayed in this hotel for christmas 2004, and we had a brilliant time. Why go... * Location - by Macy's and Empire State * Friendly and helpful staff * Free Breakfast and Coffee * Clean and comfy rooms not to foget value for money 
29643 WJ is a very nice "boutique" hotel in the Theater District. Rooms are quiet (but small, as are many NYC hotel rooms), and a good price, with good service. During our first night the air conditioner was loud, so we asked the staff to fix it and they did. 
29644 Would definitely recommend staying at Hotel Chandler. Rooms are clean and modern. Front desk service was excellent as the staff were friendly and always willing to help. The hotel is within walking distance to the Empire State Building, Macy's, and many other must see's. 
29645 Easy check in, beautiful views/room, friendly staff all around, easy walking to restuarants & Times Square & Theater District. Hector the Doorman was friendly, funny & helpful. It made our trip more fun to be at this hotel & we will def. return. 
29646 What a disappointing experience - paid a lot for the room but little value. Furnishings tired and worn but, worse, room pervaded by cooking smells. A/C very noisey. No coffee making facility - not even a cover on the duvet. Yuk. Milliemicron 
29647 Great location, but small but functional room. Therefore, price/performance a bit too high. Did not take breakfast due to high price. No temporary parking possible/we were sent away. Lobby on ground floor does not exist, you need to take elevator first to go to 5th floor. 
29648 Creo que una de las fortalezas del hotel es su estrategia de marketing, el hotel, sus habitaciones bastante normales para el precio que cobran, no volveria 
29649 staff lovely, hotel a bit old looking, rooms clean but dark. bathrooms new and shower was lovely, 
29650 Great location. Just a little Bit dated but good value for money. Long queues to check in. But staff are very efficient when u finally get to them. 
29651 This hotel is beautiful......luxury, clean, great big rooms, friendly staff, great location. Would highly recommend this to travellers. 
29652 A (reservation) mistake from Expedia brought us to the Paramount Hotel. We were helped by a fantastic "frontdesk" assistant called Nerma, to upgraded rooms. Thanks expedia for making the mistake, we will definately go to the Paramount again in the near future. 
29653 spent 2 nights at this hotel on 08/17-08/19 to celebrate my birthday. experience was so disappointing. hotel floor smells like a skunk and their towels were so smelly. for $540.00 ,it was not worth it. elevator sounds like it is ready to fall apart. 
29654 This hotel was right near the convention Center and within walking distance to everything we needed. The staff was so courteous and we loved the European Style hotel design. Thanks Houston, whata wonderful experience at such a convenient price 
29655 Parker is great. Super location by the subway and the park. Front desk is cheerful but chill. Heard the gym was baller but ran in the park instead. Toiletries are nice. Only bad thing: Tv's in rooms are from 1995 
29656 Very inconsistent. One hour the elevators work - the next... Wait 10 minutes. The 'elite' lounge is a crowded, low service (can't find a table) place. Food/drink prices are high. Internet service is ridiculously poor - the Marriott family is still in the 20th century (wired ). Inexcusable. 
29657 7 day stay in NYC, working very long hours. Hotel was clean, room just big enough, and very quiet, even on the low 10th floor. Incredibly friendly and helpful staff, right down to the late night security guards. Cannot be beat for a good mid town place to stay. 
29658 Do very good service and reliable staff very comfortable bed the location is the best in new york. you can walk to anywhere 
29659 Listen. I had a great experience at this hotel. I don't understand where the negative feedback is coming from. So close to my convention at the Javits Center. Walked everywhere without fear. Without any problems. Courteous staff. Decent price. OK breakfast. An overall wonderful experience. 
29660 when in Chicago , a great place to stay ,good restaurant , a block form the Michigan drive , ,good reatrauants around and helpful staff 
29661 comfort and clean 
29662 We really enjoyed the space in this hotel and the very comfortable beds.The nearest subway stop was within easy walking distance and made it a pleasure to visit any tourisr sites. Would definately return to the Beacon for a further New York visit. 
29663 A lot of Manhattan hotel rooms resemble glorified broom closets - not the Affinia. The hotel is modern and my room on the 7th floor was clearly recently renovated. Everything was clean, bright and cheerful. Shame the charge for wireless, especially given how expensive the hotel is. 
29664 Spacious, clean, updated rooms. Great lobby bar. Only downfall is that it's on Canal street. Overall great stay. 
29665 Great location. Comfortable stay. Close to all the main shopping label store and restaurants. This hotel had a cool rooftop bar. The only thing that was a flaw was the fact that we had to pay 15 dollars a day for the wifi which was per device so be warned. 
29666 Great location and quiet the staff was super friendly - rooms are small but it is NYC. Lobby has free WIFI and a nice seating area - breakfast was good - staff was too helpful just needed some quiet time. This is a great Hilton super clean and quiet. 
29667 Great experience with a group of 24 I was not sure what to expect. Valerie Cruz & Yesi Luna were a pleasure to work with. Nice rooms & great location! Check in went smooth. Tanks for your hospitality! 
29668 This hotel is clean, spacious and central for everything..a little gem within walking distance of many of new yorks must sees..yes it could do with a bit of a makeover but it has character..staff helpful but not obtrusive..will be going back again definately..xxxx 
29669 AnnMara Gayle does just an excellent job in guest relations. They anticipate the customers needs and get to know the frequent hotel guests by name. 
29670 My daughter & I stayed there in our search for her prom dress. The staff was extremely helpful in recommending stores and areas that we would like to explore. Rooms are small but nice. 
29671 Talking about incompetant staff. People work at the reception are not able to handle the easiest problems. No elevators. Therefore, be prepared to carry your own luggage. 
29672 We had a wonderful trip to New York, though in 2009 october my birthday. We stayed for a week visiting some friends and all those great restaurants.We will be back. 
29673 this hotel continues the Ritz standard. The staff is excellent, very helpful and friendly. The roooms are well appointed and comfortable. We had a club level room and it was nice to get coffee and a pastry quickly. great hotel, nice location, great staff 
29674 Nice, clean and comfortable rooms. Good breakfast. Extremely pleasant front desk. Great value for the money. Breakfast was very good - lots of items to choose from. Only issue I had was the weird flushing toilet. 
29675 El hotel es sencillo, con habitaciones confortables y buen gusto, la ubicacion es lo primordial, muy centrico de los cuales puedes ir caminando a los principales lugares. El personal sumamente cordial. Fue nuestra primera vez en NEW YORK, pero no sera la ultima porque nos encanto. 
29676 No matter how thrifty you are trying to be, don't waste your money by staying here. Spend the few extra dollars and enjoy New York. 
29677 Great price, great location! A roomy, comfortable art deco designed lobby with plenty of couches for meeting with colleagues, clients, friends. The coffee shop is a NY "institution" and great value. 
29678 I've had great stays... I have had mediocre stays. The living areas in most rooms are decent sized. However, the bathrooms need a serious renovation... and the elevator need to be much faster! I'd try another place, but this hotel is so conveniently close to where I work. 
29679 We stayed here 4 nights in Feb. 04. We checked in at 11 AM after a red-eye flight. Great room with fabulous view of the Chrysler Building- incredibly helpful staff. Got a great rate through QuikBook. Will definiitely stay here again! 
29680 My husband and I stayed here for a quick getaway to see a show. Great location, clean, and nice staff. Room was small, but that's New York. Very good value! 
29681 I just returned from NYC and stayed at the Michelangelo. I loved it! Wonderful location. Very cozy, the staff is helpful and the resturant next door is very convenient. Please note the food is excellent but the service isn't what you receive at the Hotel. 
29682 It's ok for business trips. Few steps from Michigan Avenue. Clean. Good wi-fi connection. Good bar service. No breakfast service, but a nice Lavazza shop next the side entrance. 
29683 in a good neighborhood to get around the city. Half a block from the subway. Warm and comfortable. A very good breakfast at the Black Duck. 
29684 Recently stay in Chicago at the Marriott on the Magnificent Mile, the service was excellent unfortunately you have to pay 14.95 a day for internet service and you cannot control the temp in your room. 
29685 Reasonable place to stay, small but sufficient. Opposite the bus station which is great if you want to travel out to the woodbury commons outlet shopping. Times square is just a few streets away. Get there early for breakfast because it gets packed early. 
29686 I stay at the Sheraton at least twice a month and the staff there is fabulous! The rooms are always clean, and the food is wonderful. I highly suggest this hotel for business trips when you live out of a hotel during the week. 
29687 The Hotel was great but the noise was kind boring... The location is great and the people very friendly I love it 
29688 Perfect location, walking distance to Times Squares, 30Rock, Macy's, & super close to almost any theatre. Very clean & new- had no problems whatsoever! Friendly & helpful staff & super comfy beds. Couldn't have asked for a better at such a good price. Would stay here again in a second! 
29689 Simply superb hotel with fantastic location. without a shadow of doubt the Crown Plaza has to be the very best that my wife and I have been guests, and we are sure to return sometime in 2009. 
29690 Hotel was very good, service excellent. Rooms on the small side, but expected, and functional - didnt spend any time in the room as too much to see outside it! Shower was fab, a real bonus. Location vey good, round the corner from Empire State Building. Would recommend it. 
29691 Just needed a place to sleep while we ran around but this was better. Breakfast was sufficient and not crowded. Very close to NASA and convenient to other sites. The room was quiet. The beds were very comfortable. The place was clean. I would go back. 
29692 Second time using this hotel and will use it again in the future, nice staff, great location,clean rooms .Outstanding hotel will definately recommend!!! 
29693 This hotel is very nice and clean, the rooms are light and beds are confortable! my triple room was fantastic! There are no noise at all, breckfast is simple but good. Good free connection. It's not very close to the subway... 
29694 Altrough crowded and reception the total impression from this hotel is very satisfying. Spacy suites with kitchenette, splendid view and helpful receptionists/bellboys. 
29695 This is a smallish hotel. Lovely staff. The rooms are quite old and not as glossy as their website shows but I would recommend St Giles as a great place to stay in NYC. 
29696 My mom and I really enjoyed our recent stay. The staff is professional, courteous and always spot on. The room was clean and very spacious. I will definitely make this my top hotel pick for future trips to New York! 
29697 I got this hotel as a result of blind bidding on Priceline. I paid $155 + taxes per night. The advertised rack rate on the hotel's website is $400 per night. Good midtown east locale. A bargain at $155 per night but not at $400 per night. 
29698 Well positioned luxury hotel. The nearby Red Flame Diner was a great place for breakfast and reasonably priced. Many restaurants in the area catering to all levels and tastes. Reasonable value for money 
29699 It was a beautiful hotel. I had a massage both days of my stay. The spa is very small as is the workout area but the massages were great! The rooms were clean and beautiful. Staff was friendly. Room service food was good. We had a wonderful stay! 
29700 Great hotel in terms of location, size of room, cleanliness and service of staff. Area has many restaurants of high quality to choose from in addition to good quality hotel restaurant. 
29701 Karadzovski, Tk help me plan my day activities and suggest some great places to visit. She was very informative and nice. I think you will find her very useful while staying at the W in City Center. She really nice and made my stay in Chicago memorable! 
29702 Sam Guiragossian Manager of the Westin Gym rocks, he gives great advice and awesome neck massage. He kindly followed up after my wife and I left with a personal work out for us both. He is awesome. 
29703 The Waldorf is New York City. The best location, the best service, and a real historic NY atmosphere...hard to beat this wonderful place... 
29704 Hotel is right downtown, so for anyone having business there it is a great location. Overall, pretty good location. However, one of my colleagues was robbed in a neighboring parking lot, so be aware of your surroundings if you park in the area. 
29705 My husband and I went to NYC for the first time. We really enjoyed staying at the Iroquois it is close to everything!!! The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are small, but the beds are comfortable. We would stay here again! 
29706 I couldn't ask for a more comfortable, peaceful, and elegant place to stay with my family in New York City. The hotel is conveniently located near all the popular places tourists visit, and the staff was extremely professional and very efficient. 
29707 We visited Houston with family and had a very nice stay here. The front desk check in service was friendly and the rooms were neat and clean. Will definitely stay again! 
29708 The location on Michigan Ave is perfect. The hotel has its own lively bar and is located near shopping and some fantastic restaurants. The decor in the corridors and bedrooms is beginning to show its age, but other than that no complaints whatsoever 
29709 From first arrival through the entire stay we were treated like family. Kudos especially to Sam at the Fitness Club, who (free of charge) gave great training advice and even sent a customized workout plan to me by email the next day! 
29710 El hotel colma las espectativas. en realidad muy bien ubicado lo que permite ir varias veces al hotel a dejar paquetes en la habitacion si es un viaje de compras por ejemplo. a 3 cudras queda una estacion de metro y un Marcy. 
29711 The Affinia is right in the centre of things - a perfect place to stay! The hotel staff were very friendly and the room very spacious. Highly recommended! 
29712 Treated us like a member of their family! Room, decor, service, location--all wonderful! We'll definitely be back. Make sure to see Fabulous Freddy to help you find the best in NYC. 
29713 .... what more can you ask for?! I have always had great service at the Westin Galleria so I am really sad that they aren't on my firm's preferred list anymore. I would choose to stay for pleasure thought just because of the location. 
29714 Stayed at the Affinia 50 service was A+ room was A+ staff A+ Especially thamara pierre 
29715 The hotel room was clean, the staff was polite and friendly. The location was very convenient. Very affordable as well. 
29716 Great location, staff and surprisingly quiet considering it's location in midtown! The rooms are compact but adequate. Bonus: if you are snowed in the Bliss Spa is attached to the hotel! 
29717 Ottimo hotel in posizione strategica. Pulizia OK e stanze di buone dimensioni per 2 adulti + 1 bimbo. 
29718 what a goog location walking distance to everything staff very friendly rooms very clean all in all very enjoyable trip 
29719 Do not book if you like cleanliness, a dump of a hotel, worst hotel inthe USA. 
29720 Hotel pratique car une kitchenette avec frigo et micro-onde. Situation agreable (pres de central park, entre la 76th et Broadway) car loin du bruit et de la foule de time square. Un supermarche et des magasins a proximite. Petit-dejeuner convenable mais peu varie. Je recommande cet hotel. 
29721 i stayed here one night for after a meeting on the west side of hosuton - it'snothing fancy but it's clean and functional and a good deal for the $38 or so i paid plus tax - i would stay here again 
29722 Hotel was great (hot shower, clean, room size, location, nice beds) but offer no free internet and the heating was broken. 
29723 Lobby is quite outdated, but rooms have amazing views and the hotel is in a good location. Don't miss the swimming pool that's high in the sky with a perfect view of the Empire State Building. 
29724 Our second visit to the fabulous crowne plaza times square. Fabulous view from a city view room. The service was excellent and the location at times square is hard to beat. Definitely recommend and will definitely return. 
29725 Had a beautiful room, great service, comfortable bed would not hesitate to stay there again. Sokol at front desk was particularly helpful. 
29726 Bathroom had mold, shower needed to be recalked. Hotel is not being maintained. Waited an hour for a cab. The bellhops were horrible at there job. Why they weren't able to hail a taxi. I have stayed at 3 stars that were more attentive to guest needs. 
29727 The beds were so satisfying. I was exceptionally comforted by the fine linens and sensuous, high-quality mattress. The amenities are certainly luxurious. The beautiful decor of the hotel alone garners substantial acclaim. I'll surely consider staying a the St. Regis Hotel again. 
29728 Highly recommended, staff treats you like a star and the rooftop pool is awesome! 
29729 Great location, easy walking distance to Broadway Theaters. Rooms were clean, beds were comfortable, quiet at night. Rooms could use some updating. Management responsive when problems did arise. Annoying time share desk in lobby. A nice deli across 53rd Street for cheaper food options. Would definitely stay there again. 
29730 one of the few hotels to confirm a high storey room when u book it. very good and smiling service. location is perfect. 
29731 Pretty typical Marriott hotel as to the amenities. Desk personnel were friendly & upbeat. Concierge was helpful. Internet access is additional charge, but free in lobby. 
29732 We had stayed here 4 nights in May'12. Servis is excellent, apparment was very nice, great view... I couldn't find something in my mind to write the rebuke... great thanks for management 
29733 *Major renovations taking place when we were there *Staff very helpfull, nothing too much trouble *Rooms quite spacious and well appointed 
29734 The location of this hotel cannot be beat. It is so close to amazing food and great shopping, and the L train runs close by. The staff here were also superb... totally top notch. They were friendly and very welcoming. I would absolutely stay here again when visiting Chicago! 
29735 Volgens mij de beste keus als je een beetje lowbudget midden in het centrum wilt verblijven. Je slaapt en doucht er en bent weer weg metro aan de zij en overkant beter kan niet en allerlei ontbijt en lunch mogelijkheden op een paar meter afstand. 
29736 The Hotel Indigo NYC Chelsea is perfectly located in a quiet street of midtown Manhattan. Our room on the 7th floor was fairly big and the interior modern and comfortable. The staff was friendly. I would recommend this hotel to business travellers and tourists without any concerns. 
29737 i have just returned from new york,stayed in this hotel,excellent for sightseeing,shops etc all within walking distance. room clean and towels and beds changed daily.all staff very polite.would stay here on further trips 
29738 Just back from a 5 night trip and I will definitely stay in this hotel again. Staff were extremely friendly, the rooms were far bigger than most New York hotel rooms, location was great (5 mins walk to Times Square) and the free internet definitely came in handy. 
29739 It worked out so well excellent food excellent service and great housekeeping I loved the so much I slept in it. 
29740 We traveled to Chicago with a group of 4 families and wanted to stay close to the Museum Campus. The campus was within walking distance of the hotel. The rooms were great and the hotel was very nice. Would love to stay again!! 
29741 The manager was very helpful in making sure everything was ready for me and made my stay very enjoyable. Would highly recommend this hotel. 
29742 Nice room, comfy bed. Hotel has 1 tiny restaurant with space for 25 or so, absolutely no privacy there as you are just feet away from other diners, and typically over-priced garbage food. Entrance to the smallish health club is right there at the restaurant. 
29743 Great hotel, great staff, great location.Great fitness center. Buy a 3 day transit pass. Well worth it. You can get everywhere by subway or bus from this hotel. 
29744 Stayed for 8 days on business along with Clients. The attention and service from the moment of check-in was very good. The rooms were very clean and maintained clean all the time. Location is walking distance to Broadway Theatres and top notch restaurants 
29745 Very convenient inspite of heavy rain storms. 
29746 Great location on Hubbard, walking distance to everything in river north and so close to magnificient mile. 
29747 Great location, friendly staff, good rooms and good gym. Despite the very central location the rooms were very quiet. I was there on business and wish I had been able to stay longer. I would go back on a holiday any day (budget permitting). 
29748 I found this hotel to be a great little gem in the heart of Times Square. Many extras as well such as breakfast and the wine and cheese service. Highly recommend. 
29749 Really inexpensive. Clean, safe, and close to the subway - all great points. When you book ask to be far from the elevator! It's close to restaurants including Cafe Viva 2578 Broadway (at 97th Street) which is a fast casual Italian place with tons of vegetarian and vegan food. 
29750 Loved it!!!!!!! Very Elegant and yet friendly atmopsphere! The rooms very comfortable and the bathroom also!!! Very welll situated walking distance from Broadway and the Fifth Avenue!!!! Woul recomended it! 
29751 Great location on the river and near the lake. Attentive staff. Cozy beds. Fabulous breakfast buffet with a continental vibe (but it costs extra). Highly recommended for a vacation or work-related trip. 
29752 this hostel is a rare gem in New York. It is affordable and convenient - something you don't find often in New York. It is great that the hostel is not located near the busy city center. Instead, it is hidden in a residential neighborhood th 
29753 Tha location was great, the personel was so helpful and the room was actually huge for the city! 
29754 Location was great and the staff were friendly and accommodating. I had requested an early check-in and a refurbished room and both requests were honored. Bath is small but adequate, the beds were comfortable and very short wait for elevators. 
29755 No hairdryer in room, no chair in room, no grab bars to help getting in and out of shower which was very slippery ( and a liability to the hotel) 
29756 Room and bath were very spacious. Staff was very gracious and helpful. Very quiet, nice bedding. Could have used a coffee maker in the room and could have done without the condoms in the mini-bar and photos of half-naked women on the wall (traveling with the kids). 
29757 This hotel has been updated since the last time here. Rooms are very nice, well appointed. Location to the Theaters and Times Square is great. Only a few blocks away. Breakfeast is a zoo at 8AM, try to go earlier or later. Staff is very helpful. 
29758 We stayed here for a family trip and loved it! Friendly, helpful staff, great size rooms with excellent facilities in a safe part of town perfect for shopping and museums. Family members have stayed here since and. I can't wait to return. 
29759 This hotel offers reasonable rates and a wonderful location. Easy to walk to subways, time square, etc. Nice hotel with friendly staff. We felt safe there. Rooms were decent enough. This is great value to see the Big Apple. 
29760 Spent 10 days in NYC and would definately stay at Southgate again. The room was large and clean. It was nice to have the kitchen. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Convenient location - across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. 
29761 The room was very small but very clean, A couple blocks away from Penn Station and the subways. Staff was helpful, I would stay there again. 
29762 Loved the location.Close to Bryant Park & Times Square,but not close enough for the madness.Free continental breakfast had quite a selection & everything was fresh.The staff always greeted you going in & out.Got to check in when I arrived at 1130,which I know was lucky but still GREAT 
29763 We stayed at this Quinta for 2 nights. August 19 and 20th 2003. This was an excellent experience. The Hotel was clean and beautiful. The staff was very nice. This is the Quinta at its best. We recomend it highly. 
29764 The water runs brown out of the sink and bathtub and shower head. Major plumbing issues with this place. ( 
29765 lovely hotel. large room. kitchen area adds a lot of comfort. helpful, pleasant staff. great location. would definitely stay there again. 
29766 This hotel has an excellent location between park central and times square. Staff were very good and efficient. 
29767 Good location, comfortable rooms, but very small. It's Manhattan so $300/night doesnt get you much. If you are out and about all day and just need a place to crash, it's perfect. But if you can spend a bit more, you can get a considerably nicer hotel. 
29768 The staff was very helpful and assisted our group as needed. Eugene was especially helpful when our group arrived at the hotel. Staff was always friendly and smiled and would ask if there was anything we needed. I would stay there again. 
29769 El hotel es muy lindo y completo, tiene de todo y la atencion de la gente, de hasta ahora de nuestro viaje fue de lo mejor. La ubicacion muy buena, cerca del subte, y en el medio de la ciudad. Mi experiencia fue muy positiva. 
29770 I have truly enjoyed my stay at Londale. The location is perfect. The Staff are friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and the floors are emaculate. I would definitly reccommend this to any long staying traveler. It's the perfect building for an old time movie. 
29771 I have stayed at the City Club three times in the past two years. Each time it gets better and better. What a an amazing and friendly staff, cozy rooms, excellent amenities, and prime location. I will only stay here in the future! Thank you City Club! 
29772 I wasn't in my room other than to sleep but the interior design and layout was fantastic for the "cabins". It was a great use of space without making you feel too cramped in your room. Very modern. Great happy hour at the bar. 
29773 my husband and i stayed here a few years ago, so i can't vouche for now, but it was a great hotel. it was sleek and stylish. the room was very small, but we expected that and the AC was noisy.... other than that it was GREAT 
29774 If you are a lover of European style hotels this is the one for you, this hotel gives you great service, youth oriented atmosphere, affordable rates and location, location location. 
29775 Lovely hotel with huge bedrooms and bathrooms. Great location. Friendly staff and very clean. 
29776 Arriving at a hotel, even a budget hotel, l expect a few things...pleasant staff and a nice pest-free room. Didn't get that here. Instead, I got rude staff and a GOD AWEFUL small room with cockroaches!!! Horrible experience that I hope no one else will ever have to go through! 
29777 With a privileged location, between the 5th Avenue and Broadway, is a good option for those who will make tourism. The room is small, but clean and comfortable. Is a simple hotel for a reasonable price. 
29778 Stayed here for one night.....the location is excellent....had double room on 17th floor was spacious and great view!!....other people staying with us had suite with small kitchen very large room great for a family....overall enjoyed the hotel and it exceeded our expectations...would stay here again :) 
29779 Excellent location, larger than average rooms, traditionally furnished. Good housekeeping, quiet. All staff encountered were helpful. 
29780 We loved our stay at the Four Seasons in NYC...great location and the concierge were wonderful, introducing us to some new restaurants. Great gym area too 
29781 Wear your flip flops in the shower. It's a weird feeling to have strange men sharing the bathroom with you. Great for ppl under 30. I wish they had separate bathrooms. 
29782 We stayed 14 nights at the hotel metro in a family room.The rooms were spacious ,well appointed with superbly comfortable mattresses.This hotel has a very classy feel.All staff were excellent.The breakfast was delicious and a godsend to start the day. 
29783 das hilton ist ein typisches hotel fuer geschaeftsreisende... gross, unpersoenlich, etc... die lage immerhin ist sehrt gut, auch zum einkaufen etc. auch die zimmer sind eigendlich ganz ordentlich eingerichtet... 
29784 Greeted warmly by Gabby in the lobby (so good to see her again!) and received room upgrade from Liz! Our room was on the 25th floor (city view) and immaculate! The housekeeping staff deserves 5*****! This is OUR PLACE TO STAY when visiting in Chicago!!! 
29785 Very comfortable and efficient small room at what seem to be a fair rate, very good situation. 
29786 I think there is no cheaper stay if you want to be located in Manhattan and have a relatively good quality. Room was tiny but clean, good enough for just sleeping there. They had a pc with internet and printer in the lobby which was free to use. 
29787 El hotel Carter esta fantasticamente situado, podras estar siempre en Times Square, la situacion es genial. El hotel lo estan reformando y las habitaciones estan muy bien y son grandes. Yo lo recomiendo sin ninguna duda. Y disfrutar de NEW YORK 
29788 I stayed at this hotel for 4 nights. The staff were helpfull and the room was big and clean. The location is good and within walking distance of most attactions. I would stay there again. 
29789 Great NYC downtown hotel, with new WTC view, at reasonable prices and a very helpful and nice staff 
29790 From reservations through checkout, this hotel delivers. Their staff is amazing! Having a choice of ten pillows is unheard of in most hotels. We took advantage of room service, complimentary cocktails and The National Bistro. Each experience was wonderful. I want to go back again and again.... :) 
29791 We stayed for 7 nights in Feb 2011 in the Internet suite where everything was ok, maybe the double sofa bed could benefit from a new one. Really nice staff and excellent location. 
29792 One of the best hotels I've been to by far! Cannot wait to book this place again. Great amenities, amazing rooms, perfect location and wonderful service. 
29793 A little off the beaten path, closer to the 9 th avenue end of 39th. However, best staff ever! I am a frequent traveler and the staff here is that off a top quality hotel! Very clean and great price ! Highly recommend. 
29794 Great hotel with free wifi, nice room and warm bathroom floor, handy to everything. Nice to have free breakfast but the breakfast area is too small. Will definitely stay here again. 
29795 The location is very good. One block from Grand Central, 5 blocks from the Rockefeller center and 5 minutes walk from the Times Square. The price is reasonable for New York. THe staff is friendly and the hotel is clean, but has seen better days. 
29796 Great location, close to Central Park, Times Square and transport but... Air con noisy, there was no hotel facilities book even when we asked for it! Got the feeling we were upgraded as the room was spacious with massage chair. Friendly staff. 
29797 Spend a girls weekend this past October at the Hyatt on Wacker. Excellent hotel, pleasant and helpful staff. The location could not be beat - we walked to everything. Would definitely return for a longer stay. 
29798 Comfortable, quiet, room, excellent thoughtful service and always with a smile. The use of French, even ot a largely Anglophone audience, was a clever touch. 
29799 New location for us, nice renovation modern but not over the top. Rooftop bar if a real treat with great views of the skyline! Spacious rooms comfortable beds and helpful staff. We would come back again. 
29800 It's a decent, clean hotel located within walking distance from Penn Station, the Empire State Building and Herald Square. It's not too expensive and all of the major subway lines are within two blocks away. I totally recommend it if you're on a budget. 
29801 This is a very nice art deco hotel. The staff is friendly and helpful.... The rooms are clean and qiute.... we would stay here again! 
29802 Best Hobby Airport Hotel, it's an oldie but goodie! It is not the newest Hampton around, but very well kept, very clean, and great staff. Free, quick airport shuttle. This is the second closest hotel to Hobby, literally a four minute drive. Excellent breakfast as expected at Hamptons. 
29803 No regrets booking this hotel, really close to everything, if you're like us just want to have a comfortable place, but the priority is the location with a strict budget, then this hotel maybe for you. 
29804 I arrived late after just getting back to the US from a European business trip. Hotel staff were extremely friendly and helpful. Reasonably priced rooms and food service. One of the best Four Points I have ever stayed at. 
29805 This was a business trip for me and I was made welcome as soon as I arrived. Nice hotel and rooms were lovely and cleaned everyday. Friendly staff on reception especially Nicole who transported me about everyday via the courtesy hotel bus. 
29806 My husband and I celebrated our Anniversary at the Soho Grand. What a perfectly romantic getaway. Every detail was delightful. Champagne, strawberries, chocolate and Breakfast in bed. I highly recommend the Anniversary package. Loved the pet golfish too! 
29807 We love the Park Savoy Hotel. Every year we stay there and have come to love its funky charm! A great deal at a great price one block from Central Park - what more could you want! 
29808 We stayed three nights. A good place to stay away from downtown. Very convenient location to visit Johnson Space Center, Galveston Island, and San Jacinto Battlefield and right next to Hobby. Only about 15-20 minutes from downtown. Rooms were clean and quiet. 
29809 Six days in a hotel can be tough. But not here....after working a long day away from home, this hotel is where you want ti be. You will really enjiy the friendly service, clean rooms, great open bar & sushi! This is the Place to stay in diwntown Chicago. 
29810 Stayed here several times, have a fantastic location in front of the central park, helpfull staff and close to the 5 ave. great restaurant options close to it. The rooms need some renewing. 
29811 Great location on Michigan Ave. Great fitness center/pool with awesome sundeck. Easy walk to train, shopping, sights and Millenium Park. My wife, teenage son and I stayed and had a blast. 
29812 Ciao a tutti non ci sono molte cose da dire ..... l'albergo non e' recentissimo come struttura ma la posizione, il sevizio, la pulizione il collegamento al aeroporto sono eccellenti! il personale sempre gentile ed efficente..... io personalmente se dovessi ritornare a Ny sicuramente ritornerei nello stesso albergo! 
29813 I can't fault this hotel, it was clean, the beds comy, the room a really good size, the staff were friendly and helpful, the location was brillliant only 1 block to the Carnigie Hall, and the reception hall was beautiful and the food at the intigrated cafe was exceptional 
29814 de bonne qualite proche time square le service de qualite ainsi que le personnel tres serviable t a l ecoute chambre sapcieuse un vrai confort le petit dejeuner copieux et bon et savoureux on a passer un bon sejour 
29815 Our recent stay was great. Very well located and super nice staff. They made everything easy for us. Special shout out to Jaime for getting us a car and AWESOME driver (Miguel) to JFK. Thanks everyone! 
29816 Me gusta mucho es un hotel 5 estrellas que justamente merece la fama que tiene a nivel mundial. 
29817 Got a free upgrade to top floor room, which had great view. Room was not very big, but was well appointed and had a great bed and spacious bathroom. Everything seemed clean and new. 
29818 Would definitely recommend it and look forward to future visitis. Sephy Hambaz 
29819 The owners are extending the benefits of an old investment. Needs all kind of improvements, but still acceptable. Better for family with kids and no high expectation. 
29820 This hotel is older with large rooms. You get a kitchen in the suite, so if you are a with a family that is a great addition (eat inside). If you need the space and want a low cost hotel, this is a great option. 
29821 Some rooms need updating and brightening up, Although I was there at the end of October, air con needs improving. My room was either cold or stuffy. The location was terrific and the hotel's customer service was even better. 
29822 Every staff member I saw was amazingly friendly and engaging. It may not sound like much but in the world of hotels, it's a big thing. 
29823 Hotel was nice. Good service. Bartender helped with nearest non stop alcohol Bar:D Hotel room with great view to Hudson river - I hope. Nice Lobby Bar...Good - Clean and Nice. 
29824 stayed at this hotel during a horrific moving experience, the staff were friendly and professional and were able to accomodate my high floor request with a smile. If I have friends coming in from out of town I would not hesitate to recommend this hotel, nice decor and fantastic location. 
29825 This place is so bad, I'm surprised that the mice and roaches that crawl across your sheets during the middle of the night haven't found a better place to call home. 
29826 As others have said excellent location,compact but clean and functional hotel. Easy stroll down the block to Times Square,Macys,Union Station,Bryant Park 
29827 Excellent. 
29828 stayed for business with group...told customer service i wld be receiving express mail from company in advance...despite the notification they still refused the packaged which cost me a very large deal...combined with the sub-standard housekeeping...horrible customer service personnel...I WLD NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN!!!! 
29829 Free wi.fi and breakfast , nice room ( those with two beds ) I was in ny 3 times this year and this is the hotel that i will come again 
29830 Ich kann dieses Hotel nur weiterempfehlen, zu dem Preis war es einfach nur super und sehr zentral 
29831 We booked a nice stay in a two bed room. Room is nice and spacious, fridge didn't work though. everything was nice and clean and staff is friendly. Plus hotel is connected to the Galleria mall which is a huge plus. 
29832 hotel con camere "vecchiotte", ma ben pulito e riscaldato. acqua calda e cambio salviette quotidiano!non da poco per essere negli USA!! in posizione strategica...50m da Timesquare e a 3 isolati dalla Subway...io ci ritornerei!!! sulla cucina non ho commenti avevamo solo il pernottamento!! ANDATECI!! 
29833 Clean and spacious and good location...would not be my first choice for family traveling but fine for business...needs some upgrades! 
29834 Tiny but clean rooms, perfectly located close to Central Park and Subway Columbus Circle; Bar slightly overpriced ... 
29835 worst place on the planet stayed for 15 mins room had no lock and a set of bunk beds oh and a radiator held up with bricks took photos and got money back when i got home went and stayed at holiday inn it was heaven 
29836 Everything was perfect. Had a clear view of Central Park on a prime floor! 
29837 A nice hotel in a quiet location near the galleria. Nothing in walking distance. We are loyal Omni customers. That being said, it wasn't our best Omni experience because of some slight details, but wasn't bad. 
29838 This hotel and it's operation is absolutely fabulous. Can be at any better other location, it's right in downtown, next to the Mag Mile. I would not hesitate to stay again when book through Priceline. 
29839 The place we stayed was awesome. Two Beds and a good central location. 
29840 Ideal location just off Broadway in SOHO. Staff were excellent and helpful but not overwhelming. Really nice good sized room for NY and very well appointed bathroom. Couldn't fault it. 
29841 Terrific staff at the Westin! The hotel was sold out and the staff still found time to make my staff very personal and enjoyable! Each at the Grill - great food! Will definitely return! 
29842 Excellent decor and service. Staff demeanor and competence are outstanding. Terrific access to theatre district, museums, restaurants, shopping and Central Park. Don't miss Norma's for Sunday Brunch; bountiful and tasty portions. We have returned to this hotel at least annually for the past six years. 
29843 This is my 2nd stay. It is a great hotel with friendly staff, clean rooms and a great location!! I would love to stay here again! Try ABC Kitchen for dinner - Sea Salt Caramel sundae! And Penelope for breakfast - Pumpkin Waffles!! 
29844 You have a great service and wonderful location. 
29845 70 park avenue is a quiet, little gem! We were delighted by its lovely ambiance and great location. The staff is very friendly and customer-oriented. The 5 p.m. wine is a great extra. It's a recommended boutique hotel with a European feel. We would definitely return. 
29846 Loved staying in the Royalton. It is right in midtown, nice bar, excellent customer service. The rooms are regular NYC compact, but done so so beautiful and chic you won't feel like you're staying in a small space. I'd stay there again, perfect location. 
29847 Great Hotel, with great service, they attend us very well. We recieve what they promise, and all what we need to live in New York. I recomend New York Inn! SEBASTIAN AND GUILLERMO 
29848 good value for money, well situated for the tourist area,very clean,staff was very helpfull telling us where to visit and where to avoid. I would definatly go again,and recomend it to others. 
29849 Excellent stay! The people were nice and the rooms were quite large for New York. The reasonable rate even included breakfast at a restaurant a couple of doors down the street. We were very pleased. 
29850 Not the best hotel I have stayed at, although was impresed when i wlaked in, Nice lobby. Howvere soon as i got into the lift and out on the hallway. what a dump.. it looked like a sleazy hotel, the rooms were old and mouldy with plaster falling off! 
29851 This hotel for location was excellent and I could not find a fault with the place it just allowed us to enjoy our stay with no problems at all. A great base with fantastic breakfasts that will set you up for a day of sightseeing. 
29852 We selected this hotel due to closeness to Hobby airport for a small group coming off of a long cruise. Rooms were spacious, extremely clean and very comfortable. The hotel bar/restaurant does not open until 5PM, but they gladly shuttled us to a nearby restaurant. 
29853 If you can get a good deal, rooms are clean and nice. Hotel is in a super location in Soho. Just don't use room service or eat in the bar. Service is terrible! 
29854 Was shocked about the great location, the Rates were very good, the room was not that great when I complained they gave me a beeter room next day, loved it. not the best but Ok. location is great. 
29855 The rooms are dated and unimpressive and the service is poor. There are many great hotels in NYC. This is no longer one of them. 
29856 Excellent place, almost brand new, great staff and good location. Rooms a bit small but take it for granted you will have a nice stay if you do not have a lot of stuff to place in. Congrat to the manager, your people are great. 
29857 I just checked in in this hotel in the executive room. It is very small. I totally agree with the comments below. There is no storage space!!! Very disappointing !! There is not a lobby and a restaurant.I do not recommend! 
29858 My stay at the w was tremendous I felt like I was n a different country Natlie at the front desk was great very kind,respectful,helpful I look forward in staying at the same hotel n the future when I want to get away again Thanks 
29859 A colleague recommended this hotel because of it's proximity to major sites and to millennium park. I really do not have any complaints about the hotel. I really liked that we were able to take the train to ohare airport for $2.25! Give yourself 40 minutes for this ride. 
29860 From the moment we arrived to the moment we left, our time at the Hotel Chandler was wonderful. The accommodations were lovely, and the staff was friendly and attentive to our every need. I would definitely recommend staying here. 
29861 Excellent staff, excellent location, real good room, poor bar for after theater. 
29862 great location for our first trip to New York, great christmas atmosphere, two huge xmas trees and festive music playing outside. so good we are due to return again this december. 
29863 Front desk staff is knowledgeable and professional. A warm greeting along with information on this property. Clean rooms. Nice restaurant. The lounge is clean and well kept. If you're in Houston, consider this hotel. Good location in the Brookhollow area off of 290 in Northwest Houston. 
29864 We were giddy with delight upon entering our suite at the Roger Smith Hotel. Warm and welcoming decor, clean, comfortable accomodations made us feel at home in an otherwise artsy hotel located in a glamorous New York neighborhood. 
29865 correcto en todos los aspectos basicos que se le piden a un hotel. Muy buena ubicacion, buena limpieza, nada de grandes lujos pero cumple con las espectativas calidad-precio, sin duda muy recomendable 
29866 sehr gut 
29867 Absolutely perfect location near all of the action of Times Sq and the theaters. We had a clean room that was ready when we needed it. Service was fast and friendly. This hotel really helped make our trip GREAT! 
29868 Stayed with my family for 5 days as part of our US tour. Loved it! Central location was great. Room and facilities were superb. Ate at the restaurant for breakfast one day and dinner another. Sensational! 
29869 The pod hotel has everything you need! Clean rooms with all the facilities and friendly staff. Convenient location near Rockefeller and nice restaurants nearby! Yes the rooms are small but come on...its new york!! 
29870 We got this hotel from the Mystery Quick. Hotel was lovely! Restaurant was nice. Staff was friendly. Hotel was new and had great amenities. They had discounted parking available near by. 
29871 Stayed at the Hilton New York for 4 nights. Husband was bitten by bed bugs. Have contacted Hotel, who is ignoring the issue. Very dissapointed! 
29872 Tres bon hotel: Micro ondes et regriferateur dans les chambres (pour ma part). Chambre laver et ranger tout les jours sans aucun probleme. Produits de bain et serviette a disposition ainsi que Seche cheveux et fer a repasser. Je ne trouve rien de negatif. 
29873 Undergoing renos at the entrance of hotel, the resulting noise renders this hotel unlivable. No wifi in the rooms, no breakfast, no reason to return. Look elsewhere as there tons of other hotels in the area that offer much better value. 
29874 My husband and I stayed at the Westin Michigan Avenue recently and enjoyed our stay there very much. The hotel is beautiful, the service was professional, and the location is perfect. Plus, their Heavenly Bed is fantastic! 
29875 We had 2 double bed rooms on the 7th floor. The hotel is an oasis in the dessert! The staff is the most friendly, helpful and knowledgable of any hotel I have ever been. It does have a train but it's all about the city. Give it a try! 
29876 The Tremont is a nice place that is located in the most pertinent place of Chicago.The hotel is very classic and gives you that warm feel 
29877 The staff are phenomenal. I got the best recommendation for a steak. You can't beat the value for this place. 
29878 i need to be in Trump Internation Hotel nd Tower, NYC to make good business. my country is a virgen land to explore many things, we've many resources, and i need peaple we good vision to see that. and be in right place, is good deal 
29879 This hotel is so central. Staff are quiet helpful although there is a guy on reception at night so is quiet grumpy. Rooms are medium size. Hotel is clean and warm 
29880 Well maintained hotel. Nice rooms and courteous staff. Area is decent and improving and pretty close to airport and great hey access. Fitness center has weights and 7 pieces of cardi. Nice. 2nd time staying here would recommend. Starbucks in Libby 
29881 Excellent service, spacious rooms. The position of the hotel is definetly one of the best in town. A lot of nice restaurants near the hotel. Hotel restaurants are excellent, but $$$ plus. Would recommend for NYC. 
29882 Perfect location arriving at Houston George Bush International and thinking to move from Houston using the highways. Good rooms, nice free wifi also in the room and very good breakfast. Free parking also. Very positive experience. Recommended for business needs. 
29883 Great location. Large room. Fantastic service. 5 stars for sure. Everyone on the staff goes the extra mile with a smile. 
29884 We had a great view of the Statue of Liberty from our hotel. Great Staff, the bell man took great care of a bonsai plant my friend bought. 
29885 The Hotel was amazing!! I stayed there with my daughter, her 3 sons ages 10,12, and 14 in the family room. The room had 2 queen beds and 2 pull out bunk beds from the wall. Great place!!!! 
29886 From location, to the reception, to the room, to the fitness center every aspect of this hotel was perfect for my two-night stay. I would highly recommend it to anyone! 
29887 Look, I have stayed in my fair share of hotels, and Hotel Felix is pretty nice. Bid appropriately on Priceline and if you end up there, then you should be happy enough. 
29888 Friendly welcoming staff, which is a great bonus if here for business. Great size rooms and they are kept pretty spotless too. Small and fitness room are small but clean. Get yourself a car, otherwise you can feel pretty isolated! Good selection of shops close by (1k) 
29889 We stay because a friend was celebrate her daughter birthday in Eloise at the Park. Great experience. Service, ambiance was amazing. Highly recommended because they trick you like a queen. If you wants to have dinner go to quality meat. They have fabulous steaks 
29890 The hotel was great. I wanted to print something, and it was not allowed at the business center. I had to buy a printer. I had a great time. I really liked the art deco interior. I had breakfast at Starbucks downstairs, like I usually do at home. 
29891 The Park 79 offered a great price for a recent weekend stay in NYC. Although small, the room and bathroom was updated, clean and very serviceable. The staff were friendly and helpful -- highly recommended for an economical stay! 
29892 The hotel and staff were wonderful. Very comfortable bed. The room was small but, what do people expect for the price. The location is so convienent to all theaters and Times Square. A most WONDERFUL experience!!!!!! 
29893 This is a great location. It was a two minute walk to the terminal from the front door of the hotel. We did not get to use many facilities due to our early morning flight. But the pianos bar was a lot of fun 
29894 L'hotel si trova in zona molto centrale, a pochi passi da Times Square. Vicinissime le principali attrazioni e la metropolitana. Mi sono trovata molto bene, hotel molto pulito, colazione abbondante e personale molto gentile e disponibile. Ci ritornerei sicuramente. 
29895 Spotlessly clean, very comfortable bed. The room was large by NYC standards. There was some noisy late-night traffic in the corridor, though 
29896 Great location in relation to Times Square. Great staff. Great cookies. Free Coffee that actually tasted good. Fridge and Microwave were nice to have. Size of room was similar to most NYC hotels. 
29897 I found the Waldorf comfortable but very impersonal and although the rooms and location were good for the price I would be inclined to stay somewhere smaller next time i visit NY. 
29898 I highly recomend this fine hotel.. room was great. comfortable and very clean. The staff was helpful. The location is just about perfect..short walk to Grand Central. AND the roof top bar is the top location in NYC. would stay again and again 
29899 l'accueil et le manque de disponibilite sont plutot surprenants. la chambre avait une salle de bain minuscule et peu pratique mais tres propre. l'hotel est bien situe mais j'irai ailleurs la prochaine fois. 
29900 Sure, it's old and dated and undergoing renovation. But its great location and reasonable cost for a one-bedroom suite made it desirable for our family of four. It was clean and comfortable and a good home-base for discovering the rest of what NYC had to offer. 
29901 Stayed at Club Quarters for a business convention. Staff was extremely helpful, Brett was always a smiling face at the front desk. Great above great room, very modern, cozy. Bathroom was immaculate. Quiet and I loved having water bottles at the end of the hall. Internet was free and fast! 
29902 just in front of the Rockfeller Center very new and well furnished rooms even if small as in NY but good enough to enjoy your stay in NY 
29903 I made all reservations by internet. Very good rates for this hotel. The locations is perfect 
29904 Close to principal tourist place. All type of transport. The room clean but small. Personnal very nice 
29905 I recommended this hotel and i hope to comme back soon. 
29906 From a Homewood Suite......It's easy to access (right off the 10) and getting to the frontage roads to find some place to eat was also easy.....It's nothing special, but meets the expectations of a Homewood Suites..... 
29907 taille de chambre minuscule aucune armoire pour ranger les vetements odeur desagreable dans l'hotel hotel a renover car plus que douteux air conditionne ancestrale et bruyante grande chambre douteuse prix prohibitif pas de petit dejeuner hotel a eviter 
29908 The Hotel is easy to find, has a brilliant location - and it was clean and neat and not even remotely run down. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
29909 This hotel has a great location and is very comfortable. The only problem is that they charge for almoast any service, such as wi fi internet connection and package handling. It has a park view and is between 5th and 6th avenues. 
29910 Everything was renovated, new, modern and clean. The only drawback was that the rooms were very small, but somehow they managed to fit everything you needed in the room! 
29911 Recently stayed at the Lyden Gardens. I've stayed in many different hotels in NYC and wanted to try something more "boutiquey" this time. The rooms were very roomy and the room on the 1st floor had a cute patio with a table and chairs! Will stay there again. 
29912 This is a nice property, with wonderfully large rooms, especially for New York. The bed was comfortable and the staff was very accommodating. The breakfast was simple (coffee and pastry), but tasty. It was good for my business purposes and near to everything that midtown New York has to offer. 
29913 In New York for business and in classic W style, excellent service, affordable price, stylish company. 
29914 The Grace is just a block from Times Square and decorated straight from an Austin Powers movie! Good sized rooms for the price with an incredible breakfast. The wi-fi was free, but was so busy I couldn't do anything after I connected. I would, absolutely, stay here again. 
29915 Free Parking in Chicago,this in itself is a rare.Great location,very clean rooms,a staff that was very nice and cares.Attractive rates,close to everything.Do not let the outside appearance fool you,I would not hesitate in staying here again. 
29916 Poor hotel, not worth the price. Small rooms, unprofessional front desk staff. When I sent a complant to the hotel over a month ago they did not respond. 
29917 Rooms are nice and relaxing, staff very helpful, breakfast really good (mostly fresh fruit). The bars and restaurants surrounding the Sorella make planning your evening very easy. 
29918 Great location Large room Pleasant staff Would stay here again for a break in New York Great place 
29919 Absolute stunning luxury, great staff, spotlessly clean, everything you could want 
29920 The location is excellent and the lobby is beautiful. The room/bathroom, however, are tiny. Maybe that's why there is no coffee in the room, simply no space?! But that dies not explain why we didn't get soap either... 
29921 Hotel did not provide a room with a King size bed as requested and was unconcerned with their failure to honor reservations. Place shows wear, is dusty and dirty. 
29922 Despite all of the negative reviews I have nothing but good to say about this hotel. The rate was reasonable compared to most others in Downtown. Rooms were clean, staff friendly and it was within walking distance of all of the major musems and the L. We would stay again 
29923 Wow.....what an amazing stay. Not only the food-but the service. The bedrooms are beautiful, clean, modern, and elegant aswell. I just can't wait to go back. Something else that's great about indigo ny is the fact that the prices are well chosen. Overall, can't wait to go back:) 
29924 Charged up to $20/night to use internet. Telephone in room not working. Chair broken. 
29925 This was a nice Hilton Garden Inn at the north end of Tribeca. The room was good size for New York and up-to-date. Would stay again. 
29926 I stayed here for a week last summer. Front desk was fantastic; Sunday brunch was fantastic: room was very good; maid service good; Concierge desk was clueless on how to do their job; front doorman was a crook. 
29927 Worst hotel I have ever stayed in... by far. The bedroom and the bathroom were filthy. Felt disgusted just putting my head on the pillow. Was in New York for 5 nights, left this hotel after the first. Horrible, horrible, horrible. 
29928 Edisin hotel in New York, ligt 20 meter van Times Square en 200 meter metro station. ideale ligging voor mensen die de bekende bezienswaardigheden willen zien in New York; statue of liberty, empire state building, times square, Brooklyn Bridge enz 
29929 Andy E, Mandy, Tina, Dimples, Jackie were outstanding!!! And also awesomesauce! I have stayed here tons and the staff is fantastic....super nice and accommodating!!!! Lets not forgot the GM Sid...he's great. 
29930 Stayed here for the Chocago Marathon! Check in was smooth and they had my room ready before 3pm! Wasn't expecting that! Then morning of the race I had a note under door saying my checkout had changed from noon to 4pm!!! I was so excited!!! They definitely know customer service!! 
29931 Room was small and infected with bed bugs. I would not stay here again! 
29932 The staff was soooo helpful! I am booking my next stay now! 
29933 Bad location, 10 minute walk from nearest subway station. Paper thin walls. I could hear the people talking next door! Rooms were clean. Much better to stay futher out in a hotel beside a subway. 
29934 Perfect location, close to everything and just a step to Michigan Ave. Very nice rooms, fair price considering the good standard. Everything about our stay was wonderful - the room was clean and quiet, mostly the staff was friendly and helpful. We can't wait to go back again. 
29935 For the money you won't beat the W Hotel on Lake Shore Drive in Chicago. Very comfortable and clean sleeping rooms complement the upscale feel of the lobby. Don't worry about the window between the men's and women's restrooms on the ground floor. It's not as racy as it sounds. 
29936 We were in NY at Park Central for two nights. It seems that our room was booked dubbel. Sean helped us very quickly to find a another room and was very friendly. The location is perfect: between TimeQuare and Central Park. 
29937 The Club Quarters at E. Wacker was great. Free wifi and in-room coffee was greatly appreciated. Price and location were OUTSTANDING!! 
29938 eccellente hotel nel cuore di manatthan, ad un isolato dalla quinta strada e dal rockfeller center, camere spaziose e lussuose, servizio impeccabile, vista spettacolare. 
29939 This grand hotel has great history in New York City and had hosted many past and present high profile figures. The location was great and the staff were very friendly and helpful 
29940 this is a smaller, lowere=rise hotel with great staff and great service. Teh rooms are small and the place is somewhat expensive for NY, but they usually have deals at reasonable prices. Great location. 
29941 Without going into great detail, I will have to say that we couldn't check out quick enough. I was very happy that I could pull up Tripadvisor.com on my IPhone to find a nearby hotel so that my husband could walk to his meetings at the Roosevelt. 
29942 Very nice design-hotel. rooms are quite small but location is great for restaurants, bars, museums, galleries, shopping.. even breakfast is included - a small but good and healthy breakfast buffet. very friendly and helpful staff. the only thing I did not like: the dirty breakfast tables. I recommend this hotel! 
29943 We stayed for a week and have no complaints. Hotel was beautiful, comfortable and close to Times Square, Theatre District, Subways and even walking distance to Central Park. Staff was excellent. 
29944 no problem checking in and checing out overall not bad 
29945 Cold showers every morning. Enough said? Terrible room service. Shampoo and amenities never replaced in bathroom. Noisy. It's crappy $20 a night motel service for $300+ a night. The cold showers was the killer. Come on. A nightmare. They should be ashamed to call themselves a hotel. 
29946 Spent 4 nights at the Novotel 18 - 21st Dec 2004. Location is excellent close to Times Square. Room was clean and comforatable and staff were very helpful. Would stay here again. 
29947 Hotel confortevole, pulito e con personale disponile. Strafrequentato dato il cocktail bar interno. Attraverso la prenotazione in internet, costo della camera vantaggioso. Hotel che normalmente cambia la tariffa della doppia a secondo del giorno della settimana. 
29948 After several stays this place is the tops. The rooms are nice, the staff helpful and the location great. The other plus point is a nice breakfast with plenty of original and healthy options. 
29949 This is truly a great hotel. Comfortable with clean and beautiful rooms. A great hot shower with lots of water pressure. Imagine, they give you TEN different types of pillow choices! Concierge was helpful. The room was very large considering what we paid. I won't stay anywhere else. 
29950 Just returned from a stay at the Marriott Marquis in Time Square. Awesome views from just about any window. Staff are very pleasant. The fitness center was great. Just a little bit nerve wracking working out in front of the windows on the 28th floor. 
29951 This was a fairly clean moderately priced hotel for NYC, very small rooms but adequate. The staff was friendly and helpful and the free breakfast was very good. Location was within walking distance to convention center and Times Square, etc. We took the subway once but walked everywhere else. 
29952 Location, location, location plus great service. Will say in this hotel for my frquent NYC visits 
29953 Beautiful location great service, very friendly front desk agent (Anna Maria). All-in-all. -----> very recommended. 
29954 Within 10min walking distance from Times Square / Broadway and most other attractions. Lovely hotel, but very expensive bar! Our room was small but ideal for a short break. 
29955 This hotel is superb value. Every day at 5:30pm we were greeted by an all-you-can-eat supply of Hot Dogs and Cheesy Mac. What more could one want? Free breakfast, free parking, free long-distance calls, great pool and gym... no need to consider anywhere else! 
29956 Rooms are roomy and the beds are fantastic. We stayed 4 nights and enjoyed every minute of it. Location is in the middle of Times Square. No pool. No free wi-fi in rooms, only in lobby. Fine lobby with Starbucks coffe shop. Will come back. 
29957 Great hotel. Fantastic location. Service was very helpful. Enjoyed the gym and spa. One of the best hotel that I stayed in NY. Stayed there just before the hurricane sandy. Best hotel with NY Palace that I stayed in NY. 
29958 Stayed there because of close proximity to Foxwood Theater. The staff was great, they have valet parking and could not have been more accommodating. I was a little nervous about noise level since we were right in Times Square but it was a quiet night. Would absolutely stay there again. 
29959 This is NOT a five star hotel, with that in mind, it has a great location, close restaurants, clean pool, clean rooms with VERY comfortable beds & pillows. I loved the Texas shaped belgian waffles, fresh fruit and oatmeal breakfasts. Perfect for a business trip. 
29960 The Dylan hotel is a small jewel tucked in near New York library. It is a central location and near Bryant park, great restaurants and the hotel is clean,quiet and great for an overnighter! 
29961 Me encanta este hotel ,la atencion es excelente ,habitaciones amplias y limpias, buena ubicacion. Me gustaria que ya incluyeran wi -fi conection y seria fantastico. Aun asi excelente hotel. 
29962 This is a hidden gem llocated on the 8th Ave subway line away from the crowds of Times Square. The rooms are small but well planned. Because the hotel is small, it feels more personal, and the staff is friendly. Good restaurants are close by. 
29963 Great location. Reasonable sized and comfortable room with good en suite facility. Breakfast restaurant is nothing special. Free wifi only accessible in public foyer rather than rooms. Reasonable cost and good value. Probably would use again. 
29964 Pretty little hotel in the middle of Houston Downtown. Very close to theaters, bars, nightlife. Service was just amazing, lovely people! Room was actually quite big, clean and had a good working air-con (important in June!). No mini-bar though :( 
29965 Dit is een groot hotel, maar het is niet anoniem, je voelt je er thuis, en veilig. Aardig personeel. Top is het zwembad, met kleine sauna erbij (dames en heren apart), al zou dat wel wat renivatie kunnen gebruiken. 
29966 Comfortable, clean and close to everything Times Square. Terrific lobby staff, especially Charles and Rob!! Definitely will return 
29967 It is in a nice location, very close to millenium park. Hotel is good, clean and value for money. Its ideal for business travellers looking for affordable night-stay close to Chicago downtown 
29968 Some rooms face the EL tracks and are extremely loud but the hotel warns against that as well. The place looks however tired, bathrooms need some LCR. Breakfast is minimalistic. Staff friendly. Although directly next to the train stop, the location is a bit offish and the street shady. 
29969 Gross...only thing good is the location. Everything else sucked. MOld on the walls, rooms small, 1/2 hr to check into the place. Huge dissappointment, don't stay. Trying to get my money back! 
29970 We stayed at the Park Central for 3 nights. Clean room, not overly spacious, but worked for our needs. Very close to everything. Pleasant stay. 
29971 If you're in town for business and nothing else this will do but that's it. Large room so that's a plus. Hotel is pretty much on the highway so that isn't too good and area kind of sucks. Nothing there. Maybe that's just Houston though. Not sure. 
29972 This was my second visit to this hotel. The hotel was selected by my office because of its proximity to our New York office. The hotel is very expensive and does not have too many facilities. given an option I would have preferred to stay somewhere else. 
29973 5 star quality in everything! Excellent service, great rooms, great place to stay for special occasions. 
29974 Fantastic location-- steps from Times Square, but a quiet, high-class oasis once you are inside the door. Warm, welcoming, helpful staff. Comfortable 24-hour common area/lounge. Exquisitely clean and well-kept. Very European feel. Our second stay in an HK Hotel in NYC. Great chain. 
29975 I've stayed here a few times for business (my company's office is right around the corner). The location is pretty good, the staff is always fairly nice, and the rooms are decent. It's a few blocks walk from some of the popular NYC tourist attractions. 
29976 Enjoyed a recent stay at Sofitel. Hotel has style and the staff was superb. Would return in a heartbeat. 
29977 Great location if you are going to Johnson Space Center. Facility is dated and in need of renovation. The only soda machine did not work. The staff was very friendly. Overall an good experience. 
29978 Stayed at the St. Regis for 5 days in late April with a group of girls. We had a two bedroom suite shared between 4 of us. It is a beautiful hotel in a great location. 
29979 We had stayed here when we had to take our son to the Children's Hospital, the hotel is beautiful, the rooms are spacious and the view is top notch. 
29980 This is my second stay at the beautiful Palmer House Hilton. The hotel is glamorous and the lobby is unbelievably gorgeous. The rooms are very spacious, beds comfortable. I would highly recommend a stay here. If you dont stay, at least treat yourself to a drink at the lobby bar!! 
29981 Central location. Calm and quiet. Helpful, courteous, knowledgeable personell. Clean room, very well appointed. Very comfortable bed. Loved every minute 
29982 A charming quiet hotel with friendly chatty staff. Not on a main street but easy to find and close to subways. Lovely decor and feels classy whilst not expensive. Loved the muffins for breakfast. Not great on facilities (no bar, restaurant etc) but not needed plenty close by. 
29983 Beautiful building, excellent location, corridors look tired, rooms are small but effective 
29984 Great location and staff very helpful. I was happy with my stay at Yotel and i will stay there again. Close to every good places in NYC 
29985 I liked in stay here. The room is really short but remember: you are at ny!! The price is good, you have a free continental breakfast and you are so close to Macys, Empire state and others attractions! I payed U$140 dollars for 4 people with breakfast! Its amazing.. 
29986 Clueless staff, management M.I.A. Office services unavailable when office is locked. Don't bother trying to reach management by phone or email after the fact to politely complain. You'll get no answer, no acknowledgement, no signs of life at all. Light's on, nobody's home. Never again. 
29987 Wir waren zuerst in einem anderen Hotel in New York, welches wirklich schlimm war. So haben wir uns kurzerhand entschieden zu wechseln. Im Alex kamen wir voll auf unsere Kosten. Super Service, geniales Zimmer, gratis Internet, gute Lage, niedliche Bar! Alles in Allem SUPER! 
29988 Have stayed here several times when in NYC. Rooms are small but comfortable. Staff is professional and very friendly and helpful. Breakfast is included .This hotel is located very close to NYU and wonderful restaurants and shops. 
29989 Staff was very friendly. For the price,we were satisfied. Hotel is very beautiful Rooms are very old, but it seems to grow on you. We stayed for 4 days.No major complaints. Great location and price. 
29990 During the super-storm Sandy they were very accommodating. I would go make and recommend to others. very friendly nice staff. rooms were clean and nice. great location. a bit away from the east side tunnels and bridges but still good. 
29991 Stayed in a corner room on the 19th floor -- wonderful view. Nice boutique hotel, great location, close to the subway. No pool or spa. Good value for money, would stay there again. 
29992 The Place is good but the Hotel is terrible....old, 
29993 Very cool hotel -- loved the chic trendy look of everything, and it was extremely comfortable as well. (VERY hot during our stay, but our room was perfectly air conditioned.) Great for an overnight stay in the city -- no complaints. 
29994 For the price i would expect more but friendly staff. not too great cleaning rooms! 
29995 Our room was what the doctor ordered. The bed was great too relax in. The sounds of NYC were outside. We enjoyed our time at The Surrey even for a short vist, but worth the trip. 
29996 I found the employees of the Westin very helpful. We arrived early for a wedding and wanted to see part of the city. They gave us helpful tips and directions to things we would want to see and how best to get around! 
29997 The hotel is nice. Clean rooms, perfect location. Especially I would like to praise the work of the guest relations manager, Ricardo Alvarez. He helped us a lot when we were checking in and was nice and cooperative and did his best. In other words he is a total pro. 
29998 Great location in Chicago--right on the river front. Our room #2124 had a GREAT view of the river front and Navy Pier. This is a huge hotel, but attention to personal details is not lost. Very friendly and accommodating staff. 
29999 Nice hotel, nice location, THANKGOD NO BEDBUGS. I was so happy to find out that THIS hotel did NOT have any bedbugs. CLEAN, AND FRIENDLY HOTEL. I loved the room decorations and the lobby. The staff was so nice and the hotel just amazing 
30000 stayed overnight - quiet, clean, great food, great staff, great room 
30001 Excellent location, clean, friendly staff--not a luxury place by any stretch, but a very good value. Better than expected exercise room. Free WIFI. No free breakfast, but Starbucks less than a block away. Room size pretty good for NYC 
30002 Rooms were small. Price was high. A very average conference type big hotel. But the service at the concierge and travel desks were excellent. Location was perfect too. 
30003 A warm welcome, great room, incredible service and excellent location... Central Park just a few minutes away, what else? 
30004 Our family and friends gathered at the Blue Moon while in NYC for a wedding in March. The staff were friendly, the rooms were charming; we had a lovely experience. Thanks, Blue Moon, for helping make a special celebration even more special. 
30005 Read some of your reviews before chosing the Whitehall. Like anything else they ranged from excellent to poor. We were favorably impressed. Location excellent. Desk and maid service excellent. Hotel staff, including Concerige excellent. We certainly found out stay to be comfortable and enjoyable. 
30006 very generous room size, especially by NYC standards. comfortable, nicely appointed room. Traveled with two teens and a six year old, so suite was needed. would have liked more storage space, especially hanging space in closet. Requests for extra blanket and different hairdryer were slow, but otherwise a great stay. 
30007 Hotel located close to Times square, broadway shows and great restaurants yet far enough away to experience attractions on the Hudson. Staff is exceptionally nice and attentive. Clean rooms, very comfortable. 
30008 Location was great, but service was not. Asked for a wake up call, which never arrived and caused me to miss my bus to Boston. Hallways felt cramped and how can a hotel in New York City not carry CNBC on their televisions? 
30009 Really a nice value and very personable staff. Beds were very comfortable, really good shower heads, good breakfast, enjoyed the nightly reception and cookies. 
30010 Rooms were about $250 a night and within walking distance of Times Square (about 2 blocks), Grand Central, Broadway, and the Rockefeller center. Lots of food nearby (several Brazil restaurants next door). Rooms were clean and breakfast was very basic, but free. I'd stay here again. 
30011 HOTEL BEACON is a great place to stay in NYC.very close to times square.great shopping near by.close to central park.close to subway,easy to use.close to entertainment.very clean and comfortable.would go back anytime.enjoyed it.it was nice to call home in nyc. 
30012 This was a good hotel but the rooms felt old and a bit claustrophobic. On the plus side the bed was very comfortable and the service was excellent. We got this hotel on priceline and paid 170. We would not have been happy if we paid the full price. 
30013 Very close to the airport yet very quiet. Friendly staff and decent breakfast. Comfortable beds and free wi-fi. Lots of parking. 
30014 My wife and I stayed at The London to see a concert at Radio City Music Hall. The hotel staff went out of thier way to accomidate my wife and I while in town. We were just a regular couple but they took care of us like we were royalty.. 
30015 --Value for money --All the happening places close by --Subway in 2 mins walk --great staff Loved it....recommend to all the people who want to stay in midtown....budget yet very comfortable hotel 
30016 Best location in New York City. Right near St. Patricks, RockafellowCenter and many good restaurants. Theatre is a short walk. We'll be back this year. 
30017 Beautiful hotel from the outside, and inside the lobby. Had a late check in and there were no cookies! Bed was incredibly hard and uncomfortable, not what I expected of a doubletree. Nice balcony in the room. Parking was a bit expensive. 
30018 As much as possible I don't like giving bad reviews but I have to share what I have to share.The room is very small. I have stayed on other NY hotels but this is just very small. The bathroom was very dusty. 
30019 The room was beautiful. The lobby and breakfast room too small because of the pool. Friendly service. 
30020 This was our 2nd stay at this hotel. Great location, quiet rooms (small, but efficient), quick check-in and check-out and free bottled water on every other floor. Nice delis on either side of the hotel for breakfast/lunch. 
30021 Even if downtown New York, I was expecting to find a room a little bit bigger than one in hostels. Not cheap either (maybe for Chealsea NY). Good location though. 
30022 Very convenient area of mid-town. The hotel is well managed, comfortable and nicely decorated. It was a reasonable value. Front desk was helpful in recommending dining options. We even left our window open all night (3 nites). Little street noise. We would return. 
30023 The location was wonderful! The room was clean and quite large even if the wash-basin was unconfortable because it was really small. Only a lift worked but we didn't have any problem. Breakfast was included in the price and it was great! 
30024 I must have better luck than the other reviews, great service at Fannins! and even helped me with my allergy to the pillows, overall great, but specially if you are going to the medical center, everything is close, walking distance in the hospital. 
30025 it was my first time in new york. it was a while ago but I remember really liking it. the views were wonderful, the staff was wonderful, and the rooms were wonderful as well. Played a large role in my trip to New York and was very good. 
30026 Well appointed room, fantastic restaurant, great staff. Perfect location mid- town east. 
30027 We reserved a Suite with a King size bed and they only had a Queen size! Call the concierge for a restaurant recommendation and they never got back to us! 
30028 Great hotel. Convenient location. Enjoyed the wine social hour from 4:30 to 5:30. Supurb in all respects. 
30029 Very nice hotel. Staff was very friendly. Thank goodness for ear plugs, because you are above the subway. You might ask for a higher floor. The breakfast they provide is also good and very filling. 
30030 We loved the hotel and the location. The room was large and clean but really, the best thing is the location. Central to everything and two doors down is an amazing italian restaurant with coal fired pizza. Delicious! We'd happily stay here again. 
30031 The hotel had an excellent location next to the Chicago River and near the Navy Pier. The rooms were extremely clean but slightoly small. They had an oriental motif and the staff was excellent. I was only there one night but I would go again. 
30032 After a recent lackluster stay at the Waldorf, I didn't have high expectations for the Towers. Overall a wonderful experience. Comfortable bed. Spacious room. Lovely experience. Of course, the location is ideal for sightseeing. Downside: crowded breakfast in the lounge and executive lounge does not have convenient hours. 
30033 The room was very small and in front of the window was a scaffolding The service at the reception was sometimes very unfriendly The price was good for just having a bed to sleep in the middle of Manhattan 
30034 It was a bit difficult to find the Hotel at first, but once found, it was a really nice place to stay at. Was very central to everything,reasonably priced & clean. The rooms are cosy & the staff are nice. Overall, a really nice place to stay at ^_^ 
30035 After 4 weeks of travelling it ws great to stay in homely hotel. Could walk everywhere. 
30036 I recently stayed at this hotel for New Year's Eve - it was beautiful and historical and we had an amazing view of the cathedral from our room! The location was excellent and we had great service (and conversation) from Alberto! Very happy with the experience! 
30037 Un hotel muy centrico,acogedor,limpio,seguro,muy bien comunicado,cambio de sabanas diario y toallas,el gimnasio muy bueno,se accede sin cargo. 
30038 Great location, clean, modern facility, smallish but comfortable. The concierge staff was professional and helpful, with great recommendations for "real" New York restaurants not tourist. Traps. Did not try the restaurant in the hotel. 
30039 The hotel was just okay. Lacking in amenities. Clean enough. Reasonably priced and overrun with tourists....not a good hotel for a business traveler. No true business center, although there was a small one where you could print out a boarding pass or quickly check email. Convenient to Penn Station. 
30040 It's not fancy, but it's clean, the location is great, and the service is really good. Vicki, who checked us in, went out of her way to accommodate our requests. She is really terrific and we'll definitely be back. 
30041 My stay at the W New York on Lexington was perfect. The rooms were nice, the hotel staff was friendly and welcoming and the service was amazing. Jolene Koepp was hands down the move fabulous person to work with on a room reservation. 
30042 One of the best in NY.This hotel has all the elements that a good boutique hotel should have, I was extremely impressed and will make this my base in NY. 
30043 Stayed in this hotel for one week. The room was exquisite, the bed was really nice, the TV was great and the bathroom was very spacious and well-lit. The hotel itself looks like a great choice for couples visiting chicago. 
30044 Had a great stay here. Very cool place. Highly recommended. 
30045 From our arrival to departure couldn't have been better. Thank you to Sharee Hines and Kirk for this super stay. Jim/Joan R 
30046 Great location. Next to grand central. This only thing I didnt like is that they didnt have enough veggie options on their rm service menu. they didnt even have rice!!1 
30047 This used to be our favorite. Location is still great but rooms have slipped,elevators don't always work and the feeling of a luxury hotel is gone. 
30048 Fantastic hotel. Great rooms, great beds. Can't beat the location. Would stay there again for sure. 
30049 We really liked this hotel -- fantastic location, cozy and clean room, exceptionally friendly front desk staff, and very good price. Would definitely stay there again. 
30050 I was there in Nov 2010 for my brothers bachelor party. There were 6 guys staying together, and the 2 bedroom suite was awesome! Bed was great. slept like a log. HIGHLY recommend to anyone that wants an apartment style accomodation while staying in new york. 
30051 Great views in SoHo, excellent roof top bar/pool. Near a metro line, many restaurants and bars near by. When you stay here, bring out your designer labels. 
30052 hotel bem legal com custo razoavel, com otima localizacao, bem moderno e legal para a turma jovem 
30053 The location was wonderful. We walked to all the shops on 5th Avenue, Times Square and many restaurants and bars. I think the rooms are larger than most in NYC. We had the two room suite and had 4 people. 
30054 Awesome. From start to finish. Excellent service, clean rooms, & an extremely helpful staff. Already planning our next trip! Thanks again for a great stay : ) 
30055 Returning from a weekend with boyfriend, and we think this is more of a 3.5 star hotel. Large room, lots of closet space, sitting area. Great value. Only complaint is the heater made this loud, annoying sound every 20 min or so. Not too good for a light sleeper! 
30056 direkt am times square. zimmer klein, aber sauber. renoviert. super freundlich. 
30057 My favorite spot in NY. The Hotel is fantastic, but the rooms are a bit small. 
30058 Lovely hotel in a great location. Easy check in and out. Excellent staff, very accomodating. 
30059 Stayed in W Times Square last month and will never try to find any other hotel next time when travelling to NY. Just superb. The bonus comes with your special treatment in the club. 
30060 This hotel was in a good location, just a few blocks up from Times Square, close to transport, restaurants and attractions. The room was comfortable and serviced daily. The air-con unit coped relatively well with the heat but was quite noisy at night. 
30061 This is a very nice business option in downtown Chicago. The staff was excedingly helpful and the property was updated very well. We were upgraded to a suite overlooking the river and it was beautiful. The location made it possible to walk to Miracle Mile shopping and restaurants. 
30062 the location was perfect, walking distance from Penn station.the room was fully equiped with everything we needed, and the room was very quiet. the customer service was exceptional! it was very welcoming plus several bonuses we have received. the breakfast was fresh and lovely. it was above our expectations. 
30063 It needs an urgent remodeling the rooms smell bad carpets are old and the price is high not a real good values 
30064 Spent a month at the Pierre, the staff was so friendly and accommodating to my every need. The room was spacious and plush with wonderful views and state of the art electronics. Wonderful stay. 
30065 This hotel met every expectation and beyond! Great property, with an amazing rooftop bar! The staff is very friendly and the hotel is very clean. Great neighborhood and walking distance to so many attractions and local hangouts. Love this hotel and plan to return very soon! 
30066 Was somewhat dissappointed with the hotel given some of the excellent reviews on this site. Small room with no room to manouvre due to extra bed. Clean, quiet and very well situated. 
30067 Good hotel with a decent hot breakfast that is close to the Medical Center in Houston. 
30068 The primary advantages of this hotel are the location and price. The room was sufficiently clean, comfortable and without bedbugs. On the whole, though, the Milford Plaza remains on the old side. It's the sort of place you go to sleep at night, not spend your day. 
30069 I loved the room...I loved all of it. Parking was steep, but that's Chicago and we got a deal on the room so who cares. A walk or cab away from everything. Great service. 
30070 Rooms were very large and clean. Room was quiet. Beds comfortable. Check in was quick and smooth. Location was close to great shopping & to Times Square and Theatre District. Starbucks located on the first floor.Pleasantly surprised! 
30071 We were very pleased with the Allerton. Our room was one of the larger ones with a large king bed. The location, being on the Magnificent Mile, is ideal. No need to rent a car, public transit is very near the hotel. We will be back! 
30072 A smaller and perhaps as a result more welcoming and personal Houston hotel. Towards the north of downtown where the better bars and restaurants are. Only downside is no pool. 
30073 has great service luxurious views and the statue of liberty and you can have four tourist attractions and you will have 50% off each one of your tourist attractions and they have good clubs like club blue blue 
30074 But this hotel exceeded all of my expectations! It is modern, up to date, clean, and the staff is fantastic! Would definitely stay here again and plan to any time I am back in Chicago. You won't be disappointed! 
30075 Affinia Manhattan was a great selection for a girls trip. The location was great, the room was keep very clean and all service represenatives were terrrific. The front desk went over and beyond to accomadate any request we had. I highly recommend this hotel for the price and location. 
30076 Relaxed, friendly, helpful staff were remarkable. I am in wheelchair and at no point was there any inconvenience resulting from it. Room was excellent, food at attached diner was great but staff and unbeatable location are primary reason we will return. Executive Room had more than enough space. 
30077 Clean, comfortable mattress, friendly staff, and steps from the subway. 
30078 I recommand this hotel to everybody. We will be visiting New York again, perhaps next year. I can't wait to book our room in the Gansevoort again. Top hotel ! 
30079 Small kitchenette, comfortable bed. The room was very clean and the location couldn't be beat. Price was lower than most. 
30080 Terrific new Kimpton, rooms have great wall to ceiling windows, good size for NYC, lobby is happening if not a bit loud, not the most convenient location, but good value for the dollar. 
30081 Absolutely nothing wrong with this hotel, its staff, location, and the price. A total bargain when you compare, especially with its own kitchenette! Loved it!! 
30082 O hotel eh de 1926 e foi totalmente reformado na decada de 80, eh muito bem localizado, na frente do maior parque da cidade de Chicago. Tem 1.500 quartos muito aconchegantes e grandes, proporcionando muito conforto. O cafe da manha poderia ser melhor, mas tem boas opcoes. Exclente custo beneficio. 
30083 This place is beautiful, incredibly well-located. Staffed by friendly knowledgeable people. Service in all areas is impeccable. Lively night scene. GREAT bar. Best concierge service, (Chris Davolino) I've experienced. Helped us plan perfect restaurant outings and entertainment experiences. HIghly recommend! 
30084 We enjoyed very much the location and the beauty of this brand new hotel. The only thing I did not like very much was the internet speed. 
30085 This is a place to relax and have fun. Very exclusive and nice decoration. The staff is very professional. CLose to nice restaurants and lounges. Right in the middle of SOHO. Great for a weekend getaway with friends. Check out the mercer kitchen. 
30086 We had a petite corner non smoking room and it was awesome!!!! bathroom bigger than i expected and we even had a view of city which was great. Loved it!!! 
30087 I was afraid that there would be bed bugs, but luckily no. The room was terrible but I got used to it after a while. Great location but I won't come back to this hotel. Even though the room was terrible, it was far from cheap. 
30088 Had a great time staying at this little hotel. The rooms are cosy but clean. Very convenient location close to underground. Good value compared to other hotels in NYC 
30089 The room was devine, with a genuine European feel right in the middle of Times Square. You will not be disappointed! 
30090 The Pierre has beautiful suites and the most wonderful view of Central Park. This is a perfect hotel with such detail in hospitality excellence. The Le Carprice for lunch and Two E Lounge were also onsite and excellent. I'll keep coming back. 
30091 Reservations & email confirmations are both efficient and professional! (Booking for 2013!) Location: is the best! Newly designed rooms combine beauty, style and function ! Entire staff -friendly, courteous and helpful!.. 
30092 Always a classic. Even interior rooms have alot of natural light. Wonderful beds. Great upper east side location. Feels like home. 
30093 Easy access from times square and great views from rooms. We always stay here when we visit the big apple. The rooms are always clean and quite, its a nice place to park your things and go explore the city. 
30094 Good mid-range hotel with good location near the Galleria. But beware, it charges for parking. On weekends, no newspapers unless you want to buy the local paper. 
30095 Great hotel...great service, great room...well appointed, roomy, extremely comfortable, wonderful amenities (little kitchen, great desk to work and Aveda products in the bath) Made our stay in NY better than expected. Doormen were fabulous!! 
30096 The location of the hotel is very convinent for the first time visitors. Few blocks away 5th avenue and broadway. The rooms are clean but small versus Europe standards. Only non smoking rooms. Mini bar quite expensive. The staff is very helpful & genial. Recommended ! 
30097 The best part about this hotel was the spaciousness of the rooms, the memory beds and the biscuit/cookie that miraculouly appeared each night for supper. I would have preferred the bathroom to be a little more protected from outside viewing but a minor quibble. 
30098 Loved the hotel. Used to stay at one or another top hotel in NYC but will now become a regular here. Attentive staff, great location, love the food and the cabaret room. 
30099 Needed a quiet weekend away from my hectic life and Hotel Icon was the perfect choice. Loved the huge bathtub, comfy bed and decore. Very secure, service was exceptional! Great valet too, guys remembered my name 
30100 Breathtaking. Absolutely beautiful with astonishing service. $$$$ but worth it if you've got it. 
30101 We stayed at this Marriott over the Thanksgiving holiday and were very impressed. The front desk staff was courrteous and friendly, the rooms were comfortable and scrupulously clean. We've stayed at a wide variety of NYC hotels over the years and this one was the best by far. Highly recommended. 
30102 The Standard Hotel group is always a guarantee for a fun city stay. This hotel is in a great location in meatpacking district. It's fun, cool fashion crowd, has a good restaurant and bar. Great place to stay with friends for a short break. Great views from the rooms. 
30103 .i had read some of the reviews before we went over & we were greatly surprised how good everything was from the bedroom to the friendly staff.We will not thing twice of booking this hotel again when we return.Kevin De Largy Bangor N.Ireland 
30104 Was a great experience and the hotel was great, central and the view on 45 floor great. Clean room, breakfast and excellent time we stay in this hotel.. 
30105 This hotel is wonderful. THe rooms are great and staff is exceptional! Very friendly and helpful! We loved here and walked to most everything 
30106 Stayed for 1 week April 28 - May 5th. Hotel staff were friendly and helpful. Stayed in a 2 bedroom, which was a good value and much bigger than expected especially by New York City standards. Would recommend this hotel for families or larger groups. 
30107 For such a big and busy hotel right next to the airport it was difficult to fault this place. Staff were great, Room perfect and surprisingly no issue with plane noise. Had a pleasant time at the sports bar and breakfast the next morning could not be faulted. 
30108 Our room was clean, cool and comfortable during a blistering heat wave. Enthusiastic service from front desk and bell man. Just as good as during our previous stay 3 years ago. 
30109 Extremely clean property with a great location. Rooms are larger than many in the city. This hotel was updated recently and has shown continuous improvements thru the years. I was only here one night but will come back. Staff was nice, rooms well appointed. 
30110 Love this place. Comfortable rooms, good value for NYC. Nice breakfast. Location is perfect for Times Square and also Broadway shows. For the value, will definitely come back. 
30111 Great staff and nothing to complain about. Great hotel for nightlife and shopping 
30112 Great hotel, people wonderful 
30113 Rooms great -- an oasis in a big city. Felt like I was at the beach. 
30114 I stayed here for 8 nights on a recent business trip. The rooms were among the biggest I have stayed in in Manhattan. It had a full kitchen, plenty of closet and drawer space, and enough outlets for all my gadgets. Employees were helpful and friendly. No bedbugs! Highly recommended 
30115 From booking to check out this hotel exceeded my expectations. The views from our room were over the top. One of the best nights sleep away from home in years. I can not say enough good things about this facility. 
30116 Great little hotel in the city. Price was great and very close to Grand Central station. Room is pretty small, but they all are in NY 
30117 Great for Business Travel. Group accomodations made our stay easy and comfortable and helped us have a successful conference. 
30118 Checked into an old, worn out room with falling apart furniture. This should have been an out of order room. FD moved us to another room which was acceptable. FD agent could not have cared less. Location was great but did not make up for zero customer service. 
30119 The Swiss Hotel is wonderful. The rooms are awesome. Since it has a triangular shape, there are lots of corner rooms that are spacious and lovely. There was nothing we didn't like about this hotel. The staff, the location, the views, were great. we highly recommend this hotel. 
30120 This is my second time staying at Grand Hyatt in midtown Manhattan. The location is amazing - right above Grand Central. The room is nice enough. But I especially like the bed. It is so comfortable. 
30121 The Belvedere is really great. You come in and feel like home. All is very clean, calm and safe. We enjoyed the very good breakfast every morning. Our girls trip to New York was awesome! Thank you to the Belvedere, one day we'll come back!! Claudia Ritter 
30122 What a HOLE. The service stinks and so do the rooms. I recommend sleeping in your car. 
30123 Terrible service with expensive price! Bugs found on the bed!! The front desk is very rude! 
30124 The hotel has exceedingly good service. All the employees are friendly and professional, making your stay even more enjoyable. 
30125 Good service, very nice, kind assistance and take care the guest very good. 
30126 Was not expecting much from this hotel upon reservation. We were pleasantly surprised when we arrived. The rooms were spacious and clean, the staff was helpful, and the location was great. We will for sure stay here again. 
30127 Had a wonderful stay. The staff friendly and helpful. Rooms are comfortable and clean. Hotel is quite considering you are close to freeway. The breakfast is excellent. I would go back and stay at this hotel again. 
30128 OK, this is NY and hotels are expensive but in my opinion The Pierre is quite an average five star hotel. 
30129 This hotel was better than expected, looking at reviews. Old, but what do you expect, it's been there awhile. Lobby was amazing. 
30130 We were given a very friendly welcome when we arrived, shown to a spacious fresh and well furnished room. The views over New York were fantastic, the higher the better. The room was well stocked up with towels, toiletries and coffee making facilities. Staff were so helpful. 
30131 1/2 a block away from times square.. friendly doormen (brian) close to EVERYTHING 
30132 Over all not bad...long wait on old single elevators. Rooms are modest but who spends any time in there any way. Room was clean. I really liked the complimentary breakfast! Just an FYI if not into touristy attraction stay somewhere in Greenwhich. Very cool area with all the great restaurants. 
30133 This hotel is vastly overpriced for what it delivers, even by New York standards. The room was so small that I felt claustrophobic. The internet didn't work but I got charged for it anyway. 
30134 Unique and cool vibe to rooms, very nice, awesome lounge in the hotel open late. Perfect location. Excellent choice to stay at! 
30135 My daughter (age 20) and I travel to NYC for a girls weekend every summer. This was our first stay here but definitely will not be our last. You can't beat the price, the location, the service. Highly recommended! 
30136 Excellent, Manager (the one who checked me out on my departure, Sorry I do not recall his name). All around A+ all they way...will be back!!! 
30137 Absolutely the best place we have stayed in NYC. I will stay there again. Great location, wonderful service and some great history. It is right accross the street from the MoMa and central to many of the sights. The beds were outstanding. The breakfast buffet was even wonderful! 
30138 Stayed there for two nights Spring of 2002 and have reservations for another two nights in Spring 2003. Very clean, comfortable and extremely convenient. 
30139 Great location,around the corner from Times Square, walking distance to Central Park, theaters within waliking distance. Hotel staff was excellent, friendly and would take the time to chat, or answer any questions. Price was very good for its location.Rooms were very clean. 
30140 We checked in to the Intercontinental at nite time and it was wonderful our rooms were facing north and had the best beds Cava the restraurant down stairs is wonderful and the food is first class 
30141 ich hatte das penthouse im 9. Stock. Upgrade.... Mit balkon, aber ohne moebel? Ankleide dunkel, bett sehr gut, tv sehr gut, bad sehr sauber, alles sehr stylisch. Fruehstueck sehr ameikanisch. Eier, speck, filterkaffee, kellogs....preis 206usd. Insgesammt: ich komme gerne wieder! 
30142 Great location, loved the spot for business or play. Rooms typical New York and the service was great from one man in particular. I wish I got his name. Small India/Asian man with classes. Very nice man. I recommend this hotel. 
30143 A stunning hotel with everything you could wish for. We had a double aspect room with amazing lighting and views. The bar was buzzing at cocktail time and the restaurant was superb - ask for a kitchen tour if this interests you. 
30144 We stayed from 31aug-5sep. Nice room, clean and friendly-helpful stuff. Location: perfect!!! We will com again. 
30145 We stayed here for one night for my wifes birthday. It was a great little Manhattan hotel. The room was small, but very clean. The location was superb for our needs as we were going out for the night. Best of all, the staff were great. 
30146 the first to manhattan... prima di partire avevo letto alcune recensioni negative ...dalle quali mi dissocio assolutamente....buon albergo ,posizione strategica,colazioni buonissime ed abbondanti ,personale abbastanza disponibile, camera al 16 piano:pulita forse il bagno ....con una doccia dell anteguerra...!ma complessivamente un hotel da consigliare...! 
30147 Great location. The staff was helpful and the room was very nice. Walking distance to Grant Park, the Adler Planetarium, the Field Museum and the Shedd Aquarium. Great diner around the corner (Eleven City). 
30148 I was in Shoreham with my daughter recently. The hotel is in excellent location and tastefully decorated. Front dest people were very warm and helpful especially Debora and Laura (I don't know whether I spelled their name right). Highly recommended. Love to go back. 
30149 This hotel is right in the middle of everything but the rooms are quiet and relaxing. Great views of Times Square and super comfortable beds. 
30150 I was expecting a small room, and it was small, but the bed was a bit too short for me. The hotel was nice and modern, and clean, and the staff was helpful as well. 
30151 My husband and I love Starwood properties. Sheratons vary from hotel to hotel. The Brookhollow was one of the best experiences for a quick weekend stay in Houston. Loved the robe, complimentary water bottles, and quality overall. 
30152 stayed here 4 nights for business. was definitely gouged on price. doors were chipped, room was small and uninspiring. advertised marble bathroom- very disappointing. poor service. will not stay again 
30153 I was very curious about the hotel but I honestly do not intend to stay there again. I stayed in one of the largest rooms - not so big but ok. The view was a wall and the service was just right. 
30154 This is a very nice place to stay. Their stuff is very friendly and pleasant. Parking is very convenient. I would say this was by best experience in Houston! 
30155 The place is straight from the 60's. Elevators are tiny and it's hot at hell in the entire place. Customer service was absolutely horrendous and I would have rather slept on the streets or on the subway. Do NOT stay here. 
30156 Funky hotel, wonderful location in Lower East Side, quiet street just off Delancey. Fabulous price for NYC. Very friendly staff, delicious bagels for breakfast, old-fashioned rooms with modern bathrooms. Would definitely stay here again. 
30157 Neat little hotel in a great neighborhood; Seaport/Wall Street area. Well trained staff and excellent atmosphere. Hopping bar scene. Rooms very nicely done; one strange thing (guess it is an European thing) is no top sheet on the bed. Charge for Wi-Fi excessive; it should be free. 
30158 This hotel is very good value. We had a very comfortable stay in a quiet, clean room. Our single beds were good. Only slight niggle was the rather gloomy view to the fire escapes but would have no hesitation in recommending this hotel. 
30159 Buon ,hotel, stanze piccole ma pulite ed essenziali. nessun rumore dall'esterno. Punto di forza: la posizione meravigliosa a soli 50 mt da Times Square 
30160 The Majestic was a DEAL-the location to everything was fantastic and the staff were friendly and very outgoing. The only problem was that the floors groan a bit so bring earplugs if you are a light sleeper. I am planning on coming back. 
30161 The New Yorker Hotel was just a great place to stay our room was quiet and clean every day.The continental breakfasst on the 39th floor was a super way to start the day with one of the best views in NYC and the location of the hotel wa perfect. 
30162 Centraal gelegen en stijlvolle inrichting en kleinschalig wat voor New York een uitzondering is Zeer verzorgd ontbijt uitstekende service.kamers zijn latief groot naar New york standaard. Kamers kraak net. 
30163 Das Hotel kann eigentlich mit der Lage trumpfen. Die Zimmer sind mehr oder weniger schlicht gehalten, zum Teil etwas klein. Die Lage macht dieses Hotel wahrscheinlich attraktiv, da die Penselvania Station gleich nebenan ist. 
30164 Clean, charming rooms. Very friendly, helpful staff. Lovely weekend in a great part of town. Palatial Duane Reade drugstore/grocery across the street! 
30165 Stay On The Avenue 2-3 times a year. Great Hotel; great service and friendly, helpful staff.; great location in NY, close to all of NY'S major attractions and in a neighborhood that has everything - great restaurants, shopping, central park. They even now have a fitness center. 
30166 none of the days we stayed they cleaned the room, we had to ask for it everyday. breakfast is only a muffin and bad coffee. the only good thing is the free wifi from which i'm writing now. 
30167 Small room, no view from room, blocked by the walls n no air inflow , had to start a/c but it is toooo noisy, can't take breathe properly! It's very close to timesquare but if I can't sleep in the room no matter how close the all amenities, no recok. 
30168 I stayed there with a friend for 12 days and we liked it a lot. Clean, helpful staff, nice breakfast, very good price, great location. Everything you need in a big city. 
30169 einfaches , sauberes aber sehr zentral gelegen. Wenige minuten zum Times Square, Empire State Building um die ecke und visa vis vom Madison Square Garden inkl U-Bahn. alles sehr gut zu fuss erreichbar. 
30170 BELLO E COMODO. CONFORTEVOLE. OTTIMA LA POSIZIONE BEN COLLEGATO AL LOOP, ALLA STAZIONE METRO , LINEA DIRETTA CON APT DI CHICAGO. BUONI I DINTORNI, POSSIBILITA' DI MANGIARE CO NBUONA SCELTA. BELLA CHICAGO 
30171 Het hotel ligt op een zijstraat van Times Square en Broadway, ideaal voor het bezoeken van een theatershow of toneelstuk, daarna nog even een rondje te lopen over Times Square, te genieten van alle drukte die op je afkomt. 
30172 Had a great stay at this hotel. The staff (especially Kerman) were responsive to any request. The room was great and location very convenient. Will go back again. 
30173 BELLISSIMO, MODERNISSIMO, CAMERA VERAMENTE PICCOLA, SOPRATTUTTO IL BAGNO, MA ARREDAMENTO SUPER! QUASI QUASI VI CONSIGLIO LA CAMERA SENZA BAGNO VISTO CHE QUELLI IN CORRIDOIO SONO PULITI ED OTTIMALI, IN CAMERA TROVERETE ANCHE UN PICCOLO LAVANDINO! FATE UN SALTO SUL TETTO AL 14ESIMO PIANO! SUPER RELAX! CIAO, SIM1&SUPERVI 
30174 The Manhannten Club must go down as one of the best RCI resorts and we recommend anyone visiting NYC to stay at the Club. A truly great stay 
30175 posizione eccellente camere minuscole e per niente vivibili (con affaccio esterno degno di una prigione) assolutamente non giustificato il prezzo 
30176 Wwow i was on the 25 floor and the view was amazing just on top of time square!! And the room was so quiet... Product they give are so nice... Great hotel and exceptionnel location! A perfect way to discover N-Y. And staff are nice too! 
30177 Muy bien ubicado, habitaciones impecables, staff muy amable y siempre atento para ayudarte a conocer la ciudad. Si volvemos nos volveremos a quedar en este hotel. 
30178 What a great, chic hotel. I loved the spa suite. The room and bed were very comfortable, the furnishings and color scheme were quite cool, and the location directly in midtown between 5th and 6th Avenues was perfect. You couldn't ask for more centrally located! 
30179 Nice, clean rooms for good price. Location midtown Manhattan is perfect. 
30180 This was a wonderful experience. The staff was amazing and so helpful. The room was lovely and so comfortable. The hotel had everything I needed - there was no need to go any place else. I would go there again in a minute. 
30181 Reception were slow, hotel was very busy with airline staff. Room was very small for price and the only ones available were right outside the lifts which meant lots of noise from people passing by the door. Good location for the Empire State and Times Square though. 
30182 l emplacement bien metro en bas de l hotel chambre propre lit et menage fait tout les jours cafetiere et cafe dans les chambre un peu vieux mais propre bruyant mais ces es new york tres bon restaurant en bas de l hotel 
30183 Clean comfortable room with free internet access. Decent breakfast if eating area a little small. Short walk from CTA Addison stop and plenty of good eating spots in the vicinity 
30184 Cosy rooms, great location and very reasonably priced. I stayed for eight nights and slept well for every one of them. The rooms are small but perfectly sized for returning to after a day exploring the city. 
30185 The rooms were your average hotel room that were somewhat updated, ask for a river view room. Free wifi in the room! Great friendly staff. 
30186 Struttura situata sulla 26th tra la 7Av e la 6Av. A piedi si puo' raggiungere ogni angolo di Manhattan. Camere e bagno davvero molto puliti, personale molto discreto e gentile. Ci ritorneremo! 
30187 This hotel from the internet looks a lot nicer then it really is, and rooms were fairly nice, but service and restaurant food were horrible. I think that my sister and I paid 38.00 for cold eggs, toast and cereal that had some black mystery stuff in it. 
30188 Good Hotel, really helpful staff, Probably the best location in New York for site seeing in walking distance for many sites, Empire State, Madison Square Garden, Macy's, Times Square etc. Great value deli, turn left out of main reception (100 yds can't remember the name). 
30189 Really impressed with the overall quality of this hotel. Extremely helpful staff, clean and well furnished. Much nicer than other Sheratons in the area. Will continue to stay here when traveling to Houston. 
30190 Pleasant stay; the rooms are very small but the design of both rooms and common areas is original and refreshing. Very friendly staff. No problems at all. 
30191 Staff friendly and helpful. Great, great location. Great breakfast offering that comes with the room - coffee, lattes, and capuccinos with scones and croissaints - great to start the day. Elegant classical hotel. Would highly recommend this hotel. 
30192 Super value for money, great location, room were fine but dated, cleaned everyday, friendly staff, definitely stay there again. 
30193 Great location, clean, and excellent staff! This is my second stay at the hotel and I'd definitely stay there again. 
30194 Really nice friendly hotel in manhattan - we will definitely return In-house burger restaurant, however, is not worth the price, crowds etc. Sam's, just around the corner, is among the best Italian restaurants anywhere this side of the pond 
30195 The view and location were excellent and you couldn't ask for more friendly and accommodating staff, including at the Palm Restaurant in the lobby. Will definitely go back for the summer view! 
30196 Ottima localizzazione in Manhattan, vicino alla stazione centrale e a molti punti turistici. Hotel grazioso, pulito e ordinato. Camera grande con 2 letti singoli. Abbiamo avuto la sfortuna di dormire in una camera al 2 piano (primo piano per noi europei) e quindi parecchio disturbata dai rumori del traffico. 
30197 We decided to take a last minute trip to NYC! we were able to check in early! room - was designated as a smoking room- we don't smoke and it smells fine!!! staff fun and friendly! would def stay here again!!! 
30198 Great location. Great service. Ideal price considering in Manhantan. 
30199 My two sons and I visited NY between February 25 and March 3 2006. The people were very nice. The room spacious and clean. The location could not be better. 
30200 Beautiful hotel with all the amenities. Perfect location in midtown and close to many restaurants. Will absolutely stay again. 
30201 Nice hotel convenient to Penn station 
30202 The classic room furnishings, large rooms, high ceilings, excellent service with a friendly and smiling staff in a wonderful New York City location is a hard combination to beat. 
30203 Booked here at short notice because the price was right (for NYC). Very impressed with the quality of the room - which was a mini-suite. Will stay there next time. 
30204 The location of the hotel is perfect for a downtown hotel. The hotel was clean the staff was kind and room was very good. Tv and minibar was okay. A/C was properly working.And the view of room was very good. 
30205 The hotel is basic and standard. At check in, little stress because the rooms were not ready. It were ready after 4PM, after much insistence with the receptionist, who showed irritation and impatience. Rooms cleaned daily and beds very soft and first class sheets. 
30206 stayed at newyorker for 2 nights during my trip to NYC. Though location is good but the rooms were small and everything seems to be outdated , they need a upgrade forsure.. Rooms were small and Bathrooms were even smaller.... 
30207 It is more than 30 years I travell to New York. when I tried INDIGO, I was happy becaue finally I found my hotel in New york. reasonably priced, elegat rooms friendly staff and the great advantage! Location, close to every thing you need. 
30208 I have stayed at the Parker Meridian annually for the past 5 years. It is my NYC hotel of choice. It is chic, spotless and comfortable. The staff is friendly and efficient.The rooms are quiet, beautifully sleek and comfortable. Location is excellent.I would not stay anywhere else! 
30209 I stayed at the Novotel during the blackout of August 2003. The staff was wonderful. They handed out flashlights to everyone. The went over and above the call of duty. The hotel is beautiful. Rooms are roomy, clean and quiet. I will definitely stay here again. 
30210 We had reservations at the Chelsea Sheraton. Upon arrival, we were informed that our room was not available because the previous occupants didn't check out. What are reservations for? The staff was unprofessional in both attire and attitude. The rates were also high for a lobby that was a dump. 
30211 This hotel is in one of my favorite areas in NYC. Nice room, small, but not as bad as some NY hotel rooms. Comfy beds, and warm cookies at turn down service. I would definitely stay at the hotel again. 
30212 We were upgraded to a 2 bedroom suite. Room was fantastic. Great views even though we were only on the 6th floor. The kids were treated like royalty. It was a great weekend to celebrate our son's birthday. 
30213 The front desk staff and housekeeping staff were wonderful, they made sure my stay was the best, always polite and treated me like family. Loved the full sized fridge and stove top. 
30214 Everything went well and room was clean. No bedbugs found. Good location. If visiting on Sunday morning, make a left and enjoy the street market. It was a nice surprise. 
30215 Fourth or fifth stay at this hote. Just one night this time. Room was great on the 42nd floor with a beautiful view. Staff very friendly and very helpful. Looking forward to a longer visit next month. 
30216 O quarto e pequeno e o teto do banheiro estava despedacando. Muito feio. A empregada bateu tres vezes na porta desde as 830hs para entrar para limpar no dia que a gente ia sair. Muito pretensioso o lugar, mas tem gente que adora isso. 
30217 Stayed here Nov,2010 for five nights,loved the location 
30218 Hotel was nice and clean,staff very friendly,would go back 
30219 Stayed for a quick one-nighter at this hotel near Times Square. Expensive, but won't disappoint. Great lounge and breakfast area off the lobby ... good for informal meetings. Short walk to anywhere you need to go. 
30220 Loved our stay at Affinia Dumont! We were upgraded to a suite. Very spacious, clean room with comfortable beds. Extremely courteous and helpful staff. Great bargain for mid-town Manhattan. Would definitely recommend! 
30221 New, very modern hotel. Very comfortable room. Lots of very good resturants close by. Friendly staff. 
30222 This is a small, quiet, Boutique Hotel in the Galleria. Its within short walking distance to great shopping and restaurants. Room was very clean and guest services were on top of everything. I'll be back soon! 
30223 Modern hotel with nice front desk service. My only problem is they never were able to have my reservation ready beforehand - kind of annoying. But rooms are clean 
30224 This hotels is outstanding. The staff, room, bar, & restaurant all five star. Andaz gives new meaning to the word "boutique". For those that gave any negative reviews two words "stay home". 
30225 Crowne Plaza is an excellent option in Chicago. The rooms are large, nice and clean. The location is excellent, many malls and shop nearby. 
30226 Nice hotel, good location. Very friendly staff, storing luggage, etc. Great restaurants nearby. 
30227 The hotel was very clean and the staff very professional. The bed and bedding was quite comfortable, so it was a good night of sleep. The hotel is well located. 
30228 It was 94 degrees out when we arrived and the cool lobby and friendly welcome were much appreciated, the room was equally cool with quiet, efficient air con. Spotlessly clean, terrific bed, iPhone dock, free wifi, great bathroom. Everything we needed. Great location, excellent value. We'd stay again. 
30229 We stayed here for 3 nights and found the room to be very clean. The continental breakfast was really nice and the staff were very approachable and always on hand to help. The location was excellent. 
30230 We stayed at the Sofitel after reading the reviews on Tripadvisor, it is an excellent hotel in every way location is excellent, staff cant help you enough, rooms are beatifull and the beds are soo comfortable. 
30231 Nice and comfortable room. Great design. Excellent location. Excellent breakfast with New York Times included, which is a great idea. Helpfull team. 
30232 The hotel was very convenient to stay at as there was a full kitchen, which came in very handy during a long stay. The location is very good. People are very nice. 
30233 Took a long weekend to NYC from Philly and this was the perfect place to stay at a good price. The front desk staff was exceptionally helpful and contributed to a great experience. I will definitely be staying here next time I come back to NYC. 
30234 Very clean and modern. The staff are outstanding. Very helpful. Very keen to make your stay a good one. Great shuttle service as well. Good bar area and bar menu is good. There is also a daily healthy option. 
30235 The entrance is really nice, and that's all. Rooms are small, and dark. Hallways are dark too and look old and broken. I didn't like the bathrooms. This hotel needs an upgrade, it's super close to lots of attractions, but I don't have any desire to stay there again. 
30236 My wife and I stayed for the weekend and found this hotel well located, but many constructions surrounding the area makes it noisy day and night. Did not know was a long-stay hotel meaning our rooms were not done until we were out. 
30237 The hotel was lovely and I had a great view of the lake. My only issue with the hotel is it's slightly south of the loop. 
30238 Poor room standard - dated decor Management could do with customer relationship course. 
30239 The Benjamin is a wonderful hotel in midtown Manhattan. Nice, clean rooms with great bedding and bathrooms. Pillows are fantastic. Starbucks is right around the corner, as are severaly good local restaurants. Spa/workout facility is very nice as well. Great, centrally located, near-luxury hotel. 
30240 Very nice staff, clean room and walking distance to everything! 
30241 Siamo stati a New York per 10 giorni. Citta da sogno!!! E l'albergo era di un buon livello, camere dotate di ogni confort cucina frigorifero asse da stiro fero, letto poi enorme e confortevole dopo le girnate trascorse per le vie della Grande Mela!! 
30242 what a great hotel. close to battery park, seaport, WTC and other lower manhattan attractions, the hotel is clean, quiet and very nice. 
30243 Ottimo Hotel posizionato strategicamente, vicino a due linee fermate di metro, area ricca di vita, molto pulito ed economico se prenotato per tempo camere piccole ed essenziali, ottime per chi ci deve solo dormire (come tutti quelli che vogliono gustarsi new york) ci ritornerei subito. 
30244 It's heyday has passed. The rooms are aweful. And with NYC night temperatures hovering in the 30s, I had to call several times each night for heat. An abysmal experience for sure! You've been warned. 
30245 Ci siamo trovati molto bene, camera confortevole con piccolo cucinotto molto utile per la prima colazione, si vedeva l' empire dalla finestra: spettacolare! Grande gentilezza alla reception ci hanno organizzato varie gite.A un passo dall'empire e da times square. 
30246 This is a great hotel. I checked with them about specials and was able to buy one night and get one free. 
30247 It was a nice hotel and good front desk service upon check in. The room was small but nice with no view. lol Conveniently located in midtown close to entertainment, food, and transportation. All for a decent price. Would stay here again! 
30248 Beautiful, modern hotel. Everything is beautifully decorated, crisp, and clean. Ralhan was able to get me checked in early to an incredible room with 15 foot floor to ceiling windows and an extraordinary view of the NYC skyline. Nice location and just a short, easy walk away from Times Square. 
30249 I've stayed at this location before. It is convenient to the subway, Chinatown and the financial district. It has pleasant staff and is clean. But not being able to take a hot shower for two days in a row does not make for a pleasant stay. 
30250 I wish I had read the reviews before I stayed here. My experience at this hotel was horrible from the time we arrived until the time we left. There are plenty of hotels in this area, pick a different one for your stay. 
30251 great wee hotel in New York; staff brillant very helpful, breakfast good. good links too midtown midnight; subway 2 mins away - good resturants and pubs near by. also rooms good size and cleaned regularly - would defo recommend and would defo go back again 
30252 Beautiful rooms with great service! I loved the granite bathroom and products provided. This is a great change from the corporate environment of the large hotel chains I normally stay in. Try this hotel and you won't be disappointed. 
30253 Elegant hotel, perfect location. Room stylish, spacious, practical and very clean. Most of the staff were friendly and helpful, others (the minority) looked as if they didn't want to be there... but the whole New York experience made up for it all :) 
30254 awesome place to stay if you are on a budget. my wife and i stayed here and could not be more satisfied with the staff and location. it is close to many things in chicago nearby. 
30255 We hebben genoten van alle luxe die The New York Palace te bieden heeft. Niets is te veel voor het vriendelijke en deskundige personeel. Daarbij komt dat door de zeer centrale ligging van het hotel alle belangrijke bezienswaardigheden gemakkelijk te bereiken zijn. 
30256 Location is unbeatable. Staff were very accommodating. We stayed in a comfortable, modern 1 bedroom suite on upper floor with view of MSG. Will stay at the Affinia Manhattan when we return to NY on our next trip. 
30257 Great staff, great service, had a wonderful time. Loved the music that was played everywhere. Would like to see if I could buy more CDs ( Got the first one) We celebrated my daughters 21st birthday there. It was the best!!!!!!! We will be back. 
30258 Ottimo come posizione siete nel cuore della fantastica new york e poi voglio dire anche se l'hotel e' datato e non bellissimo se siete i tipi da una doccia e subito fuori a godersi la grande mela va benissimo ! 
30259 The hotel was great. This was my second stay at the Alden hotel and I enjoyed it just like the last. This is my new home in houston. 
30260 Nice hotel Excellent breakfast Old rooms Lack of proper closet annoying 
30261 Highly recommend the Irish or American breakfast at the Fitzpatrick. Beautiful cafe with excellent service. Excellent food, great tea. Wonderful experience. 
30262 The room had a lot to be desired. There were no areas designated to store clothes. There wasn't even a full closet for a dress. It was very dusty and the room had very poor lighting. I had to keep calling for towels, they would never replace them. 
30263 Great location, really kind service, good breakfast and clean bathroom, all that you need for have a good days in New York with a good price. 
30264 Stayed here recently for a girls weekend! It had great service, great location, and great staffing! We even for a free breakfast from a very courteous manager once he realized I was a Hilton Honors member! It was very close to awesome shopping, food, and sight! Would come back again! 
30265 el hotel esta bien ubicado cerca al central park y a media cuadra queda una estacion de metro,pero la atencion de los empleados es horrible no tienen idea de atender el turismo. no me parece que sea un hotel de cuatro estrellas. 
30266 I stayed in a single room and found the room to be just fine. The location is fabulous and compared to other hotels in the same few blocks, the price was unreal! A nice little find which I will use often until everyone discovers it and the prices spike! 
30267 We stayed in the Eastgate Tower for 7 nights in july 2012. The hotel itself is ideally placed for easy access to all that New York has to offer tourists. The hotel is a little old but very clean with very friendly, helpful staff. 
30268 Grand Hyatt; easy access to subway system.. The hotel is nice and clean, and.the staff is very helpful. It is a little pricey, but for the convience I found it to be well worth the price. 
30269 I stay here at least once a month for a due duligence meeting. They now have a room with my name on it. 
30270 If you're looking for a great hotel with awe inspiring views and old world charm - this is the one for you. It's location can't be any better - smack dab in the middle of Gotham City. Plus, it won't break the bank. 
30271 We were very satisfied with this hotel. Room was of good size (for NY), clean, well decorated. Location is superb. Highly recommend it if you plan to stay in Midtown. 
30272 I highly recommend this hotel if you want to be in a great spot on the west side. Walking distance to Chelsea market & meat packing district, the high line and union square. Rooms are small if more than 2 are staying 
30273 este hotel esta muy bien ubicado...a metros de donde se sacan las entradas para los teatros..esta puesto muy coqueto y la atencion es muy buena..muy buenos amenitys...el unico inconvenieinte es que las habitaciones son minimas...no hay donde guardar nada ni donde poner las valijas .. 
30274 Very good location near Union Square. Tiny but clean rooms, toilets/shower in the corridor which were usually free and clean. Good hotel if you want a central base for your midtown stay. 
30275 For 66$ king size bed Total price ttl.. Very clean Hotel 
30276 Com found the deal for me 
30277 Great boutique, stylish hotel in the heart of time square. Service is also great - everyone is very friendly. Love the H2O products. Bathrooms and rooms are clean. Free hot chocolate in the lobby with marshmellows! 
30278 Rooms are a shoe box, single beds, no fridge, rooms are dirty, Internet costs $15 a day (all other US hotels we have stayed at it has been free, they are doing renovations at the moment all for $300 a night. 
30279 The hotel offers huge suites, nice staff and fairly clean rooms. The hotel is somewhat old and the good things come at a price. 
30280 Stayed here three nights in August 2012. Very helpful and friendly staff. Room was clean and well appointed. Beds comfortable. Atrium concept is dramatic, but unnerving for sufferers of acrophobia! Speediest elevators I can recall. Good location, walked everywhere (except Wrigley -- took the subway/L). 
30281 Hotel is beautiful and the suite we had was terrific. The Raffaello allows you to request an upgrade to a Suite for a very reasonable charge based on availablility. Staff is attentive and our sleek bathroom had a huge rain shower and dramatic lighting. Intimate stay and good value ! 
30282 Loved the breakfast and the servers that served us were wonderful! Rooms and beds were comfortable. Maria Remerez, Issia Palencia, and Domongo Marfinez, were good to my family at breakfast each morning. Very wonderful breakfast staff! 
30283 It is very good value for money and in a very good location,no complaints, i could go again,it made my stay in NY very pleasant. 
30284 What more can I say? Excellent service, Couldn't do enough for us. Well located. Would highly recommend this hotel for couples, singles or business. Really great all rounder 
30285 It's the second time I stayed at On The Ave and once more the experience was great. The staff is always attentive and the standard room is excellent, no matter it wouldn't be large enough for a couple with kids. MCT 
30286 DO NOT STAY HERE! we woke up in the middle of night to a rat digging through our things. i wonder if they ever clean any of the furniture, sheets, comforter, or bathroom. 
30287 I was in Doubletree Times Square for a vacation with my son. We loved the location that was really amazing. The room was very big with all comforts but it needed some renovation. I would definitely recommend to a friend of mine. 
30288 Found the business centre outrageously expensive and very confusing. Hotel OK - view outstanding, but had trouble getting the limo service to pick me up as police just kept everything moving! Midtown probably would have been better! 
30289 The hotel is beautiful, and of course the lobby is wonderful. The rooms are good, clean, and service great. Most of all the location is perfect to see the sights of Chicago. Easy access to public transit. Loved it all. Chicago is beautiful. 
30290 I was very surprised about this place. I thought it was going to be really snobby, but instead I found the staff to be very friendly and accommodating. Of course as expected it was very luxurious 
30291 Location is also fantastic. Close to everyhting we wanted to visit. 
30292 Be careful about booking a double room...it will have one double bed.....the stay was nice...the hotel is in. Great location...I was double charged and had to be reimbursed...that stunk...over all an ok stay 
30293 Came here for a girls weekend and was really impressed. Room is clean and quiet. All the employees are very nice and helpful. We liked the free printing and the lobby lounge. The restaurant next store has a busy bar scene and looked good too. We will be back! 
30294 This was our first time in New York and will not be our last when we return we will stay at the Dream again we could not fault it, suggestion if you are elderly like us stay on the first four floors, as the high rooms are nearer the club. 
30295 Sofitel is a wonderful luxury hotel in Manhattan within walking distance to shopping and theaters. The staff are professional and helpful. Rooms are clean and large. Bathrooms are very large. Great workout room. Would not stay anywhere else! 
30296 alles war echt toll, guter service sehr zentral gelegen. neu renoviertes hotel 
30297 The rooms are nice and on the big side for NYC. Ours had a kitchenette which was great. The staff are all wonderful and couldn't be more helpful or friendly. The beds are super comfortable and the whole place is spotless. Only downside is no bar or restaurant on premises. 
30298 This was an awesome stay, everyone was friendly and the rooms were especially great. They were clean and we had an awesome view. I would definitely stay here again in a heartbeat. The beds were vvvveeeeeeeee eeeeeeeeeeeery comfy. 
30299 We stayed for 10 days over the Holidays. As a family of four we booked 2 Luxury suites, one with King bed and the other with 2 double beds. Both Suites were AMAZING! What was even better was the staff at the Kimberly! Highly recommend! 
30300 Great hotel, we have stayed 3 times now and never disappointed! Very handy for Times Square, Central Park and 5th Avenue. Local diner and coffee bar make breakfast a bit cheaper than the hotel offering and good quality. 
30301 I had a pleasant stay at the Chelsea Savoy this past May, the staff was helpfull, the rooms were nice and clean , the location was also perfect--away from the tourists in Times Square. I would recomment this hotel to anyone wanting a more "real" New York City experience. 
30302 Had a good stay at this hotel - It's a bit far from the convention centre but very handy to shopping and restaurants. I'd stay here again, as long as someone else was paying. 
30303 We stayed at the the Hotel Metro last week. Although not a luxury facility, the hotel was clean and had an air of sophistication. The staff was very pleasant. Ana Maria in the bar was particularly cordial. We would stay there again. 
30304 This hotel is a great location if you are visiting Broadway, Rockefeller Plaza, and other tourist attractions. The rooms are spacious and clean and the staff was very helpful. We had breakfast at the hotel each day. 
30305 Great Staff and Accommodations. Room was very clean. 
30306 Great Hotel. Location is perfect. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The coffeee machines on each floor were a nice touch and much appreciated in the morning. 
30307 Very convenient to restaurant row, Times Square, Rockefeller Center and many shows. We walked most places as cabs were scarce. Hotel room was large. The breakfast buffet was delicious with 2 Starbucks locations in the hotel. The doormen were quite helpful. 
30308 Hotel has a great location. Rooms are clean and have a decent size (for NYC) Bathroom very small but ok. Constant background noise in the room even though the thermostat was off. Wifi is expensive Stay away from Norma's to have breakfast, Too expensive , average of $35 per person. 
30309 Cet hotel est vraiment a recommande car personnel tres sympa, chambre tres cal me, propre, menage fait tous les jours, petit-dejeuner tres copieux, varie. Egalement tres bien situe, a deux pas du metro et des bus. Je lui donne 5/5. 
30310 Apart from the size of the rooms (huge), everything at this hotel was mediocre. We will spend our money elsewhere next time. 
30311 outstanding service, great location, best concierge, amazing staff, spacious rooms, what more can one ask for...... 
30312 Pros: Large room good continental breakfast Clean room indoor pool is pretty clean accommadating and helpful staff Cons: Right by Interstate, can be loud in room - ask for a room on the side facing the other way. 
30313 The room was big and clean with comfy beds. Nice breakfast for only 4 dollars. Perfect location and nice staff. Will definately stay again. 
30314 This is an older hotel, small but very clean room, accommodating staff. Great Manhattan location. Three women shared the room, but had no problems with the size. Eleavator old and worn, but working well. 
30315 If you're looking for a hotel close to the airport to hold a meeting, you can't get much closer. For business this was an ideal property. I wouldn't stay here for any other reason because the plane noise is a bit distracting. 
30316 Stayed almost a week and was definitely comfortable. Great service. 
30317 Very old hotel, probably 50 coats of paint on the wall. But its clean, tv was nice, only4 channels but you don't go to nyc to watch tv. Don't use the travel people in the lobby. Very pricey. But overall great place. 
30318 This is a nice place to stay. This hotel is located away from the time square madness. The rooms are nice but I was surprised at how tiny they are. The hotel staff was very acommodating. I would definately stay here again. 
30319 One of the best hotel I have stayed. It's really a signature collection. You would notice that right when you enter the hotel. All the graphics were done neatly and presentable inside the room. Of course, all NY hotels have small room size but this one is special. 
30320 Corporate trip for me; clean; fair rate; great bar - 
30321 Had an excelent time staying in the millenium hotel. Very central for all sight seeing activities, would thoroughly reccomend the hotel & would definately stay there again on another visit to New York! 
30322 Stayed here during hurricane sandy. The staff was extremely nice and helpful even during a hectic time. The one down side was we were told the restaurant was open until 11 and when we arrived at 1045 we were refused service. 
30323 got a broadway package deal with hotel and tickets for wicked. beautiful location on michigan ave opposite Grant Park, right on the lake. the room was nice and the pool area was very nice. 
30324 Good boutique hotel just a block from Times Square. Walk to shows and restaurants and the subway to anywhere else. Good sized rooms and clean, but more important....quiet Buy your discount tickets for broadway shows online and avoid the long line-ups at the Times Square kiosk.. 
30325 Strange little conservatory type bar. Very cool music, chilled atmosphere, and there's an outside area too for smokers I guess. We just stopped by for a quick drink. It's ok, but only for a quick drink....a whole evening would be too much! Very nice staff. 
30326 We were very well greeted at the Omni and provided with a beautiful upgrade to a marvellous corner room. The room was spacious and well appointed. Location of the hotel is excellent, both for business and shopping. 
30327 great & clean - friendly hotel in heart of NYC close to all attractions in Manhattan friendly staff good for all kinds of trips 
30328 A beautifully renovated, convenient location hotel at a reasonable (for NY) price. Room was tastefully done with a homey feel. Service is exceptional. Will stay there everytime we go to NY. 
30329 The staff at the Hyatt go out of their way to make your stay enjoyable. The rooms are clean and spacious. It is a little far from downtown, but there is a bus stop on the corner and cabs are always on standby. 
30330 Everything in the hotel was great. I got extremely satisfied with the service, the room, the breakfast. The staff is really nice and polite. Prices are good, especially considering its location which is close to some famous stores and sites. Daisy 
30331 Just a great location and a superb staff that wants to make sure your happy! 
30332 The hotel would not honor a reservation that was confirmed both by phone and in writing (email). I will not do business with them again. 
30333 Loved our stay, felt right at home. Everything as promised. Will definitely stay again. Be sure to visit Alice's Tea Cup for the best scones ever, just a few blocks away. 
30334 The location of this hotel is right in the heart of Times Square. The hotel staff was very friendly and accomodating. We felt at home during our stay here and are looking forward to returning there during our next visit to NYC! 
30335 I had a very comfortable stay and this ideally located hotel. The service staff were terrific especially Anamaria at the Front Desk who always had a smile. 
30336 This hotel was a real find and an absolute gem. Superbly located, friendly and helpful staff and the rooms were actually a decent size for a NY hotel. I highly recommend this lovely hotel 
30337 Hotel con muy buena ubicacion, habitacion moderna, comoda, no muy grande. Perfecto para estar de paseo todo el dia y regresar cansado al hotel a dormir. 
30338 Avoid at all costs-you will have airport style queues just to check-in with a wait time of around one hour (no exaggeration), rooms which are in considerable neglect, a breakfast so lacking in quality you will want to skip it, over-priced rooms and poor customer care. 
30339 Nice rooms, nice people, nice location. The lobby is under construction but did not interfere with anything. Sounds like it will be nice when done. Pretty funky and hip, but wouldn't that mean free internet? I just wish hotels provided foam pillows! 
30340 The staff of the Skyline Hotel at 725 10th Ave. are very courteous and helpful. They made our event so much easier. Everyone, including security were right there to help us. I would recommend this hotel to everyone. Thank you staff of Skyline 
30341 The price is really interesting for a hotel in this area. Don't expect 4 stars standards but the rooms are pretty comfortable and very quiet. The cleaning is not perfect but it's fine. The restroom is OK. I definitely recommand it. 
30342 Great motel. Prices reasonable. One half block from Times Square. Walking distance to Broadway Shows. Property in great condition. Overall a wonderful experience. 
30343 The hotel was ideally situated for my business needs. I ate at the Custom House in the eveing and had a great meal. 
30344 Great location right at Times Square, we were centrally located and our family of 5 was able to walk to everything. The front desk staff was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. The rooms were nice and will definitely stay there again. 
30345 Our room was perfect, the food and service from IPO was excellent and staff was personable! Special kudos to the following: Jayne Davis GM, our waiter:Eric(very attentive), the hostess:Devin(always smiling) and the efficient Molly-cocktail waitress. Everyone made us feel special, which in turn made our trip memorable 
30346 Warm service, came early, left bags, got a nice room with a view. Not in times square exactly as other reviewers have noted but close enough. If you can get this for a decent price - go for it! 
30347 Good location. Room is small. You gotta pay for internet access. The worst is i got bitten by bed bugs!!! Will never go back again! 
30348 What a great staff and a lovely New York hotel!! 
30349 I was attacked by bed bugs. What a nightmare! Management claimed they checked the room with a certified pest control company and there were no bed bugs. I can tell you by the 30+ bites / welts on my body they have bed bugs. Beware! 
30350 My family and I stayed at this hotel for Spring Break. It's a great hotel, but not necessarily one for vacationing families. The Galleria Mall is VERY close and ideal for shopping. The staff was relatively friendly and efficient. The hotel room is VERY spacious and neatly appointed. 
30351 The staff was friendly, and the property was one of the cleanest I have ever stayed in. Comfortable, relaxing property right off the freeway. Highly recommend. 
30352 Staff at this hotel are friendly, kind, helpful and knowledgeable. The price is fair and the best part is it's a Starwood Property so you can earn Starwood Points. I stayed 4 Nights. The location is awesome, right at Times Square!! 
30353 Spent a night here in March with hubby and two adult daughters. Lovely clean room and bathroom. Great view. Friendly staff. Great location for shopping and sightseeing. Will stay here again, and recomend it to family and friends. 
30354 Nice hotel in Manhattan between 7th and 6th Avenue. The rooms are nice decorated and very clean. Close to the subway. I can recomend this hotel based on service, price and the calm location. I could hardly hear any traffic and slept like a kid! 
30355 After our disasterous stay at the Best Western Royal Plaza, Marlborough, MA This hotel was great, super staff, small but very clean and comfortable rooms and although downtown NY very close to Chinatown, Little Italy and subway , would certainly return. 
30356 We stayed for 3 nights..excellent location..basic amenities..rooms were small but clean and tidy..good staff...defi recommend for travelers... 
30357 Perfect place at New Year as left hotel bar at 11.50, strolled to Times Square a few metres away. No need to queue, had a fabulous time. 
30358 The bathroom was very small and the shower had lots of mildew. It was rather disgusting and smelled bad. The room was clean other than the very dirty shower. 
30359 Great location, great rooms ... It is clean, spacious, pretty quiet, and safe. The staff were kind and we were given a room on the 22nd floor, with spectacular views of the city and the lake. 
30360 Hamptons are great for business travel and the employees are exceptional. This Hampton is a great price, a great location and the service is wonderful. Anytime I'm in NY on business, it's my first choice of places to stay. 
30361 Rooms are relatively small and furniture is dated. Room and bath were extremely clean. The bed was very comfrotable. Heating and air system was very quiet. Very good value for the price. 
30362 Good location - 5 minutes stroll to 72nd St subway. Good supermarket and deli across the road, cafes close. Residential neighbourhood feel. Three blocks from central park. Helpful front desk. Large room king bed kitchenette - clean and nicely furnished. Some noise from adjacent room. 
30363 Stayed for five nights in April 2011. Location excellent, service first class from staff and rooms are spacious and very comfortable. Don't hesitate to stay here it's worth the money and within walking distance of many of NYC's attractions! 
30364 Love the hotel and the friendliness of the staff... So very helpful and pleasant... 
30365 This hotel really is in a great location - especially for Times Square & the Broadway Theatres. Rooms are basic - but good value. The Cafe Edison is a real New York experience - don't miss it. 
30366 I've now stayed at 6 Columbus several times on business trips to NYC and its quickly become a favorite. The location is great, the hotel has everything you need and the staff are very focused on catering to your needs. If you like stylish boutique this is a good choice. 
30367 Stayed in march in this hotel (29 flour), could cry for the emotions i got. Sunny day, very beautiful room, Walk in 35 minutes through 42nd to central station. Pleasant and very friendly staff 
30368 The hotel looks brand new. The furniture is appropriate. It is really clean. 
30369 we stayed 5 nights and the hotel and it was very nice: clean, great location, very good assistence if needed and fun! 
30370 Great experience - the staff from the front desk to the concierge to the bell boys were just terrific. The rooms were clean, white linens on comfortable beds. It exceeded my expectations in every way and this is the hotel I will choose every time I am in nyc 
30371 Beautiful hotel and execellent area for stay. Hotel needs to improve on having a much bigger choice of foods - too many politically correct foods at hotel!! Employees are execellent. No swimming pool at hotel. 
30372 Gracious and helpful staff...not to mention cleanliness and appealing, relaxing atmosphere. Thank You 
30373 Beautiful hotel. The most comfortable beds EVER! Great location. Had a small issue but they were great about it! I'd go back! 
30374 The hotel is getting a bit tired and needs a revamp. However it provides a wide range of accomodation possibilites. The staff are excellent, helpful and proffesional. 
30375 Everythings been said about its Location, Service, Etc, we feel exactly the same. A Good Value Hotel. 
30376 Just returned from out fifth stay at the Grand Hyatt New York. Stayed from Aug8-13th. No complaints whats so ever about this hotel. The location is unbelievable, staff is terrific and the renovations are outstanding. See you next year for stay number six. 
30377 this place was a real find. In the East Village with an excellent wine bar next door. We were upgraded to a room with a terrace (unfortunately it rained!). Nice touches including free bottle of wine, lovely toiletries, extremely comfortable bed. Not cheap but we loved it. 
30378 Stayed here for five nights, rooms are clean, comfy bed, and Staff are excellent, polite and helpful. Very central, and for those who like real ale there is a good Brewery pub round the corner next to the bus Station, recommended. 
30379 grote kamer, goede badkamer, goed bed. Zou iets beter schoongemaakt kunnen worden en meer aandacht voor het aanvullen van de toiletbenodigdheden. internet zou gratis beschikbaar moeten zijn, of goedkoper 
30380 This is a Luxury hotel for sure... :) I love the location (3 minutes walk to Rockefeller Centre) and the service (from desk) is excellent... :) Breakfast is a little pricy ... >< I also had a conference here inside this hotel, the conference setting was prepared very well. 
30381 Kamers met badkamer, zeer eenvoudig, oud. Wel schoon en van alles voorzien. 's Ochtends vroeg werden de vuilnisbakken naast ons raam geleegd. Wifi werkte niet voor Iphone's en Ipad's. locatie op loop afstand van de Magnificent Mile en vele restaurantjes. 
30382 I like the people and the room was really clean and confy the fron desk rep was really nice and help me a lot 
30383 While LastMinuteTravel claims this to be a 3 star hotel, it just isn't. If you're looking a 2-ish-star hotel with private facilities, this is fine for the money. Near a subway station that will bring you fast into mid- and downtown Manhattan, affordable, and clean enough. 
30384 The hotel is nice and very clean and staff is very polite, what I didn't like is that if the room is small it should have a nice HD TV: Plasma or LCD. But the TV was very small. The rooms to be hones are NOT very comfortable. 
30385 This is truly an outstanding hotel! Our stay was very pleasant. The staff was excellent and very accomadating. This hotel truly excels in customer service. The room was great,very large and comfortable. The bed was very comfortable. I truly look forward to my next visit at this hotel! 
30386 Had a comfortable and relaxing stay at the Chatwal. This NYC luxury hotel truly exudes class and sophistication from its interior appointments to the quality of customer service. 
30387 My husband and I stayed here in April 2011. It suited our needs. Clean, comfortable, good location.Would return here again when visiting New York. 
30388 FOUR WORDS: INFLATABLE RAT, BED BUGS!!! I don't know how I'm going to survive 3 night here. Ny is.gross but this welcoming was by far a bit much! The room.is totally run down and dingy. Bathroom is awful! Yuk! 
30389 I was expecting a bit more. The room was fine, decent size, comfortable bed. Couldn't get the WiFi to work. No coffee maker in the room. TV was dated. Slow drains in the bathroom and some loose screws holding things together. Staff was friendly and helpful. 
30390 This hotel is is great, with a fantastic location and large, modern rooms and an amazing bathroom. Young and friendly staff. The second floor has a big "kitchen" and bar area suited for dinners and parties, I would recommend it to young people! 
30391 Great views. Close to metro. Nice pool and exercise room. Expensive parking and restaurant. Getting up to the room can be a chore as you have to take two separate elevators. 
30392 This hotel was just spot on for me. Very nice rooms, full service great food and excellent location to where my business took me (which was mainly The Galleria area). The swimming pool was a life saver as it got up to 38 deg C (100 F). 
30393 Great staff! Clean and great views of 9/11 memorial. Convenient to public transportation. Cant say enough good about this place. Rooms are small but very clean. Have a drink on the rooftop bar for great views of the city. Stayed here for yankees game and #4 train close by. 
30394 What a great place to stay, close to everything in mid town manhatten, 3 minutes from Maceys, 10mins. walk fromTime Square, comfortable, clear and recently renovated. 
30395 Recent business trip to Manhattan for meetings. This hotel is still "fabulous". So much history and modern day comforts. Great fitness center and prompt service. Sir Harry's can top it off for anyone. 
30396 I really enjoyed my stay. The staff and the housekeeping were very attentive and courteous. The room was very clean and everything was in working order. I would definitely stay here again, when in the Chicago area. The location was great because it was close to the airport. 
30397 The location is not the greatest, especially at night. But the staff was friendly and the hotel was clean. Cannot really complain. 
30398 Just spend 4 days in the SoHotel. First class, for location, value and all that you could ever want for from a city location hotel. Well done and many thanks to the many staff who helped us during our stay. We will be back! 
30399 Well situated downtown close to lake front. Room clean and comfortable. Alittle noise on front facing room from overhead railway close by. Excellent value for the area. 
30400 Crowne Plaza Magnificent Mile was a good experience. The location is great, just next to Michigan Avenue with all shops and businesses, and near from Oak Street Beach. Also I liked the rooms and especially the bed, which was very comfortable. 
30401 Don't be fouled by the outside of the motel. The rooms were clean and the bed was comfortable. The breakfast was not to good. There was no milk for cereal and nobody around to help. 
30402 Enjoyed my stay here. Power stayed on throughout the hurricane, and the staff was very accommodating. Thank you! 
30403 centrale ottima posizione vicino empire, camere con ogni comfort, noi avevamo una deluxe abbastanza spaziosa con letto king, veramente gigantesco e mega tv lcd. finestre poco insonorizzate, ma zona molto tranquilla. Lo consigliamo, e ci torneremo volentieri. 
30404 Great hotel for the price ... beds are very comfortable ... rooms are traditional ... only disappointing thing from my perspective was the tv (ie. older style and small). If this hotel upgraded the tv this hotel would probably be my #1 choice for a downtown Houston hotel. 
30405 Attractive, quiet rooms -- above the 2nd floor (the bar downstairs can be loud). The rooms are small -- like a European hotel -- but they are clean, modern, with free internet service. The hotel is conveniently located, and the staff are friendly. I love it! 
30406 We have stayed at several Affinia Hotels in NYC in the past and the Affinia Gardens is our new favorite! Great location, great space and amenities for our family.We will be back! 
30407 The best thing about this hotel is that it is located in the heart of the theater district. The room I had was clean but smelly (but perhaps not all of the rooms are like that). The staff were friendly. You have to pay for Wifi. 
30408 Having stayed in 5 stars all over the world, I would have to say this is one of the best. Great staff. Great service. Great facility. Running into Carlos Santana and a host of other celebs was also pretty cool. 
30409 We enjoyed more than a week's stay in this very nice hotel with a fine view of the Hudson River from the balcony. The neighbourhood nice with good restaurants and the famous Zabar's is a few blocks away. Easy access to the underground and caps around all the time. 
30410 I stayed there for 9 nights in May -liked it a lot. Nice staff, clean and quiet rooms and what counted for me: From 14th street it's a 10-minute-subway-ride to Brooklyn. Perfect! 
30411 Great boutique feel with a trendy bar and very good restaurant. Rooms are tiny but modern and well appointed. Concierge was significantly better than most; really great! 
30412 My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Night Hotel. The rooms were clean and spotless. The manager Tom and his staff were amazing and went above and beyond any expectation. 
30413 Staff very friendly & helpful , front desk went out of their way to accommodate me at check in. Rooms about what expected at HI Express clean nice, AC not working that well but ok. Great location. 
30414 teeny tiny room -- had to hang our coats on the door knob. No chair. One good thing -- the windows open. One robe per room. Worst of all -- I was bitten by a bedbug. hard to reconcile hotwire's 4 star designation with the reality. 
30415 i went with 2 friends for 10days and stayed at this hotel. i loved it,the rooms were very big and clean. it was in a excellent location,15mins walk from times sq, i would deffiantly recommend anyone to stay here! 
30416 Small and stylish, the theme is an elegant urban gothic. Staff was very helpful and while the room was small , it was comfortable and quiet. Right in the theater district and very close to Times Square. 
30417 Rooms were small but clean, service was great as was the location and value. Would stay again if we had to stay in NYC. 
30418 Clean, safe, friendly & the only place we will stay even if we have to drive 50 miles out of our way. 
30419 stayed here for the second time a few weeks back rooms are ideal for what you need location is superb staff cant do enough for you it really is central for everything!! 
30420 Nice, clean, close to the subway. Would stay there again! The service was great. Didn't have any complains during my stay. Beds were comfortable and could easily relax after long working days. Good complimentary coffee as well! 
30421 Location location location. Breakfast average. Great staff 
30422 Very well located and the rooms were very nice. The only problem os that for New Year's you can't get close to Times Square because all the roads are barricaded. Apart from that all great. 
30423 Clean, spacious, and free wifi! Couldn't get a better deal and in a great location. Definitely heading back very soon. 
30424 Very nice and friendly Hotel in a superb position at 2 min far from Time square Excellent service and there is a quite good bar with very good breckfast or dinner. I really suggest this hotel to everyone who wants to visit NY 
30425 The hotel was beautiful and the staff was great too! Two names stick out...Eddie and Nelson!! I would definitely go back to The W and ask for them to help me!!! Great job guys! 
30426 I spent one week at the hotel felix with my boyfriend! We really had a great time! The hotel is very good located and the staff is so friendly! The rooms are very clean and really stylish! For us it was perfect!! 
30427 Room in Tower A. Convenient to subway, Whole Foods, Central Park; not a bad walk to broadway/ts. Bathroom recently renovated/very clean; TV great; bed-queen -- ok; no view; I'd stay here again no problem. 
30428 Had 5 brilliant nights at the Hilton Times Square, couldn't have asked for better service, was worried about noise in such a busy area but could hear nothing from our room. We couldn't fault our stay and will definately stay again soon. Location cannot be faulted 
30429 No complaints. Clean, no bedbugs, helpful concierge and bellhops. good location if shopping from Houston to Worth, Broadway to Lafayette. Walk to Chinatown. Subways close. Room could have better shading for the mornings, but otherwise, recommend. 
30430 Went with my husband who had some work to do in the states. Very nice hotel. The restaurant next door is perfect for breakfast. 
30431 I have stayed here once before and was not disappointed either time. This hotel is beautiful, every bit if it. The bar is elegant as well. The location is great. It's hard to write a review, except to say you will not be disappointed. 
30432 For god sake use some money to repair that beautiful hotel, it only needs some litle remodation on the painting and carpeting, it is located in the heart of new york and it is a pitty the finnishing conditions are so bad. 
30433 We visited NYC over the Thanksgiving holiday. We loved our stay at the Iroquois. The rooms were nicely decorated and just the right size. The concierge was helpful and it was nice to have access to a business center and small workout facility. 
30434 I have spend a week in this wonderful hotel while been on a business trip to my company's New York office. I hade a 3-room suite, it was gorgeous! 
30435 My 2 girlfriends and I were thrilled to find the spacious and comfortable room, delicious breakfast and inviting bar at the TRYP. We will definitely go back to this hotel-- great location and reasonably priced. 
30436 Will need soon some refurbishing but a great service ! Excellent food ! The situation is perfect to shop and dine in city center. We had a suite on 49thfloor with a incredible view on Central Park and the buildings. Four seasons are the best ! 
30437 Prachtige kamers. Vriendelijke bediening. Perfecte ligging. Een aanrader !!! 
30438 Wonderful stay for a family of four. Excellent, sincere service. the prices in the bar are a high, but not unexpected. Our suite was very nice, well appointed and well laid out. All in all, it was actually a bargain as New York goes. 
30439 I have stayed many times at this location and the people there are friendly and very helpful. nice rooms in a great location 
30440 The Parker Merdian is a fantastic mid-town location. Rooms are a bit minimalistic, but in an extremely fashionable / chic manner. Staff is always extremely helpful. Views of Central Park from the high floors are great. 
30441 The hotel's best asset is its location. Lobby is beautiful. Check in staff helpful and cheery. Rooms need detail work for 4 star designation. Staff were not as pushy for tips as other locations I have stayed at. 
30442 My husband and I enjoyed being at this hotel. All is clean. Great location. Safe place,close to Michigan street. staff is amazing, polite and helpful. 
30443 nice quiet boutique hotel in very nice neighborhood surrounded by good small restaurants and near the museums, rooms are small but nice and clean and bathroom is nicely updated 
30444 The location was good. The coffee and muffins in the morning was just right. Relaxed atmosphere in the lobby. Good and quiet sleep. Free Internet for check-in to return flight. Subway station 34St-Herald Sq. very close. 
30445 We stayed at the Holiday Inn Express durint the Thanksgiving Holiday Weekend. We found it very comfortable and nice. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The breakfast each morning was terrific. We will be back during our next trip to the Chicago area! 
30446 Two blocks to Times Square and to Grand Central. Great breakfast, very friendly and helpful staff. Short cab and subway or long walk to Central Park. 
30447 Wonderful in every way. Second time I have stayed here and am planning to go back in December. Staff are wonderful, rooms hugely comfortable and the location perfect. Looking forward to our next visit! 
30448 hotel looks trendy and pulls quite a crowd on the weekends. seemed understaffed and had to give up my suite as they were overbooked. Standard rooms are small but have all the luxuries required. Would stay again but only if on special - not worth the $450 quoted. 
30449 Convenient location, good price, helpful staff, great pizza, near Sears Tower, 1 block from Clinton Station Chicago Transit Authority station. 
30450 It is amazing excellent hotel. I loved. exellent location, price,services. I like the Staff. Especially: Mrs. Elizabeth. she is amazing outstanding helpful. 
30451 You will enjoy your stay @ the Symth Surrounded by gr8 food and the best spot to find good coffee on NY But no free WIFI. $ 15 for 24 hrs Go across the road to Starbucks and use their free WIFiI just don't have a coffee. 
30452 We hebben 3 overnachtingen gehad in dit hotel. De lokatie was perfect maar ik schrok van de slechte staat van de kamers. De badkamer was erg gedateerd en slecht onderhouden met vieze vlekken in/op toilet en douche. Kamer verder niet bijzonder. Prijs/kwaliteit kwam niet overeen. 
30453 The staff was effecient, friendly and helpful. This is one hotel stay I would not hesitate to recommend. It's located in a trendy, cool and funky part of the city. I had a truely wonderful experience. You will too! 
30454 ottimo hotel, camere ampie e ben arredate con vista sulla 7th avenue. bellissima la sala per la colazione con vista su time square. personale veramente gentile e disponibile. lo consiglio! 
30455 Such a convenient location! Staff was attentive and pleasant. Room was very comfortable, nicely decorated and very clean. Elevators were staged for access for different floors decreasing waiting times. 
30456 Davvero poco raccomandabile. La posizione e' scomoda (ma e' una valutazione soggettiva). La pulizia lascia a desiderare. La piscina e' occupata ogni giorno per party esterni, impedendone l'utilizzo dai clienti (!!!). Insomma sara' pure trendy ma perche' soffrire?? 
30457 We really enjoy our stay at the millennium Times Square, it has a great perk and that is the location just steps away from the main broadway plays, shops and dinning. This our third time at millennium and we are looking forward in returning. 
30458 Friendly staff, modern rooms, great shower (fuzzy soft robes), wonderful food, and in walking distance of Broadway! 
30459 Nice little boutique hotel on east side of Manhattan. Clean and cool with rooftop observation deck and coffee bar. They responded promptly anytime I called. The only bad thing about it was I could hear the street noise even though we were on floor 7. 
30460 Hotel was very nice and clean. The Location is great in the Middle of Everything in Times Square, close to subway and alot to do within walking distance. Staff was very friendly and helpful. 
30461 Upon the glowing recommendations of many friends who have stayed at The London, we recently spent a wonderful weekend there. The service, location, accommodations, and atmosphere are second-to-none. This is our new favorite hotel and we will definitely stay here again. 
30462 Quiet location, friendly service, spacious rooms, very clean, remodeled bath, tastefully decorated, comfy sitting area, big desk & office chair, micro & fridge, great bed, quiet rooms, large breakfast. SUPER place to stay. 
30463 Great hotel for a good price, friendly staff, clean room, close to all cool things the Big Apple has to offers, ... I know where I will stay next time in NYC! 
30464 Lovely little hotel right in the heart of the theatre district. Traditional decor. Only problem was painfully slow elevators. Not a bargain, but a good value. 
30465 Spacious room with very good bed. Fine service and good restaurant. Don't know about the breakfast; we did'nt have that in the hotel. Heard a bit of noise from the subway sometimes, but didn't find that disturbing. 
30466 Cannot beat this location! Breakfast is good. Hotel room is spacious and clean. Great value. We also had a 3 day business meeting here and rented a meeting room. This worked very well. The staff had the room ready each day. Perfect place to hold meetings. 
30467 Helpful staff are just one of the reasons this is a great place to stay in NY.You have a choice of a bar across the lobby, or a rooftop bar that lets you see the lit up buildings at night.Our room was neat and clean,also a nice size.Very good stay. 
30468 We where here for 3 nights and enjoyed every bit of it. The complementary "breakfast", 24/7 fruit, coffee and tea. We also enjoyed the free wine and cheese between 5 and 7 PM. Teddy and Lopsang where very helpful and friendly. We highly recommend this hotel. 
30469 Excellent for a business stay - staff was very good, hotel was clean Parking was very reasonable 
30470 Demasiado caro para el servicio ofrecido. Sin desayuno y el personal muy estirado poco amable. 
30471 We enjoyed staying at the Palmer House Hilton very much. We were on the Executive Floor which offers a nice lounge and afternoon snacks and breakfast. The food in the restaurant in the hotel was not quite as good as I expected. 
30472 This hotel is conveniently located to shopping and restaurants. Many attractions are within walking distance. This is an old historic hotel. Although the architecture is interesting, it appeared dirty and in ill repair. We did not try the restaurants on site. 
30473 Man skal som gaest vaere opmaerksom paa at ved bestilling gennem expedia, tildeles man ikke noedvendigvis det vaerelse som man har betalt for hjemmefra, men hvad de har ledigt. Expedia-rejsende virker til at andenrangsgaester. 
30474 we got this hotel under the surprise deal where you book first and then they reveal hotel. good central location if u dont have car. rooms are small. bathroom has no window or ventilation & is too cramped up. aircon is old fashioned and noisy. 
30475 Chicago is wonderful and clean ! The Drake hotel is Beautiful. The service is exceptional !! The city is unbelievable. The people are very friendly. The FOOD is delicious. Everything about our trip here was very pleasant. Definitely coming back soon !!! 
30476 dopo esserci lamentati per lo squallore della stanza a terzo piano (Moquette sporca-soffitto sbriciolato...un incubo)ci hanno trasferito al 15 esimo. Un po meglio....ma sempre male per lo standard europeo..... Impossibilitati di cambiare hotel per la multa che ci toccava(e ci credo......vorranno scapparsene tutti!!!) Vacanza rovinata dall'incubo di rientrare in hotel. 
30477 After reading some negative reviews was a little apprehensive about staying here. Was completely impressed and thrilled with the location, amenities, services and incredible staff. This is great location, the outdoor market, shopping and restaurants. Mod, comfortable rooms. Traveled with 7 year old. Very quiet at night, incredible. 
30478 Hotel St. James is perfect. Fare rates, rooms are clean, staff is very nice and location is excellent. If you want to visit NYC, I do recommend the St. James Hotel. 
30479 Beautiful hotel. Excellent, friendly, helpful staff! 
30480 Thank you for a nice stay! It was great arriving at the hotel and be welcomed by Carmelo "the bellman", smiling and very helpful, he put us in a good mood right away! 
30481 The London NYC has been my hotel of choice in Manhattan for a few years now. Recently stayed there and the service was outstanding as usual. The rooms are spacious and clean and relatively quiet considering its fantastic midtown location. Will continue to stay there exclusively in NYC. 
30482 Business trip and the hotel next door to the business we were visiting. Great location. Comfortable room with great views looking east to Navy Pier and the lake. 
30483 The room was nice. Double headed shower-awesome. The famous Chef Ramsey has a restaurant inside which is also pretty cool 
30484 posizione centrale - servizio mediocre - camere piuttosto sporche - veduta zero 
30485 I went there recently for a business trip and the Hotel was in an ideal location. The entire place was very modern, from the bar to the room. I would definitely stay here again, especially with its proximity to Midtown. 
30486 Tolles Hotel, direkt am Central Park und Ecke Fith Avenue. Tolle Ausstattung und super Serivce. Echt zu empfehlen. 
30487 El desyuno, muy basico, y las personas encargadas de la recepcion, demasiado serias. 
30488 Paid $200/night for a musty smelling 10' x 10' room (seriously) with a toilet that didn't flush and a broken bathroom door lock. At least the staff was friendly while logging all the problems. Oh, and Times Square South isn't anywhere near Times Square. 
30489 Lack of caring for a traveling public put affinia on the c list .rooms not small but as the receptionist told me, petite .choose walking on your suitcase or bed to get to the petite bathroom.ok hotel if you need a room close to Penn station and in transit. 
30490 I stayed at the Time Hotel recently and had a great stay. The staff was courteous and welcoming. The hotel has a great location and I will be back. 
30491 My husband and I stayed at the Courtyard Marriotts and was very happy with the cleanliness and great French restaurant. Walking distance to Times Square, Today Show and even walked to Central Park. 
30492 Although this was only my second stay at the Muse, my wife and I were greeted like old friends, and our single room had been upgraded to a suite! There were many extras after that. The hotel was immaculate,quiet, and convenient to transportation. 
30493 This hotel must be one of the most over priced hotel in the world! We payed 657 USD/Night for a out dated rather small twin bed room without breakfast. One thing is for sure, I will absoluteley never ever come back! PS: The lobby was rather nice! 
30494 Great location, 5 minute walk from time's square and 5th avenue, surrounded by nice restaurant, 2 minute walk from subway. Really nice gym, overpriced and Internet is shotty and extremely overpriced. Business center is not free either. 
30495 The staff it's wonderful. The property amazing located. The lobby has free wifi and it's huge. We will come back. 100% guarantee 
30496 hotel tres bien tenu ,proximite du metro et des bus les chambres tous les jours faites aucun probleme sur tout notres sejour de quinzes jours .Reception rapide et chaleureuse un hotel sympatique notament le baggagiste Tibetin 
30497 The hotel was clean quiet and great location!! Doorman very helpful. Location, location, location!!! Had a problem with TV and they quickly fixed problem and gave us warm cookies for our trouble. Will stay again when return to NY. 
30498 Spotless, large rooms - VERY accomodating staff - pretty close to everything in Lower Manhattan, would DEFINITELY recommend. The only complaint was 22 floors, and only 2 elevators. 
30499 Friendly staff and things look good at first glance but look at all the dusts on the window sills, furniture, and the housekeeping don't clean floors or do much when you are staying there more than a day. Only after check out they are instructed to do the floors! 
30500 we had cold showers for 4 days and the reception really didn't care. they didn't even know what MOMA was and when the museums were open. the central heating was broke for 1 day. but the rest of the hotel (beds, location, furniture) was ok. 
30501 Wonderful spacious rooms, clean, well stocked, courteous and helpful staff, beautiful hotel. Can be pricey, but what hotel in NYC isn't? This is definitely worth a stay. Not a single problem with this visit when we stayed at Michelangelo. 
30502 Great location within walking distance to shopping areas, not far from grand central station, lots of eating placing around. Very friendly and helpful staff, comfortable spacious junior suite, great bathroom, comfortable beds. The breakfast at the hotel, not a lot to choose form but fulling. 
30503 the fan went on and off all night which made the room very noisy. when it was off the traffic was very apparent and there was no way to keep it on. 
30504 The room was fine, but there is nothing there. No restaurant, bar, and the people at the desk seemed totally disinterested that we were their guests. We walked to another hotel to have dinner and we were glad we were only there for overnight. 
30505 Stayed for a second time on Affinia Dumont, and again the same feeling of being in a place where you are taken care of, clean, well maintaned and everyone is at your service, excellent hotel! 
30506 Staff was very helpful and friendly; other guests were also friendly; warm atmosphere 
30507 This is the worst hotel that I've ever stayed at. I had the misfortune of dealing with an incompetent staff. I placed my belongings in my room. When I returned I found cockroaches climbing on my suitcase. I promptly left 
30508 3 night stay, staff absolutely fab, great position for midtown. A bit out dated decor but who cares ? Had everything you expect for an apartment , we will be going to stay here again next year. We were in room number 23g lots of space fantastic views. 
30509 Lots of fun on this staycation! We are manhatanites and want to do it again... 
30510 Excellant service and very friendly staff. Loved the rooms and would definitely go back. 
30511 Bad smells in room. Missing dishes in kitchen. Table and bed table are dirty and sticky, floor and carpet as well. Insects of all kinds, even cockroaches! Disgusting! Fortunately, they gave my money back, when I run away. 
30512 This hotel is in an excellent location. I enjoyed walking through the neighborhood. I didn't like the decor but that's ok. I can see where some people would think it's fun and cute. But the mildew on the bathroom ceiling, shower curtain, and grout just isn't appealing to anyone. 
30513 Excellent customer service on all levels. Great location. Great amenities. 
30514 the hotel in a great location close to time square the staff was very friendly the elevators are small and our room was a little smelly the carpets where dirty and stained. all and all though it was a pretty nice hotel just a little pricey 
30515 We Stayed here during a shopping trip to chicago. Although the room was really small it was big enough for two women and ALL their Christmas shopping bags (and thats saying alot!) The price and location of the hotel made up for the room size. 
30516 The Holiday Inn in Midtown is a great hotel. You can walk to Central Park and lot's of other famous attractions. The service is perfect. 
30517 Convenient location near Penn Station. Very comfortable bed and good size bathroom with terrific shower. Good access to subway transportation. We were out and about in the area and felt very safe. 
30518 Sehr sauberes, gut ausgestattetes und zentrales Hotel 
30519 We live on Long Island and choose this for a weekend retreat. It was a perfect boutique hotel. The service was excellent. The atmosphere warm. The food excellent. We walked to many locations and felt as if we were coming home each time we returned. We will definitely go back 
30520 The perfect place to stay in NY, just 10 minutes from Grand Central station and where bus tours leave from, also Times Square is a easy walk 
30521 The hotel was fantastic, clean with great helpfull staff, and we had great view. 
30522 This hotel is in a great location in proximity to the theater district. The rooms are clean and the staff was very friendly. Good buy 
30523 Stayed here for the weekend on a "suite Deal" The room was amazing, old world charm and furnishings, but with all needs for a modern traveller. The bed was ultra comfy! 
30524 nice,clean big room and a good staff. Great location in Times square close to the best theatres and restaurants in town. 
30525 Hotel has a wonderful location, it's in the heart of Manhattan, but still not expensive, It is in front of Madison Square Garden, and two blocks from Empire State Building. 
30526 My family of four people spent a week here. The room and bathroom were spacious. The location was good for walking anywhere or using the subway. Normally I would prefer to stay in an apartment with a kitchen, but this worked out fine. Would definitely come back again. 
30527 Terrible Service... Do not stay here. 
30528 This hotel is located in the heart of Times Square.... had a blast! The rooms are clean and the service is great! Love, love, loved it!! 
30529 The Park Central is well situated in NYC and offers rooms that, although not modern are very comfortable, clean and well priced. If your plan is to walk to many of the tourist attractions, this is a great place to stay. 
30530 We received tremendous service. Loved the 2nd floor Rick's Cafe. Still cannot believe how easily we moved from crazy Times Square night life to our peaceful hotel. We will return.... 
30531 Security is lacking at this hotel. Two guest rooms burglarized on the same night last week. July 16. Stay at your own risk. 
30532 There is something special about the Mag Mile at Christmas and the Chicago Intercontinental is a great location to experience it all. The service here is excellent and you cannot beat the location for dining out or a quick shopping trip. 
30533 A pure kip rooms were dirty - carpet was shocking location poor too far up the city cheap and cheerful 
30534 Servizio e gentilezza perfetti, bella palesta e camera spaziosa e comoda, ben posizionato in pochi minuti a piedi si raggiungono cental station e molti punti di interesse. Una scelta perfetta e da consigliare 
30535 We stayed at this hotel like we have done many times before. The room was small but when I'm in New york City, I don't plan on spending too much time in the hotel room. Nothing to complain about as others did, the hotel staff were very nice to us. 
30536 Thus charming boutique hotel is just a few blocks away from times square. Very clean, professional and courteous staff, Would defintely like to stay here again. Great find. 
30537 The front desk was very helpful in directing me to some amazing places (for late night food, music etc.). The room was cushy, unique and beautiful, with a great view, and the bar was fantastic. The shower was heavenly! 
30538 bit pricy since the renovation, but still worth it. rich in history and ambience. we try to stay here as often as possible. if you love historic old places this is a gem! 
30539 This hotel is in a perfect location for my meetings and it is a reall beautiful hotel. The only major issue I had was the reservations staff told me one thing that was correct and the front desk told me something completley incorrect. Everything else about this hotel is great. 
30540 Nieuw hotel , vlakbij Times square,metro,hop on hop off busstop om de hoek,de nieuwe high line promenade,shopping.. Rustig gelegen,luxe kamer met grote douche,uitstekende bedden..en een uitmundende service. TRYP hotel zeer zekers een aanrader 
30541 Camere enormi, arredamento nella media, pulizia molto carente soprattutto nel bagno (veramente nauseabondo!) che ero costretto a disinfettare io ogni sera (con una specie di Amuchina americana!). Posizione eccezionale. 
30542 friendly staff, but not overly so. they keep it cool but know how to smile. excellent location to enjoy the high line, west village and high line. great restaurants nearby. loved our room. will definitely go back. 
30543 ......................................................................... 
30544 Stayed at the Hilton Manhaton East. Great service, location is perfect. Rooms small but very clean. Nice breakfast each morning was included in price. 
30545 Beautiful motel and excellent room with fantastic pricing. We booked this hotel on line and certainly were not disappointed. They even offer a shuttle service to local restaurants and shopping. Now, that's service. 
30546 I stayed with a couple of friends at the Econo lodge for the labour day weekend and the hotel had no hot water for the weekend. The staff didn't apologize and the toilet in one of the rooms overflowed twice. 
30547 we had a great stay, the room was clean and modern, the staff were extremely friendly. the only downside to the hotel in our opinion is the lack of a pool. everything else was superb! 
30548 Location is great, but that was all. Dark corridors like a maze. My internet special room was TINY with dirty walls, carpet and bedspread. The door looked like it had come from a high security prison. I think the sheets and towels were clean, but that was about it. 
30549 Stayed in June 2004. Great location in Midtown. Friendly, courteous staff, and room at a great value. Room furnishings were in great condition. Did not eat in hotel restaurant - many good places and better values nearby. Would return anytime! 
30550 No complaints. Staff was friendly and accommodating. Room was clean and adequately sized. We were on the 36th floor and had a nice view of the skyline. It's within a couple of blocks of Grand Central. There are lot's of cool restaurants in the area. 
30551 Affinia Manhatten was fantastic, new decor, security was great, central location, staff friendly and they were very helpful. Highly recommend. We also stayed at Affinia Dumont but the Manhatten was better. 
30552 Fantastic location, super comfortable bed, clean, great service, subway right outside your door, access to everything at a great price for New York City. Highly recommend!! 
30553 The staff at this hotel make it a great value. The hotel is well located for walking to Times Square and up to Central Park. From the front desk to the bellman, they all went out of their way to make us feel special. 
30554 Great hotel, clean, good position but the lady with the bun behind the bar is Very grumpy and moody, everyone in the hotel was nice except the lady with the bun. The beer already was expensive, but now I got it delivered with a grumpy face. 
30555 The Suite was great! We loved have a kitchenette and a bedroom and a livingroom. Gave us all great privacy. The doormen helped us with tips of where to find what close by. The view of Lexington Avenue was great from our suite!!!!! 
30556 I stayed at the benamin first week of February on a recomendation from a friend and let me tell u it was amazing. I couldnt believe the service, Elias especially thanks again....and the beds fell right to sleep... Best experience ever 
30557 Modernes Hotel in zentraler Lage, Zimmer etwas klein, Service o.k., Internet auf dem Zimmer nicht kostenlos, das Aquarium im Eingangsbereich ist absolut sehenswert. der Concierge ist sehr hilsbereit und sehr professionell. Keine Parkplatzmoeglichkeiten direkt am Hotel (Parkmoeglichkeiten gibt es in einem Gebaeude nebenan, ist aber sehr teuer) 
30558 Rooms are nice & functional. In the Bathroom I received the traditional Westin Amenities, which I really love! The "heavenly bed" was outstanding. Most of all: The staff was very attentive and friendly! 
30559 Really enjoy the Parker meridien hotel - Rooms clean and spacious, amazing service throughout. Hotel is well located in Midtown. The burger place in the lobby is very good, would reccomend the hotel to all. 
30560 I really liked this hotel. It's conveniently located, and beautifully appointed. The room was very large by New York City standards, and the view to the north was dazzling. Service was exemplary, and very low key. 
30561 Spent 5 nights in this fantastic hotel. Loved the lobby with its gorgeous flowers. Situated perfectly for Times Square, Broadway et al. Hotel staff were fantastic - gave us an upgrade without having to ask. Rooms were excellent - particularly the shower. would totally recommend this hotel for all occasions. 
30562 I loved hotel chandler, the staff was very nice and helpful. Right away they gave us maps of the city that were very helpful for our trip. It was very clean and I had no complaints. I would stay here again if i ever go back to new york. 
30563 Great hotel, fantastic location, brilliant staff. Room 1220 was lovely. Enough said, would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
30564 Handy for what you want in Manhattan, good young staff, efficient services, decent rooms and good support for business trippers....I liked it at the price I got the room for ($200). 
30565 Surprisingly good for the money! Good location, friendly staff, nice but small rooms! The bed is oh so comfy. I will return here! 
30566 Love these hotels, set- up/amenities. Great find one in central location in NYC. New, clean, friendly, comfortable. Perfect. 
30567 - near ground zero - sometimes too near ! - rooms facing ground zero suffer from building noise (hotel offers free earplugs) - breakfast buffet: small but fresh food - friendly staff - different underground / subway stations nearby - near huge shopping center (Century21) 
30568 wait staff very friendly, gave me wrong room, but let me stay in it till the right room was ready and after driving 200 miles that was big! breakfest was very convenient and over all atmoshere was kickback and enjoy! 
30569 it is one of the best hotels in NY... great location, Amazing serves and wonderful rooms 
30570 clean and great location----Laura and Nicole were very helpful in taking care of all our needs. great staff! we will recommend it highly! 
30571 The staff is the definition of accomodation. They have never told me no, and they clearly answered all my questions. The rooms are great, and you can easily walk to so many things, Penn station, The Empire State Bld, Times Square. It's my favorite hotel in the city. 
30572 Perfect location for sightseeing, dining and shopping in NY. Staff were helpful and accomodating. Room was perfectly cleaned every day. 
30573 I love the Dream Downtown. I've stayed at the there a handful of times and have already reccomended it to family and friends. It has a great atmosphere, gorgeous, modern decor and a wonderful staff. 
30574 Heel goed hotel. Ik had een single Pod, kamer is niet groot maar slim ingericht en van alle gemakken voorzien. Heerlijke regendouches, airco op de kamer en free wifi. Goede prijs/kwaliteitverhouding, ik zou er zeker nog een keer logeren! 
30575 I was happy with my stay here. The rooms were small, but very clean and comfortable. The staff was friendly and accommodating. The location is fantastic and less than a block from the subway. I have to agree the breakfast wasn't very good but that is my only complaint. 
30576 People if you're in Houston,Texas and need a hotel off the I-10,this is the place to be.I enjoyed my stay the staff was outstanding exceptionally clean rooms.I could go on but, you need to experience it for you self.I'll give it a "20". Good value I didn't want to leave. 
30577 Very strong smell of cigarretes even in the non smoking rooms. Terrible service from the employees and mainly from the managers. Much better hotels optins with much better cost benefit. 
30578 What a mess! The bathroom looked like someone had died in the bath, likewise the carpet. I'm all for New York attitude but the staff were rude to the point of hostility. The final straw was having NO hot water EVERY morning. Pay a bit more and go elsewhere! 
30579 It was great......had a wonderful time. Would come back anytime! Service was awesome! Food was great! Swans were beautiful...........room was very accomadating! Room service was prompt and very tasty! 
30580 This is a very clean and well maintained Hampton Inn. It is actually in a fairly quiet location in a nice part of town. 
30581 Wonderful room and shower, walking distance to the Galleria. The hotel is peaceful, comfortable, with beautiful decor without being over the top. I was there for a conference which was also at the hotel so it was very convenient. 
30582 Very good hotel,good price, close to all nyc atractions,new room, refurnished, very confortable. 
30583 A escasos metros de Times Square, no podia estar mejor situado, y muy cerca de gran cantidad de lineas de metro. Las habitaciones son bastante decentes y las camas comodas, la habitacion la hacen cada 2 dias, pero compensa con creces. Muy recomendable la relacion calidad/precio 
30584 Great location. Friendly staff. Spotless, comfortable rooms. What more can I say? Choose the Carlton and you won't be disappointed. 
30585 It was my first stay in this area and would recomend this hotel. Clean friendly staff and good food. The area is close to all major highways and there are plenty of good places to near by as well as shopping. 
30586 Great location CLOSE to the subway Clean room and large ( corner) nice view Complimentary breakfast basic but ok with perfect coffe Value for the money!!! 
30587 Fantastic "boutique" hotel just a few steps from Times Square. Everything you could ask for. Having stayed in NYC a number of times, this is by far the best hotel yet. The double/double rooms were huge! 
30588 Dirty and unkempt. Dust everywhere, air con broken (front falling off) and cracked toilet seat. Decieving from the outside and reception. But central and easy access to everywhere either on foot or subway. Would we go back to that hotel - No. 
30589 Great small hotel with a lot of individualized service. Lovely suite (lighting could have been better - esp for makeup) The hotel itself doesn't have huge variety of restaurants but it is so central that there is no need to ever eat there! 
30590 Filthy, peeling paint, green shower, and $190/night? fugettaboudit! Glenn Miller would roll over in his grave! 
30591 A really nice modern hotel, very clean, comfortable and very helpfull and friendfull staff - especially Raul at the door, who was always helpfull with tips about NYC! 
30592 Stayed here around graduation week as there was no other option. Room was old, smelly and with a dated kitchenette. Was a suite, but still small. Staff was very friendly and attentive, though. Restaurant looked interesting, but didn't try. Near UN and nothing else. Boring location. 
30593 No place to put luggage. The closet was too shallow to use. There was no option but the peek a boo showers. All in all a fun hotel but nothing to really justify the high rates 
30594 Stayed here in early December. Many of the hotels in the area were EXTREMELY expensive and this was a good value and the room was large. We were only a few blocks from Time Square so you could walk to a lot of the hot locals, restaurants and shopping! 
30595 Hotel ademt New York, sommige personeelsleden hadden blijkbaar een "off-day" anderen daarentegen waren weer uitermate vriendelijk en/of behulpzaam. Vlak bij de "Empire State, Madison square garden, Broadway en Times square". Centraal in "The Midtown" gelegen, top lokatie zeker in deze prijsklasse. 
30596 Very chic hotel in the heart of Times Square, steps to theatre, attractions, etc. Room was nice, very contemporary style, while I encountered a couple of small problems in the room,the service was excellent. Restaurant was very good and expensive. I would stay here again. 
30597 We booked rooms here for my daughter's Oct 2nd wedding. The hotel was immaculately clean and the staff were all very friendly. The food was always hot and plentiful at the breakfast buffet. I would highly recommend this location to all! 
30598 Hotel is great. Walk to penn station and short subway ride to theater district. Rooms a bit small but have wood floors. Nice touch. Beware though, the beds are shockingly firm and the shower is weird new-agey and has no door! 
30599 Solid choice in NYC. Room was big by New Yrok standards. Lovely view to Times Square. 
30600 Great hotel in great location,staff very friendly rooms amazing got upgraded to a spectacular room on second to last floor if building was fab.Recommend this hotel for any special treat as no not the cheapest but a big WOW factor can be had at the W 
30601 This is a great value for NYC. The rooms are smaller than average but it's New York city, don't you want to get OUT of the room a little? My first time at a hotel in the Kimpton chain but I like what was offered for the money. 
30602 Making a reservation somewhere I've never stayed before was making me a bit uneasy but once I arrived, all vanished. It is a wonderful hotel in the tradition of what New York offers its visitors. I will recommend it to all my fellow travelers. 
30603 Absolutely great location just next to underground station with new clean rooms. Friendly staff and free internet. There's a Starbucks right next to the hotel so the morning coffee is guaranteed. We are definitely coming again when traveling to NY. 
30604 Great location for us on a weekend trio into the city. Rooms were clean and comfortable. Staff was outstanding. 
30605 This hotel was the headquarters hotelfor VCU during the final four and their support and good wishes were over welming! Thanks we had a great time in Houston even though we didn't win. 
30606 The location is fantastic, the rooms are small for the big price. The staf is nice, but nothing far from normal. I had ants in my bathroom... and unless I got an extremelly good deal I wouldn't go back. 
30607 The hotel is well located. The Reims are a good size and are clean. The hall and elevator show signs of wear and it is an older hotel. The breakfast is basic. Towels and sheets are not plush. Good value for the budget conscious seeking accommodations in the Galleria area. 
30608 Ubicazione della struttura ottima, centralissimo, ideale per spostamenti a piedi che con i mezzi. Servizio adeguato al tipo di hotel. In fase di prenotazione abbiamo richiesto esplicitamente camera ai piani alti, richiesta subito esaudita. Personale ben formato, educato e super disponibile. Ci torneremo sicuramente! 
30609 This hotel is in a great location. Rooms were very nice and the beds were very comfortable. The free breakfast is an extra plus. We would stay there again. 
30610 We really enjoyed our stay, the staff was very helpful, especially Victoria Colon, who returned my phone charger that we forgot. 
30611 Hotel in un'ottima posizione per vedere New York a piedi. Pulizia nelle camere perfetta,gentilissimo lo staff, sempre disponibili per informazioni e suggerimenti. 
30612 In the heart of Chelsea, brand new hotel, and they are trying to win you back. The room was large by NYC standards, two double beds, flat screen TV and nice marble bathroom. The staff could not have been more helpful. 
30613 Clean and friendly service. Breakfast bar good but basic. 
30614 When I had a problem with the heating in the room the manager Eliza did a fantastic job sorting it out. He was helpful and courteous - beyond expectations. Overall prompt service made me feel welcome. Well-located for midtown. 
30615 The hotel lobby is too dark and the rooms are matchbox small. You can't turn sideways in the bathroom. 
30616 Stayed at the Doubletree Hotel for 1 week in April. Very nice, brilliant location. Just 3min walk down the road to bloomingdales and a further 5 mins to central park. Pleasent and situated in a great area. 
30617 Convenient location. Very clean. Everyone was very accommodating especially Will who greeted us and helped us with cabs and also Arron who was very helpful, friendly and went out of his way to help with bags to and from our car and transportation. Would definitely stay here again. 
30618 Heerlijk hotel, mooie kamers, schoon, goede service met name de concierge, perfekte ligging bij bekende winkels, wel ongezellige ruimte voor te ontbijten en ook erg duur. Spa perfekt, zeer klantgericht, mooie fitnessruimte 
30619 Selected this hotel because of the good reviews it received on trip advisor. We were not disappointed!! It is a sophisticated hotel, with stylish rooms and comfortable beds. We had a great stay!! 
30620 We love this place - we are warmly greeted and well treated by the staff. Great location ...all of Broadway is within walking distance. 
30621 I stayed at the 34th floor. Spacious room, friendly service and amazing view. I will highly recommend it! 
30622 a block away from time square. Great location 
30623 Great little pub next door. Friendly staff. 
30624 Look forward to go back! Devoted service, excellent food, concierge really nice and who is providing excellent advices (reservations, places to go to...). 
30625 Only an average experience. Small outdated rooms that have been fixed up several times over the years. I would stay here only if I got a great deal and was planning on spending very little time in the hotel. 
30626 Uvicacion excelente atracsiones excelente buenas tiendas y buenos parque para visitary buenos museos para visitar. 
30627 Stayed here while visiting my kids. For a moderately priced, well located (between Times Square and the Meatpacking District), Manhattan hotel it was very comfortable, clean, attractive with a helpful staff and a pleasingly soft trendy decor. 
30628 For 20 years I keep coming back to this hotel al least twice a year Special praise for the manager Pedro Jose Hilario and the very helpfull people at the door Krys Krol, Michael and Sal. 
30629 Arrived at hotel to a warm welcome. Got to room, where a call from reception, to make sure we were happy, soon followed. Luxurious room with the best bed and bedding possible. Really can't fault the hotel or service. We would return. 
30630 i like river view ,location, very clean hotel , very good price i miss swimming pool 
30631 The staff really makes the trip effortless. They know customer service. The rooms were so sleek and modern with huge comfortable beds! Even though its Chinatown it is so worth the cost because of the boutique style hotel and the service. Trust me, stay here and enjoy!! 
30632 Fuer NewYork ein annehmbarer Preis. Super Hotel, sehr schoene Barock-Empfangshalle,Zimmer einwandfrei,gross, sauber, und nicht zu laut, von 7.00 bis 10.30 Kaffee, Tee und Muffins inclusive. Lage 2 Strassen unterhalb des Empire State Building. 
30633 This hotel is on a really great place, in the center of New York, near the Penny Station. Looks like New York classic... 
30634 Stayed here one night back in November. Absolutely loved it. I don't have one complaint. We were able to check-in early. Staff couldn't have been better... The rates are definitely high, but I think worth it. Won't stay anywhere else from now on while in NYC... 
30635 The hotel experience was great and the service was friendly and attentive. Great food and beverage options without having to leave the hotel. Great views of the highline. Ill be back 
30636 Perfect location. Our first room was the smallest hotel room I have seen in 10 years of travel, but after an upgrade we were back styling in a beautiful room. Great staff complimented the great theme of the hotel. 
30637 Very nice hotel centrally located to the theatre district near Times Square. Clean and spacious room despite the single report on bedbugregistry.com from a year ago. The included breakfast was a little disappointing: coffee, tea and pastries (which were cold and not fresh on Sunday) only. 
30638 we stayed here for 7 nights and it was perfect, great location easy walking distance to main attractions, very comfortable and clean! Easily come back to the Affinia Dumont! 
30639 The Dead Boys used to live upstairs. John Spacely of "Story of a Junkie" lived here. Its a hell hole. It used to be a cool hell hole. Now its just a hell hole. 
30640 The Standard is one of the best hotels in NYC. Amazing location, design and staff. I would definitely recommend the hotel. 
30641 An average hotel on a great location 
30642 The staff takes the NY attitude to a new level and simply does not serve their clients. Avoid this place since at this price level you can definitely find other places which will better value you as their customer. 
30643 This hotel/hostel is a great place to stay on the upper west side convenient for everything. bit of chaos at reception at all times but aint no thang. Dino Carlucci 
30644 Simply disaster. 45$ for a night in a 6 bed dorm size not bigger than a small bathroom, with the broken air conditioning and insects! Awful, avoid it! 
30645 The Worst Hotel I Had Been In. See Photos of How Dumpy I Received the Room. http://home1.nikonnet.com/servlet/com.arcsoft.LoginNew?com=arcsoftBanner&awp=index3.html&DIRECT=&USERNAME=evl&PASSWORD=nikoneditor_18597999&WHO=memberguest 
30646 We spend one week in NYC. Great hotel, close to metro and restaurants. Nice staff, special thanks to Ramona who served us breakfast at Federal Cafe all week and gave us many smiles. Would recommend it to anybody. 
30647 The front desk staff didn't greet me once, despite coming and going at least 4 times in 24 hours. The rooms are outdated and the bed uncomfortable. Parking is $49 a night. Overall, not worth what you pay whatsoever. 
30648 We booked on the hotel website, with the possibly of upgrade at ckeck in $ 69.00 extra each day ti the towers hotel. This worked out really well we were upgraded to a beautiful suite. 
30649 First the person who handes the baggage was rude and make me mad I ask him a simple question and he came to me with a rude attitude 
30650 and the room didn't have a microwave we have a baby and need the microwave to warm the babys food 
30651 We stayed here for honymoon its was great position nad would go back. Price wise we found teh New Yorker better Value for monay.. 
30652 Short walk to Empire State Building ,Times Square ,Theatre District, 
30653 Wonderful room layout. Service was excellent. Would return in a heart-beat! 
30654 Spacious room with comfortable bed, good quality bathroom and plenty of amenities in the hotel. Reception staff were friendly and helpful. Centrally located hotel next to Times Square and subway nearby so easy to get around NYC. 
30655 The service at the Palace has always been great. Our room gave us access to the club which was a lovely place for a quick breakfast or a late night drink. The rooms in the Tower are nicer, however. 
30656 If you want to see New York this is a perfect spot. Minutes from Times Square and the tour buses. Really handy for theaters, shops and restaurants too. 
30657 Everything about it was easy - location was fantastic, room clean and comfortable, room service quick! I will absolutely return to this hotel when I'm in the area. 
30658 The rooms are small, but very comfortable, and immaculate -- and there's a lovely scent throughout the whole hotel. A ceiling fan is a great touch for Southerners like me! The staff is without a doubt the most accommodating I have ever experienced. 
30659 I stayed here this past weekend. The location was great. Room is adorable and large for NYC standards. I wanted to be close to Madison Square Garden and was literally across the street. I would definitely stay again. 
30660 I stayed over a business trip in this hotel and it was amazong, Philip Stark designed hotels are always great. Breakfast was nice but 30 dollars? Too much. The location is not so great, there are no cool restaurants near that. 
30661 Club quarters was excellent for our 4 night stay in Chicago, it was very clean, the service was prompt and the location was ideal. 
30662 What a lovely welcome to NY! The hotel decor is lovely, the staff are super helpful and friendly. Will definately stay here on my next visit. The only down side was that the rooms could do with brighter lighting for make up! 
30663 The staff was freindly,the service I received was outsanding all of my requirements where meet. Transportions needs where meet. 
30664 My husband and I stayed at the Regency Dec 1 through 3, 2004. Our room was very nice and the staff could not have been more accomodating. We usually stay on the west side but found that this location was very convenient. We would stay here again. 
30665 Clean...location is great.....but why charge $10 to run on the treadmill for 30 minutes?? I'm sorry but I think it tacky to charge guests to use the exercise room when you are paying over $200 a night. However, the things that needed to be important, were. 
30666 Between Amsterdam Ave and Broadway on 77st. Hudson river on one end, central park on the other. Nice suites. Lot's of food and breakfast right outside the door. 
30667 we got a fantastic deal on travelzoo, and really enjoyed our stay. The location is fantastic. I loved the lobby bar. The rooms were nice, and we had a lake view. I would definitely stay here again 
30668 Slept real good on the nice beds. comfy..The Inn is in a good location near good shopping and resturants. Was easy to get to and get on the hwy to travel to our destination. We will most certainly stay again good to have a familar place to count on. 
30669 We have never stayed at a hotel like this before,the staff is very friendly,pleasant and very helpful.It's a perfect location if you want to stay close to Times Square. 
30670 I stayed at the hotel just before Easter 2002 and thought it was one of the best value-for-money hotels that I've ever visited. The location,facilities,room quality,free breakfast and customer service were all Excellent. 
30671 The location is great (51st and 7th0 and the rooms lovely. Got a good price on the internet and then when we checked in they upgraded our room too! Nice continental breakfast comes with the room. Have stayed here before but this time was even nicer--we will definitely stay again. 
30672 The staff and hotel was awesome!!! The room was way better then I thought, 2 queen beds, they were so soft! Great Location! We will stay here again!!! 
30673 lovely room, large an airy for new York. we felt really welcomed and at home by the warm reception at the front desk,especially Liz. would def recommend it 
30674 We felt like we were treated as special guests. Our needs were addressed in a speedy and efficient manner. Friendly staff who were always interested in us. Would definitely come here again. We especially felt welcome by #21 and #28. 
30675 I was pleasantly surprised about the Yotel. It was very clean, new and above all close to the Javits Center. Galley is very convenient and wifi is complementary. Rooms are very small though but overall very nice experience. I will come back. 
30676 This was a very nice place to stay with our family. The rooms were clean and bright. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. It is a convenient location, in the heart of Manhattan. We also loved the easy access to the subway. 
30677 Never heard of hotel before I walked in. Usually stay at Magnolia but that place has gone down hill. Looks like i have found my new home. Wish i found it sooner. Loved the lobby music. Its all classic oldies, you can t help but sing along. 
30678 I stayed here for one night in a superior twin shared bath room. The shared bath is dirty and the room smelled like feces. It was horrible! 
30679 Very tired drab shabby hotel smells badly of cigarette smoke good location but thats the only plus that I can think of 
30680 un albergo incredibile, sia per la posizione, sia per la struttura. Stanze ipermoderne e confortevoli, solo un po rumorose per via dell'impianto di climatizzazione, ma per il resto si respira aria di grande mela.. Solo ripensandoci mi vengono i brividi... ci tornerei immediatamente. Tutti molto cortesi e disponibili, grandissima ny. 
30681 I have been stayed just one day but this hotel is so nice. If do you want to stay Houston Downtown, I recommend this hotel. You will be satisfied. 
30682 The hotel is old, but well maintained. It is in walking distance of some attractions, but if you are looking to spend lots of time at the Navy Pier or on the Magnificent Mile be prepared for a long walk or to take a cab. 
30683 This hotel is great to go and sleep, the service regarding bell boys, internet and restaurant is not the best, is a hotel only to sleep and that is all. The rooms have a great size and are very comfortable. The beds are great. 
30684 a nice hotel to stay:friendly,good location, comfortable 
30685 We had a great stay. While the room was on the small size, the big was a King and the bathroom was a really good size. Great location. We also enjoyed our meal and drinks in the bar and restaurant.. It had a really good vibe especially on the weekend. 
30686 Stayed in this hotel in Times Square. Had a wonderful arrival experience and a beautiful stay. perfect location. 
30687 Location is not great for restaurants and attractions, but they offer a nice shuttle. Front desk and breakfast staff were very friendly. And helpful. Rooms are ok but I was on the Hh floor and surprised by how much noise traveled between rooms. 
30688 Can't beat location, comfort, and service. Definitely my first option next time I go to NY 
30689 If you want to be in mid-town, and have all the charm of an older hotel..this one is great. Nice staff, larger rooms than normal in NYC...and wonderful location that is walkable to the museums, shops and business locations in Mid-town. 
30690 We read a few negatives about this hotel but on the whole it was a very good trip, staff hepfull and curtious, restuarant was excelent great foood, good freindly service and the location, what more can you ask for 
30691 This past weekend (4/8-4/10) I had a chance to stay at the Waldorf, it was quite an experience. Everyone was genuinely pleasant, and eagered to make sure you were comfortable. The architectural culture had a historic appeal. We were there for a Bridal Extraveganza we really did enjoy ourselves! 
30692 It was clean and had a nice breakfast buffet. It had everything I needed for my stay. It was small but for the price it was well worth it. I will stay there again and I usually stay at a lot of upscale hotels like the Hilton or Marriott. 
30693 The front desk guy was super-helpful. The free airport shuttle was timely. Typical Candlewood Studio Room was very clean. No problems. Great stay. 
30694 The staff was super friendly and helpful. Location wasn't too bad as we were near the financial district and close to the subway lines. 
30695 We spent eight nights in the hotel, everybody was very friendly and helpfull, nice spacious rooms. Very good beds. If we ever go back to New York we will choose the radisson again, thank you all. 
30696 We stayed for one night on our vacation to NYC. The hotel was clean and nice. The rooms seemed up to date. The rooms were clean. The front desk staff seemed friendly. The location was good and near a few subway stops. 
30697 Easy on the eyes and welcoming as we arrived. Check in was quick and cookies and hot chocolate and coffee were waiting in the lobby. Our room was comfortable and clean. Concierge was helpful and friendly. Top bed cover could have been cleaner. That was the only drawback 
30698 From the moment you set foot in the New York Palace, you feel like a princess. The property is elegant and full of character. The service was friendly and consistently good. The room was very large by New York standards, albeit that the view was not stellar! 
30699 My boyfriend and I went to NYC for a week and I decided to pick a hotel in Times Square so we could walk to a lot of stuff. It was amazing. It was a great trip and a great hotel!!! 
30700 The girls decided to take a shopping holiday to New York. I'm so happy we stayed at the Holiday Inn Express MSG. We found the staff to be friendly and helpful. We only paid 129US for a very comfortable room. Would definitely stay here again 
30701 Great hotel..consistant, friendly, clean...great staff.. John, Tia, Vanessa! 
30702 Convenient, clean and professional. I loved the contemporary style of this hotel. The hotel staff were exceptional. Rooms were large and roomy. The beds were outstanding. Great free wi-fi in the room a big plus. 
30703 Perfect beds, probably the best in NYC. Poor service. Excellent breakfast (included in price!). Ambivalent location (Times Square...). 
30704 I had a conference at the Times Center and missed the preferred rate for the Westin. I found this hotel and it was perfect. Great location, great service, clean. Of course it's tiny but what do you expect in prime area of NYC? 
30705 The Hotel is good enough. However i do not see this as a four star hotel. many details missing. But it is really good value for money. Everything is good (not excellent) Food however i suggest you eat somewhere else 
30706 ...showed up on my account after I returned home, since I declined the key to the mini-bar, I can't find out what this was...and they don't respond to my e-mails. Other wise, everything was ok. 
30707 The Bentley Hotel is a small boutique style hotel about a 20 minute walk from times square. We had a Junior Suite which was large and well equipped. Friendly staff and well worth considering if you can get a bargain. Only thing missing was a refridgerator in the room. 
30708 In this super expensive city, Parker Medidien stnads out for it's value for money. 
30709 The hudson is a very nice place. Very trendy and drawing a cool crowd at the bar at night. We had no problems, everything was in order and we enjoyed our stay very much. 
30710 I requested a non smoking room and they didn't have one available. The room stunk and they said they could move me the next day. The bathroom was clean but with the smell of stale smoke, it really didn't matter. The remote control didn't work either. 
30711 Newer hotel with clean rooms and bathrooms. It was close to MSG. Stayed on a lower floor and there was not a lot of street noise. Rooms are small, but that is expected of NYC hotels. Would stay again. 
30712 The best hotel in the world to travel with your dog. The bar/lounge is the best in the city,and you may sit there with your dog too. And the doormen are marvelous. 
30713 You don't get much for what you pay for. It is expensive, but every hotel in Manhattan is. HOWEVER, If you're looking for a clean, quiet hotel with friendly staff, in a safe neighbourhood, centrally located to most attractions this will be fine. Recommended! 
30714 We only stayed 1 night but the location couldnt of been any better! Staff was courteious. Room was clean. It suited our needs! 
30715 Free internet. Very convinient. Coffee 24/7. Good place to stay 
30716 Very good location. Proximity to many things, including good restaurants Indian food also available near by rooms ok. Service no great 
30717 What a location! We arrived, parked our car, and walked everywhere. It was such a breeze checking in, the staff was incredible, and only $93/night! We will definitely be coming back in the future. 
30718 Right near New York's Penn Station, good spot to head out to the rest of the city. Staff was very nice. Rooms were a bit small, but nice. 
30719 Very pleased with this hotel - recently stayed 5 nights. The room was large by New York standards, and it was very quiet too! Lounge was excellent although very crowded on weekdays. Good location for transportation. Staff was very professional too. Well done Marriott! 
30720 Stayed here when I visited Chicago. The location is pretty good as it is close to Michigan Avenue. The staff was friendly and the rooms were clean, albeit a bit too small. But for the price I paid, I would say it was a pretty decent hotel to stay in. 
30721 After reading all the negative reviews, I was surprised that my stay was so pleasant. Nothing fancy, but the room was clean, quiet and comfortable, and the staff was courteous. I would definitely stay there again. 
30722 Great hotel in a great location. Very clean and good value. i have stayed here very year for the past 6 years and recommend it. 
30723 Spacious, spotlessly clean room and bathroom. The hotel is centrally located and the food and drink available are of a very high standard. I've stayed at the Omni Berkshire many times before and I'll be coming back here again next time I come to New York. 
30724 Great location & helpful staff. Large suites.Terrific immediate neighbourhood by Carnegie Hall, MOMA, shopping. 
30725 A great staff, comfortable room, and oh that shower!! The room was extremely quiet, both from street noise and other guests. A nice touch was breakfast included, a NY Sunday Times and bottled water. 
30726 Went from 23 Dec to 1 Jan. Location is absolutely superb. No complaints at all. Go to the Belvedere if you want a really great base at a decent rate. 
30727 Everything was amazing. I love the rooms, the restaurant and the rooftop is definitely a most!!!!! The staff is really nice and helpful. I will definitely come back soon!!!! 
30728 Fantastic hotel if your staying in manhattan this is the hotel to be in, with it's own entrance to grand central station. All the staff are friendly and the hotel and the room could not be cleaner. 
30729 I went to this hotel to the famous New York marathon. The place is very nice and well cared for. First class hotel. The place is centrally located, close to the Central Station. We eat pretty well, the service is ok. 
30730 This was an excellent value for under $150 when we stayed here in May 2004. Large rooms for NYC, well maintained, thick walls for quiet, pleasant room for free continental breakfast, and (of course) great if busy location. 
30731 This is always a great hotel to stay at when visiting the windy city. Great people, nice rooms, great service and always a great place to rest your body in the evening. 
30732 Good location and price is good, just the room is small. 
30733 Hotel perfect for soho shopping trip. Hotel is very modern and has a great rooftop gym and bar. David Burke restaurant was ok. The concierge gave great dining recommendations. 
30734 (review of Captains Cabin) Amazig location, such a fun, stylish hotel. Cafe Gitane room service, awesome bar, great look and rooms (while small) are well kitted out with nice bathrooms. Wouldn't hesitate to return 
30735 Christine was very helpful, and help made our stay even better 
30736 I have stayed in the lower east many times and would not hesitate to return. Nothing was to much trouble for the staff. I will be recommending this to friends and colleges. I am pleased the standard have moved into the lower east. 
30737 The hotel was nice!! You can tell it's been in that location for a long time but it was nice and clean, Will definitely stay there again. The staff was super friendly! 
30738 Very competent and friendly staff, Simone at mission control deserves special mentioning. Great location, very modern and clean. Free wifi and breakfast. Will definitely stay here again. Thanks! 
30739 Free parking, free wi-fi, clean bathroom and clean comfy beds. There was a great little restaurant on-site and several others within 1 block. The best part is the location...we got a CTA fun pass and saw the city without worrying about driving. I'd stay here again for sure! 
30740 Love The place... Quiet Roma with great decor! The servir is good and Breakfast is oweaome. 
30741 A good (and good value) NYC hotel. Conveniently located in midtown (great if driving in on the FDR as I was). Rooms are larger than most in NYC though the views are underwhelming. Everything is clean and comfortable. 
30742 Everyone was very nice and helpful Room and bathroom decent size for NYC 
30743 Ligging erg goed,op loopafstand van broadway en andere leuke dingen. Kamers erg netjes lekker ontbeten om de hoek bij de bagelexpress. Niet in de topdrukte en er toch vlakbij. Vriendelijk personeel,erg behulpzaam. Enige minpuntje bed is wat aan de kleine kant... 
30744 great prices, great service, clean, the most comfy beds! 
30745 This hotel is very well located,close to metro station,far only about 50 ft., as well to the Penn Sation,and has got a very friendly staff.I and my wife apreciate too the several facilities around the hotel like restaurants,shops and so on. 
30746 This is one of those hotels which is looking a little under the weather and is in need of a make-over. Service, rooms etc. are fine, location is great but it is obvious that a make-over is needed. Decor, carpets are furnishing all need to be replaced. 
30747 I love the location of this hotel, very nice and walkable to michigan ave. Stayed here on my last night in Chicago. Not bad for the price and the room was pretty big and the beds were very comfy. Overall, a good place to stay downtown. 
30748 Wonderful hotel ! very nice staff. just a pretty room, with a confortable bed :) Not a lot of noise and just an amazing view from our room ! It's very very close to Times Square, approximately 10 minutes by foot. And also close to Central Park (10-15 min ). 
30749 We've stayed at the Omni a number of times for the last 7 years and have always been pleased. The rooms are nice, the location is great and I have always found the staff to be very accomodating. 
30750 nice sized room , great broadway location, pleasant staff, fair prices 
30751 I stayed here with my sisters and mother. It was a nice retreat away from the hustle and bustle with quaint restaurants and bars near by. Douglas was extremely friendly and helpful....A +++ customer service. 
30752 Clean place with friendly staff. I would only stay there again if it was the cheapest in chicago. My wife would prefer a little more luxurious. No hot tub. Sheets were very soft & comfy. 
30753 Beautiful hotel. Great location. Pure bliss. Loved it. 
30754 first time at the staybridge hotel new york, hoping to go again next year. Accomodation well above standard, all staff outstanding esspecially Jamie at the door who helped us on a few occasions. Well done staybridge you made our holliday the best ever. Lynne & Paul Chapman.UK. 
30755 Loved it. Completely wonderful from beginning to end. Loved every minute of the experience. 
30756 Suberb location. To be a hotel in New York, the rooms were impressively huge. Very nice and helpful staff. If you don't have a quite high budget stay away to eat in the hotel. My next travel to New York I will for sure stay at the Waldorf Astoria hotel. 
30757 Stayed with my partner 29.05-4.06.06 I must say that the health club is the best I have ever been to.. This is really special. Sport lovers - this is our paradise. SPA is not bad as well :)) Rooms - not the biggest but pretty cozy. Very helpful concierge! 
30758 Hip en trendy vormgegeven hotel. sAvonds is de club in het hotel gezellig, maar geeft ook wat lawaai naar de kamers. Netjes en schoon. Het kan erg druk worden en daardoor lange wachttijden bij de liften. 
30759 This hotel is in a good location near Penn Station. Room was clean,affordable and quiet..Would stay here again. 
30760 A very nice hotel. Close to lots of restaurants. Front desk staff at check in was very cordial and helpful. Room was clean and relatively new furnishings. No closet and small bathroom so not designed for lengthy stays. Excellent breakfast. Plenty of parking. 
30761 This hotel was fantastic! Great location, hip bar, modern decor. Rooms aren't enormous but are roomy enough, and the bed, pillows and down comforter are amazing! We also got a very reasonable rate on-line. Plus there are Bliss products in the bathroom! I would definitely stay here again. 
30762 hotel was nice, staff was friendly, would stay again 
30763 Right in the middle of Times Square, yet quiet and secure. Great service and hospitality. 5 minute cab ride from Penn Station. Couldn't ask for more. 
30764 Very good nice, stylish hotel with modern rooms, good staff and a bit of "hip attitude" without getting ridicilous. Good location to reach downtown/wall street and Tribeca and the other areas up north. A very good option for a 4* in the area. 
30765 Great location, grand lobby, rooms disappointing in comparison. Their in-room wifi charging is a scam as it's per device not per room. Two mobiles, one night, two charges of $15. 
30766 very good location close to time square and if you want go out and around new york city. 
30767 The staff was fantastic, the service was second to none, the location was perfect, I travel to NY often on business and usually stay at Hilton at double the price. You simply cannot beat the value and location. 
30768 Spend a night in the city with my wife for an NYC event. We had a wonderful room very clean and room was very comfortable. Staff was great and very helpful. 
30769 We stayed 3 nights in executive floor...very nice room (2 beds 2 rooms 2 bathrooms)...cool location...but too crowded...breakfast more full than possible... 
30770 I loved the hotel. I really loved it. Staff were so nice and friendly, Could not do enough for you. Room was clean big and comfortable. Highly recommend this hotel to everyone I know. It is so central to everything. 5 mins from everywhere. 
30771 Best doorman in town especially Yasir suliman he really helped me during my whole stayed. 
30772 not as bad as we expected, hotel is basic but clean and comfortable. rooms are ok in size. good location and lots of good places to eat nearby. subway is close by as is central park. would definatly go back 
30773 The rooms are nice, clean, comfortable, well decorated, and organized for such a small space. The staff was friendly and helpful, overall a great value. 
30774 The hotel is very well located right in the heart of time square..they have a very helpful staff and very useful concierge.. The restaurant has great food and in all a very lively place..I recommend staying here. Kudos to the general manager. 
30775 All people working in that hotel was impolite and not helpfull. Internet connection was not free and wifi signal was crap. I had to bed so my room would be cleaned at 15:00. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY. 
30776 An excellent but not cheap hotel. Rooms are large (by New York standards), the beds comfortable and the bathroom wonderful. Staff very efficient but also friendly. Great gym and breakfast a pleadure to eat. Highly recommended. 
30777 The hotel room was spartan but fine, however, I honestly do not understand how a highrise hotel can operate with service carts and personnel constantly tieing up the elevators? On more than one occasion it took over 10 minutes to reach the lobby from the 25th floor, literally 
30778 This hotel is very clean and the staff is just wonderful. 
30779 I just want to say the staff is very nice! Liza in particular at the front desk is very kind! You cant beat the location and the price! oh...the door guy is easy on the eyes too! 
30780 Stayed here with family in 2011. Got a "suite" and we had an excellent stay. Good location as well. 
30781 My wife and I stayed for a long weekend, and we chose the Westin because of its proximity to Times Square and the Broadway shows. It didn't disappoint. We stayed on the 38th floor. Rooms are nice in size and are quiet. It's expensive but worth the extra price. 
30782 I stayed at the Waldorf Astoria in NYC on September 7th-10th. It was my second time staying there and they get better and better. Their customer service is impeccable. Love, love them! 
30783 Great location, clean room and friendly, helpful staff. Other than the noisy old air conditioner we were completely satisfied.I was expecting more character since it's an older hotel but there is none....not a big deal however. 
30784 I stayed at the W from a Fri-Tues and every bit of the experience was wonderful. From the extra helpful doormen/bellstaff to the fun and friendly front desk personnel, the service and quality is excellent! I will try to stay there again on my next trip to NYC. 
30785 Hotel was conveniently located to Reliant Stadium for the Final Four and also only about a mile from the great shops and restaurants in Rice Village. One day it was raining and the general manager personally drove us to Bracket Town, which was located in downtown Houston. 
30786 We have been coming here for years. It is an amazing hotel- very upscale and classy. Perfect location, and incredible staff. Couldn't ask for a better hotel in my eyes. 
30787 This was a very nice hotel in a terrific location -- close to freeways and lots of restaurants. Hotel was well kept up and our first floor room was very quiet. Would definitely stay here again! 
30788 Wonderful time, exactly what we wanted. Terrific location, beautiful room, but what made the hotel special was the people. They were so helpful and friendly and answered all of our questions. 
30789 all ex+ service clean rooms, soft queen size bed, large bathroom, good breakfast and free entry for steam room, sauna and swimming pool! a little bit noisy air recycling... nothing compares to the Times Square soundtrack! Super central position 
30790 The location was absolutely perfect, right in the heart of manhattan and walking distance to just about everything. great staff and very clean rooms. 
30791 You're in the heart of the city (with a free car ride to the jazz clubs and restaurants of Rush St. if you want) and it's just a nice place. Enjoy. We did and will do it again. Most amazing of all was the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. 
30792 Location is great. Staff is welcoming. Room was bigger than I thought it would be (room 1526). You will not be dissapointed. 
30793 The staff was terrific and very friendly. The room was clean and the crib for our five month old daughter was very nice. The location is ideal. Great hotel and service. 
30794 tres bien place ( env 10 mn de l emire stae building ) et a 2 mn des stations de metro. ceux qui auront la chance d avoir une chambre cote rue auront une vue sur l empire. bonne literie. rien a redire. 
30795 It is apparent that the hotel is ready for a refurbishment and notices across the hotel state this is happening 2013. Despite this we were not disappointed, yes decor tired but clean and roomy. Staff were very pleasant and all in all great value for money. 
30796 Hotel centralissimo ma stanza piccolissima e molto rumorosa!!! Receptionist inesistenti e alla mia richiesta si stampare il new York city pass mi hanno detto dove comprarlo... 
30797 I was a guest of a member of Soho House NYC club. As a result, I enjoyed the benefits of well mixed drinks on the uber cool rooftop deck on a hopping evening in the Meatpacking district. A very memorable experience, and one I relished, and will relish in memory. 
30798 Loved the rooms, the atmosphere and the service (bell man, concierge, front desk, phone person were all very friendly). Cleanliness in the rooms need to improve. Location is not trendy, but not far from all the main areas. Overall the value was great, very satisfied for the cost x benefit. 
30799 Great package price with parkin, walking distance to times square, close to metro. Not very clean, cigarette smoke on floors, elevators slow! 
30800 this hotel was great, just got back stayed on the 37th floor which had an awesome view of the city. Staff nice and helpful. Room was huge for NYC standards I think. Great location, pleanty of restaurants and can walk to Times Square quicky. Highly Suggest going there. 
30801 room adjacent to lift shaft....could hear lift starting and stopping all night. room 'adjoining' therefore noise from next room could be heard....t v from 2 to 4 am 
30802 Great rooms, yummy beds, good size.. Staff very polite, helpful , excellent bar upper and lower perfect access to the Village, Soho and Wall Street. Surrounded by fantastic restaurants. Wonderful time Geoff & Wendy 
30803 Got a great deal through priceline name your own price. The room was very small just enough room for one person. It was clean and adequate I definitely would not pay full price for this hotel. The lobby and staff were great. Location was great and convenient. 
30804 My first review, but I've stayed here oodles of times. LOVE the newly renovated rooms - tres chic and with the comfort that Affinia is known for. Always a warm welcome from the team (especially Steve, the Hotel Manager) and a quick walk too and from Penn Station. 
30805 I would recommend this hotel to anyone if you looking to stay close to Times Square. Close to all the main attractions, great view looking down Times Square from hotel room. Room very spacious and big. No complaints would recommend it. 
30806 I stayed here one night on a business trip. The hotel was very clean and my bed was very comfortable. I stay at many hotels while on business and this was one of the better ones. Good location and the staff was very friendly. I will stay here again. 
30807 one point to improve: there is not enough place for the breakfast. 
30808 We enjoyed our nicely decorated and comfortable room which we booked at the very good senior rate Marriott often offers. I was especially pleased that the manager remembered my name and greeted us in a friendly manner. 
30809 We loved the Belvedere..Very close to everything,and the rooms were very nice and clean,and spacious by NY standards.. Staff was friendly,and very helpful !! Definetly will be staying here again.. 
30810 Attenzione ai camerieri...vi addebiteranno consumazioni mai effettuate...per cui non avrete mail il rimborso! 
30811 Superb hotel! Spacious suite for 3 single travellers including 3 double beds. Friendly and helpful staff, very attentive. Great location with nearby bank and a good choice of restaurants. Complimentary herbal teas also a nice touch! 
30812 Big room for Manhattan standards, great free breakfast, free wireless. The only thing I missed was a fridge in the room. 
30813 very glad to return to the Park central stayed here in 1984 very large room excellent service and close to the park. Breakfast bar on ground floor was staffed by a delightful lass and the offering was wholesome would not think to stay anywhere else in NY 
30814 This is a great boutique hotel. I told the staff that i might have another guest. I was given an upgrade without asking for it. 
30815 It was cheap, but the hallways smelt of urine and the public bathrooms were not kept clean. I could feel the springs through the bed and the sheets were so thin you could see through them. 
30816 Stayed for just one night but was very happy with the warm and kind service provided. Clean, neat rooms are a bit tight but ok. Location is just one block away from Macy's, shops, restaurants, very good. Good value overall. Will come back if I have the opportunity. 
30817 The hotel is well located with an antique look & feel and helpful staff. The standard room is not very spacious according to the american standards, but big enough for the european ones. I found it a bit overpriced and noisy at nights besides the ridiculous prices at the minibar. 
30818 We love this hotel. Great location, great view of the park from the pool and great burgers! 
30819 What a great Hotel this is. Very friendly staff, ideal location, good price and loads of free coffee. This was my second stay in New York, and I would strongly recommend this Hotel. 
30820 I stay here once a month for business, The price is good, the rooms are clean and considering the planes fly right overhead you do not hear them. It is a busy hotel, nad could do with some renovating. 
30821 Refreshing colors in the room. Free wifi that is excellent for travelers and work needs. Good free coffee machine in the room and tea. But limited to 3 capsules only. Close to the subway that is very convenient Only wish that they have included breakfast 
30822 Just back from an excellent stay at The Palace. We stayed 4 nights and service was impecable. The doormen, the concierge, the mail room staff, breakfast service, every single person we met was very professional and helpful. Location is perfect, although Manhattan offers many "perfect locations". 
30823 hotel situado en la calle 44 con la 5 avda.Muy bien situado.Hablan castellano en recepcion.Al menos nuestra habitacion espaciosa,cama grande. Para las necesidades del hotel en N.Y muy adecuado.Tiene gimnasio e internet gratis. 
30824 Excellent location, nice rooms. Very modern style and neat. Very kind staff, always willing to help you. Check inn was really easy and quick. Yobot it's so fun, you can store your luggage until your plane or train leaves. I'll totally recommend it !! 
30825 A stylish boutique hotel perfectly located. We had a suite which was very large and such a comfortable bed. 
30826 I love everything the location is walking distance to a ferry going to Liberty Island. All the front desk staff are nice.. Its a cool place... The design of the rooms is so nice evrything is nice! nice! nice! 
30827 Amazing hotel .. well worth the money. Very central so you are only a few minutes from the Hudson River / Broadway / Central Park .. the rooms have amazing views out over the city :) 
30828 Perfect hotel for an early flight! All the basics were covered. Free shuttle that brings you to the airport. Expensive for what you get but I assumed it is because it's right by the airport...Bed was comfortable but the pillows are ridiculously small! 
30829 Hotel impiegato spesso per motivi di lavoro. E' situato nei pressi di Time Square, quindi comodo. Camere eleganti e spaziose. 
30830 Enjoyed staying here before but this time lots of renovation type noises at 8 pm and we chose to pay for an upgrade that would give us Internet access. The access was a bad experience and the room was too cold. 
30831 Spent four fantastic nights at The Franklin... ...nothing else to say, just wonderful, thank You! Lars and Tina Sweden 
30832 I visited Houston for family wedding in June with my family. I stayed for 3 days. Stay was pleasent, staff was friendly, breakfast was good. Price was reasonable. My kids enjoyed the stay at the hotel. I would recommoned. 
30833 Stayed here for 2 days in October and this was the most convenient location. We were able to walk to everything we needed- public transportation, restaurants, broadway shows. A little pricey but it was great 
30834 Our third stay at this very conveniently located Manhattan hotel. Spacious rooms, complimentary WiFi; tea, coffee and hot chocolate available at all times and a fairly generous breakfast buffet. Staff was generally friendly. 
30835 Got a good deal on priceline. The location is great, right in Midtown. A little underwhelming at check-in, the front desk staff doesn't go out of their way to be helpful, but the rooms are a good size for NYC, clean, comfy beds, and again, the location is great. 
30836 very nice hotel, staff are very friendly and helpful, rooms are clen and fresh.shuttle service is quick and reliable , and it's a walking distance to shopping area. i really enjoyed staying there 
30837 Great Hotel! great location, rooms were clean, location was great, and the price was good taking into account the location. 
30838 The hotel room was updated and larger than other rooms I have used in NYC. If you can stand the crowds of Times Square, I recommend this hotel 
30839 We stayed here in June. Fabulous location, right in the heart of new york. Close to Broadway. Loved the hotel and its contemporary feel. The bar and bar tenders were fantastic and helped us to find good restaurants. Small plate food was really good. Highly recommend 
30840 Friendly staff who make you feel you are not just another guest. Good value and well located. My #1 choice hotel to stay in Manhattan 
30841 I like the hospitality and friendliness of the staff of the hotel. Enjoyed our dinner at S Dynasty with its excellence food and romantic ambience. It's within walking distance to 5 Ave for shopping! 
30842 Nice view on the upper floors. Stayed on the 16th floor, could see some of the lights in the theater district. Bed was comfortable...location was excellent. Great place if you plan on catching a show and don't want to pay for an expensive hotel. 
30843 very well located and spacious rooms. Rooms are not so good isolated because we were at the 52n floor and still hear the sirenes during night. There is not so much space for hanging clothes. It's a pity that the hotel doesn't have a spa. 
30844 The housekeeping was very friendly and helpful as well as the front desk but the concierge service was terrible; they were not helpful, too busy and unfriendly. We were left to figure things out on our own. 
30845 This hotel is idealy sited for transport to all the main attractions ndits good value for money too. 
30846 Expresss elevator and all in service - No waiting made daily trips from room to street stress-free! 
30847 Great lobby, great history. In dire need of renovation. Paint cracked, wallpaper peeling, stuff broken. It's time for Hilton to bring this historic property back from the dead! 
30848 Stunning views, huge clean spacious rooms, super friendly staff - there was nothing to fault. Made a family of 5's 10-day trip to New York City all the more enjoyable. Could not recommend this hotel highly enough. 
30849 We went for the Tut exhibit, so the location of this hotel couldn't have been better. The staff was helpful and friendly, and it's a great value, too. The continental breakfast was like feeding time at the zoo, but overall our stay was pleasant. Nothing to complain about here! 
30850 I have been staying here for several years. The service, cleanliness, etc. has always been consistent with the chains specifications. They are presently doing updates. There were a couple of updates since my last visit. I would recommend this location to any business traveler, etc. 
30851 luxury boutique midtown manhattan,10min walk for 5th avenue!just super!very big room,very clean and the staff very friendly!!! 
30852 I stayed at this hotel again for business purposes. I think it's growing on me. I had a really good experience. The convenience to Greenway Plaza can't be beat. Also, if you want to visit Lakewood Church, it's a 2 min walk. 
30853 had a great experience. beautifully remodeled room. nice computer station - all connections available. flat screen, lights in the mirror in the bathroom so that the fog clears. my teenage boys loved the lobby interior. very courteous staff. 
30854 Great staff, VERY VERY friendly and helpful. The rooms were not the best. The beds left me with aches every morning. The carpet wasn't the cleanest. The location was awesome. We were able to walk most places. 
30855 wannabe swanky in glammed up times square. nice, but not typical westin-quality rooms nor typical westin-quality service. but, hey! who cares? you're in new york! 
30856 A beautiful hotel with an excellent staff that is elegant and sophisticated, yet warm and friendly. The room was beautifull and so clean! From the moment you arrive to the moment you depart you are cared for with top of the line service. 
30857 Great hotel with just enough space for everything to be comfortable. The atmosphere is upbeat and youthful with fun music playing and a general buzz around the building. All of the staff is more than friendly. 
30858 ottima posizione per visitare new york, colazione incredibile very american style, ottima pulizia, l'unico problema e' stato che non siamo riusciti a connetterci con internet anche perche' lo staff purtroppo non capiva bene l'italiano, da consigliare............... 
30859 Excellent place to stay. High quailty feel for less. Clean, good service.. free wifi, walking distance to food places and safe at night. Has a pool and also close to the airport. Even has computers and printers you can use for free. ! excellent pic. 
30860 Good hotel, easy walking distance to the theaters and public transport. Room service was good. Unfortunately, an encounter with a very rude manager left me with an overwhelmingly negative opinion of this hotel. I will not stay here again. 
30861 I previously stayed here before for a business trip last year and it was a no brainer to return. Like before service was great! Looking forward to my next stay. 
30862 Nice staff, conveniently located and everything walking distance. Rooms are clean and "tipical size" for NY 
30863 After years of staying in hotel after hotel in New York City, I have found one that is a calm, inviting and inviting place to be. The staff is excellent, the food wonderful and don't miss the swimming pool. It was worth the wait to find this place. 
30864 Great Place to stand for business Excelent location. 
30865 You will be amazed at the downtown parking rates. Call ahead because it can add up to $100. a day to the bill. Palm Restaurantis great. 
30866 I really like the Andaz collection by Hyatt. All hotel are very modern and staff are all very knowledgeable about area. Rooms are very modern and clean as well. I stayed here to attend the US Open in Flushing Meadows, only a few blocks away from subway. 
30867 The rooms were large, clean, spiffy and all had an area for a lounge suite and lounge chair.The location was amazing and the staff great.For groups, try to get out of the $3 surcharge per person per night...we did! its tipping in disguise of a charge. 
30868 Centrally located and decently priced. Staff extremely courteous. The little lobby was small and unattractive, but the ladies working in it were warm and friendly. They were efficient and did a wonderful job. Room ergonomically designed and interesting. Very clean and comfortable. 
30869 This was my second stay in this hotel. The staff is helpfull ! You have free wireless. Very nice breakfast (delicious muffins) Nice view!Close to times square and city center. Good quality/price ratio for NY! I would go back, and reccomend it from every point of view! 
30870 I visited New York with my father and we stayed a few nights at this hotel. The room was amazing and the view from the top floor was beautiful! 
30871 Great location to come and experience Chicago! Just around the corner from the shopping. Nice people at the front desk. Rooms are nice. Beautifull lobby. Will definitely come back next time we are in Chicago. 
30872 This is my third stay at the Crowne Plaza Times Square and the hotel keeps getting better. The location is great, the rooms are large with very good bathrooms and the staff, this time around, was very pleasant and helpful. A very good stay. 
30873 We had a delightful stay at the W in NYC. Times Square lit up the night sky and the view fro our room was spectacular. I was a bit uncomfortable with the glass walled bathroom. Privacy wasn't an option until we had the bellman bring us a blackout shade. 
30874 Staff were superb friendly and very helpful, breakfast was a scrum unless you got in early. Great location, the only downside was the size of the room, 2 suitcases at the end of the bed made it feel like Times Square in the rush hour, crammed 
30875 For the cost this place was awlful. Room was tiny, with an even smaller bathroom. The room was so small two people have to take turns moving around the room. Bathroom was a sink with no counter top, toilet, stand up shower. 
30876 We had an excellent stay at the Alden. The hotel was very nice and clean. It was also in a great location. The staff was courteous and professional. I will return to Houston and the Alden will be my hotel of choice. 
30877 I've stayed here on a few occasions and have never been disappointed. It's location is convenient to shopping and many great restaurants. Rooms are comfortable and the staff attentive and the best part is a reasonable price. 
30878 The location was close enough to walk to Times Square easily. The rooms were nice and clean. 
30879 Enjoyed our recent stay at the Courtyard Downtown. Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful with directions. Our room was clean and comfortable. Great location and would definately stay here again. 
30880 This hotel goes from bad to worse - first impressions are the porn shop downstairs and the filthy reception area. The rooms are tiny, dirty and in terrible repair but the worst part is the other guests - the vermin!!! DO NOT STAY HERE! 
30881 Large rooms, friendly staff, ok restaurant, breakfast very expensive. WiFi should be free given the room charge. 
30882 a really good upmarket hotel. the hotel and its rooms are as good as the web site pictures. convenient location 5 mins from central park which is great for a pre- breakfast walk. take a helicopter tour of nyc-extravagant but leaves a lasting memory. 
30883 Ok, la location e' ottima ma i muri sono troppo sottili e l'hotel pieno di maleducati e non e' possibile dormire 
30884 Staff and employees were perfect. And very clean hotel. Room wallpaper could be renovated... 
30885 Very nice hotel in downtown Houston in a convenient location besides the Convention Center - Restaurants were top shelf with fair prices - The guest rooms were very nice with one of the best mattresses I have ever had at a Hilton property. All in all very nice Hilton property. 
30886 This was my third time at the Parker Meridien. It is as good or better than the other, more expensive hotels at which I have stayed - Essex House, Regency, Plaza. The rooms are good sized and the staff is very good. Tom and Jerry on the elevator = awesome. 
30887 Stayed there for two nights at end of Jan 2010 and were very satisfied. Rooms were smallish but well appointed. Bose Sound Docks in each room were excellent. Fantastic location close to everything in mid-town. Balcony was another plus. 
30888 Fantastic hotel. Ideal location. We were given one of their executive suites on the top floor because it was my mum's 60th birthday. Absolutely huge! Must be one of the biggest hotel rooms I have ever stayed in! We had a brilliant time. 
30889 Great place to stay so close to time sq, rooms are clean and up to date, love the decor, and the price you can't find any better, we will be back :) very happy 
30890 I stayed at the InterContinental New York Barclay for 4 nights. I stayed there while having a conference in Philadelphia because I love this hotel. From the moment you walk in to the moment you leave, SERVICE is great! Rooms are beautifull!!! 
30891 Had a great stay at the NY Marriott East Side. The staff was above and beyond friendly and helpful from the valets, bellman, front desk staff and housekeeping staff. Lobby was beautiful. Guest room was larger than normal by NY standards and well appointed. Location was convenenient. Would definitely return! 
30892 Hi we really liked the upscale furnishings and amenities in the small room. Parking was really convenient and staff was really nice. Bar prices are steep we thought - two glasses of house wine cost $34.00 plus tip. 
30893 Pros -> great location, good gym (they have complimentary chair massages, the trainer gives excellent neck and shoulder massages) Cons --> bad lighting, always seems extremely dark like walking into a nightclub, erratic about green choice enforcement 
30894 Really nice area, close to shopping and subway station. The hotel was clean and very quaint. I really enjoyed my stay. Staff was friendly but not over the top. Would definitely stay again. 
30895 el check-in fue muy facil apesar de lo facil habia personal tratando de ayudar, hubicacion cerca de todo, habitaciones, pasillos muy limpios, puedes utilizar las computadoras e imprimir tus pases de aboradar sin costo. 
30896 Great hotel and good location to downtown Houston. However, there is nothing to do there. 
30897 Would recommend the Staybridge comparing to other accommodation we experienced in New York this is value for money. Cheers Steve Aus 
30898 The Hilton is a well appointed, first class hotel. Purpose of my review is to commend Raquel Ortiz, front desk associate on her excellent custoemr service. She was able to check me in early and give me an upgraded room. 
30899 the hotel was very clean all amenities gym , sauna bar, restaurant, staff was friendly , Chief Cincierge is friendly and Knowledgeable, her name is Vaness Torruellas, thank you Iroquois Hotel for making our stay in NYC a pleasant and Relaxing experience. 
30900 Super friendly staff. Helpfull in every aspect of my stay. Everyone was respectful and seemed to enjoy their position with the company. Very well maintained property 
30901 So close to the action but so peaceful when you enter the location and room. Clean rooms well equipped for an enjoyable stay. 
30902 I chose this hotel because of the reviews I read - I was not disappointed! The staff really do make your stay enjoyable and are happy to assist with requests. I had a lovely suite and felt it was a good value. 
30903 If you are looking for a simple, clean room for a value this is a good hotel. In the middle of trendy Tribeca and walking distance to restaurants like NOBU. Our room with one double bed was super small. 
30904 Service is nonexistent and the rooms are very small. The staff was unable to do simple tasks like bring pillows or provide the items offered on the menu. The coffee they have outside the guest rooms was very good but not worth the lack of hospitality. 
30905 I liked it. Kind of reminds me of a B&B-type room. It was very cozy. 
30906 Hotel Beacon exceeded our expectations during our stay in June 2005. Excellent loaction - one stop via the express #2 train to 42nd St. Walk to Central Park. Out of Mid-Town madness. Kitchennette and grocery stores across the road resulted in savings. 
30907 Nice location, right near Carnegie Hall and Central Park. Check the subway plans, there are several possibilities within walking distance, depending on where one wants to go. 
30908 I never stayed at the Hotel Riverview but live in the neighborhood. Believe all the negative reviews. This place is downright scary. There are drug addicts and transgender prostitutes that frequent here. I always feel sorry for the unknowing tourists I see arriving outside this hotel. STAY AWAY! 
30909 Great hotel for the price, great Location, and amenities were great 
30910 Superb location, near theaters, 2 blocks from Park Ave, 2 blocks from Central Park. Great rooms, clean, quite, good breakfast Stayed there for 2 nights and I was close to everything I wanted. 
30911 We travel a lot and stay at W hotels whenever we can. Although this was our first stay at the Chicago Center City W, Justin Sullivan took care of us like we were regulars. VIP treatment all around, amazing room and a great stay over all. Thanks again W! 
30912 We got the 1104 room, top floor, no buildings in front of us. Empire State view from the bed. The only issue is the sleep quality because of a group of young neigbours doing a party every night. Business center $1 / 5min. Good breakfast. 
30913 Excelent service from a great team! Great location, right by Central Park in a relatifly quit street. Room was kind a small but than again, you're in New York. Complementary breakfast was a nice surprise. The hotel was very affordable. We would certainly stay yhere again! 
30914 Great Location!! NIce restaurant bar..rooms could have been a litte bigger, but all-in-all is a lil diamond in the ruff. 
30915 The hotel is located in a nice area, close to many famous sights. Service at the hotel was very unpersonal and indifferent, and a bad surprise that wireless internet had to be purchased at a pretty high price. 
30916 Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The staff were all super friendly and very knowledgable. Room was a little small but that did not detract from our overall experience. We got a super rate and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and value received was impressive. 
30917 Fun modern rooms with great views. Walking distance to: Millenium Park, North Michigan, and lake walking paths. Nicer than the huge conference hotels just down the block. 
30918 La posizione dell'hotel e la fermata della metro' fa di questo hotel un ottimo punto di riferimento per chi si muove a piedi 
30919 Personalmente eravamo al 45 piano stanza lussuosa e gradevolissima come confort. Veramente un ottimo risveglio dopo una giornata di camminata grazie ai letti morbidissimi e comodissimi. 
30920 In every way, this is a typical Courtyard by Marriott. Good staff. Recently redone with the Courtyard decor and lobby arrangement. Beware of the freeway construction it can make for a challenging drive to some parts of the west loop area. 
30921 I have to share this little gem, it was clean, and friendly, and I love the low key location. I only stayed one night with my family, but I will stay longer next time. We were pleasantly surprised. Thanks Affinia Gardens were enjoyed our stay. 
30922 My extended family and I stayed at the hotel for 4 nights/5 days for a girls trip in NYC. We found the hotel room clean and efficient. The hotel is well situated downtown extremely close to several subway lines. 
30923 I and my darling husband run away from Brooklyn to this exquisite heaven for our anniversary. It is the craziest thing we ever did for the occasion. Clean and stylish room. Thanks to everybody 
30924 We visited on an overnight occassion with our young grandchildren. Having previously stayed at the hotel when known as Shelburne Murray Hill, we were not disappointed. The location is great, service outstanding, clean room, wonderful value. Visit ended with an excellent breakfast at the hotel restaurant, Rare. DEFINETLY WILL RETURN!!!!! 
30925 My wife and I spent the week of 10/15-10/22 at the grace. The hotel and staff exceeded our expectations. I doubt you will find a better deal the room rate was very reasonable (for Manhattan). I highly recommend the Grace. 
30926 I was disappointed in the overall condition of the hotel and the service. I would definitely not stay there again if traveling to New York. The hotel isn't clean and the staff is arrogant. 
30927 fantastic hotel great location !!! staff fantastic you have to love New york its stunning and a real iconic place would come back again and again 
30928 Room were neat and clean, food good and not over prise and great llocation. Would stay there again 
30929 Four days in NYC on business, decided to expand my horizons and get out of Midtown...the Chelsea Indigo was a great alternative; convenient neighborhood, good food shopping (nearby Whole Foods), close to Chelsea Market, the Highline and other destinations and restaurants. Also decent size room (for Manhattan) will stay again. 
30930 Have been waiting at and around front desk for more than an hour, as the hotel keeps predicting (wrongly) when my room will be ready. What's so hard about being honest with guests, so they don't waste their afternoon sitting around the hotel? 
30931 Alexandria at the Front Desk was wonderful. She went out of her way to make my stay in Houston a positive one. With a smile on her face and her great attitude she is an asset to Houston Club Quarters. 
30932 Stayed 3 nights and although it was conveniently located and we loved the location the bed was as hard as a rock and the shared toilet stank of urine and I had to clean it myself a few times. We stayed on the ground floor. Wouldn't recommend it. 
30933 After the Metropolitan Museum wouldn't let us check our suitcases (they said they were too bigt) & turned us away, the Carlyle several blocks away let us do it instead. 
30934 I loved this hotel. So much history. Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, Patti Smith, Leonard Cohen Stayed here. We had a very nice, clean renovated room. Nice bathroom and kitchenette. The staff were very friendly. Maybe we were lucky but we will go back. Wonderfull hotel. 
30935 I went with my daughter to visit NY for a day ,see broadway show. It is a good promotion price,cold winter,but it is nice location, clean,chic. 
30936 The room was dirty, some of the towels were dirty, the ceiling in the bathroom was falling down and the service was non-existent. More one star than four star. 
30937 The Surrey is not cheap, but for a quick getaway location, it's worth every penny. The rooms are large (by NY standards) and the staff is excellent -- friendly and helpful. 
30938 Everything was perfect from Front Desk to room assistance. Location was great - close to central Park, My Suite was spacious and clean 
30939 Rooms are small but I understand real state is tight in NYC!!! This hotel is conveniently located near times square!! It is great for couples!!! 
30940 Posizione strategica per chi vuole visitare NY, a pochi minuti dalla Quinta...grande camera, molto silenzioso, ottimi interni, bagno grande con doccia e vasca, personale veramente gentile e disponibile. Consigliato! 
30941 Stayed for four nights in March. 25 minute queue to book in while staff chatted behind the counter and seemed not to notice guests. Areas of the hotel very gloomy. Bedrooms so small that the wall-hung television could caused bruising. Not something I would repeat voluntarily. 
30942 Just returned from an amazing stay. It went beyond my expectations. It had a friendly staff, killer view, beautiful rooms. Its location, overlooking the Lake, was perfect for a stroll to the Pier. Try Wave for brunch-awesome French toast. 
30943 Brought a group to stay at the hotel for one night only. Sales dept was great! Loved Knave and the burger joint. Positive, smiling staff despite the horrendous drilling and construction going on next door. Will definitely stay there again! 
30944 We stayed at the Doubletree last night. We attended a wedding reception nearby and decided to spend the night in Houston, We had a beautiful room on the 19th floor, the view was amazing. The bed and pillows were incredibly comfortable and we had a good sleep. 
30945 Stayed two nights before a cruise. Excellent location, staff, and value. 
30946 We enjoyed our stay at the Helmsley. The bed was super comfortable and the pillows were perfect. The staff was very helpful. We were hoping to relax in a hot tub but there wasn't one. That was probably the biggest downfall for us. 
30947 Good location is its major plus, friendly staff and charming and helpful conceige. The place was clean and neat. The room was average, but the bathroom was tiny. no closet in the room Bar and restraunt were good 
30948 When staying there my wallet with big amount of cash, credit cards and documents was stolen from ythe room. Though it was obvious that it was stolen by hotel employee, "investigation" gave no result. no damage was reimbursed. They didn't even report to police. It's awful. 
30949 We stayed at the St. marks hotel for the 4th of July weekend. I was very happy with the room. It was cleaned each day and the people at the front counter were very nice. For $150 a night which includes taxes it can not be beat. 
30950 the staff were lovely in this hotel but the rooms are very small and if you are over 5ft tall can cause problems if the rooms had been bigger i would have booked again to stay here on my next visit to New York 
30951 The Westin is a hotel that takes care of your personal needs 
30952 We needed boxes to ship our many purchases and they were very accommodating. The employees are very warm and remember their return guests. 
30953 This is an average hotel... not bad and not very good either. It's good for it's location for business purposes. Rooms are slightly worn, food is ok quality. Adequate gym. Nothing more to say... 
30954 I traveled with my husband, daughter and dog (!) to the W Hotel in Times Square......what a wonderful experience! Bell staff outside was great; check in was prompt and view was unbelievable! We will be returning! 
30955 Excellent experience which I will never get in my life time. 
30956 My family and I loved our stay at the Dream hotel, it was so comfortable and it had a great vibe! :] 
30957 Good rooms and extraordinary service. Large safe for my laptop and iPads. And most of all, I love that they discount the parking if you drive a hybrid. Close proximity to great restaurants. I will stay here each time I am in Houston in is area. 
30958 When you step outside the hotel, there is an extreme odor. The room is very very tiny and a little gross. The TV didn't work, but we had a really great time. I liked the Art Deco style. Overall, price and location make this a dang good choice. 
30959 Very friendly staff. Exceptional service. Terrific location. Very well connected by subway. Will stay there again. 
30960 huge rooms with a great location. Manager Katz helped us out! we will stay there again. 
30961 The hotel employers are very friendly and work hard to please the guest. We woke up to no hot water, when I called the front desk within 5 minutes someone was at our room to help us out. 
30962 The location of this hotel has drawn us back several times. We are always happy with staying here. It is an upscale hotel with very many nice amenities, and very nicely appointed. Close to Central Park, Rockefeller Center and within walking distance of Times Square. 
30963 Good location in Chelsea, easily walkable to many sites. The internet was a poor connection as mentioned by other reviewers and the buffet breakfast was less than desirable. The rooms were small but a good night sleep. 
30964 NYC at Christmas time is amazing! The Westin was perfect for our stay. Checkin was a breeze. Staff was friendly The location is awesome! I'm not sure where some of the negative reviewers stayed, but we couldnt have been more happy with our stay 
30965 Not good folks. Bathroom is outside your room, cleaners dump your clothes in the floor, and the room is not too clean. Ahh, I got what I paid for! 
30966 Perfetto per chi vuole visitare new york a qualsiasi ora, con qualsiasi mezzo, a due passi da times square..ottimo punto di partenza per qualsiasi attrazione per gli ottimi collegamenti! pulito, personale molto cordiale, una splendida piscina interna per rilassarsi (se si ha tempo)..se rinnovassero l'arredamento delle stanze sarebbe perfetto! 
30967 l'hotel si trova in buona posizione, a 5/7 min a piedi da Empire State Building, le stanze corrispondono alle foto indicate, diciamo un 4 stelle molto curato e confortevole, personale molto disponibile 
30968 Great rooms. Beds are wonderful. The rainshower type shower head was very relaxing. Priced very reasonably for a weekend stay. They are very green and even have special parking for hybrid vehicles. 
30969 well to me everything was great.......and i will tell to my friends and family about it .... 
30970 We needed a place to stay closer to Mt. Sinai hospital and found Marmara. What a terrific find! The price was reasonable and we got a one bedroom apartment that was simply fantastic. It felt like home instead of a hotel room. 
30971 there are no words for this Hotel. simply a temple. maybe the staff could be much more nice but....after all....it is a fantastic place. 
30972 I would stay here again, this hotel was great. we booked the room for $76 on Priceline (3.5 stars)...blew away our expectations 
30973 Rooms are extremely small. No storage for clothing. Would not want to spend much time in my room. No gym. Do not like the idea of walking somewhere else to work out. No ice machine. Must call room service for everything--which means tipping for everything. 
30974 The staff is excellent...........every time! We love the location, Norma's, and the lobby bar, I think it's relatively a recent addition. Sometimes it's a bit noisy at night; could be if construction is going on nearby. We hope to be back soon! 
30975 Good hotel. Quiet. Good size rooms. Very clean. Staff was friendly and helpful. Breakfast buffet is overpriced. 
30976 Great location, bar staff not knowledgeable, concierge gave wrong info re duty free shopping at Midway, great view from a top floor - didn't like coffee maker. staff friendly but not as experienced as they should be. 
30977 Overall good hotel for NYC,excellent location very clean rooms and a nice bathroom. 
30978 Dirty and always smelled like pot. Employee was rude and dishonest. 
30979 Stayed here with my mom, and everything was stellar. The only reason I didn't give 5-stars is because one front desk agent wasn't very friendly. Otherwise the food at the bar was excellent and the beds were typically super comfortable. Bathroom was surprisingly luxe! 
30980 Stayed for a week in Park South Hotel and found it very well run with excellent housekeeping, great breakfasts (nice outdoor terrace for the sunny mornings) pleasant and efficient staff and very conveniently near 28th st, line 6 subway stop, will certainly stay there again and would certainly recommend it. 
30981 Great staff. Well accomodating. Hotel is missing a few key items to make it great. 
30982 My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the Bedford 6th - 15th April. The room was clean and very spacious, the staff helpful and friendly. The hotel is ideally situated and we would definitely use again. 
30983 we arrived in NY expecting alot, we got alot! the showers had hair i them, we had food under the bed, and the long dirty hallways felt like we were walking in a horror movie. we never saw any staff other than the grumpy receptionist. ... interesting, yes 
30984 October 12 - 15. Loved this hotel. Suite was clean and comfortable and staff was very professional and extremely friendly and courteous. Nice safe location. 
30985 I was in NYC for a weekend business workshop. The Chelsea Savoy was recommended to me by the workshop organizer. My room, the hallways and the lobby, were exceptionally clean and odor free. The front desk staff members whom I encountered were friendy and attentive. 
30986 Keep up the good work DaVinci Hotel. We had a great stay at a good price. Good deal on parking as well. 
30987 Great apatrment style 2 room suites with fridge etc. Super friendly doormen and front desk. Well located for walking about the city. New sparkling restaurant. 
30988 stayed here 22nd- 27th august nice rooms shared bathroom always clean as were the rooms friendly staff good location 10 minute walk to union square metro would recommend this hotel to anyone 
30989 Situation inmejorable en el corazon de Manhattan. Que pena que el hotel sea muy ruidoso, la amabilidad del personal nula y los ascensores permanentemente ocupados ( contra basta 10' minutos para bajar ! ) 
30990 I have been there twice. Both times I found the hotel excellent. Rooms are ultra neat and tidy. Beds are very comfortable. Great service. Good food; you should try their chocolate mousse (AMAZING). Location is very close to shopping malls and airport. Overall a great experience. I highly recommend it. 
30991 Bem Localizado, quarto pequeno mais suficiente para dormir bem e tomar um bom banho, 
30992 The staff made us feel welcome and valued. Some minor problems with some of facilities but staff was obliging in dealing with these. The complimentary coffee in morning and complimentary basic WiFi were both very nice touches! Also the fresh flowers throughout the hotel were stunning! 
30993 Beautiful design, great service, fantastic accommodations. The location is pretty sweet, of course, too. 
30994 The hotel was just wonderful! Our room was the best we've stayed at in NYC. The service amazing and the hotel beautiful. No detail was left unturned. We will stay there again when we go back. 
30995 had refurbished room, highly recommended, free coffee and tea facilities 24 hours, ideal location for getting around on subway, and within walking distance of most tourist sites. staff were extremly helpful on advice where to eat etc. will certainly use again 
30996 The hotel is located next to Grand Central station. It is a nice modern hotel with a large lobby. The room was sufficient but the bathroom was a tad on the small side. A clean hotel with friendly staff. Would stay here again. 
30997 This hotel has world class status-- Yes it's old, but the hotel is exceptional. Oh and its location is suberb. I will be a return visitor that's for certain... 
30998 Hilton Chicago is one of the best hotels I've ever stayed in. The staff were so sweet, the rooms were very comfortable and the view was INSANE! I love this hotel. 
30999 Easy walking distance for theater and attractions. Very pleasant service, friendly at every turn. Rooms were lovely, lots of nice little touches. Would definitely stay again. Did not eat there as so many other places in the area. Convenient place to print off boarding passes in lobby. 
31000 This is pretty expensive hotel with bad and not friendly service and cleanliness. The only good thing about this hotel is the location - close to Radio City and Broadway theatres. I wouldn't recommend this hotel. 
31001 we stayed for 3 nights at the beginning of feb. would recommend this hotel. staff could not be more helpful, the room was great and the location was perfect for all the sights. would definately stay there again. 
31002 Right on the door step to time square and central to everything. Rooms were very comftable clean and staff extremely helpful! Reception area not very but never experienced crowding in our stay. Thank you defiantly recommend :) 
31003 Brilliant location exceptionally convienent being so clos to a nuber of subway lines, central park and a number of museums. The hotel staff were extremely fiendly and helpful. The room was a great size with a unbeleivably big tv very clean and well equiped. Would gladdly recomend a stay here. 
31004 Good location, we had a nice side view of the lake and the observatory. The rooms were okay. Could do with a refurb in parts, especially in the bathroom. Good pool and gym area. But overall it was okay, would stay here again! 
31005 For my wife's big 30th birthday, I rented a jr suite for her and her friends. The hotel staff, from front desk woman to bell men to spa people, was fantastic. Room was beautiful and extremely well-designed. Our stay was simply perfect. 
31006 This has to be one of the best hotels in the world! The rooms, though not cheap, are large by NYC standards. The staff are excellent. Highly recommend! 
31007 river north is also close to most places the hotel is nice, fancy but I like the ones in the main avenue 
31008 I will come back, thank you! Not the best hotel I ever have been at but it suit its purpose. 
31009 Excellent stay at Room Mate Grace. Very good service and the location is fantastic! So if you're searching for a great hotel in the middle of the big apple, choose this one cause I can promised you that you ain't gonna be disapointed!!! 
31010 The loaction of this hotel is nice if you want to be in the Chinatown/Tribeca area. Just keep in mind the lobby area/bar is so small. You can move around the lobby area, especially if there is a line at the front desk. The rooms are rediculously small. Think twice! 
31011 Watch out for rooms with Queen bed. They are situated next to the elevators and you hear them all night. I got a room like that although I asked for a quiet room. 
31012 It far surpassed hotels that cost three times as much. Would definitly stay again. 
31013 Old building with small rooms, now a tired old space with small rooms and uninterested unresponsive staff. 
31014 We stayed at The Belvedere this weekend and it was fantastic! The service was outstanding, the cleanliness of the room was beyond expectations and the location was terrific! 
31015 I could have upgraded to a motel 6! 4 stars-really! No bell desk, no late check out. Crazy blaring music until 3am. SLOW/NO bar service. View of nothing. At least they were rude to round out the scuzzy gross room experience. Recommend, not no, hell no. 
31016 Nice hotel ... Nice crew ... What else ? :))) this hotel is really amazing. Try it you will not forget it. We will come back for sure !! 
31017 I stayed with 4 friends in 2 rooms and we had great service. The location was great. The staff was friendly. On my next visit to New York I won't think about staying anywhere else. 
31018 Execellent location, room was big enough, comfortable and warm. The hotel booked us onto a shuttle bus for the return journey to the airport and we generally very helpful. 
31019 Nice clean room.Location excellent,close to subway,good breakfast,no tea or coffee making facilities in the room 
31020 Excellent workout facility. Fantastic pool. The staff are pros and always friendly--especially the manager Robert. He's your man for the history of the Intercontinental Hotel. So stop by and say hi. :) 
31021 Andy the conceirge was excellent you can get good rates on weekends the employee from kosovo helped us with our coffee machine and was very helpful I would stay here again you will need to get tickets in advance for the 9/11 memorale ask Andy 
31022 Stayed 4 nights at the Affinia 50. Perfect location for our needs and we were able to walk to many attractions. Staff was very nice and room was clean and quiet. 
31023 The Fairmont did a good job. Clean room, good linens, good service. We would go back. 
31024 The Gramercy Park Hotel is a very sophisticated, hip, artsy hotel in the Gramercy neighborhood. The public spaces are filled with the art of contemporary masters. The staff is attentive and friendly. A stay at the GPH will certainly enhance your NYC experience. 
31025 We stayed for two nights, using points from Marriott. Paid not even a cent for myself, wife and two daughters. It is a lovely hotel, free coffee in the lobby area, nicely arranged and spacious rooms (for Manhattan), close to theaters. Fine bed linens, toiletries. 
31026 Roger Smith provides quality rooms with great food/drinks as well. Rooms are quiet and not over the top. Good value. Thanks Mr. Smith! 
31027 Great hotel for the money. Centrally located within walking distances to the sites, shows and shopping. Excellent breakfast and helpful friendly staff. I would stay here again with no hesitation. 
31028 Nice Hilton... it has everything you could possibly want in a NYC hotel. Location, nice rooms, helpful concierge for newbies, and did I mention location? It's only a few blocks from Central Park and Times Square, but not in the super-noisy-hustle-bustle section of the area. 
31029 I am a frequent business traveller to NYC and I was booked into this hotel by our travel agent. It is old, dirty, the heating does not working properly and the staff and rude. This is a two star backpacker standard accomondation. Stay away, pictures on website deceptive. 
31030 Hotel eccezionale dotato di tutti i servizi, camere ampie e arredate in stile, parti comuni dell'edificio splendide, nel periodo del nostro soggiorno decorate con meravigliosi addobbi natalizi. Perfetto il servizio e strategica la location in piena Midtown. Attenzione agli extra molto cari come del resto comporta il livello dell'hotel. 
31031 Located in a perfect position to go anywhere. I was there for about 10 days in august 2008 and i could walk everywhere from the hotel. The room was big and comfortable with a view on the Magnificient Mile. Price was also not bad. 
31032 I stayed here in room 721. I'm very much appreciative of the level of service and the quality, location of the accomodations I received. If and when I return to New York they will get my business. Thanks Hotel 17 Barry 
31033 Very clean and nice place to stay. We had a great view of the empire state building and could see the statue of liberty in the distance. Location was perfect for exploring Times Square. We plan on staying here again next year. 
31034 The Hilton Garden Inn in Northwest Houston is the BEST EVER in service! The entire crew works to serve the customer and each employee seems to have the same level of commitment. Thank you Domingo T. Martinez JR. and Maria Ramirez, your smiles and hard work are easily noticed! 
31035 Extremely convenient location, good service, decent interiors and reasonable prices - this is the value for money hotel to beat south of 23rd St. 
31036 The service could not have been better. The staff was friendly and over the top helpful. We really enjoyed our stay. The restaurant and bar were great. We will be back. 
31037 I always have a good experience here...great location....service was impressive and good quality rooms..the hotel staff was great!! Will be staying her again and I recommend this hotel especially if you are having fun in the city and arent't spending much time in the room anyway.. 
31038 Consigliatissimo!!!Noi vi abbiamo soggiornato per 5 notti nel novembre 2010 E' a soli 10 minuti a piedi da Times Square...la metro poi e' vicinissima!Personale cordiale e stanza molto pulita oltre che carina!Rapporto qualita' prezzo ottimo!!! Nelle vicinanze ci sono diverse strutture per il brunch! 
31039 What a fantastic hotel, one of the best in New York City ! 
31040 it's cozy. clean. good room service. attentive staff. I recommend. 
31041 Visited for Thanksgiving with family. Muse was even better than expected. Excellent location. Super room. Friendly staff. Convenient and affordable. My best NYC hotel experience ever. Will definitely stay there again. 
31042 ho alloggiato in una camera deluxe direi sufficientemente spaziosa...letto king...ma bagno molto piccolo... posizione fantastica a 2 min a piedi da times square ma tranquilla... consigliabile soprattutto per questo... 
31043 Terrific location on corner of Lexington and 39th, rooms are modern and relatively large by NYC standards. Boutique feel. Lobby is small, wifi available in the lobby. Staff friendly and helpful. 
31044 This hotel was beautiful! It doesn't look like a normal hotel nestled in with the brick buildings. The room was spacious, very clean. The housekeeping staff was extremely friendly. Great restaurants and shopping near by, I highly recommend it. 
31045 This was our second stay at the Waldorf Towers. Again, only the very best. From the staff to our 900 sq foot suite that was upgraded for us. Thanks to the Waldorf and the Hilton Company. 
31046 Just stayed one night here, but wish it had been more. Great hotel. Lare rooms, great bathroom. Fantastic lobby an bar. Would stay here again. 
31047 Great boutique hotel in the hustle of Chicago. No doubt the rooms are small, think European. But I'm in the city and not hanging out in the room all day. Free wireless and free computer access paid for themselves. Nice decor, staff was eager to please. I'd stay here again. 
31048 sorry i'm late with the review. just want to say thanks to the whole staff at the london. everyone was very helpful and very respectful. i had a great time and Fernando at the front desk was the best!!! definitely will be there again!!!! 
31049 This is an excellent place to spend a few days in New York. The rooms are larger than most New York hotels and the staff seemed very friendly. It is located in the heart of theatre land and during the day walking to the major attractions is not a problem. 
31050 We enjoyed our stay at stay. It's a small hotel, a few houses from times square. The room was clean and comfortable, bathroom was fully equipped and clean as well, staff were friendly and helpful. Overall I can nothing but recommend Stay for a stay in midtown Manhatten. 
31051 Shower was horrible, so hard it hurt, the mattress was old and uncomfortable, very small room and toilet, no closet, view was into a horrible apartment building next door and it was way too far up town. Not worth the price, stay elsewhere. 
31052 This place would make a great "regular" Marriott but was just average for a JW. Good food and an excellent fitness center though. I guess having just stayed at the JW in Washington DC raised my expectations too high. 
31053 Hatten uns viel mehr vorgestellt von diesem Hotel!!! Die Lage ist super nur etwa eine Minute vom Times Square entfernt aber leider sind die Zimmer zimlich klein und haben nicht sehr viel komfort....schade 
31054 Wonderful hotel, clean, efficient, service was great, perfect location. Will stay again. 
31055 Very nice boutique hotel with nice amenities in Gold Coast of Chicago, a few blocks away from Oak Street and Michigan Avenue, near many restaurants within walking distance. Easy to get around from this location and a bright, cheeful place to stay. 
31056 Great Hotel! Stayed in February 2004 - it is undergoing a multi-million dollar rennovation.Very clean, cozy, rooms are small, but very pleasant. Very conveniently located.STAY THERE! 
31057 i stay at the Mela twice a month for business. simply put...the staff is very friendly and helpful. the rates are reasonable. the location is fantastic. the rooms are clean. i highly recommend this property! 
31058 Our room was actually tiny, with a tiny bathroom and a tiny wardrobe. Staff was not very friendly. I would only recommend this hotel for a nice location. 
31059 They messed up our room reservation, gave me unwanted wake up calls at 3am, and charged me for minibar items i never got!! all with no apologies.... the people at the front desk are rude and inconsiderate! 
31060 My wife and I just stayed at The Blakeley on 55th street on Easter weekend. Its really a great little place. Friendly well trained staff. Clean rooms. Nice ammentities and a great location. Really couldnt ask for more. 
31061 Love this very classy "Grand" Hotel. Stayed 4nights in an upgraded room which was very spacious room. Very attentive staff. Breakfast buffet expensive, but then this is NY where everything is pricey. Central location within easy walking distance to many sites, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue, Times Square, etc. Will return. 
31062 Recently stayed here while we were in town awaiting a flight home from going to see the gators play texas a&m. The hotel def impressed me, very nice room, comfortable beds, amazing staff and a very very good restaurant! All I could ask for in a hotel! 
31063 Een goed, schoon en gezellig hotel iets buiten het echte centrum van Manhattan. In 2006 gerenoveerd. Prijs/kwaliteit verhouding uitstekend. Tegenover metrostation. vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. Hotel bezocht in juli 2007. 
31064 I was in NY for a very brief business trip. I got in late, but had a great quiet room to relax in. Very close to my meeting. Staff very friendly and helpful. Will definitely be back. 
31065 hi was there for 1 week hotel service was excellent, great stuff willing to help about anything comfortable rooms, clean room and orginized internet speed is good 
31066 Travel much on business. Take the family here every year for a 3-4 day vacation to Chicago with friends. Location is excellent (nice area, close to shops and restaurants). Rooms are nice with good views of city, hotel is clean, service is good and atmosphere of hotel is nice. 
31067 the rooms were cozy and the location was good. close enough to michigan ave, but far enough from the crowds. the wireless connection was weak, however, it worked just fine from my room. the only complaint was that the conceirge was not very helpful. 
31068 In the heart of NYC Times Square, convenient to Theater District, Rockefeller Plaza. Quite comfortable and very friendly & accommodating staff! 
31069 My family has stayed at this hotel many times and really enjoy it. The property it sits on is big and very wooded. It is very relaxing. The pool and gym are great and so is the spa. We've always had great sevice. 
31070 This is a comfortable, well kept, luxury hotel. I booked on a package deal not knowing much about it. Across from MSG and within walking distance of many tourist attractions. Very clean and comfortable. I would recommend. Large room for a New York hotel. 
31071 You want a great experience stay here. Not one thing to say bad about this property. Perfect stay and they make you feel special. Staff wonderful.... Stay you won't be sorry 
31072 Our first visit to NYC and the location alone of this hotel is fantastic. Add to that the ground floor security, the friendly staff, the cleanliness and a corner suite and it makes this hotel very difficult to beat!!! (Almost forgot, they throw in fabulous cookies too). 
31073 ottimo hotel, camere spaziose e pulite, letti comodi. Qualche mancanza nei servizi: il personale non sempre simpatico, la navetta gratuita per il centro, che avrebbe dovuto passare ogni ora, noi non l'abbiamo mai vista 
31074 Great location in upper west side of Manhattan. Room was roomy and extemely comfortable. Many restaurants close by with fresh food to purchase across the road. Underground at the front door and staff very accomodating and friendly. Close to Central Park. Would definatley recomend to anyone visiting Manhattan. 
31075 Loved the hotel. The room is a cool contemporary design. Also the designer who set up the second floor lounge area did a great job - it is such a cozy and comfortable place to hang out and have a glass wine - this was a real surprise. 
31076 voor een nette prijs super goed gelegen boek je een klasse hotel. alle volgens afspraak. Komen hier beslist terug, kijken of het enige minpuntje ( geen vers brood bij het ontbijt omdat we wat laat waren rond tienen. 
31077 Typical Hilton property, clean and easy. Nothing particularly interesting about the place, just right down the middle. 
31078 I really can't see what all the fuss is about here. The rooms are OK (but small) and the rates are way too over-priced. The location is OK but everything else was just about average. - Still, if you've got money to burn, don't listen to a word! 
31079 very noisy air conditioning, could not sleep all night long!! 
31080 The room was Ok., but under expectation taking into account what you pay for it.. The service was really poor. lack of kindness. Many other great options before to go stay at this hotel. Only if you don't find anything else in Manhattan. EXPENSIVE!!!!!!!!! 
31081 comfortable Rooms in a great location 2 blocks from art museum and Millenium Park. Close to a large number of excellent restaurants xxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx vvvvvvvvvvv hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh 
31082 Huge rooms, very clean, lovely bathrooms, comfy beds, nicely decorated. Great location for everything. Only slight issue is the slow check-in as they tend to employ French staff. 
31083 This Hotel is very well located, clean and well maintained but the rooms are rediculously small - two people was a crowd. 
31084 Typical W experience--chic, hip, flashy, fun, inspiring. Perfect location for business downtown. I want to specifically recognize the conceirge, Eden Bernal, whose rapid response time and friendly demeanor helped me stay dry and on time for dinner! Thank you Eden! 
31085 As i said, ver good hotel. A little expensive but in a great location. Very close to the Metro stations. Should have free wifi. 
31086 This hotel situates in very centre of Manhattan. When you step out of door you will immiadetly feel the smell and the noises of this giant city. Hotel itself has dirty rooms, rugged overall and small rooms, but it somehow goes well with the general feeling in Big Apple. 
31087 Hotel is erg goed, mooie kamers, wel wat klein maar dat is New York. Ligging is ook prima vlakbij Empire State Building en de metro is een straat doorlopen. Personeel erg vriendelijk en behulpzaam bij het conformeren van de terugreis. Ook goede tips over eten en winkelen. Een aanrader! 
31088 Very good hotel. Great localization Thanks to Howard from the reception, very helpful, respectful. The other guys should learn with him. Internet is an absurd to charge in the room. Nowadays this is a default for hotels like this. 
31089 We recently stayed at the Athenee Hotel - the hotel is in a nice location - close to Central Park, staff were very attentive and professional - concierge was very helpful. The room was a little dated but neat and clean. Room was quite small but adequate for our needs. 
31090 good location. the room is big and the bed is very confortable, breakfast very expensive. concierge gave good suggestions of restaurants. The city is very nice, we enjoyed so much. I recomend. 
31091 Really good value! Well situated; 2 blocks from Central Park and approx 10 minutes from Times Square. The room was spacious and clean. The bathroom was functional, although the shower could be a bit temperamental! The staff were friendly and helpful. I will stay here when I visit NYC again. 
31092 Our room was clean and well set up with two queen beds with enough room for two of us. Easy access to all attractions in NYC The lobby bar was a lot of fun and the bartenders were excellent, the tapas were good also. 
31093 Very well located! Nice and beautiful hotel. Extremely clean the room, housekeeping friendly all the time. Front desk service poor. Nice room facilities. Missed a Nespresso machine in the room. I have been there twice already. 
31094 Wat een heerlijk hotel is dit. Top comfortable, heerlijke bedden en een lokatie om te dromen 
31095 Conveniently located just off the beaten path. Very charming and comfortable and VERY clean.. I would definitely stay here again~ 
31096 I was next to a room that partied all night for 2 nights in a row. No sleep ! Very loud guest pounding on the door and using profanity. 
31097 All average, from check-in to check out. Didn't have breakfast. It's a safe choice, if you look for an airport hotel, but value for price could be better. Rooms are nothing fancy, but are clean. Probably a room with a view to runways could make your stay more pleasant. 
31098 We travelled from Australia and found Staybridge suites to be in a great location, nice room, friendly staff, loved happy hour, free breakast & laundry. 
31099 Perfect location. Clean and updated rooms. Decent size bath room. Some street sounds on the third floor street side room. 
31100 Facile d'acces quand on prend le bus a JFK, proche de la gare central. bien place. de plus on peut se faire le petit dejeuner ou autres repas dans les chambres avec le coin cuisine amenage. Atout nonnegligeable 
31101 Please ignore all the negitive reports about this hotel. We have been in New York three times and used this hotel all the three occasions.From the front door staff to the cleaning staff, they couldn't have done enough for us.Fab location, steps away from Times Square... 
31102 Big and clean rooms with awesome view! Basically a walk distance to everything in Midtown Manhattan, but situated in a quite and relax part of it. The PJ's restaurant downstairs also worth the visit! Totally going back! 
31103 You have been warned - this place was really scary - truly a ghetto. We stayed there for one night pre-cruise and barely slept - we would have been better off sleeping at the airport. 
31104 Nice room next to the park with great views. 
31105 This is a really good 3 star hotel. great location and reception. Rooms are nicely furnished, Staff were great help. We had 2 rooms, the normal suite and a largere one with a sofa bed for the kids. Transportation is close by with the sub way. we would stay again. 
31106 excellent location, great neighborhood with lots of stores and shops, close to subway, large clean rooms, and excellent service, Will be staying again for Thanksgiving 
31107 Got great price on Quikbook ($202). Very large room with large upscale bathroom, recently renovated and very nice. Staff very pleasant. Nice bar. Lots of casual restaurants for breakast around the corner on 7th ave. I highly recommend this hotel. 
31108 Antiguo, malo y caro el desayuno, lejos de los buenos lugares y encima caro. 
31109 Excellent hotel. The staff and concierge are excellent. The hotel is close to shopping, and the theater district. Always stay her when visiting NYC 
31110 Great friendly staff amazing location. Great rooms not too small. I would stay here again for sure. 
31111 We chose this hotel form the TripAdisor reviews and it was ideal for us ,Good location,Clean nice size room,Fridge was a nice bonus.Free use of business center.Next time were in NY we are going to stay here.Big Thanks to everyone at this hotel. 
31112 Great location and service. i will recommend this hotel as I think has a lot aof value to offer. Personnel was kind and very helpfull at all times............................................................................................................................................. 
31113 This hotel had everything that one would want from a NY hotel. Location, accommodating staff, great views, location! We were able to get the most of our vacation thanks to the hotel. The location is just fantastic. The rooms were nice. And the staff very courteous and friendly. 
31114 Newish, very clean, and a refreshing change for the area. Real fast internet, big plus for me. Here is some filler words to make 100 characters. 
31115 This hotel is amazing view of the Empire State building. Door Man 24/7 very eclectic rooms and design I reccomend this to anyone in the manhattan area. Hats off to the eventi 
31116 Thank you to TK at the W Hotel in Chicago for providing exemplary service during our weekend stay. From directions to places to dine, TK was right on the money. Location was perfect (i.e., a Starbucks nearby). My daughter and I had a fantastice time and we will be back. 
31117 Pros: Awesome location Cons: Extremely small, the elevator sucks. But honestly you don't go to NY to sleep, in fact you won't spend much time in your hotel room. Overall, for the price it ends up being a good deal. I would recommend. 
31118 I was pleasantly surprised by this hotel. Although the street is questionable later at night, the quality of the hotel more than made up for it. The free reception and breakfast were added bonuses. I will absolutely look into staying here again when I return to NY. 
31119 first time in newyork, brilliant location, staff very friendly, within walking distance for everyone rooms were good , with comforable beds and pillows. would go back no problems 
31120 Staff very nice and friendly, elevators are terrible, very slow, small, waited 20 minutes to catch one to go to my room. Rooms are very small, got a good deal on Priceline but the $50 per night parking plus you have to walk half a block to parking garage. 
31121 Had a fantastic corner room looking out at the lake. Beautiful. The staff treated us with such caring and warmth. Would retuern in a secopnd. Thank you for the chocolate strawberries, a treat in itself. 
31122 Tracy (front desk) and Kevin (doorman) were just a few of the team members that provided excellent service. The location is the best in Times Square. All suite rooms are very large. Just stay here and you will be happy 
31123 Warm welcome at reception and a complimentary upgrade was much appreciated. Disappointed that no tea or coffee making facility was to be found in the room. Bathroom small and cramped, nowhere to leave toilet bags. Breakfast was a disaster - poor quality food and service, plus expensive. 
31124 At check in Candice was the best! She was a wealth of information and she got us into a wonderful room. She was over and above to make sure we were happy. The hotel is just around the corner from Times Square; close to all the theaters and great dining. 
31125 I stayed there for two weeks, very professional, courtious staff, clean room and housekeeping was great. Free shutle, continental breakfast, Free wifi,varity of reasurants delivered food to my room. Enjoyed my staying. Angie 
31126 Hotel was beautiful, clean and modern. Rooms were basic but very clean, all staff were so helpful i couldnt of asked for anything else. 
31127 Stayed here five nights and you should be warned that great prices for the hotel are because it is completely surrounded by construction. However very quiet indoors and the staff goes out of their way to make your stay great. 
31128 Great place to stay In NYC. Close enough to all the action of Times Square yet Quiet on a side street. would highly recommend. Great and Friendly Staff as well. 
31129 O quarto tem uma cozinha completa equipada, permitindo cozinhar. Pessoal atencioso, e cama boa. Ha uma meia quadra (9a av), depois do port authority, tem um mercado que se podei comprar carnes frescas a precos razoaveis. Tem uma mini loja no lobby que quebra um bom galho em emergencias. 
31130 oui l'emplacement est super et la vue magnifique pour les chambres sup..mais285dollars sans petit dej a 28dollars meriterait une salle de bain plus classe q celle digne d'i ibis q nous avons eue.par contre acceuil super et le bagagiste nous a trouve 1 super taxi pour 8.. 
31131 Even though I was ill the night we were at this hotel it was a nice hotel. I spent a lot of time in the room. Went to a Yankees game vs rangers. Easy to get to the train from hotel. Lobby gorgeous. Be prepared to drop a dime here. 
31132 This is not the nicest Marriott I have stayed at in terms of physical beauty or comfort. Room small. Beds ok. Lobby a little dreary. But the staff is among the best of anywhere we have stayed. Extremely nice. Very helpful. Would definitely stay here again. 
31133 The Tremont is an older hotel with a great location in downtown Chicago. While the rooms and elevator are small, we found The Tremont clean and quiet. The little box of chocolates for Mother's Day was a nice touch! 
31134 Good and bad. The staff is very friendly and interested in making guests happy. Be careful of room placement. Rooms on lower levels facing construction are unbearably loud. Rooms on higher floors are absolutely fine. 
31135 A few blocks from Times Square, this hotel is affordable and clean. Rooms are comfortable and fairly quiet. Good breakfast buffet each morning. 
31136 Good sized rooms for New York and helpful staff. Location is good also. Would definitely use again when next in Manhattan. 
31137 Although the rooms aren't luxurious the suites are fairly spacious, clean and with good in room facilities. The hotel is in a great location bang slap in the middle of Times Square. The rooms on higher floors give fantastic views of Times Square and aren't noisy. 
31138 In pieno centro, pulito e conveniente. Personale cortese. Stanze e letto piccoli. 
31139 PROS: Quiet Privacy Secluded Very Clean Nice Staff The rain head shower is the BOMB Having the complete kitchen setup is very handy The hotel is in a very nice area Free Breakfast and it is Good! Free Wifi! 
31140 Nel pieno centro di Manhattan. Davvero una posizione ottima per visitare la Grande Mela 
31141 Great hotel, close to everything. Super nice facilities; everything you need for the best price in NYC. We paid $130 a night. Make sure you also go to Ulysses for Sunday brunch! AMAZING! 
31142 Service level is low, and the location is noisy due to traffic. Woke up every day to honking horns from the street. We will not stay there again. Location is 3 blocks from subway stop. Lexington goes downtown so taxi's are easy to get. 
31143 Good location just outside the hustle and bustle. The lobby is very nicely decorated. The room was a bit small but the king size bed was incredibly comfortable. Could use a little modernization from their tv's to their bathroom. Overall very pleased with the hotel for our weekend stay. 
31144 My wife and I stayed at The Surrey for 2 nights for our anniversary, we could not say enough about the hotel, the service, or the location, it was all perfect. Will stay here from now on 
31145 Hotel is located Kitty corner from Madison Square Gardens. Easy access to Subway, walking distance from Times Square, Empire State Building. Location is great for a week end getaway to NYC. Hotel is older but clean 
31146 Rooms are reasonable.. spacious enough. A good value for Manhattan 
31147 Older outdated hotel with great location and decent rates...so I thought until I was charged $250 after my departure for a carpet damage that was already there. Having a very hard time getting resolution. 
31148 These people get what it takes to run a motel and airport shuttle service too. No reason not to stay there! 
31149 Service was impeccable-everyone from the Manager on duty, guest service reps to the servers. I expected the typical New York attitude, but was wrong. The staff was friendly and hospitable. The Steve's breakfast was delicious and the portions were just right. I would return there in a heartbeat! 
31150 Very clean and comfortable rooms. The bathroom was spotless and plenty of hot water. Free breakfast has a good choice of food and there was plenty of it. Would stay here again. 
31151 We arrived late (1am) on a Thursday and it took them 40 minutes to help us and a further hour and a half to find our booking-their fault-for which they didn't apologise. The room was small and not nearly as nice as advertised-such an awful start to a brilliant holiday. 
31152 I recently stayed at this property for a business trip and was immediately struck by the attentive staff, exceptional services and beautiful property. I will absolutely make Hotel Granduca my hotel of choice for my Houston travel. It is a gorgeous property with world class customer service. 
31153 11 of my family stayed at the Times Square North for 4 days, and we had a lovely experience at the hotel. The staff was efficient and helpful, and it was nice to be able to meet and talk with the family in the lobby. The breakfast was a plus. 
31154 Basic room but clean, good shower 2 minute walk to the empire state building, great cafe next door for irish breaksfast and very cheap. Perfect if you will be spending your holiday out of the hotel room. 
31155 I loved my stay, it was very comfortable. The staff was great, and very friendly. My only complaint is the internet was so slow it was unusable. .2mb up and down. Free drinks and dinner in the evenings though! 
31156 We stayed at this hotel in the middle of May 2011. The hotel was very nice and the location excellent. Great Stay, the doorman Jose and Brandon where excellent! 
31157 Older hotel with charm great staff fantastic location and all you need. The cleaning staff do an amazing job. The pool is large. Thank you to all staff for their help and travel advice. Would definitely stay here again. 
31158 This is a great hotel if you just need a place to sleep. Felt like I was in a camper when in the bathroom, it was so small. The bed was very comfortable. The location is right near the subways and within walking distance to theatres and Time Square. 
31159 Stayed with my family and had a wonderful stay, the view from my room was amazing, all staff were nice and friendly specially Jenny. we will be back next year and hope to get a nice room like this again.. 
31160 Room 208 is quite large and one of the newly renovated rooms. Our room was very clean and quiet. Great location. The hotel validates parking around the corner at a rate $21 a day. 
31161 If what you are looking is a hotel close to Galleria with a very comfortable room, good gym, a basic restaurant, this is your place. nice van service in the area, the suites are large, with a nice desk and small fridge. 
31162 50th Birthday and they did not disappoint upgraded every thing was perfect from start to finish best stay in SoHo ever Corner Suite 
31163 Attended two conventions at this hotel this summer. The rooms are nice and clean, conference facilities very nice and staff excellent. The big bar is a nice gathering spot if you don't want to venture out but the hotel is close to lots of great restaurants. 
31164 Great hotel in a great location, service is first class and very friendly. Well done! 
31165 We enjoyed our stay here. Rooms were a bit on the small side, but it is NYC after all. Concierge was very helpful and the diner is to die for. Amazing food! Fabulous location! 
31166 It was the perfect little getaway hotel - beautiful room, amazing staff, awesome ambiance, great location. I wanted to stay longer! The rooms are stunning, but small - definitely for a solo trip of romantic getaway. 
31167 I celebrated my 50th birthday with friends in New Your at the St Gile - The court. It could not have been better! The staff was gracious , the rooms enormous and well appointed and the location could not be beat. 
31168 The staff is incredible. Hotel is chic and the lobby is always a great time to start off your night. With clubs upstairs and downstairs there is no need to leave the hotel! 
31169 A busy hotel with a staff that still stays friendly and service minded. Rooms were clean though the double's beds were small and not enough space to walk around it. All in all , the location is what you are paying for. 
31170 The Hilton Garden Inn is excellent value which is near Macy's, the Empire State Building, Fifth Avenue shopping and Koreatown. It's also very close to numerous subway lines. The personnel are very friendly and helpful and the rooms are immaculate. If you stay there, you'll be very pleased. 
31171 Please,Please, Please don't go to this Hotel it is completly disgusting if you like rat and bed bugs you are welcome to go. 
31172 Just not a great location for Chicago. I moved hotels after two nights to a Marriott that was very central off of Michigan Ave for the same price. The room I got stuck in was pathetic for a Grand Hyatt Hotel. 
31173 Great value, beautiful, spacious and clean rooms, excellent location within walking distance to shops and restaurants, nice pool and great service. Word is getting out and this hotel books up, so don't hesitate! 
31174 Un hotel de ubicacion fenomenal, , muy cerca de la parada de metro. Fuimos 6 adultos nos dieron dos habitaciones continuas que se comunicaban con una puerta. Situacion perfecta para conocer la ciudad, desayuno perfecto. Recomendable a cualquiera 
31175 This hotel is very well situated, in the center of midtown, near metro, train, shops, restaurants. Could be felt as a bit "formal" but in fact employees of this hotel are very helpfull. The Check-out system is very practical. Very kind, pleasant, memorable stay. 
31176 The staff provided exceptional service were very friendly and welcoming. The hotel is absolutely beautiful, clean, and stylish. 
31177 Was in town for long weekend. Seems the property has been renovated not too long ago - bathrooms are awesome, service very friendly. Hotel room spacious by NY standard. Excellent facilities and fitness center. 
31178 I will never, never stay at that hotel again. Customer service was not good. It always help to sell the city and hotel which the guests are visting. 
31179 Super friendly staff,clean and comfortable room,and great location. My only suggestion is that to go for the little larger room. Upon arrival the staff gave us a chance to view the rooms and we quickly upgraded to larger for not much more money. Thanks for a great time.....we'll be back! 
31180 we stayed at west side Inn for 5 nights , rooms and bathrooms were clean , staff really freindly all depends of what kind of customer you are do not expect 5 stars service , you'll be fine there 
31181 maid service upon request ... 
31182 Thank you for a perfect stay during a crazy st. Patrick's Day weekend ! 
31183 Perfect room, perfect beds and a beautiful bathroom. Everything was new. Personel was very friendly and Times Square is just a walk away. No noise in the hotelroom from outside. We enjoyed our 3 day stay very much! 
31184 We stayed one night after completing a cruise. The hotel let us check in early which we really appreciated. It was a great location and everybody we came in contact with were exceptionally helpful. Would definitely stay there again.. 
31185 My hotel was better than other hotels I have stayed in NYC. Recommended it to colleagues visiting to NYC. 
31186 Location excellent. Very clean and comfortable. Staff efficient, courteous, friendly and helpful. Would recommend this hotel. 
31187 Not sure if we were in a refurbished room or not, room 632. But it was fine, 2 single beds, plenty wardrobe space, flat screen tv. Tiny but functional bathroom. Breakfast in hotel cafe was great. No problems at all, would definitely return. 
31188 The front desk is very helpful.The concierge has good offers.The location is very good.We loved it and we'll be back. 
31189 Hotel seemed a bit dreary. Seems poetic as the staff seemed just the same (nothing bad mind you). Rooms had a musty odor, however everything looked clean. Bed was standard and nothing was outstanding. Disappointing overall. 
31190 Charming, sophisticated, clean, comfortable, great customer service, subway out the front door, close to retaurants, shopping, entertainment. Everything you want in a New York hotel. Average cost/night b/w $160-$200. 
31191 We booked into this hotel and did not know what to expect. The people were nice at the desk and very helpful. The room was clean, but not beautifully decorated. It was convenient to the theater. Right for the price that we paid. 
31192 Check in and amenities were good. Free breakfast and evening cocktails a bonus. Room was good, but we needed to request extra towels for our family sized room. However, towels were provided pool side for swimming and hot tub. Overall it was a pleasant stay. 
31193 Wonderful hotel, very clean, friendly, courteous staff, comfy bed. Will be staying there again. 
31194 Wonderful place to stay downtown Chicago and only a block from Michigan ave. You can't ask for a more modern hotel. The building is old however they have done a great job keeping the inside up to date. I would stay here again. 
31195 Room is terrible: VERY small, only bed fits, no even space for luggage. One little window, view of a wall. I suggest: either go to more expensive hotel, or rent private appartments for that money (200$ per night for that room is TOO much even for NYC, imho) 
31196 Took forever to check-in, room was dirty, and when I said something to the front desk they gave an "I don't care" attitude. Not planning on returning. 
31197 Spectacular. Great service, beautiful hotel, great food. Too bad they're not a Starwood Hotel since I'm a Starwood junkie Platinum level member. 
31198 We had a nice stay in NY in the Night Hotel, which is very convenient localled close to where things happen in NY. 
31199 We found the hotel attractive and welcoming. The location was great for our stay in New York - Mid Town Midhattan is very accessible from the Time Hotel. The staff was very friendly and the room was very comfortable. 
31200 Buona la posizione. Stanza piccolissima al secondo piano (nonostante nella prenotazione avessi richiesto un piano alto), sull'interno del palazzo si vedono solo scale d'emergenza, finestra non apribile. Bagno mediocre. Riscaldamento non funzionante. Buono il ristorante. 
31201 Comfortable rooms excellent location stones through from Times Square would stay here again. 
31202 The service was not atypical of most Holiday Inn Express hotels, but the staff was unusally accommodating. I highly recommend this place. It is also at most a 15 min. walk from most anything site, restaurant, or shopping area downton. 
31203 The furnishings are very modern and clean. Lots of space and you can get comfortable pretty quickly. The staff is wonderful, very helpful and accommodating. 
31204 hotel molto particolare per l'impostazione "modaiola" e di tendenza; in posizione ottima (due passi da Columbus circle), ha camere un po piccole purtroppo la mia molto rumorosa,affacciata all'angolo della 9th e non adeguatamente insonorizzata: dal rumore notturno sembrava di esser affacciati sulla tangenziale Milano... 
31205 A large living area for NYC. But functional rather than really cool. I think they could have sacrificed some space for better quality fixtures and fittings. The bed was very comfortable, and it's quiet on the 37th floor. 
31206 Stayed here for a two day conference. The hotel is next to the river leading out to Lake Michigan. Depending on your room the views are great. The food was very good and the rooms were very updated and clean. 
31207 The BEST location in NY both for business and to discover the city. Also great achitecture and service. This is the place to stay in the Big Apple. No question. 
31208 We visited Chicago by Amtrak on a limited budget to see the symphony and a basketball game. We had a great time and overlooked the negative things. We received a good value for the money. We might stay there again. 
31209 Only stayed for 1 night but really enjoyed it. Great views and big clean room. Doesn't have the charm of some of the smaller hotels in New York but great if you want to be in the heart of Times Square. 
31210 Great hotel. Mini suites could have used two tv's one for the sitting area/roll out and one for the bedroom. 
31211 Good location but this is the only plus point. The hotel rooms are very old and the bathroom horrible. One advise : choose an other hotel. For the price you will find a lot better even in the same location. 
31212 Service - friendly especially for NYC! Rooms - decent sized, modern, clean and comfortable (ask to see a room first!) Overall - great value - one of NYCs cheaper hotels in a great location, lovely rooms, nice people. Highly recommended. 
31213 awesome staff, spotless room, great location!!! take dress shoes if you want to go to the skytop lounge!! will stay again. 
31214 Very nice hotel with lovely public rooms, attentive service, beautifully appointed rooms (small bathrooms.) Very busy, lots of business travellers, but still maintains quality service. Unfortunately, the location is on a very busy street and the almost constant honking horns make it difficult to get a quiet night's sleep. 
31215 The location is great! Price is reasonable as well. Front desk staff is friendly, especially Elizabeth! Shes patient, professional, and very approachable. Strongly recommend this place 
31216 I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago this past weekend. It was awesome location just steps to Michigan Avenue Deluxe Shopping, The Water Tours, The Marilyn in front of Chicago Tribune, and River Walk. The room was beautiful and the staff very helpful and friendly. I recommend this property highly. 
31217 Nice facility, but it's out of the way a bit. Circumstances led us to have dinner there at 'Print', and it was very good. 
31218 Room was adequate. Bed was comfortable. location close to shops and restaurants. There are other choices in the same price range. 
31219 In posizione strategica, direttamente sopra la Grand Central Station e la metropolitana e comunque al centro delle attrazioni 
31220 Ha un coffee bar aperto da poco nella hall, ma se si vuole risparmiare basta accedere alla stazione e si trovano, bar, ristoranti, negozi di ogni genere. Letto comodissimo. 
31221 Love New York! Great location, service and staff! Great view, Can't wait to be back. was bit hard to see from the street but throb Walk to everything shops eateries and more. Thanks for a memorable time. 
31222 Stayed overnight on July 29th. Great access to 5th Ave. and Times Square/Theatres. Overnight parking was handy across the street. 
31223 For business near the Galleria this property works fine. It's convenient in every way: service, rooms, restaurant, exercise room, etc. 
31224 Maximum comfort, unfailingly pleasant and helpful staff, clean room and a comfortable bed. The breakfast offerings were tasty and fresh. A nice lobby bar with friendly service. What more could one ask for? I'd return there in an instant. 
31225 The location of New York Inn is amazing! You can walk for everywhere! Just some blocks from Times Square! The staff is really really friendly and veeeery kind! I really recomend! 
31226 Great location, 1 min walk of the mile and opp is a 7/11 where we got a cuppa tea every morning which was handy, they provide a coffee machinein room but I don't drink it, gym is small but quite so not problem using machines 
31227 Their employees were extremely helpful and nice in every way! Their rooms and bathrooms and kitchens were impeccable! The location was perfect with movie theaters, restaurants, shops, transportation, and convenient parking all within the area! I will definitely stay here again and recommend it to all of my friends! 
31228 Loved our stay here- the rooms were spacious and well appointed, very clean and amazingly quiet. The location is great- can walk just about everywhere. Heaps of food choices locally. All staff we encountered were friendly and helpful, especially the doormen- they were great! Cant wait to return. 
31229 Spacey, quiet with a sense of luxury. I would definitely choose it again and I highly recommend it. However parking should be cheaper (I find the 52$ a lot), breakfast needs some refining (it is good quality but limited in variety) and front desk needs more employees. 
31230 tiene solera,pero si lo que quieres es estar centrico,lo tienes casi todo cerca. 
31231 I've stayed here a couple of times and been very happy with the price of the rooms and the location. The rooms are a little dated but everything is clean and the beds are comfortable. Short walk from the trains and lots of good restaurants nearby. 
31232 The customer service was great. Very friendly and very helpful. 
31233 We just left NYC today and I already miss it. hotel staff was very attentive and eager to help. We will go back in September and most definitely will be staying at this hotel. Great location and great service. Thanks to each and everyone!!! Traveler from Chicago,IL. 
31234 Perfect location for a quiet night's sleep in the city~ but close to great shopping and activity~! (42nd Street is a block away~) Thanks to Leonore for recommending her favorite store - Barami~ Cant wait to return~ 
31235 I stayed here with my wife for our one year wedding anni, and all I can say is location. It is within walking distance of everything, The rooms were clean and the staff very helpful. 
31236 Decent hotel, with basic ammenities. Clean and comfortable, courteous staff. They also have a shuttle service to shopping area and airport. The only drawback is that is has limited restuarant options within the hotel and around it. 
31237 One of the best Hilton brand hotels I've stayed at (I'm a Diamond member and have seen many). Clean, comfortable, reasonably large rooms, particularly for Manhattan, ideal mid-town location, great staff, reasonably priced, impressively fast internet (and elevators). I will definitely stay here again. 
31238 I left the hotel with a $211 bill and arived home with a $241 charge to my account. When I called the manager, he predictably sent me to the accounting department who was no longer working. I can't recommend a hotel that employs these tatics. 
31239 I stayed here only for one night, but it was very nice. Right in the heart of Times Square and I had a great view of the City. The customer services was excellent. 
31240 Everyone is friendly and the rooms are clean. Why pay $100 or more when you can have the same size room and service for less.Sheene, the girl at the front desk is so friendly and always willing to help. 
31241 An absolutely first-rate budget hotel providing excellent value for money. Accommodation was clean and comfortable, I never had to queue for the shower, and the breakfasts were delicious. I would make this my first choice of hotel every time. 
31242 This hotel is in great location in the middle of NYC. Hotel is old and you can not compare it to brand new hotel. But if you want to sleep in classic clean old New York building with great atmosfere try this one! 
31243 I've stayed at 4 and 5 star hotels all over Manhattan. Over the past year, however, I have returned each time to the Eventi. Wonderful staff, beautiful hotel, incredibly comfortable rooms and for my needs terrific location. 
31244 I booked this room through Hotwire and good thing I got a hefty discount because this place is not worth the rack rate. The hotel is band new, clean and modern (the rooms are tiny but functional). However, the staff is disinterested, unhelpful, unwelcoming and really soured the whole experience. 
31245 Rooms were small but modern, very well designed and clean with free wifi. Location was excellent and only 5 mins walk from Times Square. Free coffee and muffins were nice in the mornings. Didn't try restaurant. Staff very helpful. Would definitely go back! 
31246 Great hotel,friendly staff great location,clean and tidy,would recomend to anyone who wants a good hotel at a reasonable rate 
31247 Average,Generic,Dated, European pakage deal hotel.Good Location is its best quality 
31248 Mold rennovation project currently in progress. Breakfast; Hot Bar was $14.02 with tax before tip. The facility & food are well below average. Overpriced for the experience. Staff was friendly & helpful. 
31249 Y con esa ubicacion, no pretenderas que sea de lujo. Si buscas ubicacion, esta perfecto. Pero todo el hotel es viejo y las habitaciones estan un poco descuidadas. Si buscas ahorrar, para NYC esta perfecto!!!! 
31250 Great staff ... great location ... what a wonderful weekend. We'll be back. 
31251 We were three friends coming to NYC from Rochester,NY, California and upstate NY. The Edison Hotel was picked for its location and its price. It was clean and safe. We had a good experience at this hotel. The people were friendly and nice. Agnes D, Judy T. and Ramon S. 
31252 We used the Sheraton Brookhollow location as our hub for accomodating our friends and family for our wedding reception. The staff was very accomodating to our needs and the hotel had ammenitites for a variety of guests. The restaurant, bar, and shuttle made things easy for out of town guests. 
31253 I love this hotel, while it is a cruel reminder of 9/11 it is great to see this hotel open again! It is convenient to everything Wall Street! 
31254 The Lucerne is very clean and safe - in a beautiful neighborhood. I was only one block from Amsterdam and one block from the #1/9 train! The staff was extremely friendly and helpful - I was treated much better than I expected for this rate. I'll definitely stay there again. 
31255 This hotel is absolutely a must! The service is excellent and the staff is highly professional. The lobby is a dream and the view is romantic. Even the bathrooms are fabulous... 
31256 great location to get to downtown we were in town for Houston Marathon quiet rooms bonus of complementary late check out to anyone running the marathon of 3pm very helpful 
31257 The room was horrible--I don't mind a small room in NYC, but this one had a horrible odor, like mold. The bed was hard as a rock, the furniture falling apart and the room could barely accommodate two people and luggage. Never again. Only plus was location. 
31258 Very interesting hotel at 10 mns from Time Square and 5mns from the Subway, well located! Nice service, very polite and open minded personal. Everything you need to enjoy your stay in New York 
31259 - Great location - Busier than a train station with more traffic - Small 3 star quality rooms - Kangu hammer drilling at 10am.. - very expensive ($100 for breakfast...) 
31260 This hotel experience was excellent! The staff was extremely friendly and accomodating. The location and design/comfort aspects of the hotel are wonderful. I highly recommend to anyone visiting NY from a liesure or business perspective. 
31261 Hotel exceeded our expectations. Room was enormous and very elegant. Perfect honeymoon suite.will definitely stay there again 
31262 This was by far the nicest experience that I've had in NYC hotels. The rooms were big, clean, beautifully decorated, and 1 block away from Penn station. I could not have been more pleased. 
31263 Stayed in a suite, best room i have booked! Couldn't fault anything! If anyone faults this hotel they have a problem! :) 
31264 super friendly staff a very clean and comfortable room a very helpfvol staff during hurricane irene good beds big and clean bathroom great location we loo forward to our next visit to new york 
31265 This was a lovely "irish feel" hotel, excellent staff, priced well for NY, great location to main business areas and local shopping 
31266 Great location. Friendly and helpful staff. Great value. Clean. Will definitely stay there again. 
31267 Renewed hotel, very good location and price, excelent room, good Business Center with free internet and printer, nice staff. Definetely recommended. Everything worked fine and I have no complaints at all. Just be aware of the prices of the minibar and parking, they are very expensive! 
31268 Location was absolutely wonderful. its like having your own highrise condo in the heart of the city. found the hotel on luxury group and was very please. 
31269 This is the second time I stayed here and I would definitely come back again and again. Rooms have everything you need and the staff if very friendly. 
31270 Voor tieners die de eerste keer in New York komen: 'breath taking'. Groot, veel, lawaaierig, indrukwekkend, cool = the city that never sleeps. Laatste week van oktober en dan nog 25 Celcius .... wow! 
31271 We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August 2010. Our room was large for NYC standards, clean and in a great midtown location. Air conditioning unit in our room was quite noisy. Overall, it's a comfortable place to return to after a busy day sightseeing. 
31272 The people who work here are absolutely wonderful--front desk, dining room, housekeeping, maintenance, back office, general manager. Very clean and well appointed common areas, rooms quiet. We stayed 8 weeks in an accessable room that was very comfortable. However, the entire staff made the long stay very nice. 
31273 Our HR Technology conference hotel was sold out so we booked this and it was surprisingly very nice. Only compliant would maybe be the elevators were slow. Room was nice and clean. Rate was reasonable. Free dinner and drinks in the evening and free breakfast pretty good. 
31274 I loved this hotel and I have stayed in a number of NY hotels over the years. The room was spacious and a great price. The staff was outstanding. The location was terrific! Anything I needed was promptly taken care of. Could not have asked for anything more! 
31275 If you like dirty small rooms with hardly functioning air conditioning and no safe , cracked sink , then this is the place for you 
31276 We checked out after one night having paid for two , that's how bad it was ! 
31277 We get a hotel in the city every year for our Anniversery for the past six years and this is the best stay we had. We really enjoyed this hotel. We will definitely stay again and recommend this hotel to friends. You made our Anniversary very memorable. 
31278 Beautiful Rooms Charming Ambience-Feels like the old Lower East Side Very helpful staff Only downside is we did not want to leave the hotel 
31279 The room was clean, newly renovated, and modern. Location was great, right in the Theatre District. The only thing I disliked was that the bathroom door was sliding and did not provide much privacy. 
31280 Very nice hotel. I had stayed here in the past, it is still good and getting better. I would highly recommend this hotel for business travelers, girlfriend trips, seniors, and families. There are plenty of restaurants available in the area. Also very convienient to the freeway. 
31281 Hotel seemed new and everything was in great shape. 
31282 Good, clean quiet hotel at a decent price ($175) Stayed here 4 days- only problem was that internet access was a little spotty, but not a big deal. Continental b-fast was boring, but most are. Staff was pretty cool. 
31283 Our favorite hotel in the city is the Waldorf. Staff is solicitous and courteous, concierge came through with 5th row Yankees tickets a few hours before game. Perfect central location, comfortable accommodations, a great base for walking the city. Many happy family trips here, lots of good memories. 
31284 I was at the hotel for a bussiness meeting recently and was impressed with all aspects of the hotel. The rooms were clean and well maintained and the food and service during the meetings was outstanding. I would highly recommmend this hotel to anyone coming to the the Chicago area. 
31285 This hotel was great! Miriam was so wonderful, she really took care of us and made sure that we were well taken care of. 
31286 Wer in New York ein gut gelegenes und preiswertes Hotel sucht, ist im Wellington gut aufgehoben. Metrostation neben der Eingangstuer, Central Park, Times Square, Fifth Avenue und Broadway im Umkreis von rund 300 m - besser geht es eigentlich nicht. 
31287 Great location. Very clean a Typical Wingate property. Breakfast was very good as usual. Minutes from Times Square. Staff very attentive. Smaller property therefore not much conjestion. Will return to same place next month 
31288 At first the guy tried putting me in a standard room when I had a free upgrade. I brought this to his attention, and then we got the superior room, which I and my bf enjoyed. 
31289 Nothing special about this hotel but good location and pleasant staff. The rooms are big (for NYC) and the place is clean, if a little dated. Good value for money. 
31290 Chambre hyper petite, on entend des bruits effrayant de tuyauterie comme si cela allait parfois exploser, je ne suis pas difficile du tout mais je deconseille vraiment cet hotel, tres mauvaise experience. je me suis inscris juste pour en temoigner. 
31291 I had a very nice stay at this hotel. The staff is very friendly and pleasant to talk to. Everything went above expectations. 
31292 What a great Hotel, new with great facilities including a fridge and safety deposit box. Immaculate room. Recommend to everyone. 
31293 Ive stayed in a lot of manhattan hotels and this is by far the best. the location is great. the rooms are new, modern, spacious and the staff are helpful. great burgers in the resteraunt attached. no complaints whatsoever.would return again. 
31294 We stayed on the 50th floor and room was wonderful. Views everywhere 
31295 Staff very attentive and quick to respond to your needs. Bathroom was huge and extremely clean. Bedroom was at little stuffy but the hotel gave us a fan so it worked out. Highly recommended. 
31296 I stayed at this hotel in October for a conference. It was very close to public transportation which made getting around great, The hotel was very clean and the staff was great! This was my first experience there but I will be back. 
31297 Not my first time staying here... Love the nice modern rooms. Excellent location across the street from the Galleria. Would stay here again... 
31298 Lovely Houston mainstay - floor to ceiling windows gives rooms a treehouse feel. Comfortably elegant with gorgeous grounds. My son loved the pool area. Excellent service - the manager made us feel welcome and sent some treats up to our room before turndown. Wonderfully classic place to stay in Houston. 
31299 The Standard East Village was a perfect location. The views of the Empire State building were awesome. The corner King rooms are a great way to stay in the city. Cool bathrooms and nice lighting just added to a perfect weekend. 
31300 Good value for a City hotel. CHarming architecture, Starbucks in Lobby, convenient to everything we needed. 
31301 Odeur bizzard dans les couloirs, chambre un peu poussiereuse mais propre, douches propres. Tres bon pour le prix, bien place (metro a 2 blocs), acceuil sympa, conseille aux jeunes a petit budget. Deconseille pour sejour romantique... 
31302 Viajamos a Nueva york con mi marido y tres hijos. Alojamos en hotel San Carlos en un dpto, es decir 1 suite y un estar con sofa cama y kitchen. Fue una excelente eleccion , quedamos muy contentos. Ademas la ubicacion de primera. volveriamos a ir al mismo hotel ! 
31303 I can't complain about a single thing other than the high price. I would have stayed at the Days Inn for $50/ night less, but they were full. I'll probably try the Days Inn 1st again next time. Make the price more reasonable, and you'll have a customer for life. 
31304 Hotel Carter ligt echt om de hoek van Times Square. Als je tevreden bent met een net bed, om de dag schone handdoeken en opgemaakte bedden en hier en daar wat achterstallig onderhoud(!!!) beveel ik dit zeer voordelige hotel ten zeerste aan. 
31305 Managed to snag a really good deal on priceline, and was pleasantly surprised with our room size. It was a huge room with a beautiful view of the 911 memorial. Location was good with subway stations nearby, but as we were here during thanksgiving, the financial district seemed quite deserted. 
31306 Great location, great service, friendly staff, but lighting was deficient in our room. 2nd floor lounge was very nice. 
31307 Traveling with teenage son, received free room upgrade at check in. Room was clean and efficient, very large for NYC. Appreciated the kitchenette. Furniture was not the newest, but for our purposes the room was more than satisfactory. 
31308 A nice overall stay. Only one night, so perhaps not long enough to really get a good idea of the hotels amenities. I would stay here again when in NYC 
31309 This hotel is at a great location. Restaurants, shops, public transportation, everything is just a few blocks away. The room was small, but very clean. Nice king size bed. 
31310 This place rocks!! The best service I ever imagined. Even got us a limo to the airport. Meme at the front desk was the best--I have nothing but good things to say about this place--clean--good location---great breakfast bar---awesome staff--I cannot say enough--will stay there again when visiting--Sean Dixon 
31311 Quite clean, the staff very friendly and helpful. Great rooms, when you're so tired you feel like in heaven. A lot of comfort. Good food, nice location, very good priced. I wish I'd be able to stay in a hotel nearer to downtown, but still enjoyed this one. 
31312 Booked this for a fun weekend outing with the hubby. We loved it. The hotel was newly renovated in a modern hipster decor and the service was great. 
31313 The location of this hotel is fantastic. Times Square is just around the corner, Starbucks across the road and a couple of Irish pubs next door. The rooms were clean, wifi good and beds comfortable. This hotel was perfect for our short stay in New York. 
31314 The Hotel Grand Union was centrally located to major shopping areas and restaurants. My room was great, cleaned everyday clean sheets and towels. The staff was great and eager to assist me with all my questions about NY. I will be back during the summer. 
31315 Myself and my husband have just returned home from a week in your hotel. It was a wonderful experience from the start until we left. Our trips in the Rolls Royce to Rodeo Drive & The Polo Lounge made it magical. We will be back. Thank you. 
31316 A quiet spot amidst the bustle of the upper west side. A great find. 
31317 hotel/hostel pequeno, mas bem arrumado e bem localizado... otimo custo/beneficio!!! 
31318 Stayed here for two nights, great location, great service. Small rooms but perfectly fine for the amount of time we were actually in the room. No street noise. 
31319 Third time in NYC first time in this hotel and everything was spot on! Stayed here for 6 nights for new year and couldn't ask for more! Spotless, polite staff and great location macys pretty much on the doorstep what more do want! Marc Southampton 
31320 would have expected better from a luxury hotel. you can still feel it was an old hotel. Service was not particularly friendly, just average. 
31321 There were bugs in the bathroom and on the desk. Other then bugs, the room was OK, bed was comfortable. Fitness center was in good condition as was the business center. The staff were excellent. Friendly, knowledgeable, helpful and welcoming. Parking was expensive. Valets were pleasant. 
31322 bon hotel vieux mais propre; toujours demander des chambres donnant sur l'arriere car les bruits de la rue sont assourdissants dans les chambres de devant! essayer aussi d avoir les chambres avec kitchenette, cest le meme prix! 
31323 In for the holidays with family to see family. Great staff, breakfast and room. 
31324 The sofitel is a great hotel in the heart of New York City. The staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are comfortable. The bathroom is beautiful and the bed is wonderful for a great night of sleep. For the money it is the best bet in town! 
31325 This hotel is so bad it's comical. Pealing paint, worn out furniture, stains everywhere. It's amazing they're still in business. 
31326 rooms are big, but bathroom is quiet small and ramshackle. The service is not very good, staff is rude and hasty. I booked a triple, but the 3th bed wasn't ready. 
31327 Woke up to no hot water and had a big meeting. Not a good way to start the day. They comped the room, but I would have rather had the hot water. 
31328 This hotel is in a perfect location. The rooms are clean and the staff friendly. Yes, they are small, but this is New York! I can't think of anything negative to say. Traveled with my two daughters in the early 20's and had a blast! 
31329 The hotel staff was attentive and nice (which is a change from your normal New York encounters). They took care of everything and the hotel was very cool. The terrace had excellent pancakes and atmosphere. 
31330 Just returned from a week at the Comfort Suites in Houston. The hotel is great and so is the service. It is close to Astroworld, Relaint Stadium, and other Houston attractions. It was hot in Houston... but the facilites at the Hotel were extermely well kept, and cool. 
31331 Very well located with nice rooms. The attendants are very nice, i could send a lot of Packages to be delivered there and they're very kind about it. You walk few meters to be at Times Square, with many Metro stations nearby. Definitely recommend it. 
31332 This is a great hotel- perfect location. Tons of shopping and FREE BREAKFAST!!! Front desk extremely helpful. Enjoyed my stay and will definitely will come back (: 
31333 Very nice hotel overall. The rooms were spacious and clean with a kitchen and desk. Wish the wifi worked better and the hotel was in a better location but would stay here again. 
31334 Pluses: great staff, decent breakfast, cozy fireplace. Minuses: hard bed, very worn looking, especially for the price. 
31335 Room was beautiful, clean and quiet for NYC. It even came with one of those sound machines with about 8 choices of sound - I chose ocean waves. Maybe that is why I thought it was quiet. A/C worked great too. Definitely plan to stay there again. 
31336 Decent and Clean Rooms, Excellent Service, Internet in Lobby and a walks distance to Times Square....great value !!! 
31337 It's no wonder this hotel is always "on sale"...do not be fooled! it's no where near a 4 star hotel. There are so many other hotel options in this area...steer clear of this one! Horrible customer service and everything else was no better than a 2 star hotel. 
31338 Stayed at this Hotel for a 2 day meeting. Very nice room,comfortable bed and excellent service. The main problem with the hotel is that Houston closes up at 5 pm. Unable to find a good place to eat within walking distance. The breakfast buffet at the hotel is a rip-off. 
31339 Art deco classic , amazing building that looks best the way it is without renovation! Only problem was banging from service room about ours, other than that very very good 
31340 The desk people were so helpful. The location was incredibly great; across the street from Penn Station, and down the street a few blocks from Times Square. It was awesome! We are returning in a few weeks, in the fall. 
31341 I was in Houston for business, marriot was really a nice place to stay, the property is really good, the service was excellent and the staffs were really friendly. I totally recommend this hotel for any type of visits. thanx 
31342 This hotel charged me $500 for a reservation adjustment five minutes after making the original booking. I got nowhere with the staff over this. A complete fraud. Also the neighborhood surrounding is devoid of nightlife 
31343 So many other hotels to choose from. 
31344 When I need some important papers delivered in a rush; the Whatever/Whenever team delivered. (Thank you Gizelle!). Congratulations to the GM, Patrick and his team. Great hotel in a great location, clean and efficient rooms. 
31345 Embora nao seja diretamente no hotel mas, havia uma obra com um bate estaca toda a madrugada da Sexta feira para os hospedes que estavam nos quartos voltados para a Park Avenue um incoveniente inaceitavel 
31346 Excellent service. Very friendly NewYork welcome. Edwin was courteous and made me welcome. Didn't have time to explore. Next time maybe :-). It is easily reachable from LaGuardia and close to the WTC cluster. 
31347 The location of this hotel is superb. A stonesthrow away from Times Square. As soon as you step out of the hotel, everything you need in right there. (Shake Shack!) Rooms are clean and nice. Internet was fast but you will need to pay extra. Had 2 good nights sleep. 
31348 People who work here are so nice...but the rooms are incredibly small, old, and the smell from the airconditioner (which had to run constantly due to the heat) was unbearable. We traded rooms twice...and the maid kept spraying some very strong air freshener.. into the airconditioner. Horrible! 
31349 I highly recommend this hotel for business or pleasure! 
31350 Hotel is in a great location. Lobby is nice. Workers are great. The rooms are extremely small and tired. Carpeting, paint, bathrooms are in bad shape. Rooms need complete renovation.. 
31351 Excellent location + friendly staff + clean and spaceouss room. We asked for an early check-in at the front desk and we received it promptly. We used the restaurant a few times and the service was nice. Location is fantastic. 
31352 Stayed here for my birthday like a home away from home. The room was very nice bed was comfy and the little bathroom was very cute and clean and only 10 mins from grand luxe cafe where we had dinner will definitely stay here again! 
31353 Everything was fine. Great service and great room. Loved the bed. Very comfortable. 
31354 Perfect location for the theater district. Walk out the front door and you are less than a block from plays and great restaurants .Great check in person at the hotel.Wish I could remember her name). Room was clean and very presentable. I would return 
31355 buona la posizione, camere piccole soprattutto per 4, bagni vecchi, pulizia molto scarsa e condizionatori d'aria vetusti, oltre ad essere fastidiosamente rumorosi immettono i camera aria viziata. Personale non sempre disponibile 
31356 Fantastic boutique hotel right off Times Square. Great staff, service, and good rooms. The wine & cheese durign early evenings was a ncie touch. Will defintly stay again during upcoming NYC visits. 
31357 The room is nicely decorated and the bed is comfy. There is a Starbucks in the lobby with free wi-fi. The hotel is within walking distance (10-15min) to a Wal-Mart and a Target. The only complain is that there is no free wi-fi in the room. 
31358 Good site wonderfully comfortable beds very helpful staff concierge services The room is well equipped 
31359 Checked in for four days last week. Was in town for business. Its located a couple blocks away from Madison Square Garden. Hotel is ok and decent location. Room was small but quiet. Not a lot of noise from the street. No microwave or fridge. All in all, just ok. 
31360 The Hotel Wolcott was very pleasant, the room was reasonable and very clean. We enjoyed our stay there and will go back. 
31361 I stayed at the Fairmont on a business trip recently and thought it was a top-notch city hotel. Great location near Michigan Avenue, the Art Institute, and downtown Chicago. Great views over the city and lake. A large and comfortable room. Also excellent meeting facilities. 
31362 lovely hotel, good location, bit expensive, but that's manhattan, friendly staff and very helpfull, love to stay there again next time!!!!! 
31363 Not keen on massive hotels this appealed due to it's smaller stature and location. We weren't disappointed. The room was lovely and plenty of room for all our stuff. Great location, pleasant staff. Would stay here again. 
31364 Once again, Kimpton Hotels didn't disappoint!! The staff were super friendly and helpful and the location of the Eventi couldn't have been better. Even though the room was very small - to be expected in NYC - the huge windows and good size bathroom were a plus. We'd definitely return. 
31365 Upgraded to a central park view room well worth it. The staff where amazing could not fault anything about the place. Would have no doubt about staying there next time I go. 
31366 Never stay or go to work for this motel, since the owner just want to rip of the employees and the customer. They are the worst ethics people on world. 
31367 We really enjoy it! We were coming from a traumatized accident with the flood that killed more ten 1000 people in the city where we have our vacations house in the mountains. We needed that relax. The hotel is very clean, the staff is quite nice. It was perfect. 
31368 Great location, best value for money (40$/night for double room), clean bathroom, simple rooms with nice furniture but could be cleaner - dirty carpet, blanket and very untidy cloak-room. bored and unkind receptionists. But I can recommend it for the price and location. 
31369 Hotel attrezzatissimo, personale cortese, meraviglioso, old style,bello romantico affascinante, posizione eccezionale a Manhattan! ha superato le aspettative! camera bella accogliente comoda attrezzata di tutto il necessario. Sturbucks proprio nella hall dell'hotel..insomma speriamo di tornarci! 
31370 The hotel reminded us of Italy. The room was great,the staff friendly and professional,and location perfect for theater goers. 
31371 The hotel has a good comfort, and affordable prices, also near to main streets and the metro, very important if you don't rent a car. 
31372 Great hotel for the price. Room was very clean and maybe recently redone. Would definitely stay here again. 
31373 We attended from Ohio for a wedding. Compared to other area prices it was a steal. I planned only to cleanse and sleep in my room and it was more than adequate. Plan to return in the fall to enjoy more of the city. 
31374 Quiet, peaceful, heck of a location, roomy by New York standards. The walls appear to be a little thicker than the standard. Which means that the BOOM from closing doors is mitigated. 
31375 Clean, quiet comfortable room and a great location for sight seeing! Lobby level bar even has decent wine (Ferrari Carrano) at $11/glass--pleasant surprise for NY! Large fitness center. The club is decent with cold breakfast food but fresh and a good mix. 
31376 The rooms were a little pricey, but its new york. Location is great !! i would visit again. Lisa was a little rude to me, but that was ok. Other than that It was a great night stay. I do not really have any compliants 
31377 Close to Grand Central-Metro North. Good price for NYC on Priceline. Small but comfortable room. Bring earplugs. 
31378 I thought this hotel was fine. The elevator and common areas were a bit dated, but the location is good for business and the sheets and staff were very good to deal with. The good news is the rates that I got seemed to reflect the condition of the hotel. 
31379 Great rooms and fantastic view over the Hudson river 
31380 We meet every Tuesday morning for our Houston Executive Roundtable business networking meeting and the staff treats us as kings. They are great. and I hope we are here for a long, long time. They serve us breakfast and make sure all our needs are taken care of 
31381 Convenient but small. Extremely small rooms, not very clean, dark corridors, and very expensive bar (even to NY standards). The one redeeming factor was it was a 30 second walk to Times Square. The concierge was not helpful, they knew the basics and could not offer any exclusive tips. 
31382 Corner suite , lake and city view, courteous and accommodating staff as usual - only place we'll stay downtown Chicago plus they're green and reward you with half off nightly parking charge! 
31383 What a delightful surprise to find this gem. Courteous staff, immaculate facility, excellent location and much more. My first impression of a warm and friendly place stayed with me throughout my stay. I highly reccommend this hotel. 
31384 We absolutley loved it here. The staff were so nice and helpful. The rooms were a great size especially for New York. Very modern and up to date. The bed was the most comfortable bed I ever slept in. Will definitley stay here again. Cant Wait!! 
31385 1. Close to airport. Convenient place. 2. Service is so-so. Below Average. 3. Crazy rate for long distance ($7/min) call in room. 
31386 This was nearly the worst hotel I have ever stayed. My room was old, not clean, lighting miscommunications, and location with not transportation mid-day a nightmare! I will never recommend this hotel. 
31387 nice situated. Very good rooms. Free Internet. Close to Brodway and to many intersting places 
31388 The service is nice and the reception clerk is very polite and ccooprative 
31389 The only positive experience from our stay at NH Jolly Madison was the proximity to grand central and the empire state building. Everything about the hotel is old and smelly. 
31390 I loved the modern, sleek decor. Very comfortable bed. Excellent location. There is a very nice, large drugstore across the street to pick up snacks, bottled water, etc. USA Today every morning--outside door. Was not impressed with room service--food was not enjoyable for the price. 
31391 stayed there for two years in a row we always had clean sheets and towels was great for the price,elevators are slow staff not too friendly,but close to everything but not worth staying for $140.00-$160.00 per night,there are better ones for that price 
31392 The service here is great. More incredible than the design is the service. Wish I could come here everyday.. 
31393 If you want to be close to Times Square and the Theatre District, this hotel is perfect. It is just a few minutes walk to these exciting areas. The hotel is clean, the breakfast is ok and the beds are very comfortable. 
31394 Just returned from new York, hotel was excellent. Friendly staff and nice clean hotel, beds were so comfy!! 
31395 Great location for all attractions and Starbucks very handy to start off the day!!! Would definately stay again 
31396 Only one lightbulb worked in main room light / Radio didn't work - called for new one which didn't come / shower control automatically went to superhot which was a scalding danger 
31397 After speaking to their rep.and getting their very best price incl.auto.........we were pleasantly surprised at the friendliness and cleanliness of the hotel. Rec'd 2 free drinks and all of the staff was exceptional from the front desk,maids and doorman and waitstaff. Will stay there again in a heartbeat.......... 
31398 I try to stay at a Doubletree whenever I travel. I like the well appointed rooms and the reasonable rates. Friendly and professional staff too. 
31399 A very unique hotel experience, almost like staying at home in a big city. Rooms are large, loved the locale. Was skeptical after reading some of the negative reviews, but I'd stay there again in a heartbeat. 
31400 Loved the hotel. Very stylish and modern. Comfortable beds. Staff eS very friendly and helpful. I would definitely stay again. 
31401 Business / Fun trip (brought my family). This place is about location, location, location. Just close enough to Broadway and Times Square to be fun, but not super convenient for business. Rooms were not super clean is my only complaint. Overall a good value for Manhattan. 
31402 Nothing that particularly wowed me about the place. The room was nice but not amazing, the service was reasonable, but again nothing that wowed me. The price nothing special. I don't feel anyone would be disappointed with the place, but it won't astound you either. 
31403 This hotel might not wow you with glitz and glamour, but it was just right for my two-night stay. The bed was super comfy, the location was perfect, and the staff was always courteous and helpful. 
31404 My only complaint is the very noisy A/C. The room was clean (rooms are small in NYC and that's expected) and the staff were very friendly. Secure location. Great street. Well lit. Excellent spot. 
31405 The service at the hotel was great. We were there for a family weekend and also loved the location. Th Concierge Service and their recomendations were great. 
31406 Very clean and attractive room. Staff was extremely helpful and friendly. 
31407 Surprisingly nice! Beds were quite comfortable; rooms were spacious. The bathroom in the room was a bit small, and the sink was a bit awkward (low and outside the bath). The bar was a great addition in the lobby area! 
31408 We were only here for one night, and we will be back! Excellent location, full service menu, lobby bar, great people watching on Lexington Ave. The rooms were excellent, clean, well arranged, bed was MOST comfortable and the staff was kind and attentive. 
31409 If you're looking for a place to crash in the evening and have a decent night sleep this is the perfect hotel for you! decent prices at an amazing location, no deals like that. nice service and good value for your money. 
31410 My husband and I stay at the Bentley about twice per month and are always welcomed warmly, as if we were family. Robert is a great help to us, as is the rest of the staff. The Bentley is our New York home. 
31411 A very basic, no frills motel with free parking in a lot outside the motel. Very interesting variety of customers. Good & fast food in adjacent coffee shop...if you can find an open seat!! 
31412 Great ambiance, friendly, helpful staff, decor was tastefully done. The rooms were comfortable. Roof Top view was superb at night! In all a great experience. This hotel was well situated for all the sights! No distance to subway. The restaurant was excellent. 
31413 This was a pretty cool looking Hotel but it need a few new up dates like the TV. We are in the age of Flat Panel TVs. Also they should have Wifi. Other then that Awsome Hotel would recommend. 
31414 This trendy hotel is very nice to look at and the rooms are cool but the staff does not care about customer satisfaction. The suits are not worth the price but the spa is outstanding. NEVER host a party there, the cost is very high and the service is horrible. 
31415 While in New York I lost my credit card. The hotel worked with me for payment during my stay. They allowed me to pay my bill daily with cash. 
31416 Nice and clean suite with good housekeeping service. Great location at the top of times square. Small and dangerous valet/taxi pull-up space. Small lobby area. Small hallways and suite. Small restaurant on 5th floor (windowless I think). Parking attendant cleaned out my car change. 
31417 2 Bedroom Suite was spacious but the room needs upgrading, shower and TV's are from the 80's. Room was not ready till after 3pm. Bed was very comfortable and sushi restaurant downstiars had a good vibe. 
31418 Stayed only one night, but staff was friendly and the room was clean. Would stay again. 
31419 This is a nice hotel but EXTREMELY overpriced. You would think late at night they would give you a break on price. I know they have the market cornered at the airport but gheez. 
31420 I stayed in one of the W's "cozy room(s)." It was the perfect size for one. Plenty of room and very efficiently design. Bathroom as well. Staff was friendly and helpful across the board. Delicious breakfast in the hotel restaurant. 
31421 We stayed for a week at the Strand. Super efficient staff who are polite and professional. Good room size, great elevators. Convenient location in Midtown garment district. 
31422 I have stayed at the Parker Meridien and found it to be merely adequate. The front desk is quite snooty and the decor is frayed. However the location is good and for a little extra $$ you can get a lovely view of Central Park. 
31423 I stay 2 to 3 times a year for business and have always had great service ...last week Nervea at the front desk was amazing. Thanks so much. d 
31424 Our interior room was lovely. Relatively quiet with a comfortable bed and nice linens. The staff was friendly and although the lobby was old, we didn't spend any time there so it didn't matter. The location of this hotel is fantastic and I would certainly stay here again. 
31425 It was a lovely stay at the Doubletree by Hilton. The staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the rooms were really nice. 
31426 Great location. Great staff all work hard to give the best service! 
31427 Ottima la posizione (praticamente si e' in times square), pulito, camere ampie e bellissimo l'arredamento (che non guasta). 
31428 Disguised as a "biggie", this sleeper offers boutique character and comfort. The staff is outstanding and very accommodating to individual needs. Surprisingly quiet rooms surpass oct NYC hotels. Excellent restaurant and bar, but shuts down a bit early for NYC. 
31429 The hotel was clean always. The staff were very courteous and ready to resolve any issues that arose. I would recommend it to anyone if asked. 
31430 Huge hotel connected to the airport. I was there for business, like everyone else I assume. Very convenient if you have the meetings in their facilities. Worked out just fine, very clean, nice, good service. I'd go back. 
31431 What a surprise! Rented room because A/C was out at home on holiday weekend. Despite the less than desirable area, the room, commons and pool are great! Will definitely recommend this property. Not all Days Inns are this nice. 
31432 Location is good if you want to experience chinatown, little italy and soho. Hotel staff are all friendly and hotel seems safe. Rooms are old but clean. Price is good. You won't want to linger in your room or the hotel. 
31433 Not a newer hotel but what you would expect at this price. Clean and roomy with friendly and helpful staff. 
31434 Het hotel heeft een uitstekende locatie (500 meter vanaf Times Square). Service is uitstekend en ze helpen je heel goed met informatie en tips over de stad. Kamers zijn wat gedateerd, maar wel netjes en voldoen goed. 
31435 The room we stayed in had recently been renovated. From the front desk staff to the room decor, everything was just awesome. Hotel was very clean, friendly and courteous staff who assisted us with booking a car-hire for 0400 pick-up to JFK. Will definitely stay here again when in NYC. 
31436 Small rooms, great location, good service. Times Square, Central Park and NYC train station are just a short walk from the hotel. 
31437 Asked for a high floor. Views from room window were of Tiffanys one way and the Lake the other. Beautiful & large room & clean. Location was a few steps off Michigan Ave & all the shopping. Helpful staff. Would return if I went back to Chicago. 
31438 Stayed for one night in early August as part of Great Rail Journey party. Unfortunately we ended up in a room with no view at all except for a roof. Location was good for Hancock Tower and Navy Pier though. 
31439 Hotel was amazing, suite was so luxurious, the service was so attentive. The hotel is out of this world and has such a history and splendour. There's no doubt it's not good value and is very expensive. 
31440 Free WIFI and parking. Great location. Close to the L and an easy walk to Magnificent Mile and most Loop attractions. Rooms are clean and comfortable. Nicer rooms then other Best Westerns I have stayed at. 
31441 Superb location.So close to Broadway,Central Station,Empire State Building and other attractions.Excellent Breakfast. Room was comfortable.Helpful front desk but unfortunately gentlemen who sat opposite the lifts appeared surly and unhelpful. 
31442 We were put into a TINY room with AN unpleasant smokey stench. We were moved THE NEXT DAY to a larger, nicer room, with a bottle of Chardonney given to us in compensation. The staff was very pleasant and helpful. 
31443 We have no complaints at all. Everything was exceptional! 
31444 I had a wonderful time staying here. The staff was very friendly and helpful, I loved the room (very modern, clean, free wifi) and the location was great as well. I'll definitely stay at this hotel again next time I'm in NYC. 
31445 Stayed here during a conference that was happening at the hotel. Great tools (request a Hudson view room on a higher floor). Very friendly staff. Evelyn, who checked us in, was just amazing and super efficient. Hope to come back again - with my family, on a holiday. 
31446 You are paying for the excellent location here in Midtown, within walking distance to everything touristy. Upon arrival we were pleasantly surprised. The hotel rooms are fine, the bathrooms are renovated, the room was clean with good beds. Overall, budget minded travelers will be very pleased!! 
31447 This hotel is really good, has probably the best location in all of new York, and it is very nice in the inside. The only thing that makes it sPecial though are the elevators, other than that it is not a very special hotel, good but not great. 
31448 This hotel is great - great view, great rooms, great bar, great service! The reservations department and conference service staff was awesome to work with. My clients LOVED the property, and the bar overlooking Times Square is a MUST SEE! 
31449 Extravagant lobby, helpful receptionist, lovely doormen and porters for the luggage. Doorman was especially helpful in hailing a taxi at 6:00 for when I was going to the apple store to buy an iPad 2. Rooms are great, food at breakfast and tea was gorgeous. 
31450 This is an amazing hotel, directly across the street from Water Tower, Hancock Building, Shopping galore, great food places like Ditka's only a block away. Beds are dreamy, staff is awesome and location cannot be beat. 
31451 Big spacious room, but no free wifi when it is available everywhere, even in the park! Disappointed! Extremely good location. McD breakfast, round the corner, is excellent! Walking distance to the Cloud gate aka ' Beam', Willis Tower for the sky bridge 
31452 My deluxe room was spacious, with a sofa, table, and chair. The desk was in a separate alcove. Right across from Penn Station, which was important for my needs. Would stay again. 
31453 Expensive hotel. The staff was... the staff do not know how are the hotel rooms... so they gave us a room near a BIG aircondition machine (out of the room, but too noisy!). Avoid this hotel!!! 
31454 The room was great and overall hotel is nice with its fancy interior, but people who work there on the front desk need to learn some better customer service skills. 
31455 The room is very big, and fairly nice. The bathroom is lovely. The staff in the breakfast room ignored us for 30 minutes while chattering amongst themselves. 
31456 Aside from the fact that there was no elevator (meaning a climb of several flights of stairs to my room) and the fact the rooms were extremely cramped, it was a good place to rest my head between days of exploring the bottom half of Manhatten. 
31457 Room was a bit small but okay for one night.. Great view from room..Parking was $40.00 for an SUV overnight. Had to go a couple of blocks to park. Waiting for car on a Sunday morning wasn't fun but kind of expected. Would definitely stay again 
31458 5 block walk from Grand Central, hotel staff were very welcoming. Cleanliness, comfort, and amenities of room were all top notch. Though exercise room is temporarily closed, hotel renovations did not affect us. Some decent restaurants within 1-2 blocks; fashion district very near. 
31459 My husband and I spent Memorial Day Weekend here and liked it. The location is great, I really like Soho and it's easy to get around from there. Price was reasonable, room was small but I guess that's to be expected for NY. 
31460 Spent six nights at this top New York hotel summer 2011. Highly recommended. 
31461 Compared to the cost of other hotels in this area of NYC the Milford could be considered a bargain at $220/ night. The hotel is currently undergoing what appears to be some extensive and probably badly needed refurbishment. Like most NYC hotels the Milford charges extra for wifi. 
31462 We stayed at The Benjamin in late September 2012. The staff was nice (actually the doorman ran to the middle of the street to greet us!), the room had a small "kitchenette" (sink, microwave, fridge) and was clean. I would definitely go back. 
31463 Stayed four days for an anniversary. Loved it! Great service, great price. 
31464 The employees were SO friendly, the rooms were HUGE and clean, and the maid service was great. You really cannot go wrong staying here! 
31465 Great location. Excellent rooms that meet your comfort needs. Attentive staff. Price to value is good. I would use this hotel again. Bonus is that it is right across the street from Le Bernardin, one of the best fish restaurants in America. 
31466 I spent my 1 year anniversary here and it was perfect. Garnet Lee was very helpful and took very good care of us. The house keeping staff responded to our requests in a lighting fast manner. Thank you for a memorial stay. See you next year! Thanks Dumont!! 
31467 on a three night getaway with my cousin, we stayed at the hampton inn on pearl st--GREAT CHOICE- the hotel was great-upscale beds and linens,hotel was immaculate, front desk was friendly and knowledgeable- especially OMAR--he is an asset to this property 
31468 We loved the location and the wonderful service and nice rooms. We have stayed here on our last four trips to New York and we will continue to stay here on our next visit. 
31469 Expect zilch, I booked this hotel via hotels and paid $200 inc taxes, never again, service was poor, elevator [--] and the rooms were extremely sparse 
31470 Este hotel eh novo e fica muito bem localizado, ha apenas 3 quadras da time square. tem uma decoracao muito inovadora e interessante. Serve um cafe da manha simples. Vale pena, eu voltararia com certeza. 
31471 This is a nice hotel and well located. It has a few rooms with wonderful central park views which are nice to get if you can. The rooms are a good size for New York and quite clean. Its one of my favorite places in NYC. 
31472 The hotel is right in the middle of the action and sights Chicago has to offer. Easy access to public transportation. 
31473 I went to Houston for the Essence Festival. The location was just ok, compared to the festival being in New Orleans. I stayed at the JW Marriott. This hotel was Fabulous, HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. 
31474 Best service ever,I have NO complaints about anything. Location is great, very clean rooms and receptionist very polite and helpful. I'm really looking forward on coming back on my next visit. Thank you so much. 
31475 stayed 1 night during the holidays and truly enjoyed it. our room was great. breakfast (included during holiday promotion) was one of the best. fitness center was very well-equipped. location is ideal. self-parking is free adjacent to the hotel. A+ 
31476 I've been to the Michelangelo about 8 times. It is a beautifully appointed hotel and very convenient to theaters. It has a European feel to it and is perfect for a luxurious theater getaway. 
31477 stayed in this hotel for 7 nights from the 16th april,room had a great view of the empire state ,maids cleaned daily,lobby staff were more than helpful,if youre visiting NY,i can certainly recommend this hotel. 
31478 hotel bien situado, un trato muy correcto y amable. Las camas estupendas se duerme fenomenal. 
31479 Comfortable and stylish hotel central to anything you want to do in NYC. Bar wasn't that great, but room, bed and bathroom up to Westin standard. 
31480 Seriously, my room had only a sofa bed. No real bed. Horrible. Shame on you. 
31481 After a 4 night stay I can say we were very happy with our stay in this great hotel. Our room was very clean and in full working order. The staff were all extremly helpfull and very polite. Had a fantastic (if rather expensive) meal in the Bull and Bear. 
31482 Great hotel location. Great sights to see and walk around. The room was simple elegant. The bed was very, very comfortable. Service was fine. I didn't not eat or anything here. 
31483 I spent 2 days last week. The towels need to be whiter because they look dirty. Bathroom needs renovation 
31484 My stay in this charming hotel enhanced my New York experience. Its old-world elegance and strategic location near major museums, fine shops and restaurants in the Upper West side are a plus. If it provided free internet and free coffee in the room, then it would be almost perfect. 
31485 Was one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in - Rooms felt like home - Awesome Service 
31486 whenever we're able to, we stay at the michelangelo...the rooms are lovely and immaculate and the location can't be beat....i look forward to enoying a cappucino in the morning, too 
31487 Good hotel, well located. Do not expect big rooms or a luxurius breakfast, but this clarion has a great location, it is next to the subway and major NY landmarks. Definitly i would come back to the Clarion Park Avenue, a good priced, clean and affordable hotel. 
31488 Very overpriced and poor value. Watch the bill and insist on closing the bill when leaving. 
31489 The hotel was just what we needed when staying in New York. Big and comfortable bed and good service. Great hotel at the price we got through Hot Wire. Not sure we would have ordered at full price though. 
31490 Great value so close to everything. Highly reccomend location for proximicy to all shopping and attractions like Navy Pier. a good walk is to head down Michigan avenue all the way to the art instititute. 
31491 Very nice hotel. Service was spot on, always there to help. Rooms are nice, but view not so nice. Think this is the case with most hotels in New York. Very clean and tidy, in a GREAT central location. Would stay here again. 
31492 I enjoyed my stay here. The room was very clean and quite spacious. Staff was excellent - - -so very friendly and accomodating. Generous breakfast. I would absolutely stay here again. 
31493 Everything was wonderful. Loved "Oprah's Favorite" tea served in restaurant -Room was beautiful! I will be back and will bring friends! 
31494 The room was very small,but modern and clean. I stayed on the 5th floor which was quiet. $300/nite,not much value. I guess if you need to be in this area of the city,it's ok. Just don't expect any services of the large hotels. 
31495 La hubicacion es muy buena porque estas a dos callles del Millium, sobre la calle Congress. La limpieza impecable y la gente super amable... 100% recomendable! 
31496 Stanza per 2 comoda, pulita e con splendida vista. Albergo molto bello, in particolare il ristorante all'ultimo piano offre una panoramica sul ponte queensboro e sui palazzi nei dintorni molto scenica, specie i notturna. Unica pecca le stanze poco insonorizzate..sia rispetto ai vicini sia rispetto all'esterno..ma ci si abitua! 
31497 The location is perfect, just a two block walk to anything it seems! The rooms were clean and the front desk was helpful. The free breakfast was great. I recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget and visiting Times Square. 
31498 Collocazione fantastica; servizi efficienti stanza spaziosa e silenziosa 
31499 A good hotel, nice bartender, good food. Lots of things to do around it. 
31500 Fiquei somente uma noite no hotel, mas recomendo! O staff foi muito prestativo e a localizacao eh excelente! O quarto nao eh grande, mas eh novo, limpo e bem agradavel. 
31501 This hotel was recommended by Joanna Pop. We were not dissapointed. Great location, very good service and spacious room. We will no doubt go back again. 
31502 I stayed for a night and was impressed by the comfort of the hotel room which had a plush bed. All staff--from the doorman to the reception to the cleaning staff--were friendly. Breakfast (though no-frills) was complimentary, another plus point. 
31503 From Magda in reservations, to Mr. Schwartz our concierge, to Rudy & Olga behind the bar, & Vivienne at the front desk, Sanctuary was just that, a place to get away, relax, & enjoy. Cheers, - Sebastian. 
31504 We stayed here as a family for 5 nights in October to celebrate my 60th birthday 
31505 It totally lived up to expectations - central,quiet,fantastic rooms,great service & we loved the complimentary wine between 5pm & 6pm each day. 
31506 We went with an alumni group to Chicago for five weeks. this is an extremely comfortable small hotel with pleasant staff. The restaurant has a wonderful breakfast menu. 
31507 I had my wedding here sunday march 20th 2011. Margo clements was so helpful and took all the worry out of planning our wedding and reception. We stayed in 1408 and the view was breathtaking. I would love to stay here again soon! 
31508 We have stayed in this hotel 3 times central location good value staff very friendly will stay there again We have told friends about it no frills very clean 
31509 Comodo per visitare Mahnattan, vicinissimo al bellissimo 205 Fifth Avenue, camere spaziose e ben pulite. Vista Empire!!!!!!Consigliatissimo. Non ho provato i ristorante al suo interno ma poteva essere valida alternativa a Peter Luger 
31510 Pros: great location; cheap Cons: dingy lifts; small and poorly ventilated bathrooms; our room's heater could not be turned off (even with the help of hotel staff) so we had the A/C on as well in order to sleep "comfortably" 
31511 The 2505 2 bedroom suite was absolutely wonderfull for our familly. One week in NY with our 20/18/14 years old kids, staying at Affinia, with excellent services, very amiable staff, nice food, good furniture, terrific location 10' walk from Empire State Building .... Great experience. Enjoy ! 
31512 Well located, good service. Only thing - no free Internet and no coffee in the room. I hate having to order coffee or get dressed and go get it. The deli across the street does make good coffee though. 
31513 I stayed at hollyday inn soho for a business trip and it was very comfortable hotel. The location is not so good but there is a subway nearby. The service was excelent! 
31514 Excellent hotel. Very cool spot. Nice rooms, solid service. I would most certainly stay there again. 
31515 It is soo close to everything! We stayed there for 5 nights and it was just great. You walk out of the door and you are just in the middle of everything. We couldnt even hear the traffic noise.would always go back. 
31516 great location, large room, clean, friendly helpful staff. a stones throw from epmire state building 
31517 This hotel needs a lot of work. Part of the bathroom fixtures were falling down and there was no hot water in the morning. The room was terribly dated-something out of the 70s.The only redeeming feature is that it is in the airport and thus convenient for an early flight 
31518 There was absolutely nothing to complain about. We went for the parade, and it could not have been a better experience. The staff was friendly and helpful; the beds were comfortable; the location was great--on the parade route! I will book there again. 
31519 This hotel was stunning and beautiful. While we were at the hotel we saw Morgan Freeman, The Top Ten American Idol, and Steven Hawking. I loved this hotel because no matter what room you had you had a wonderful view. 
31520 IF you want to stay near Times Square, this hotel is an ideal location. And the staff is so friendly. I got a great price through Travelzoo, so it was affordable. There are lots of families and people from other countries, making the ambiance very festive. 
31521 The Hilton Suites is very well located. Within walking distance from the Magnificent Mile and close to several great restaurants and shops, it's really a no-brainer. Parking is expensive, but that's true anywhere in Chicago. Rooms are clean and well-thought out. 
31522 I absolutely loved our stay here. Would recommend to everyone I know. Very convinent location, easy to get a taxi, and wonderful staff! 
31523 I felt like they really wanted me to be there, almost like I was a star or something. I did not know that kind of attitude still existed in the industry. 
31524 We stayed for one evening to attend a wedding nearby. The room was large and well appointed. The rate was very reasonable. We would highly recommend this hotel 
31525 Its clean, as close as it can get to times square. Sleak and good fashioned. Breakfast was good. Got control for mattress to control firmness. Descent toiletries. Range of Free and premium content on TV. Concierge was quiet helpful. 
31526 Great hotel that feels very posh without being "snooty". Clean, well appointed contemporary rooms. We'll definitely stay here again! 
31527 un hotel in ottima posizione, sotto l'Empire State Building, personale molto cortese, camere perfette, free wi-fi in tutte le camere 
31528 Great location, very good room service, wonderful bed and lux bath. I loved this place and want to go back now!!! 
31529 We stayed during hurricane Irene and were very well looked after. Great location. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Only downside was the window looked onto a brick wall and air con was noisy. But we will definitely go back and stay there again. 
31530 Another pleasant stay at this little haven in NYC. Some of the bathrooms are small, but the rooms are a nice size and have always been immaculate. The staff, friendly and efficient. It is conveniently located, and our favorite place to stay while in New York. 
31531 Excellent location, very clean, huge lobby, friendly staff, nice rooms,. The only negative remark they need to upgrade there air conditioning system from front lobby to hall ways to rooms other than that I would stay here again. 
31532 Hotel in ottima posizione, principali attrazioni raggiungibili a piedi. Le camere anche se non grandissime, sono comunque accoglienti e pulite. Personale cordiale e disponibile, ho chiesto di cambiare camera e sono stato subito accontentata! Consiglio: se possibile chiedete camere ai piani alti, il traffico si fa sentire! 
31533 i was displaced from home and since ive been here, the service has been above average. Crenita, Kerrie, Grace, Jacob, Woodrow, and Roger are all very polite. The entire staff is humble, and understanding. If you're taking a trip, i would recommend the sun suites of hobby every time. 
31534 Location was great. Service was great. Received a room upgrade to a Jr. Suite which provided us extra room to relax and unwind after plunging into the sea of people in Times Square. Great bar and AMAZING breakfast at Normas. 
31535 The hotel was not really all that bad. It seemed clean which is the most important thing to me but during the night I saw a roach in the bathroom. The bed was very uncomfortable also. I would not stay here again unless there was no other option. 
31536 We enjoyed every minute we stayed in the hotel: in the morning the wonderful breakfast, at noon the excellent service and guidelines of the staff, in the afternoon the swimmingpool, sauna and steamtub and in the evening the marvellous bed... It was awesome! Dieter and Annelien Dulst from Belgium 
31537 Unbelievable!!! Believe all of the reviews about getting stuck in the cellar. Moldy smelly. Wet. Unfortunately everything else is booked in NYC. So glad we only booked one night! We are out of here. 
31538 A bit out of the way from downtown but certainly not an issue. Near subway station which made getting around easy. Not very touristy...more authentic New Yorker feel. Hotel is a great home base and right across from Central Park West. Don't stress the negative reviews, this is great. 
31539 The hotel is nice and very clean. Excellent location and service but it is a little bit expensive. Good breakfast 
31540 My room on the 41st floor was pretty swanky. The bed was really good. No complaints at all. 
31541 Our room was very clean, modern, attractive and spacious. Location was great, staff was very friendly and helpful. View was fantastic. Beds were very comfortable. 
31542 This hotel is ok but we had to change room because the first room we were in was so noisy we hardly could sleep there. I found it too expensive but I am afraid it is the case for all New York hotels 
31543 We went with our children (9yo and 7yo) for a holiday weekend. It was really cold, so walking outside was tough. It's a great location. Saw the Rockettes...great location for that. We stayed at the upper floor, so we had complimentary bfast...which was great w/the kids. 
31544 I stayed here with the recommendations from my travel agent I found it a very nice quiet area to stay in nyc with an awesome market across the road, at a great stop for the subway from time square, the best cafe next door for breakfast absolutely loved it 
31545 Hotel was very clean inside, despite the area it is in. Right on a major bus route, you can ride the city bus to the airport if need be to save taxi fare. I had business about 2 miles away, and the bus took me fairly close. Great value. 
31546 I was part of a college lacrosse team that stayed at the Jewel on 3/12/11. Great location and an extremely friendly staff. Rooms were well done and offered all the latest tech features. Looking forward to returning to the Jewel with my family on my next visit to NYC. 
31547 Just came back from our second visit to NYC and stayed at this hotel for its charm, character and location. We had a fabulous service and the location couldn't have been better! So close to Grand Central, Theatre District and awesome shops! 
31548 As has been previously stated, The location is great. The employees were friendly and helpful Good size unit i BR, with large BR, 1and 3/4 baths, modern and clean. Yes the elevator's were a little slow but not a big deal. Would go again. 
31549 I'd definately recommend this hotel as it was a great location, very clean (came in every day) and its cheap as chips. Its not luxury but a great place to lay your head if thats what you're looking for. I would definately go back. 
31550 Very Happy with this hotel. Bed was supper comfortable and I loved the products offered in the bathroom. Staff was excellent. Would stay again in a heart beat. 
31551 Old hotel with old hotel problems - small rooms and tiny elevators. Some noise and generally lousy views of the neighbors. Lobby lounge was enegetic (and expensive), staff was helpful. Location just OK, but did get a bargain for NYC as it was evidently a relatively slow weekend. 
31552 Stayed 2 nights; good value and location especially if through a discounter. Rooms are small but seem quite new and spotless. Waiting for elevators was a pain. Beds were comfy but the lumpy cotton filled comforter was a bit odd. I'd stay there again for a similar bargain rate. 
31553 You cant go wrong for what you pay. Best location. Everything is walking distance. Nice staff, helpful. Internet and computer in the lobby were pretty good. 
31554 never been to new york before did this off the internet...and had a great time lovely room but shared bathroom but it wasnt a problem we would stay there again lovely and quiet and central park a stones throw away 
31555 Nice hotel near chinatown, plenty of restaurant around and very easy access to the subway. Small room for 4 people but it's new york. Clean room. I will go back to this hotel. parking is expensive, look around for cheaper price. 
31556 hotel bien situe,pas loin de la gare centrale.Quartier relativement calme,nous etions au 24 etages avec une petite vue sur l'empire states b.Surface d'environ 70m2 avec 1 grande chambre (2 lits king cize),un grand salon avec canape lit et une cuisine toute equipee(cafetiere,lave vaiselle,lave linge,micro onde.....) 
31557 Nice location, small but nice rooms and great service. Checkin process was smooth and completely automated. Rooms are small/compact but for business travel, its just fine. I had breakfast in the hotel, the a la carte breakfast was quick and the price was reasonable 
31558 Everything about this hotel was great. The staff, the rooms, the location were all great. We would definately stay here again. 
31559 I found the 'Murray Hill East Suites' to be clean and in a perfect area to get around Manhattan, NYC. The hotel is close to Grand Central Station and NYC Subway's. The front desk employees were very friendly and helpful. 
31560 The only thing we didn't like was the shower. There wasn't enough water. To wash a long hair like mine, took a long time. 
31561 We went to Chicago for the first time 4th of July--and booked this hotel --It was so nice--lobby clean-- staff-super friendly--rooms--great--we had 3 kids 2 adults and stayed in a corner room--it wa fantastick--beds were good--bathroom clean-- no complaints-- very central--- and we would stay again!! 
31562 We loved the Fairmont and te location was great for us. Easy to get to state street and convent to hop across the river and head north on Michigan Our room was on he 37th floor and the view was spectacular. Highly recommend this lovely hotel 
31563 The employees and facilities were excellent. This is my first choice of hotels for my next trip back to Chicago. The location is perfect for walking to all tourist attractions. The rooms were nice and the staff was fantastic. 
31564 Our stay at The Roosevelt was well beyond our expectations! The lobby is fantastic. The front desk let us check in very early and our room was large and clean. We appreciated the free WiFi as well... I highly recommend The Roosevelt! 
31565 Great location and new grand club staff. However, If you want a glass of cheap wine, go elsewhere and avoid the Grand club,a rip off as compared to other Hyatt clubs. 
31566 did not live up to representation, poor condition stains on rugs and bed linens, skin rash when i woke up, sink cracked, tv not working, AC rattled loudly no help when complained and charged extra when checked out early to find a livable hotel VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!!!! 
31567 We stayed 3 nights at the Westin. The location is ideal for tourists. Otherwise, the staff was not friendly. The room was OK. Generally, the place looks very cold and very "industrial". 
31568 Hotel exceeded our expectations - nice large clean room; friendly staff - especially Rick; clean room - well kept up; location was excellent in midtown Manhattan; close to Subway lines; would stay here again & recommend to friends; felt very comfortable with this choice of lodging 
31569 Muy prolijo, comodo, moderno, sencillo y muy buena ubicacion 
31570 We loved it at the Gansevoort! Great views, comfy beds and amazing location! Service was very nice and friendly; room was immaculate and comfortable. Rooftop pool was wonderful. Would stay here again. 
31571 Albergo centralissimo..camere piccole ma carine..pulito...insomma lo consiglio 
31572 Het is een heel fijn hotel met een perfecte ligging! Binnen 10 minuten lopen sta je op Time Square, en de metro (Penn Station) is om de hoek. De kamer die wij hadden was niet zo groot maar hij zag er verder heel netjes uit, en de bedden lagen heerlijk! 
31573 Had a wonderful trip to New York at end of January and were fortunate enough to stay here. Lovely hotel. 
31574 We enjoyed our stay at the pod a lot. Location is Great really close to the Rockefeller Center and Times Square isn't that far either. The Service stuff was very Kind 
31575 Stopped at this hotel for our honeymoon found it good value for money. perfect location in times square. Rooms are clean but need updating. 
31576 Good location just off 7th avenue and not far from madison sq garden. Hotel itself lovely but staff dont appear all that bothered. We had an issue with being overcharged and staff couldnt have been ruder when we asked about it. Would not stay here again for that reason 
31577 They advertise a rooftop garden bar. The rooftop view is great but the rooftop is tacky and there is no bar! They advertise a world class restaurant and they only have a small breakfast menu in the lobby - no restaurant! Someone needs to call them on false advertising. 
31578 me and my mum stayed here for 4 nights, it was fantastic. We upgraded to a larger double room which was worth it. The staff were friendly and very helpful, the roof top bar was fab...good cocktails. We thought the complimentary breakfast was great. Would definately stay here again! 
31579 This is probably the best bang for your buck. You get a very nice little room for just $50. You can't beat that in this area. It's very clean and comfortable hotel. I would reccomend it to my friends. A rare find for such a reasonable price. 
31580 We had a great time at the Manhattan @ Time Square. Kids loved the indoor pool. Confortable beds to rest before heading out to Time Square...exceptionally located walking distance to everything (central park/ 5th avenue/ time square of course) 
31581 tres bel hotel situe sur la 5 eme avenue. service irreprochable 24 h/ 24 h parfait avec une mention a cecilia , la concierge, qui donne des adresses top dans new-york. elle reunit la classe, la grace, et le professionnalisme. super !!! 
31582 This was a great trip, the hotel was clean, friendly & pet friendly. 
31583 Good hotel in optimal location, services without problems, only variety of breakfast items could be better. 
31584 You can not beat this location - just walking in and out of the hotel was fun. Close to Rock Center, park and shows. Nice! 
31585 Gostei muito do hotel, acima das expectativas. A localizacao eh otima, o hotel eh novo comparando com os de NY. Quarto com decoracao moderna. Atendimento atencioso. Oferece acesso a Internet no lobby, agua, cafe, cookies, etc 
31586 Marriott had an indifferent staff, ice machines didn't work tried 4 floors, lost our reservation[however, we had a printout. Do yourself a favor, stay at the Blackstone [a Marriott property ] get a 3 day bus pass and walk to Lou Malnatti's. 
31587 I stay here three times a year for a week or so on business. The location is great but the rooms are small, even the allegedly "spectacular" rooms, and some - though not all - the staff have some attitude issues. More at the Grumpy Business Traveller blog, www.gbtraveller.blogspot.com 
31588 Excelente Hotel!! No tengo ningun comentario negativo. 
31589 Nicely renovated rooms and other interior elements. Clean. Free Wi-Fi! Close to everything. Recommend! 
31590 I stayed at this hotel in the past, before it became a Doubletree. I love this hotel, the rooms are quiet, the staff is GREAT. As a Hilton Rewards Member, they let me check in early and gave me a great room. The rate was great too. 
31591 The staff are very friendly and helpful! Love their hip uniforms. The rooms and housekeeping is amazing. The rooftop lounge has amazing views. 1st time in Soho. One of the best hotels I've stayed at! Young, hip and very chic! Would come back and definitely recommend! 
31592 We stayed here in July 2011 for 3 nights. This hotel is in a GREAT location. The room was small and stuffy. The staff was difficult and there was no free wifi. I have experienced more luxury in a Holiday Inn. 
31593 We loved the hotel and the staff. We were right in the middle of everything we wanted to do and see. The staff were friendly and helpful. The hotel was clean and well taken care of. 
31594 Staff gentile e "all'apparenza" disponibile, camera decisamente scadente e poco pulita (polvere ovunque)? Nota positiva: ubicazione centralissima. 
31595 We always enjoy our stay at the Four Seasons. Its location is ideal for the International Quilt Show and the staff are always friendly and helpful. 
31596 Loved our time here - great staff, great views of the Empire State building from the top floor, great (free!!) breakfast, tea and coffe on tap 24/7, lovely rooms: perfect little place. We can't recommend it highly enough! If you're off to New York and can stay here, DO!! 
31597 A great location for touring manhattan and good value. Rooms are comfortable but decor and facilities are basic. Reception area very busy at check in timeso be prepared to wait. 
31598 Hotel strategico per la sua posizione. Ambiente giovanile e arredamento moderno. La camera di tipologia standard non e' molto grande ma tutto sommato c'e' spazio sufficiente per tutto. La colazione e' ricca e soprattutto hai tempo fino alle 12 per poterla fare. Sicuramente un hotel che consiglio. 
31599 Stayed for a few nights. Nice clean rooms, nice bed, only thing that let it down was the noisy air con coming on now and again. Would stay again. 
31600 My family & I stayed in this hotel for 3 days, it was in an excellent location, and the room was clean and neat. We really enjoyed our stay. I would highly recommend this hotel and will stay there again when in the nyc area. 
31601 Room was great and breakfast was bettter quality than expecting. 
31602 I thought that this hotel offered a great value for the price paid. The recent remodel is very nice and clean. The front desk was helpful and polite. Worth more than what I paid for it. 
31603 This was a first class hotel. I stay at Hilton's because their beds are very orthopedically comfortable and you wake up without a back pain. I got the bed and breakfast and the restaurant was wonderful with nice windows to look out of during your meal. 
31604 Stayed at The Lowell September 2011 for 5 days. Service and room impeccable and the upper east side simply the most desirable part of NYC. Thanks to all at the Lowell. Even down to the cold water as we left in the limo. A stay we wont forget. 
31605 Clean, very helpful and friendly staff. The location next to Bryant Park is superb, so you can walk with the free coffee or tee to the park in the morning and make your plans for the day. 
31606 My husband and I stayed here in June 2003 for our honeymoon. Room was great extremely well furnished and comfortable. Close to Times Square and the theatre district would stay here again definately! We had complimentary beakfast buffet in the adjoining Millenium Broadway and the food was great. 
31607 My stay was very comfortable, it was my home away form home. The accommodation was great, all amenities was up to standard. I enjoyed my stay and will certainly come again. The breakfast could have a little more variety. 
31608 after reading all the critics for ny hotels we were in a mess!! We went for it and it was all that we were expecting!!! A clean bed and a nice bedroom,no noises and good shower,what else can you ask if it is well located and good price!! Highly recomended. 
31609 Staff were among the best I've seen anywhere, so helpful, location is handy to anything downtown, and it's 5 minutes away from downtown, the only drawback is the lack of eating options close by. 
31610 Outstanding property. A million dollar view. Insist on a high floor. Very expensive food - basic breakfast is about $30 a person - but options around the hotel at much much less. Wonderful service and luxury with a fine location. 
31611 Nice rooms (outdated a little bit), nice lobby, definitely great location, walking distance to Times Squares, Central Park, 5th avenue shopping, Radio City Music Hall, Rockefeller Center, Empire State building. Close to subways, restaurants. Pricey, but this is NYC. 
31612 The room was small but very clean and nicely decorated. Staff iis friendly and helpful. Price was a liitle high, but it was a last minute trip. 
31613 It's the best hotel I've ever stayed at. It was also for a cheap price. It was very expensive for everything else especially the pool. The fruity water was good. Great Location too. 
31614 I would highly recommend the San Carlos for families (two adults and four kids in my case). The large suite comfortably slept all the kids. The service was excellent. The only complaint is the continental breakfast was poor and the bad. 
31615 Stayed here in mid August with two teenage kids in a separate room. Very comfortable and clean and rooms were of a decent size. Concierge was very obliging with breakfast tips to eat more modestly than in the restaurant. Good location for mid town, central park and subway to downtown. 
31616 Customer service is wonderful. Restaurants are great. Rooms are very comfortable. 
31617 Excellent location for a downtown stay. Rooms are clean and everyone was very friendly, helpful and accommodating. Would highly recommend this establishment. One note, there is no coffee pot or ice buckets in the room but room service will bring these items to you complementary. Of course gratitude is appreciated. 
31618 We stayed here for 5 nights July 1st-6th and had a corner room on the 6th floor. The room was quite large ,the shower was fantastic, and the staff very very helpful. I recomend this hotel. 
31619 This is the worst hotel that I have ever stayed in. Everything is broken and in disrepair here. I had a cleaning lady steal a flash card reader cable from my room. What a joke, I would highly recommend staying at a different hotel!! 
31620 We regularly stay at The Granduca and on each stay we are impressed with the lovely surroundings, quality of the furnishings, linens and especially the service. The dining outside by the pool with the beautiful landscape transports to times in Italy. Our favorite place in Houston and elsewhere 
31621 Good location with friendly, accommodating staff. We stayed in a large corner room with a very comfy king size bed, a great desk area, a sitting area, a kitchen, an updated bathroom, and corner windows with a fabulous view of the city and river. 
31622 The Manhattan Club is located just below Central Park, across the street from Carnegie Hall. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are spacious for NYC. It's any easy walk to Times Square or any Broadway show. 
31623 I stayed here with my mom for 8 days in December. The room was very spacious with a plasma and two beds, very comfortable. The breakfast was excellent(only 6 dollars). The personal was very friendly. I would recommend this hotel to anyone. 
31624 Although the mattresses have seen better days and the toilets are to low. I was happy with the food which I was able to eat while dieting. 
31625 This boutique hotel on Time Square is excellently located and a value. The rooms are clean and well appointed. There's a free wine happy hour from 5-8 pm and a continental breakfast each morning. If you're looking for a nice quaint experience, this is the place. 
31626 Albergo piuttosto centrale e molto vicino alla metro, supermercati e negozi. Le camere non sono molto grandi ma perfette se non si vuol fare vita di albergo. Sono molto ben tenute e pulite. Disponibile un computer e connessione gratuita per gli ospiti. Lo consiglio per ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo. 
31627 if you want to be within walking distance to all of the broadway theaters, this is the hotel for you. Close to Port Authority Bus terminal and only one subway stop to Penn Station. 
31628 I have stayed at this hotel a few times over the last years. Its Guest Relations staff is very courteous and efficient, in particular Ms Maryia Andriyenko whose ability to resolve problems and remain smiling is quite exceptional. The suite and room was confortable, but the corridors could be improved.Thanks 
31629 Visited the Setai again in late March, with a smaller but much better experience this time. The staff was significantly more courteous, the food better and overall much more consistent this time. Looking forward to my next visit. 
31630 Read reviews before going, and I was worried about going there. However, it is a great hotel. History lives there. Relax rooms, and great service. However, if you are below 35 I would suggest a more young spirit hotel. Again, very polite personnel and clean rooms. Lucille 
31631 Okay, so the manager had a bad day, don't make that a reason to avoid this hotel. Nothing can compare for price, cleanliness and location. ...four in a bed is not so bad! 
31632 Rooms are small, but nice, and cozy. close to EVERYTHING. Parking is super expensive per night. This hotel is super gorgeous on the inside. If you stay spend some time walking around! We pricelined our rooms and got an excellent deal, so parking wasn't as much of an issue. 
31633 Handy to all attractions, great customer service (staff are extremely helpful), complimentary breakfast :) & at a good price for peak season in times square. Small rooms. 
31634 The rooms r very small n the breakfast is neither too tempting. Location of the hotel for the tourists is good, only one elevator, which makes the life difficult n in case of a fire, only the lucky ones wil survive. 
31635 robbery !!!!!!!! I stayed at this hotel and I people from the hotel opened my bag and stolen! They stole my brand new just bought IPAD 2 
31636 They replied that nothing can be done! Run this mediocre hotel! 
31637 super hotel direkt im garment district. alle shopping highlights direkt vor der haustuer. hotel ist super sauber und das personal sehr freundlich. fruehstueck im zimmerpreis enthalten und total ok. 
31638 Although this hotel looks like Business kind, but they are seriously encouraging families. Very family friendly hotel. Excellent location Friendly lobby. Good restaurant for break fast. Plenty of parking Toilets needs bit rework. Internet shall be free, but they charge. 
31639 Great location you can walk or take subway to most attractions, near Chelsea in the flower district. Small rooms with fridge, microwave. Very helpful and friendly staff. 
31640 Love the hotel its location and its consistency...but 3 of thelast 4 time I have left the doorman makes change for the airport bound taxi...it takes the fun out of being there.... 
31641 Excelent room, beautiful reception. I have been in many hotels arround the world, and with no doubt this is among the top 3. Room is huge and new. 
31642 Stayed here for five nights In September and found the location was great - just five minutes walk to times square, staff were brilliant and it was very clean and spacious - highly recommended for anyone travelling to NYC! 
31643 a good business hotel in mid-town. Like most mid-town hotels, the views from the rooms are a little limited, and the amenities average. However, the breakfast bar is great, the gym is really quite good, and price levels more than acceptable for the service. 
31644 Not great security anyone can enter at anytime amd wireless internet is charged and unreliable. Other than that great location, block from 5th ave and clean 
31645 Loved staying in Times Square. Comfortable room and beds. Mr. Linton, the Lobby manager, was particularly helpful and kind when I had to pick up a package from the front desk. 
31646 Stay at the trump soho or the smythe, soho grand needs a remodel badly, very small rooms, besr art is Salume next door, they have great paninis with quality ingredients, 
31647 Clean and decent room, a bit small but I understand this is normal for NY. Breakfast is ok, not luxerious The neighborhoud is really great, lots of restaurants, close to the subway and an easy walk to downtown Manhattan 
31648 Went to Mangattan for the weekend and had fairly low expectations. I was beyond shocked by the entire stay. The staff was beyond helpful and genuinely friendly. The rooms were extremely clean. The location was superb. I am already looking to book another trip! We will be back very soon! 
31649 Liked the great view -- did not have any problems with hotel -- good deal and also best pizza place called Tonys on second avenue. 
31650 Soluzione ideale per chi intende stare in zona Manhattan senza spendere un patrimonio. Comodamente dall'hotel si raggiungono a piedi le principali attrazioni di Manhattan (Times Square, Madison Square Garfenm 5th avenue ...) 
31651 Booked this hotel due to TripAdvisor reviews and we weren't disappointed. Location really good for theatre land, cinema and underground. Staff very helpful and pretty cheap membership ($10) of the big gym a few doors along street. Bagel/pastry breakfast was sufficientto start our day. 
31652 Bed is very comfortable. Rooms are spacious and clean. Service is always there but unobtrusive. Well satisfied with this hotel. 
31653 A terrific value in Manhattan. Roomso are good size for the area and is centrally located. Parking garages are close, though the hotel does offer valet parking. Very close to a subway station also. 
31654 Yeah, it's an older hotel, but the price is decent and the location is perfect for our annual visits to NYC in December. We don't spend much time in the room, so we can get by without a luxury room. 
31655 Stayed in the Roosevelt Hotel for 4 nights and it was great hotel especially for location. So near Times Square, Grand Central Station & Fifth Ave. The rooms are a good size and the staff are very friendly. Would have no hesitation in staying here again. 
31656 The hotel is clean and renovated. The only inconvenience is noise coming from passing next to the window train. I also did not like the additional fee for luggage storage (2$). 
31657 Every room in the hotel is an experience! The bar is amazing, the restaurants are top-notch, and the rooms are works of art. The location of the hotel is perfect for any stay in New York. I highly recommend The Standard! 
31658 Prima hotel voor de prijs die je betaalt. Subway dichtbij om zo snel en goedkoop overal te kunnen komen. Weinig vriendelijkheid bij het personeel, maar dat was overall zo in NY vonden wij. Prima kamers die elke dag werden schoon gemaakt. Leuke bars en eetgelegenheden in de buurt. 
31659 Staff was attentive,friendly and efficient. Close to convention center, Light Rail and theater district. Wifi was spotty but free. 
31660 Everyone was delightful, especially David Tom. He did everything with a smile. The beds and pillows were OUTSTANDING. We slept like babies. 
31661 Have stayed here on numerous occasions. The rooms are stylish, clean, reasonably new, a good size, with comfortable beds. I slept well. The check in and out was efficient and friendly. I recommend this hotel if the ptice is competitive at the time of booking. 
31662 Great atmosphere during the week before Christmas. Hotel was buzzing...Close to Times Square, a few Blocks from American Girl and great restaurants. 
31663 Family room(2+2) was large, clean and comfortable with lovely views of Chrysler Building(especially) at night. Pleasant walk to shopping on 5th and to Times square. Also near renowned steakhouse Smith &Wollensky. Great value for such central location where we sheltered from "Sandy" 
31664 This was the worst stay I've had in New York. The room was dirty, the furniture stained and thread bare. I've read some of these other reviews and we must have stayed at different hotels. The only positive thing I can say about this hotel is it's location. 
31665 The staff was great! Thanks Omar and team, we will be back. From the time we arrived from a hectic trip into the city, everything was great, easy, and helpful. Just what we needed. 
31666 Excellent hotel. Staff is very responsive and the facilities are wonderful. Was able to get into an available room early in the morning, and found the amenities to be excellent. Definitely would recommend to all. 
31667 Trendy rooms, comfy beds, reasonable price, clean....everything you want in a hotel. Not a 5 star hotel, but well worth being one of the lowest priced in NYC. 
31668 Stayed at the Hilton in downtown Chicago on a golf trip. It was great. Was able to find cheap airport parking leaving Toronto. Thanks to the people at www.parkingexperience.org. 
31669 First trip to NYC, Yotel was great. Small rooms, took a little time to get used to the bathroom, but everything else about this hotel was awesome. Would stay here again in a second. Have no hesitations in booking with this hotel. 
31670 This hotel is current and at the same time allows you to walk the halls that graced hollywood of the past...the rooms are the perfect combination of practicality and hollywood classic...why else would Carey Grant have lived here?! You will not be disappointed. 
31671 Of course not the best hotel I ever been but definetely good enough to enjoy your holidays with a decent price, rooms and toilets are really small, the location quiet good next to centrAl park, subway 2 minutes walk! 
31672 Was here for a couple nights in July 2011. Staff were friendly, location is nice - literally on top of the subway station. Pretty nice area of town - plenty of restaurants if you don't want to go too far. Easy access to the touristy places via subway, etc. 
31673 Mediocre room. No Bathtub. TV far too small, and only basic cabel. But cheap with intenet deal and good location. Breakfest not bad. 
31674 The Westin provided a convenient and comfortable stay for myself and my business travelers. We enjoyed great rooms and service. Sam, the Personal Trainer in the gym, was very helpful and friendly... attentive and knowledgeable. The concierge and front desk were also extremely patient and helpful regarding all requests 
31675 Grande opcao pra quem tem orcamento apertado e gostaria somente de um quarto confortavel com banheiro pra poder se recuperar das compras/passeios em New York. Recomendo para os viajantes que estao procurando curtir mais a cidade e seus atrativos do que os potenciais atrativos do proprio hotel onde ficam. 
31676 Excellent ! Ease of check-in, large clean room for $99 per night (mid-week) and quiet room. Room has mini frig, microwave, flat screen TV, desk and queen bed. I will refer Hilton to all friends when visiting Chicago! 
31677 Huge Hotel right on Times Square. Great rooms, good service, and central location. But the whole area surrounding Times Square is tourist central, difficult to find a decent restaurant or bar close by. 
31678 Near of all. The best for family and treatment in MSKCC. Thanks Jennyfer and Pedro (Staff) 
31679 Excellent location, tiny rooms but clean. 
31680 habitaciones muy pequenas, aseo pesimo, muy ruidoso. lo bueno su ubicacion 
31681 The New York Sofitel is conveniently located just off Times Square - close enough to be very convenient to all local attractions but far enough - just two blocks away from the hustle and bustle of the area. Would not hesitate to stay there again. 
31682 The hotel location could not be better the service is excellant but the club lounge was closed for a refit during our stay We would stay again when we are in NYC again 5 star. 
31683 The staff was always helpful. The hotel offers a great continental breakfast each morning. The in room services (moviebeam) had movies that I have been dying to see in the theaters. I would definitely be coming back. 
31684 It was just a Okay Hotel, a bit dirty carpeted floor with a air conditioning that generated lots of heat or just cooled and a okay bathroom. The building and lobby was fresh. price of the hotel was great for being so centrally. 
31685 Stayed during a conference. The Lady in the Front Desk extremely friendly and great customer service Room clean and well located in downtown close to a downtown shopping strip mall with good restaurants. Never go wrong with a courtyard 
31686 I got ripped off twice - first time they charged me for the movies I never watched ($30), then a week later I found an additional $20 charge on my account. Now, I'm waiting for the next one. Hopefully this time it will be $10. 
31687 Everything was fab. Got a great deal on Expedia. 75 bucks. Construction in the lobby but it was minor. The lounge bar on the mall level has a great young host who was very entertaining. Room was spacious and very clean. I was very happy all around. 
31688 Arrived on the coldest day this april-but received a warm reception at the hotel-this was our first visit to chicago-and the recetionist-AMY-the room was comfortable with a fantastic view over lake michigan(we were offered lake view or city view).all the staff from reception to room service were very good. 
31689 Great location for the Hotel! At Broadway but not in the heart of the tourist madness, just around te corner. Although the room is small, the hotel's service is excellent. All of our questions or issues were attended to promtly. Amazing staff! 
31690 Stayed 16th till 21st on the 38th floor,very impressed with the room, lovely comfy bed, lovely friendly staff would stay there again 
31691 Returned for a 2 night stay. Room was ready for early check in, staff was helpful and welcoming. Location is great, restraunat is fair, great view of the Hudson River. 
31692 Just returned from Casablanca Hotel, it was the start of our three week journey and what a great beginning. This is no exaggeration, this is a fantastic hotel. You cannot even hear the outside noise of NYC. We stayed in king premium room. I 
31693 This was our second stay and again there was no problems. The service is OK and the place is clean. Very convenient location to the airport and just a 15 minute drive into Houston. The breakfast is great. 
31694 Very nice hotel - very clean, quiet room with a wonderful bed and free internet. It doesn't have that old, dingy feel that some NYC hotel rooms have (see Affinia Manhattan...). Highly recommend! 
31695 I do not expect a management response as I no longer have a computer to send it to since it was stolen from a locked room at the hotel and they will not take responsibility for it or the other contents that was stolen. 
31696 Some of the most attentive and friendly staff in NYC (and without being annoying or obsequious) Concierge was of no help with Tribeca Film Festival info, however, even though Susan Sarandon was present for a TFF related event in the restaurant area. Pet friendly :)=)~ 
31697 I recommend this hotel to anyone on a budget who is traveling to NYC! It's just steps from Times Square, has an awesome restaurant inside of it (Cafe Edison - suprisingly good. especially the matzo ball soup) and is super affordable. 
31698 I vacationed at the Fairmont Chicago for 3 nights in July 2009. The room, the bathroom, the view, and the staff were all wonderful. I just wish the hotel were a few blocks North (on MI Ave). Sometimes, when you're tired, that extra couple of blocks seem like miles! 
31699 The staff is very friendly at this Marriott. The room is comfortable. There is an actual Starbucks attached to the hotel which is a bonus. Ate at the restaurant called Dempseys and had a great meal. Nice place to stay if you need to be near Midway. 
31700 very friendly hospitable environment. the hotel have inside pond for the coi, absolutely gorgeous. The bar is unbelievable, you can throw the peanut shells in the floor that I enjoyed a lot. The room is absolutely beautiful with nice bathroom amenities and overall guestroom cleanliness. 
31701 Can not express enough our appreciation to Ms. Vickie Bellinghousen, for her kindness, professionalism, and attention to details among many other treats. Thanks. Emilio, Norberta and Marcella. 
31702 So the Omni is not the newest or flashiest hotel in town but they have the best staff. From the bell staff to the guys cleaning the pool thy all work as one efficient and happy team. Great pool area and really knowledgable conciearge. 
31703 Very clean hotel. Bed was excellent. Hotel staff was friendly but don't always take their advice on how to take "The L" rapid transit. Advice was confusing and inaccurate. 
31704 very clean ,beds were sooo comfortable,very quiet no annoying taxi horns.Breakfast included in the morning was a nice feature make your own waffles.One block to macys and madison square garden 
31705 This hotel has recently been renovated and is great. Rooms large for NY standards. Very clean.It is basically in Soho, even though listed and being in China Town. Very close to subway stations also. 
31706 Stayed over Labor Day weekend. A wonderful time. The room was beautiful, modern, with a great view of the city. The staff was very accommodating and friendly. We would definitely stay there again. 
31707 Enjoyed our stay! Great location, friendly staff. Small as you would expect in NYC but charming. Only aspects I didn't enjoy would be the lack of a doorman to assist in hailing down taxi's and not one taxi driver recognized the hotel? Thus you'll have to provide address. 
31708 the location is very good though it might not have a really impressive view. but it might be a really good choice at this price in nyc. the room is big enough and very comfortable. the hotel service is also very good and people there are helpful. 
31709 The hotel room was nice and clean. Had working ac and tv. I think this hotel makes even better choice because is good location. The price was also great compared to many other crazy expensive places. You should do your own research and see if you can find other places. 
31710 Here for two nights, so far great service -- breakfast arrived quickly, conceriege service was helpful, having the extra room works great so teenager can sleep while we watch The Open before hitting Chicago. Great location and would recommend to anyone 
31711 We thought the hotel was great! The staff was friendly and helapful, especially the manager, Charles Katz. He helped us when we has a problem with our reservation. They all treated us like royality! 
31712 We found the hotel to be a great place to stay if you're on a budget. It was clean and well appointed and the staff was helpful and friendly. It's walking distance to theatres and a lot of good restaurants. Rooms are a bit small, but cozy. Recently renovated. 
31713 Grand Hyatt at NYC has a great location. It is 4 block off Broadway in one of the nicest areas in Manhattan. Rooms are very clean and modern. Excellent choice if you are looking for a 4 start hotel. 
31714 ...really needs a facelift (or more). Excellent friendly staff and very reasonably priced. Noisy but waddya expect in mid-town New York? 
31715 mai ficar pq era perto do central park, lindo e barato e com banheira maravilhosas 
31716 Very clean, great staff, excellent restaurant recommendations. They greet you with warm cookies. I'm pretty hard to please and have stayed at multiple hotels that "look good on their website", but this hotel was actually great. Rooms were spacious, a rarity in the city. 
31717 Rooms were nice and roomy for the area..we got upgraded to a suite for free. The suite was excellent. Will definately stay again. 
31718 Pros: Good location. Cons: Run down condition. Very noisy. Plumbing in paper thin walls will wake you up. When bathroom is used in rooms around you, it's like the lavatory is right beside your bed. 
31719 hotel in zona centrale .camere ampie e confortevoli con annesso cucinino.atmosfera molto rilassante .personale cordiale e disponibile.zona adiacente all'albergo tranquilla a tutte le ore.unica pecca internet a pagamento e coffe shop adiacente all'hotel dove poter fare colazione non di grande qualita'.comunque lo consiglerei anzi tornerei volentieri! 
31720 Me parecio muy centrico, comodo y accesible en cuanto a su costo. La habitacion es confortable y limpia. Un detalle que considero podria mejorar su servicio es que no deberian cobrar por guardar el equipaje. 
31721 This is my first time here and looks pretty good, its being a very pleasent experience. The hotel is very well localized and the rooms are confortable and well equiped. I talked to Elizabeth and she was amazing, giving me very good informations and advices. 
31722 Great location and service. Comfortable, clean, quiet room. Would stay there again! 
31723 God awful filthy.filthy isnt a strong enough word. They say upper east side but is actually Harlem. Pics are fake. Terrible front desk help. Tv did not work. No towels. Left and staued near 30 rock.at Affinia hotel. 
31724 Located so close to Times Square & 5th Avenue, loved the 5 days I was there. Madison Square garden is not far away where i went to watch a hockey game. Staff were very helpful & polite, the fellas at the door are a great help...Would defo stay again. 
31725 The Solita Soho is a great place to stay. The staff is always so helpful and courteous, the location is amazing, and the rooms are clean and comfortable. For my needs there could not be a better place to stay in lower Manhattan. I will definitely return. 
31726 Staff is friendly and attentive from moment of arrival. Rooms are clean and newly remodeled. Nice Irish pub in lobby, which also serves breakfast. Due to unusually mild weather, we were able to enjoy cocktails in outdoor courtyard--very enjoyable. Convenient location. Wonderful little hotel. 
31727 This was my 6th stay at the Millennium Broadway. The hotel was very busy, but the staff got the job done! For NYC, I don't believe the value can be beat. The location is great. The rooms are a good size for NYC. 
31728 I had a beautiful time and the bed felt like I was sleeping on a cloud. They have good restaurants in the hotel and their pizza was the best in Chicago. The room was beautiful, my only complaint is that I believe that the WIFI should have been free. 
31729 perfetto!!!ottimo rapporto qualita' prezzo....soprattutto e' pulito e personale gentile. comodo perche' molto vicino alla metropolitana che in pochi minuti vi porta in centro.. 
31730 Een prettig hotel met veel bezienswaardigheden en restaurants op loopafstand. Beneden in de hal is een zitgelegenheid met gratis koffie en thee. De kamers zijn klein, echter gerieflijk en schoon (2x per dag schone handdoeken). Het personeel reageert adequaat. Wat beter kan is meer PC's opstellen. 
31731 Ottimo servizio, comoda la colazione inclusa ( cosa rarissima a NY), posizione strategica sia per camminare che per prendere la metro'. Stanze ben insonorizzate in modo da non sentire le sirene che passano sulla 7a. 
31732 Can't beat the location and the rooms are really spacious and modern. We managed to get a room with a view, but the pool deck also has a great view of the lake. 
31733 We enjoyed our stay here 
31734 The rooms were large & kitchen great. Did not appreciate that there was no free internet access anywhere within the hotel and found the location a little bit inconvenient subway about 4 blocks. If you get a good rate then it is worth it. 
31735 I have been staying every year in this hotel since 2007 for business purpose. Also, I stayed in other two hotels in the area, but definetely I prefer this one. What I love from this hotel is the quality and service of the employees, they are the best! 
31736 tiny rooms, service was horrible, management not very accommodating 
31737 This hotel is in an excellent location, midway between Times Square and Central Park, with a Subway station immediately outside the door, All the reviews agree on location. I didn't find any problem at all with cleanliness, room size (for New York!) or service. 
31738 Just a few minutes walk from Times Square and minutes from the Bryant Park subway station. Made a great location for us to see the sights of NYC from. The room was roomy (for NYC) and very comfortable. The staff was helpful and courteous. 
31739 Clean but not much service, took forever to have a clean room in the morning, location is great but I would not stay in the Astor again, 120$ per night is way overpriced, the only thing I could say is that it was nothing more than 'ok' 
31740 Muy bien ubicado, muy buenas habitaciones amplias, limpias, muy buen trato del personal, y espectacular el servicio de desayuno en el bar del piso 40 
31741 Vast busy and crowded hotel. Just about bearable if you stay in the Executive level rooms. Lacks a decent bar. 
31742 We had a very spacious room with a little kichinette with fidge and freezer. The subway is very close by and the staaf is very friendly and helpful. We enjoyed our stay very much. 
31743 Het hotel ligt hartje Midtown. Je loopt zo Central Park in, maar ook 5th Ave, 57st street, Rockefeller Center en Times Square kan je lopen. TQ kan je zien vanaf straat voor hotel. Zit tegenover Carnegie Hall. Metroverbinding direct naast hotel. Als het regent zit je in 10 stappen ondergronds. 
31744 prima hostel voor goede prijs. Wel beetje gedateerd gebouw waardoor geluiden nogal ver dragen maar weinig last van gehad. Schone kamers, schone badkamers welke meermaals per dag worden schoongemaakt. Locatie is ook prima, veilige buurt, Metro's dicht in de buurt en verschillende restaurantjes en diners op loopafstand. 
31745 Don't let the word out too loud about this wonderful Italian boutique hotel in the theater district. Classy and warm, the staff will accomodate your every need. 
31746 I have nothing to complain about. The accomodations and the staff were wonderful. We ate breakfast at the Hotel's restaurant and it was great. No complaints. 
31747 It was amazing... the people where nice, everywhere i have been... goodlooking girls... what more do i have to say... oh oh oh yes, there is one thing... the wheater: it was simply perfect... 
31748 Brilliant hotel and location. We had a great stay, recommended. 
31749 rooms are comforting with great beds and supreme linen. staff is very helpful. there are construction works across the street, so ask for a back facing room. only bad thing - elevators kept breaking down, and staff is hogging the ones that are working 
31750 Location great otherwise you a a complete burden for the hotel and its staff 
31751 Took ages to check in about 40 min queue 
31752 Staff typical NY rude , rooms VERY basic and not that clean , desperate to be made over 
31753 Great location. But hotel, in particular, the "regular" tower (there's two towers) is not 4-star property. Service is also not 4-star. 
31754 All the latest amenities, with the best location in the world, 3 blocks from central park and just steps from every subway line, broadway is just steps away and the view from my suite was spectacular. The decor was modern chicl 
31755 I have stayed here a number of times! Great location! Great price! Within walking distance of many popular spots in NYC; Times Square,Penn Station,et al. Humphrey's is delicious! The staff is very friendly and fun! 
31756 This hotel is very nice. Service is great rooms are excellent! 
31757 Friendly staff and good location in the Upper East Side. Although the rooms were small, it was clean and I would definitely recommend The Franklin. 
31758 This is a nice hotel. The lady at concierge Honor was very helpful. Hotel staff is active and ready to serve. The in house car and Ray were also very helpful. Room service gave me everything I asked in my room. It's a quality hotel carrying their legendary name. 
31759 Gute Lage, aber das ist schon alles. Zimmer alt und nicht sehr gepflegt, Teppich voller Flecken, Badezimmer so-lala. Wenn jemand dort wirklich nur schlafen will und sonst New York entdecken will, dann ist das OK. Ich selber werde nicht mehr dort hingehen 
31760 Hotel is sooooo quiet! Friendly, helpful staff. Good hot breakfast. The rooms are small but clean. Never had a problem getting a elevator. 
31761 They also have a nice bar with many locals, not only tourists. Stay away from the concierge, the lady behind that desk doesnt belong in the service industry. Much better to ask the door man or the friendly faces at the reception. 
31762 The staff that work here is excelents, the atention was perfect. We had a great time there. Thank you Moosa and everybody for your help and assistance! 
31763 Check in was efficient, staff were courteous, room was spacious and very clean. Beds were comfortable and clean. Bathroom was a little tired but clean. Onsite restaurant was very expensive, especially for breakfast. Starbucks just around the corner did excellent coffee and muffins for breakfast as an alternative. 
31764 Location is very convinient if you want to see the city or go shopping, specially during winter. The building is not new but the service makes up for it. I would recommend this hotel for tourists. Be ready for the strong winds around the hotel. 
31765 Although the rooms weren't the greatest, it was one of the cheaper options in NY, but is in a brilliant location. Penn Station just across the road for the Subway and shops, and then it's only a 5 minute walk to Times Square! Would stay there again! 
31766 Very polite staff, clean rooms. For a business trip it was easy in, easy out. 
31767 We had excellent service throughout our stay. Aurelia, Henry, Crystal, Stanley and everyone else that we encountered were pleasant and helpful. I left my Kindle in my room and Crystal was more than helpful in arranaging it to be sent to me. Thanks again for the excellent service 
31768 Best location in Manhattan. Cosy rooms but great value for money. Shared bathroom was spotless and never busy. Everything was clean and had no complaints. Would return every time I visit New York. 
31769 What a fantastic find. Booked this hotel on the back of all the good reviews here on Trip Advisor. Cannot fault it on anything. 
31770 It is simply the best price/performance hotel, with fantastic bar, great food and service. 
31771 This hotel was absolutely outstanding. The service was amazing, and booking it was easy and simple. Although I didn't stay in the room long, it was of a very high standard. Will definitely stay again. 
31772 I stayed at the hotel for a little less than one week. From the porters, receptionist at check-in, concierge, wait staff, the service was excellent all-around! They were extremely helpful, courteous and accommodating! My expectations were not only met, but exceeded throughout my stay. I will return for another stay! 
31773 My room was fine. The President's location is great and the staff as alwayscouldn't be nicer 
31774 it was an amazing moment for me. i hope u can stay there 
31775 Beautiful hotel, clean rooms, great shower. Friendly staff, great sauna and fitness room. Centrally located. Would stay again in a heartbeat. 
31776 Really nice staff, clean, and great location. Right in the middle of it all- can walk or catch a subway to most anywhere in NYC here. Typical New York hotel, rooms are not real large but they are comfortable and clean. Recommend this property without reservation 
31777 small, stylish rooms - incredibly odd layout - good location with excellent variety of restaurants nearby. elevator painfully slow. forget the workout room. but clean and good value, no frills kind of place. liked it though. 
31778 We love to stay in the Hotel not only because of the great location but especially because of the extraordinary service. The ladies at the reception desk are very friendly, helpful, efficient. An outstanding person is Leslie Pagan.....she is able to realise almost every wish. 
31779 This location couldn't be better, the rooms are great, the bed was extremely comfortable,(Jessica) the staff were really friendly and helpful, the music in the bar at night was wonderful.We were originally booked for two nights and ended up staying four - says it all really! 
31780 The staff was the best. The room was very comfortable and clean. I absolutely loved the comfortable bed. Slept like a baby. The hotel manager was very accommodating. I can not wait to come back to NYC for our next visit and stay at your awesome hotel. Darlene Stutts 
31781 we stayed there a few years back on two different occasions and found the hotel to be dirty, lacking in maintenance, a rude staff, poor service (it took us 3 hours to get towels), and not worth the cheap price 
31782 Modern ingericht hotel met veel comfort. Personeel is vriendelijk en bijzonder hulpvaardig. Wij hadden een ruime kamer met klein keukentje, prachtige badkamer en ruime bedbank voor onze 2 kinderen. Hotel ligt op super locatie aan 5th Avenue tegenover de public library. Veel attracties op loopafstand! 
31783 Go anywhere else, unless you want to be surrounded by transients and prostitutes. 
31784 We stayed at the Setai for a weekend to celebrate my daughters 10th birthday - everything was perfect. 
31785 Clean room with very comfortable bed, large bathroom, free airport shuttle every half hour and nice fitness center. There seemed to a malfunction with the Pay per View system the night I was there so I was able to watch the adult channel for free. 
31786 Asked for a quiet room with a view of the Hudson River and got it. Wanted a quiet room not near the elevator and got it. Wanted a clean comfortable room at a fair price and got it. Got friendly, efficient service too. Got all we wanted from this property. 
31787 Hotellet har en fantaskisk utsikt til FN-bygningen, East River og Lower Manhattan. Fine treninsgsfasiliteter og god frokost. Flotte garderober tilknyttet trenings- og badeanlegget. Hyggelig og hjelpsom betjening. 
31788 After visiting NY many times we decided on a different hotel and we were certainly not let down by this one. The location is perfect, 2 mins walk to 5th Ave and Times Sq. Staff were excellent and the cleanliness was 100%. 
31789 Stayed here 7 nights in a very comfortable and quiet room. We found all the hotel employees to be very friendly and helpful. Other than wishing for a coffee pot in the room, I give this hotel a thumbs up. 
31790 The staff is incredible. The bar has a really good and esoteric cocktail list. The design is very interesting. It is located in the heart of Upper East Side and one step from Central Park. Only downside: huge pillows, I like small ones. Very lovely stay 
31791 This was just another business trip and the hotel met my expectations for another metrolpolitan hilton. The incredible experience was looking down over a snow covered ground zero. All construction activity had stopped because of the weather and it was both sobering and impressive. 
31792 Busling Ian S hotel with great cocktails and magnicent food at the Pump Room. The rooms look a but worn for being so new... But super clean and comfortable. The public spaces are great for connecting, checking emails and relaxing. Would stay again. 
31793 It's a great place to stay in Times Square. The room was clean, great bath/shower (with complementary Aveda brand products), awesome lobby/lounge, and centrally located...all at a good price. I cannot come up with a complaint! 
31794 Arrived late for our first night in New York. Easy check-in. Good location near everything (subway, supermarket, sightsseeing). We could hear the subway under the hotel sometimes, but not a problem. So New York! All in all, highly recommended! 
31795 Dit hotel moet je echt alleen maar boeken als het niet anders kan. Achterstallig onderhoud en vies. 
31796 Cheap and excellent position for subways, near to central park and Lincoln center. Very large and conformable rooms but no fridge, kind personnel. Good choiche for visiting town, swimming pool on the roof. 
31797 Berkshire Place has had a facelift - renovation has brought a new feel to the hotel - I have been waiting a long to time for this and its well worth the wait. 
31798 Has everything you need super location, great staff, amazing views. Quite centrally located so easy access to shows. Restaurants were fast and tasty. Pricey, but it is NYNY. Will be back...................... 
31799 I recently stayed here with family. We were pleased with the hotel, which offered a decent value in a very good location. The rooms were clean and comfortable for 4 adults (two queen beds). No frills, but none were expected. Good base camp for exploring the city. 
31800 Enjoyed one-night stay at this very confortable, and clean hotel. 
31801 Really bad, incompetent staff, rooms not really good. Is not good value for money. I got charged in my credit card twice and a nightmare to solve it. 
31802 Ramada Eastside is handily located on Lexington with easy access to most attractions. Rooms are on the smaller side but this is NYC so you're probably only going to come back to crash anyway! Breakfast is very basic, but acceptable. 
31803 Nice place, lived up to what we hoped to find. Good prices. 
31804 The hotel has clean comfortable rooms. The staff were very friendly and it is a short walk to Central Park and the Metro. We would defintatly stay here again 
31805 Superb location centrally in Tribeca. Relaxed atmosphere, clean and complete rooms. 
31806 Stayed here on our first trip over to New York. Great hotel with excellent location close to everywhere. Rooms a bit small but plenty for what we needed as not much time spent in it! Would definately stay here again! 
31807 Okay Hotel, a bit shabby but comfortable. Great location! 
31808 Our stay was quite good but the service was terrible. They showed attitude to my father and mother for small reasons. All though they are a wealthy inn, still didn't mean they could be complete jerk 
31809 Very quiet hotel right next to Houston Hobby airport. Clean room, with a wonderful bed. Carpet is dated, but clean. Bathroom was sparkling and has granite countertops. Coffee maker conveniently set up. I enjoyed my stay here as a solo female traveller. Would recommend this hotel to business travellers. 
31810 Good location. Room is small but clean and comfortable. Well worth the price. Nice staff. breakfast is good if unspectacular. Will get you going for the day. TV worked fine. Those problems seem to have been sorted. Only concern, faded lipstick stains on the in-room styrofoam coffee cups. 
31811 small rooms, tiny bathrooms, bar that won't let you take your drink to your room all located in the heart of mid town. i now have a love/hate thing for them. 
31812 Incredible location and very comfortable for a hotel in NYC. Friendly service and staff!! 
31813 great location, wonderful hotel... close to great restaurants... can get taxi anywhere... a very trendy fun hotel. 
31814 I just wanted to take out time to say how PLEASANT AND HELPFUL RITA (at the front desk) was!!!!! she really made our stay that much better! The room where nice but it was truely the experience of meeting Rita what makes us want to stay again!!! Blessings 
31815 Excellent staff, quick check-in. This hotel is in a excellent location inside the Gallerina giving you numerous things to look at and do. The rooms were large, clean and quite. We really enjoyed our third stay at this hotel. 
31816 A great location a couple blocks off Michigan Ave and close to great restaurants and shopping. Rooms were comfortable and clean! Staff was friendly and helpful. Only suggestion would be that the bathrooms have a fan to avoid steaming up of the mirror after a shower! 
31817 we paid well over the odds for this hotel but found it a greation location, only across the road from Macy's. Well worth a stay but keep looking as the price keeps going up and down. 
31818 This was my second stay at this location. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted with a smile. From the time I checked my bag at the bell station on street level until I checked out, the staff was friendly and willing to help. 
31819 Unlike some hotels in the area it is great value for money. Rooms are spotless and a good size. Perfect alternative if you can't get into the sister Hotel Embassy suites. Has a good steak restaurant minute walk away. 
31820 I stayed in this hotel for ten nights. This house keeper really made me enjoyed my stay. The house keeper name is vickey (victoria) she was very very polite to every quest in the hotel. she is very polite, nice and a wonderful person. Also, very hard working staff. 
31821 Nice hotel. Not overly large. Good choice when staying in Chicago. But like everything in the City it's pricey. 
31822 The staff at this hotel are wonderfully friendly and helpful. The rooms were clean and the bed was very comfortable. I truly enjoyed my stay at this hotel. The only suggestion I have for the hotel is to offer late night room service, otherwise, a perfect stay. 
31823 Nice place, way up north in quiet neighborhood. Nice accommodating staff. Would stay again. Great quaint shops and restaurants can be found nearby as well. A surprising assessable part of NYC. May have been referred to as Carnegie Hill. 
31824 Very clean room, price was good, staff was very helpful. The bed was only a queen size/ 
31825 I can't say enough about the Bentley. The staff is the best. There is nothing pretentious--just friendly, efficient, helpful people who do theor best to make their guests comfortable. The location is ideal, and there are lots of pleasant restaurants nearby. 
31826 Great location, we had the best view of the Empire State building from our room, easy access to the subway, near Grand Central.. The staff at the hotel were friendly, loved every minute of it!!! Will definitely go back! 
31827 Last February we stayed for two nights in the Modern B&B. It is a very nice place to stay in a great, quiet location. Lisa was very helpful and gave us a very nice room. The breakfast is very good! When in Houston, stay there! 
31828 Solo destacaria la buena ubicacion del hotel,las habitaciones de lo mas normales,tirando a muy usadas y destacar un trato excelente del personal muy atentos en todo momento. 
31829 Great room. Terrific service. Loved Serafina. Elizabeth was very helpful in getting us an excellent room for a great price and went above and beyond for us. This was our second time here and we were even more pleased this time. We would highly recommend this hotel. 
31830 A hotel basically right on South Street Seaport!!! Can't get much better than that in NYC! Close to the water, shopping, sights, great food...not to mention the nautical themed rooms...super cute! They even supply good quality toiletries...see the pics & go! 
31831 The food in the restaurant was very good, the room was immaculate and the staff was friendly and very helpful. 
31832 I loved this hotel....large clean rooms, free breakfast, great staff, good location for touring the city..would highly recommend. 
31833 We stayed here in September the rooms were very small, the restrooms were very old place in general needs updating. At night the we could hear everything from the outside. I would not recommend this place. One good thing would be location. 
31834 For anyone who wants to be close to Grand Central and not be in the thick of the crowds, this is a nice quiet goral. Older rooms like this "live" better than some of the new boutique hotels where it seems you can hardly turn around in the room. 
31835 Good stay, good deals, good price.. - Free breakfast - Close to highway - Good sized room (suite) Im satisfied 
31836 I love the Edison Hotel in New York City! The staff and friendly, they cater to a budget conscious traveller - yet have a beautiful hotel in the Theatre and Times Square district! You will love it!!!! 
31837 The hotel is just ok but in a great location. Nothing very special about it though other than that. 
31838 Great hotel in the best location in new york city, close to all major attractions, theatre district, restaurants, etc. 
31839 Great restful trip. It offers a very soothing atmosphere without overdoing the whole Zen-Asia-Minimalist thing. Staff very accommodating, no snobbery. Everyone very helpful. This is a nicely designed hotel that offers a great rest -- check in and catch up on your sleep. There's a garden upstairs on top, too. 
31840 I was at the W for work meetings and found it to be a nice hotel, if expensive. Plenty of nice touches, from warm cookies to a comfortable bed (though it was not a Heavenly Bed when I was there). 
31841 Had to move room after one night, would & should have moved again to different hotel, Cannot believe they can advertise this hotel and show bedrooms which are clearly not being offered to guests, just a dreadful experience. 
31842 I am a flight attendant commuter who stays here in between trips. Rooms are always clean, the beds are comfortable, it is close to the airport and the van runs on time--these things are all important to anyone in the airline business. 
31843 Pour un premier voyage a NYC cet hotel est bien situe dans un quartier avec beaucoup de bars et de restaurants sympas. De plus avec ces deux bouches de metro a proximite il permet un acces rapides aux autres endroits de la ville, Midtown, Wall Street, etc... 
31844 Great hotel, great staff, great location. You'll have no problems if you stay here. 
31845 Really great family friendly hotel. Staff very helpful and polite - esp welcoming at breakfast (Ismerta loves kids). Rooms clean and small kitchens great - they let you take milk, yoghurt and fruit from breakfast. Pool for kids on top floor a real plus. Great location. We'll be back! 
31846 Could not find a thing wrong. Clean, friendly and close to everything. 
31847 Ottima la posizione a due passi da Times Square, hall grande e molto dispersiva, camere piuttosto piccole, volevo effettuare una modifica nella prenotazione al desk della ricezione clienti mi hanno rimbalzato verso dei telefoni perche' ogni modifica poteva essere effettuata solo via telefono, lo trovo assurdo. 
31848 Just back from this hotel yesterday and I was very impressed! Was clean staff helpful and in an excellent location. Free breakfast was great as it saved time looking for somewhere plus saved money. Would def recommend this hotel and would stay there again would a doubt!! 
31849 Excellent hotel Would stay here again This was my third time to New York and beat hotel yet! 
31850 Stunningly unique boutique hotel. Exquisite atmosphere. Unfortunatly let down by EXTREMLY rude, sarcastic and ignorant manager- bad example to set for hotel staff. Very disappointed and will not be returning. 
31851 Loved the old restored areas...rooms bigger than Allerton....great views out windows..clean..nice staff..and concierge services...kuerig coffee comp on 2nd floor.... 
31852 Good experience...rooms are about 10x10....got it for about $130/night which made it worth it. Great spot for getting to Central Park on foot. Real short cab ride to theaters and Times Square. Hotel employees courteous. Recommended if you can get it for $180/night or less. 
31853 Love the vibe in this historic Houston landmark. The staff was amazing. We had a lovely dinner for two and enjoyed the surrounding area. 
31854 Very friendly and helpful staff! Loved the coffee 24hrs. The complimentary wine and cheese was a nice touch. Rooms are a little small but clean and workable. Location was excellent! Close to all the theatres and numerous excellent restaurants. We will be back!! 
31855 Wonderful hotel. Lots of international visitors here. As noted, location is unbelievable central to times square, central park, transportation, broadway , bars etc! I got a deal for $99 per night through their website and was worth every penny! 
31856 Clean room. Friendly staff. Great location. Scary elevators. 
31857 Great little hotel - clean great bedrooms. Reception isn't that great - which is misleading cause the rooms are nicer that one would expect. Beware the concierge tho - doesn't know much.. So double check his info. 
31858 Four Seasons consistently provides the best service of any hotel I have ever stayed in. 
31859 We stayed at the Milburn last February (2003). The rooms were modest- but clean- and nicely equiped- especially nice to have a frig and microwave. The staff was very helpful. We thought and excellent price for the location- oh yes, enjoyed the neighborhoods and local markets very much. 
31860 It's near the most important buildings and places to visit in Manhattan. Chrysler; Empire State; Central Park, Broadway. It worth!!!
