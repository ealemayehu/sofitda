[BEGIN] My wife and her sisters stayed at The Muse for her 40th birthday. I called and spoke with Barbara (concierge) about leaving something special in my wife's room. Barbara went above and beyond in taking care of my request. She certainly made a big difference in my wife's stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Morgans is a small quaint hotel with a personable staff. (I was tracking this, front desk staff greeted with "welcome back" everytime I came through the front door.)
