[BEGIN] good hotel, very near central park, 10 minute walk from times square, some rooms in need of up date, staff very helpful, concierge know everything an everywhere you want to visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not far from China Town. Bus transportation is easy to downtown, but if you have to take subway, not much so.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel ligt op loopafstand van veel bezienswaardigheden, waaronder Central Park. Hotel zelf is prima. Wij hadden vier-persoons kamer. Bedden voor mij te smal met twee personen. Keurig schoon gemaakt, iedere dag. Krantje onder de deur elke ochtend. Wij waren er drie nachten.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was my first trip to NYC & the stay was wonderful. The hotel is true old NYC, we loved it. We were within walking distance of shops, theatre & resturants. I would highly recommend the Cafe Edison.  [END]

[BEGIN] I was a little skeptical by previous reviews, scored an EXCELLENT price on Priceline.. Great Location, nice clean room with comfy bed!

[BEGIN] We stayed there for about 5 days. The room was large, clean and modern. The hotel is well positioned and the staff are very helpful. What else can you ask for!  [END]

[BEGIN] Staff was great,very helpful and accomodating. Room was on the small side but very clean and with great beds. Our room was nice and quiet. Would have prefered breakfast included otherwise no complains.  [END]

[BEGIN] Dit zijn suites (keuken, zitkamer, slaapkamer) en dus geen hotel. Waar je normaal een passieve portier verwacht, was het hier echt helemaal in orde. Wanneer je -vooral met gezin- niet te veel wilt uitgeven, is dit een perfecte suite, niet duur, terwijl je toch in de Galleria omgeving zit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Value in perfect location. Just next door to Times Square and just a few blocks away from Central Park. On the downside was the roomsize, really small. But what do you expect at these prices in this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location...Clean rooms & baths...Friendly staff...Public transportation right at the front door...Good restaurant [Weber Grill]...Concierge who works with other hotels...Close to FABULOUS restaurants [ie: Joe's]...Good value.

[BEGIN] We stayed at this hotel last week and it exeeded all of our expectations The. J. W. Suite was very nice, clean and spacious.We loved the location because we were very close to Grand Central Station.The breakfast was a little overpriced. All-in-all another great Marriott experience!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in a balcony king room. My only complaint was the AC seemed a bit weak. The room bad a humid feel with a bit of a musty odor. Everything else seemed really nice.  [END]

[BEGIN] I stayed at the DaVinci August 25-26. It's not the Ritz but it's clean, comfortable, and safe and in a great location. Don't come here expecting four or five star service but it's decent considering what you paid for it. I, for one, will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here after a night out in Chicago. It was nice, clean and friendly. This is the 2nd time we've stayed here and enjoyed it each time. Breakfast was delicious as well!  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room on the 11th floor had comfortable beds, a fridge, and lots of fluffy towels each day. Combined with a location on Times Square and close to restaurants and theatres, what else does one need for a great New York City experience......  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved this place. You don't go to a city to stay in your hotel, but you want it to be clean when you're there. Which is why these affordable, small but nice and clean rooms are perfect for a city visit !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great new Hyatt, fantastic location - really great. Hyatt seems like they wanted to open it as an Andaz because it has the look & feel of one. Very nice rooms. Close to everything. Great choice for almost any activity in the city.  [END]

[BEGIN] Value is not a good word to describe it because it usually associates with low quality, but not here. This hotel has very small rooms, but the attention to detail in the cleanliness was appreciated. Hotel bar is okay. Discounted parking was appreciated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very pretty rooms with an European flair. We had a great view of the river, and could walk to everything. We said 'wow' when we opened up the curtains. The prices in the restaurant were extremely high however.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean room and facilities. Good breakfast, excellent espresso machine. Friendly, knowledgeable staff. What moer can you ask for. Nice stay, thankyou. We will be back...  [END]
[BEGIN] Very safe, great location, helpful staff. Rooms are comfortable, not overly luxurious, but clean and warm. We would definitely stay here again  [END]

[BEGIN] Excellent location Reception and bar furnished fantastic Concierge top, super diligent Rooms small but very comfortable  [END]
[BEGIN] Die Lage des Hotels ist kaum zu schlagen, direkt an der 5th Avenue und nur wenige Blocks von Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square & Co entfernt. Der Service war in Ordnung, am Zimmer nichts auszusetzen und die Bar stylish.  [END]
[BEGIN] a very centrally located near metro rail way station beetween columbus circle and coloumbia university.you will appriciate its cleaness.the receptionist will help you to buy bus passand guide you for sight seeing.but the rooms are a bit expensive as i had to pay tax extra but it was worth.

[BEGIN] Prima hotel, wel wat geluid van AC (denk ik) maar niet erg hinderlijk. Het meegeleverde zwembad was wel meestentijds verhuurd aan clubs, en dan kon je er geen gebruik van maken. Het ontbijt was redelijk maar niet overdadig of luxueus. Goede bedden, vriendelijk personeel.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location and very nice amenities. Plenty of room for 2 adults and 2 teenagers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Front desk girl was RUDE. Everyone else wass EXTREMELY ACCOMODATING and PLEASANT. Our room was on the 18th floor which was right under the rooftop bar. So if you want quiet, then be sure not to stay on the 18th floor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Five nights at The Barclay, nice hotel, well located, amazing staff, room was not ready at 5 pm after check inn but they gave us free breakfast next morning. excellent location very close to a lot of attractions, big room but small bathroom. I'd stay again for sure  [END]

[BEGIN] Very clean rooms, pleasant employees, easy access to Interstate 10, nice breakfast offerings, cookies available at the desk, hard beds, dissappointed that animals are allowed in the rooms. Heard barking when a dog was left alone in a room during the day and have allergies to pet hair  [END]

[BEGIN] Het hotel is een aanrader voor wie een bezoek brengt aan NewYork. Voor een degelijke prijs ben je onmiddellijk op 5th avenue. In de zitruimte gratis koffie en WiFi. Vriendelijk onthaal! Nadeel: geen ontbijt, maar dan ga je gewoon naar een Panera Bread voor een lekker ontbijt.  [END]

[BEGIN] Very good, pleasant clean hotel in excellent midtown location. Beds are excellent.  [END]

[BEGIN] Stayed one night, needed to be in the Medical District and that area is not the best. Got a very good rate on Hotwire, would not pay full price for this hotel. Comfortable bed and pillows, free parking. But it does need updating. It's clean, just old.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is a bit out of the way I think, but this is a good deal for it's overall value. Everything was reasonably clean and tidy and the staff was friendly. I've stayed in better hotels but wasn't terribly disappointed with this one.  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel was above average with its ammenities. However, the location is excellent!  [END]

[BEGIN] Booked this using hotwire and got a good deal. It was an enjoyable few nights and I would highly recommend it from the facilities available in the hotel to its location. It was a short walk to Millenium park and a short walk to the El system.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Clean, stylish room. Staff were extremely helpful and nice. Very safe surroundings. Love all loved it and will go back.  [END]

[BEGIN] view is really amazing! a drink will cost you as much as a ticket in rockfeller center or empire st building elevator. if you are not staying in the hotel, don't forget to try the restrooms, an experience of thei own  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, clean rooms and very close to downtown and to the very cool Randolphe St. Checking in, checking out, storing bags, retrieving bags were all extremely slow and disorganized. I would stay again, though, and take my chances.  [END]
[BEGIN] For business in midtown this hotel does the trick. Many good restaurants in walking distance. Your close to both UES and financial district. Staff is helpful and friendly. On occasion dignitaries from UN in residence and large security details. c  [END]
[BEGIN] Ground zero construction is due to go on for a little while yet and this hotel overlooks it. The location is awesome for transport links with subway on your doorstep but if you're a light sleeper, this hotel is not for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location on silent 56th, very large room with 2 double beds: suitable for 2 parents and 2 teenagers. Con: breakfastroom beeing under construction we were given 5$ vouchers for the midtown restaurant, about just enough for a coffee and muffin, but defenitily not for breakfast.  [END]

[BEGIN] My Husband and I stayed at the Jewel for five days in September. I couldn't fault this hotel on location, cleanliness and service. However our room was at the back of the hotel and overlooked some offices. I had hoped for a nice view. Also no restaurant or bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable room. Ok breakfast. Close enough to times square but without the hazzle. Stayed over the weekend. Room was on the 31st floor but could still hear very load music from a local establishment. Other wise happy with choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a one bed, 175 sq ft room. Great view from small window, comfortable bed/sofa, excellent location and price if you want to be near times square. One drawback is the location of the toilet in the studio without any door for privacy, only a curtain. Would stay again.  [END]

[BEGIN] The location is wonderful, and the room is good enough. The hotel is reasonably well taken care of, though not impeccable. The staff is very professional, though not especially warm. I found the hotel a little overpriced, but the location may account for that.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was in Houston on a business trip and barely got to spend any time in the hotel, but all my needs were met, the room was comfortable, and all the staff were helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Check-in and check-out were extremely expedient; easy access to Koreatown and Herald Square; hard to beat low triple-digit rates, especially in Midtown Manhattan; not much of a lobby or bar; rooms are small; slim and tall building with a narrow entrance; views are poor on the lower floors.  [END]
[BEGIN] 5 blocks from the natural history museum and central park, one block from Grom gelato enough said! Two kids on solo vacation with Mom. Construction didn't bother us because we were gone from 9-5 and then again in the evening each day.  [END]
[BEGIN] All the good stuff other people wrote is true, but we have to add one remark. The "double" bed was way to small for two (normal sized) women. We were surprised that nobody wrote about that!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location for broadway shows. Very clean and modern!  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel is clearn. TV has more than 200 channel. Breakfast is good. I like the happy hour in the afternoon.  [END]

[BEGIN] This is an excellent hotel located in a great spot in the city. It is within an easy walk of Theatre district, Central Park and Times Square.  [END]

[BEGIN] molto elegante, panoramico, servizio ottimo, ottimo prezzo  [END]

[BEGIN] The location of the hotel is amazing right in time square. The standard rooms are pretty much just a bed. The bathrooms could also be a little cleaner.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location, overall great value, especially in a place like New York. Will stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] My boyfriend and I enjoyed our stay at the Tremont. It was our first time to Chicago and we would definitely stay there again. It is only a block away from Michigan Ave. and very convenient. The hotel staff was also friendly and helpful to us as tourists.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable hotel just a few blocks away from Grand Central Station. Rooms are spacious, service is friendly and price is moderate for Manhattan. Overall, a good value; we'd stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Located nicely in midtown with easy access to the subway. Lots of selection for eating and shopping nearby. Some construction in lobby but this was minimally inconvenient. Room was clean and well proportioned, staff was friendly and helpful, even for NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] The price was cheap and the train was close, the park is close, the breakfast was bad. If you are staying because the have free breakfast, don't stay. But over all everything else was fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reasonably priced motel close to the subway. Just 1 express stop on the subway from times square and 15 minute ride to statue of liberty. Rooms have a kitchen if you are trying to save some money and want to cook for yourself.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have stayed there several times and while the prices and especially the parking keeps going up the experience seems more and more ordinary. No internet and the elevator situation is in need of attention. The Hyatt almost next door offers better value for the bargain hunter.  [END]
[BEGIN] The size of the room was Ok. It was clean, very well located and the personal was friendship. If I return to NY with a low budget I'm sure I will choose the Deuville again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel does lots of large tour groups. Good location in NYC. Hotel and room was clean. Beds, carpet, furniture fairly new. Bathrooms still needed updating. We got a suite, which was two small rooms combined into one - extra space was good. Otherwise rooms would be very NY small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Relsitief klein hotel, betaalbaar maar met prima uitgeruste kamers en goede service. Goed gelegen op 31e straat, dicht bij Empire state Building, op loopafstand van Broadway, Central Park en 5th avenue. Metrostation in de buurt maar minder geschikt voor laat reizen vanwege lage frequentie.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic location, great service, very nice room. We really enjoyed our stay at the Belvedere. 1 1/2 blocks from Time Sq and Broadway. 2 blocks from 30 Rock, 20 minute walk to Central Park. You can't beat the value. We will stay at here everytime we visit the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here on a recent one night stay in NYC, great location not far from the flatiron area, rooms were very clean and well sized for NYC. Would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at the Swissotel with a group of girls for the weekend. It's location allows you to easily walk to Michigan ave. shops and restaurants. The hotel itself was great. Rooms were big as were the bathrooms. The staff couldn't be more helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here three nights. Breakfast was good but very busy. Staff very friendly and helpful. Can't complain about anything except the price of staying in Manhattan!  [END]

[BEGIN] Rooms are nice size. Staff is great. I still can't believe that upscale hotels in NYC don't offer free wifi, that is a miss on their part  [END]
[BEGIN] Pleasant check in. Wifi not free. Room and bathroom enormous by nyc standrds. Clean, secure, a few minutes brisk walk rom times square. Cannot comment on food service, few breakfast places in neighbourhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Execllent location with normal sized rooms. Very clean. I wish they would install vents in the bathroom as the room always was very humid from shower. Be prepared, great locations with clean, normal size rooms in NY attract a high premium. But this hotel is worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Location. Good service & available staff (although staff at reception can be harsh/snobby). Great amenities (gym, restaurant, lounge, wireless internet, free coffee at lobby level in the morning). Good decor. Clean. Comfortable. Small but practical rooms (European concept) because this is a historical building that has been modernized.  [END]

[BEGIN] The rooms are VERY clean and the staff was friendly and very helpful. The parking garage is free for guests and that is a great perk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Second stay at a Kimpton & I'll continue to try the boutique chain. The good: excellent rate, birthday upgrades, 4* restaurant, 5*rooftop bar. The bad: hard to reach concierge who forgot to make dinner reservation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite a large room by New York standards. It was a good price for this location. It was a basic hotel room but most importantly, it was clean. We found the street noise a little loud on the weekend but other then that, I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel just opened a few weeks ago - and it is clean as a new one. rooms are small, but this was expected. it is located @ Wall&Water St. with 2min walking distance to NYSE and 2/3 Subway station. for the price i paid = recommended  [END]

[BEGIN] This is my second trip to this hotel, it's amazing! love the location, love the staff! i would stay here again, again and again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for business. Rooms were on the small side but nice esp for NYC. Wasn't a fan of the bathroom metal sink, although modern, kind of reminded me of industrial or army style. Great location about a block from the hub of times square.  [END]
[BEGIN] All ok, nothing wrong, just that there is a better W a few blocks away. That said, I had a great weekend, but that was more to do with who I was with :)  [END]

[BEGIN] comodissimo (a un passo da Rockefeller center e la 5th) pulito prezzo interessante stanze un po' piccole  [END]

[BEGIN] I chose this hotel because of its proximity to Broadway shows and theaters. Although it is a bit worn, it is clean and the beds and linens are excellent. The staff is very helpful and the concierge Larry was outstanding. The subway station is right across the street. Highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was clean, serviced regularly, very comfortable, great amenities but without a view. It wasn't noisy at all. However the neighborhood on the Upper West Side was pretty dead.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel at an affordable price. The Kimpton's always deliver and Ink48 is no exception. Very new and well appointed. The streets around the hotel are busy so higher floors are preferred. Not as centrally located at the Muse or Eventi but definitely a good choice in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Un hotel moderno, excelentes habitaciones, un bar increible, mejor restaurante de sushi en la planta baja, muy amable los empleados y la mejor ubicacion a solo metros del Time Square, salis caminando y te encontras rodeado de Teatros, Restaurantes y toda la magia de NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location was Ideal, the King size Bed extremely comfortable, the memory foam does make a difference. Staff was very friendly, would recomend it.  [END]

Please also note there is a long-term construction project going on next door, with jack hammers beginning at 7 AM.  [END]
[BEGIN] The view of Lake Michigan was superb and the rooms were extremely comfortable and sleek. Stick with the mid to upper floors if possible to avoid the Lake Shore drive distractions.  [END]

[BEGIN] Pros: Front desk personnel very helpful, room very clean, bathroom clean, clean linens and towels. Very good price and location. Cons: Room small, and over heated. NO VIEW of anything from most rooms. Breakfast room too small and overheated. Too much Styrofoam used for breakfast items.  [END]
[BEGIN] Een zeer verzorgd en trendy hotel, recent gerenoveerd, interieur design door Philippe Starck. Personeel was zeer behulpzaam en uitermate vriendelijk. Verzorgde kamers, klein maar trendy, een absolute aanrader. Theaters vlakbij en Times Square op 3 minuten wandelen.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good location, near the famous shops and central park. They have large rooms, good for families. I think all of their rooms have double beds. You have to pay for Internet. We had zero view. The room and the bathroom was clean. The bathroom has a bathtub.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean hotel, great service, and the breakfast was good. The only real negative was the super slow elevators and the fact that this hotel (and many others) abuse the Times Square monicker.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is very nice...rooms beautifully appointed (LOVED the baseball theme throughout), AVEDA toiletries, tub AND separate shower. One thing however, loud noise from atrium bar travels up so if you are on floors 1-3, bring a sound machine. I found the hotel staff to be friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I stayed for 2 nites. Great location within walking distance of many NYC attractions. Public parking facility next door. Room was clean, roomy with excellent furnishings.

[BEGIN] The hotel is about two blocks from the Waldorf. The subway is on the same corner. You are within easy walking distance to Times Square, the Theatre, Central Park, etc. Great location. The service was great, the rooms were clean and big enough. For this price, you can't go wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel staff were friendly and efficient Rooms were clean and comfortable. Food and drinks were slightly on the expensive side but you do not get charged for the great atmosphere so well worth it. Great location for exploring the rest of NY.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great little hotel on 5th avenue and next to the Empire State building. Small rooms, maybe better for a solo traveller than for a couple but very clean, comfortable. Aircon units in the rooms could be noisy in summer. The rate was VERY reasonable for the quality of the hotel.  [END]

[BEGIN] Swift and friendly check-in. Generous sized, and very clean room with comfortable bed. Small pool (didn't use). Short drive or walk to a selection of places to eat. Not far from Firehouse Saloon. Buffet breakfast was basic, but acceptable. Would stay here again without a second thought.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the second time I've stayed at this motel in Times Square. The value and location are terrific for NYC. The staff was again, very helpful and pleasant. The room, though small, was fine. Clean w/ the amenities of pricier motels. I still give it an Above Average rating.  [END]
[BEGIN] family room with a little kitchen (it's the better way to eat in manhattan); wonderful location, near park avenue, 5 min to rockfeller center; wonderful room, good price. Something was wrong with the service (not very kind); our room wasn't cleaned at 4 p.m.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice cozy room,just steps from subway and few blocks from the park.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in one of the renovated rooms and was shocked at how large it was (especially for being in the heart of NYC). The room was chic and very clean. The staff were all great and the location can't be beat, of your looking for that full-on NYC experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] We didn't have high expectations but thought the value for the size of the room and location was great. Perfect location if you are going to MSG, Macy's, Time Square... It is an old hotel but staff were friendly and the room was clean. Would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for 2 nights and have no complaints. Friendly staff and smooth operations. Yes, the place is a bit old, dirty and run down, but being downtown for around $130 a night, it is tough to beat. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very pleasant staff on front desk, Dianne was charming, the room was ok, why charge so much for a mini bar though? I would recommend this hotel, it's in. Perfect location  [END]

[BEGIN] Marriott Courtyard Times Square is conveniently located near Times Square, right nearby lovely Bryant Park. Friendly staff (if a bit over-attentive), well appointed rooms, although there was a constant cold draft going through which was uncomfortable. Free wireless internet was a big plus. An overall nice hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] ...as soon as possible! A great location, friendly staff, room nicer than I expected (judging from some of the earlier reviews I'd read).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, view of Empire State Building from our rooms, kids loved! Rooms were kind of small for 4 (2 kids, 2 adults), but I suppose they were pretty standard for NYC. We found that the price was very reasonable for the location.  [END]

[BEGIN] Enyoed my stay, great location and free terminals to use the internet. Coffee and bagel for breakfast. Great  [END]

[BEGIN] This is not flashy and perhaps only slightly tired, but a real value though on line sites. The lcoation is super convenient and get a room without a park view, you will have the quiet you seek. Fifth stay in five years, never had a problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed at several motels in the timesquare area. Although the motel may be showing its age in a few spots, this is a very nice upscale NYC motel and the staff is very friendly. Could not get a better location for timesquare or for shows.  [END]

[BEGIN] We loved our stay here! Great location, great views, and spacious rooms. Highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] With its wonderful location off Central Park, this very traditionally elegant hotel has a lot to offer. Be careful about room selection, the variation is greater than most hotels. Staff is efficient if slightly stiff. Pricey but probably worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place, great staff (Gerard in security was especially gracious and helpful). Room on the lower floor facing off-street was too dark. I'll come again and be sure to book sunlit room).  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is extremely well located, just 2 mins walk from Times Square. Excellent service, great advices from concierge. I got a room on 4th floor: nice spacious room and great view. Just a pity that internet is not free (no wifi). Overall, highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect Location. Clean Rooms. Upgrade to Park view room with SPG Gold status. Very low last minute rate on spg.com. Room Service Quick. Excellent TV. Fantastic front desk staff (huge bonus) Only downside were the archaic hairdryer (pack your own) and no bathrobe. Will chose this hotel again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Room was nice and clean. Front desk were not particularly helpful or pleasant. Maybe just having a bad day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great modern room, reminiscent of W Hotels in feel. On the smallish side, but a great alternative to the other hotels in the area. If you're able to book this hotel for ~$150 consider it a good deal.  [END]

[BEGIN] We stayed here during a business trip, the location was great for shopping and getting around. The hotel was clean and modern. We never had any issues. It was reasonable at the time but it really depends on the date.  [END]
[BEGIN] Here for a conference and given Classic King room with partial view of lake and facing park, so break in buildings means great views. Rooms 2113-2118 (or higher floors) all facing right direction. Fridge, safe, upgraded fixtures all nice and pool on top floor, oh yeah.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room (2 qns) was very large and comfortable. The shower was amazing and we couldn't have asked for nicer service. The elevators were kinda quirky. You enter the floor you want to go to and an elevator shows up to take you there.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very well located and close to everywhere. Clean rooms, friendly staff, and a nice lounge area with bar service makes it a great choice in Manhattan. Starbucks, Central Park, restaurants and subway stations right next door is also a plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] The 414 Hotel is located in a super spot. Right on restaurant row. Easy walking to many good restaurants. Subway access is close. Street is a nice neighborhood and reasonably quiet. Staff are friendly, helpful. Breakfast offering is enough to get you going.  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy amables todos los que trabajan en el hotel, y muy centrico.,  [END]

[BEGIN] Even though we did not spend much time at our room, we enjoyed every minute that we DID spend there! Much space (we had a suite), with nice furnitures. The room was clean! A trendy, but still quiet and classic hotel. With a PERFECT location!  [END]
[BEGIN] We have stayed here twice before and will book again in October. Friends live 20 minutes drive away but hotels near them are not as good as this hotel. Its worth the drive. Have not been to breakfast, only to pick up some bagels, we always go out to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, contemporary decor, pleasant staff. Great convenient location. FYI- walls are thin and plumbing is loud. Pool on 40th floor was not heated when we went.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima verblijf gehad, alleen de klimaat-temperatuur verhouding in de kamers is niet goed. Veel te warm, droge lucht. De laatste nacht in een andere kamer geslapen met 2 ramen waardoor ik beter kon ventileren.. Dus als het te warm is, vraag gewoon een andere kamer!  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed our stay, the rooms big, we were in 6 th floor, newly renovated, the beds are clean, nedsheets smell good, no bugs , roaches or anything !! I would definitely stay again at this hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed here a number of times on business and it's always been quite nice. The junior suites are great, if you can get upgraded, it's a nice perk. The restaurant is just ok, but certainly adequate. Love the lobby bar. Great locations by the PATH.  [END]
[BEGIN] De suites zijn ruim en comfortabel (deze hadden wij de eerste nacht). Daarna hadden we de ooorspronkelijk geplande eenvoudige kamer, we deelden een badkamer met twee andere kamers, maar je had wel zelf een wastafel. Was prima.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here over spring break. Most of the staff was average ... like customer service wasn't the goal, but they were nice enough get by. Room was clean, no complaints. Location is fantastic. Westheimer is *right there*.  [END]
[BEGIN] We loved the location for some great eating and easy access to Central Park. Close to the subway made it very easy to get around this amazing city any time of the day and night.  [END]
[BEGIN] just wanted to give this hotel and company a big thumbs up for there handling of our stay during the hurricane. The wen above and beyond to even having breakfast lunch and dinner catered in. The rooms are nice and overall it is a cool place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were a bit outdated, but they were clean and the hotel felt safe. Friendly staff downstairs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, and a really neat little [single] room. Nicely furnished throughout. Turn left and you've got a great choice of restaurants and stores; turn right and you're on Times Square within a minute. Can't wait to stay here next time (in a double room).  [END]
[BEGIN] Finding an affordable hotel {that isn't roach infested} is not an easy feat. Holiday Inn popped up on Hotwire and was cheaper than a friend's employee discount at Starwood Resorts. Location is great, rooms are remodeled and clean but of course they are small. That is my only complaint.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent 29JUN-03JUL in NYC at Westin, doormen, front desk, housekeeping were all really great. Lounge service at Bar 10 was TERRIBLE! Brutally slow service.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very happy with the stay from booking to departure. The location is easy to get to and while there you can forget that you're in the middle of the city. I really appreicated it. I would stay in the hotel again if given the opportunity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Classic hotel, in a great location close to Grand Central. Was able to get a great deal through Hotwire. I was pleasantly surprised to see that my allotted room was large and spacious, quite unlike most NY hotels.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I recently stayed at Park Central New York. Our Bellman, Carmelo was outstanding! From luggage care and delivery to arranging transportation for us. If you visit that hotel, make sure you ask for Carmelo! He is one of their BEST employees!  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect.. located at the airport, paid 70 USD for a night. Got the suit annexe... With a bathroom n tv... Slept well without any stress of missing the flight... Amazing.. Recommend to travellors in transit with no time for jet lag...  [END]
[BEGIN] thought it was a very up market hotel friendly people and excellent views, although make sure you get a good room because the lower market rooms are so standard, and u get a 40" samsung lcd in every room which is gd lol  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is in a great position for Central Park, Hell's Kitchen & the underground. Lots of Starbucks all round the hotel ideal for breakfast or afternoon coffee. Wifi actually worked well in the room. Hotel itself is a bit worn but is about to undergo a refurb. No real complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel with excelent location, new but very small rooms. Ideal for leisure trips, only to sleep. A little noise you'll hear.. Good value vs money. I recommend rooms with private bathroom!  [END]
[BEGIN] My Fiance and I recently stayed for 2 nights, 3 days. The location is convenient to sights and good restaurants. The entire staff was friendly and very helpful, the room was very clean. I would and will recommend this hotel and will definitely be back.  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice place and good location. Very quiet and professional staff. We will definitely stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] I booked a last minute deal here. Fantastic area near public txpt, lots of museums shopping and restaurants nearby. The room is large and clean. Basic accommodations overall, but a bang for the buck. If you're looking for a boutique this place is not for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, Modern, Good service, Great location, Very clean  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice boutique hotel. Convenient location. Good service. Updated and nicely decorated. Very comfortable room and bed. Comfy little sitting area in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, on the border of Soho & Tribeca. Close to lots of great shops and restaurants. VERY SLOW elevators!  [END]

[BEGIN] great hotel for a few days stay to explore new york. fantastic location on the upper west side close to natural history museum and central park  [END]

[BEGIN] Very nice for a "select service" Courtyard. The front desk associates could have been a little more friendly. Their phone ettiquette is very poor, but the hotel is nice. It serves its purpose.  [END]
[BEGIN] All around a nice hotel. Only below average service i received was from concierge.  [END]
[BEGIN] in the heart of trendy chelsea, only a block away from a subway station, the gem is a small and charming hotel. the rooms are small, but comfortable. good shower and cozy bed. the staff is nice and helpful. and the location is really really good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 6 nites in Feb 2003. Freezing weather and 24 inches of snow! Staff helpful and friendly. Room small but suited me. Everything very clean and tidy. Was unsure of the 'shared' facilities (bathroom) but was pleasantly surprised - always kept clean. Great stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been here twice and really enjoy this place. The rooms are simple, clean, and fresh looking with a spring green and white color palette. The staff was friendly and you can't beat the convenience of the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic view of Empire State Building from room 604. Clean, spacious room with very comfortable bed, fridge and coffee maker. Perfect for our first trip to New York!  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased through online service, but would choose as one of the best hotels I have stayed at in Midtown.  [END]

[BEGIN] This hotel was reasonably close to Times Square and is a good choice for those on a budget. Staff were helpful and arranged a taxi to the airport. Rooms are small and bathrooms are shared but for the price it was ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Een zeer centraal gelegen, ietwat verouderd maar netjes en schoon hotel. Ruime kamers met zithoek en keuken. Niet veel faciliteiten, wel internet ( ook wifi) en kleine fitness ruimte. Hotel wordt momenteel gerenoveerd, momenteel geen restaurant Vriendelijk personeel. Prima prijs-kwaliteitsverhouding, wat ons betreft de volgende keer weer  [END]

[BEGIN] We stayed for one nite. The location in times square is very good and close to Penn Station. The hotel rooms, beds are high quality and very nice. Would definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] O forte deste hotel eh sem duvida a sua localizacao. O servico deixa um pouco a desejar. Nao ha luxo mas para quem vai ficar a maior parte do dia fora do hotel, o quarto (com banheiro interno) eh razoavel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal for Manhattan- $129 a night through Priceline by naming my price. Very nice lobby, great location, nice rooms. Large by NYC standards. Only complain was thin walls in the room- I could easily hear my neighbors' alarms, cell phones, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] A pretty decent hotel in a brilliant location. Well placed for the subway and everything mid town. Rooms were well appointed and clean. Ideal for a city break. Reception and concierge very helpful and reliable.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here in Nov02 and it was everything I was looking for. Great location, great price and clean. I was travelling solo and the single rooms were not huge, but you dont go to NY to spend time in your hotel room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than average breakfast so get the bed & breakfast package if you can. Free wifi in the room. Comfortable beds, free self-parking, small but good gym, small but better than average pool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dit hotel ligt pal bij een belangrijk metro station in hartje Manhattan. Dit gegeven, alsmede het feit dat het een zeer Amerikaans, geheel in jaren '30 stijl ingericht hotel is, maakt het tot een praktische en karakteristieke keuze.  [END]
[BEGIN] great location , nice rates compared to some of the other hotels near by. The rooms were a little small but clean Would stay again !  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location about 50 metres to the subway, spacious and breakfast is free. Oh, and if you are a PriorityClub member there are few better values for your points. Personally I prefer the upper floors for the great views.  [END]

[BEGIN] This is a good hotel with huge rooms which are great for families. I was very happy overall, although the hotel's emphasis on 'tranquility' was a little too forced. Would recommend for families who need a big room and good sized kitchen attached.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great place for families. We had a one bedroom apartment which had a sofa bed in the main living room. It had two big TVs and came with a nice free breakfast each morning. The place is very central to Central York, Rockefeller Centre and Times Square  [END]
[BEGIN] Gorgeous property, but no complimentary wifi is inexcuseable. I also wish that Hilton would move on up from Double sized beds - not that comfortable to sleep two people. Extremely friendly staff, all go out of their way to make sure guests are accomodated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would recommend hotel, good location, really friendly helpful staff, good breakfast, free coffee and pastries and evening cheese and wine. If you can put up with small room its a perfect choice  [END]

[BEGIN] Location is close to Central Park and Fifth Avenue shopping. Hotel decor is older but suites are spacious and comfortable. Good value for the money.  [END]

[BEGIN] I booked what was the smallest room at the River Hotel, that came at a very good price for Chicago's standards.

[BEGIN] Right in the corner of Broadway and 54th! Wooooow what a location! Minutes walk to most theaters and attractions. Hotel sparkling clean and great staff. We got what we paid for Small but functional rooms. Very chic upgrade has been done in the bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice enough hotel with great location and no bedbugs. We noticed on our credit card that they overcharged us by $50 each day. Upon contacting the hotel, they say that they will remove the extra charges in 3 days "once they know that we didn't watch any movies."  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel moderno e molto modaiolo. Il bar al roof ha una spettacolare vista sull'Empire e il bar al secondo piano completa la piscina e la zona spiaggia (con sabbia vera). Due ristoranti ottimi ma un po costosi. Originale il soffitto della hall da cui si vedono gli ospiti in piscina.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in an odd spot but don't let that fool you. A quick hop on Beltway 8 and you can be anywhere in the Northwest side of Houston in minutes. Service has been good and I've always gotten a good rate around $120.  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked a Queen Deluxe room on Quikbook.com for $250. We were in room 95. The room was bigger than I expected it would be. The bed was perfect for 2....with more than enough room.  [END]

[BEGIN] The location was great....was in walking distance of many attractions. Would shop and/ or check pricing for overnight parking. Across the street gives you a discount but still a little pricey. The hotel is older but for the price it is a great deal.  [END]

[BEGIN] Was surprised to find a nicely tiled bathroom, clean carpet, freshly painted walls, and a desk, sofa, fridge, microwave, cable tv and a clean breakfast area (which was basic with juices, grits, oatmeal, cereal, and muffins). Decent price, safe area, and no problems. Will return if needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottimo hotel a 10 min da times square. Struttura nuova e moderna, personale gentile e disponibile, ottima pulizia. Per colazione sono offerti ottimi muffins e bevande calde.

[BEGIN] Very small room but in great location. If you just want to sleep in the room while travelling NYC, this is a great place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Evelyn was a gem and helped our family enjoy our first stay in NYC and a Crowne Plaza Hotel! Thank you, Evelyn! Staying in the center of all the action was very convenient, especially when stowing and picking up luggage!  [END]

[BEGIN] The staff (Rita) took the time to find the best available room for us and upgraded us to a wonderful suite. The suite was perfect for 5 of us and made our stay in NYC all the more enjoyable. Rooms were great - comfortable beds and lots of space.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay at this hotel about 3 times per year for business. It is a perfect location to all the sites of Times Square, but if you go a few blocks away from Times Square, you will find some wonderful neighborhood restaurants. Staff is always friendly at this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just spent 3 nights at the hotel and It was great! Rooms are small and location is a bit out of the way but the staff make up for it. Would stay there again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Muy bueno, centrico, con espectaculares vistas de times square, en pleno broadway,  [END]
[BEGIN] Pulled into Chicago around 1am and got a nice room for a good rate... Took off the next morning but the cheapest place for miles the night before. The rate was half the rack rate at the surrounding hotels. Free parking too...  [END]

[BEGIN] We stayed at the Doubletree for a six days. Without any extra fancy a normal hotel service: clean rooms, proffecional staff, free Internet in a lobby, parking right next to hotel. For my personal taste beds are a little to firm but it works anyway. Overall a good experience  [END]

[BEGIN] I always found this hotel very convenient for business in Manhattan and good location for visiting the theatre district also some excellent restaurants in the area.I have stayed here many times and will do so in future.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, but this IS NYC. Location is convenient, ample breakfast (eggs, ham, sausage, cereal, oatmeal, muffins, juice, coffee, etc.), cookies in afternoon. Friendly staff. Only downside, 2 elevators for 32 floors. Room was ready sooner than check-in. Very clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty standard hotel for the $$, but considering some smaller boutique hotels (and smaller chains) are pretty much killing it with contemporary designs and amenities, this hotel is already dated and needs a refresh. The hotel staff were fantastic. The doorman/concierge really stood out!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great stay, impressed with the service. Lost bag from the flight, great help from Milev and David in retrieving the bags, thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny, very clean, helpfull staff. Great choice. Only 2 blocks from subway, numerous pubs, restaurants anda delis nearby.  [END]

Kitchen facilities were fine, with free tea and coffee provided. Well located. you can walk to many attractions, including Broadway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Goed hotel voor wat we ervoor betaalden. Als je tijdens een beurs een hotel voor deze prijs kan boeken, moet je altijd tevreden zijn. Het hotel is duidelijk aan renovatie toe, maar het was zeker niet storend, het gaf het wel een extra dimensie van vergane glorie  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a very nice stay here. Rooms have been upgraded and are conveniently set up, bathroom is super (except why no soap dish is shower?, beds comfortable, staff very friendly and courteous, breakfast great. LOCATION SUPERB. no downsides to staying here.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel 57 is a very good hotel with decent prices. The hotel has been renovated, recently finalized, and has a good overall standard. The personnel was helpful. Breakfast prices a bit high for four persons though, we preferred the small dinner across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a quick trip to NYC this past weekend. We booked three rooms at the Park Central hotel. Kristen Buurman was very helpful in making the arrangements for us. The rest of the staff that we interacted with was equally friendly and professional. Perfect NYC location!  [END]

[BEGIN] A bit expensive, but worth staying there at least one time in you life  [END]
[BEGIN] We hebben met 4 personen in een zeer ruime suite overnacht. De bedden waren voor 2 personen wat smal. (twijfelaar) De kamers waren zeer ruim en het was schoon. Centraal gelegen: vlakbij Central Park en Times Square en de verschillende metrolijnen.  [END]

[BEGIN] great location, good sized rooms, nice beds (but hard pillows). didnt much care for the pub attached and found their lack of internet access for non laptop owners archaic. still, all good.  [END]

[BEGIN] Ci sono tornato per la seconda volta e ci tornerei anche la terza. Ho utilizzato una superior room a due letti che consiglio vivamente. Grande e comoda. La location dell'hotel e' perfetta. Inevitabili i rumori di strada, come del resto in tutti gli hotel di ny. Atmosfera decisamnte rillassante.  [END]
[BEGIN] we stayed here as a family and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves great location, close to everything  [END]
[BEGIN] In posizione strategica, direttamente sopra la Grand Central Station e la metropolitana e comunque al centro delle attrazioni Ha un coffee bar aperto da poco nella hall, ma se si vuole risparmiare basta accedere alla stazione e si trovano, bar, ristoranti, negozi di ogni genere. Letto comodissimo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room very nice, bed was great. Stayed there after business meeting in Houston had early flight next day. Took me 10 minutes to get from Hotel to Avis Return on bus and at Airport. Nice little sports bar there but did not eat there.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in a good location, only 20 mins walk to TIme Square, 2 mins walk to central park. The rooms are very big and clean. Can't complian about the staff, It was great to have a self catering room and they are loads of supermarkets in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Appartementkamers zijn ruim en comfortabel. Complimentary ontbijt kan je beneden halen en vervolgens kan je in appartement ontbijten. Wel stadslawaai, maar ruimte en locatie en rust op overloop waar slechts 4 appartementen op uitkomen maakt het een goede keuze om met 4 - 6 personen te verblijven.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really enjoyed our stay! Nice staff and awesome location! We loved our stay!  [END]

[BEGIN] Convenient locoatio, easy access to China town, Little Italy, and subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for one night on 9/11 and can't say enough about the quality/price ratio. We Hotwire'd a great last minute rate and were thrilled that they didn't treat us like a discount customer. The restaurant is casual but with great food from a top chef.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this hotel in NYC as the bedrooms are larger than most. However, even on a very high floor, the noise is very loud, and very annoying (right next to Ground Zero). Otherwise, good hotel and great location.  [END]

[BEGIN] highlight of this hotel is it's killer location, view from our room was less than average, And what happened to the great service everyone speaks of here? Was nowhere to be found during my visit, overall the location in times square makes it a "Will Return" Experience  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, clean and very well located hotel (few minutes walking to Times Square). I experienced a very good service from staff when needed. Breakfast is good and it really worth it. Advisory about places to visit from the guys at the front desk was also very helpful.  [END]

[BEGIN] This was our first trip to Houston. We found this hotel very clean The service was very good and it is very well located for the Galleria The only negative is the air conditioning is very noisy. If we return to Houston again we would stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well you can get 2 beds or a King but still small rooms. Rooms were cozy and Clean. Service was Great and amenities was a nice plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel because of the location. Good deal because we paid ahead. Elevators a little burdensome. Restaurants very expensive. We had a view over 44th and the Hudson so we watched July 4th fireworks from our room. Rooms very comfortable.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good hotel with great location. Nice clean rooms. Good service from the staff. Will definately consider to order room in this hotel again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there in May. The staff there were really helpful and friendly. The front desk got really busy around noon and it didn't allow early check-in. Received a room upgrade and a welcome package as a platinum member. Waiting for elevator sometimes took a while.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you St.Marks for the pleasent stay, we stayed 5 nights, the shower was warm, the rooms clean, not much comfort, but you just fall into bed when you do sightsseing in NYC, and therefor it'S perfect (100 metres from the next subw.-station. Geli and Franz from Germany  [END]

[BEGIN] We checked in for 3 nights 13July'06 & the hotel was full & very busy. Although our room looked onto a wall it was clean, comfortable. The location is awesome, 1 min walk to Michigan Ave, 10min walk to Lake & 10min walk to Subway station. Recommended for price,/location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, it's an older building, but it was clean, the staff friendly and accomodating. The room was larger than expected. A/C would have been nice, as the room was quite warm, and I would have enjoyed better internet access, but these are small things. I would stay there again.  [END]

Facil acceso al Subway en diferentes rutas, igual a la Terminal de Buses y la gran variedad de restaurantes a su alrededor desde comida rapida a cenas formales. Volveria a disfrutar de estos servicios.  [END]

[BEGIN] A nice surprise at a great price. Room spacious & quiet. This place is well maintained & clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the Swissotel Chicago for 1 nioght in August. I found the staff to be very helpful. The room was beautifully equipped and the downtown location can't be beat. I would highly recommend this hotel for buisiness or pleasure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Style is very evident in this hotel. Felt like I was locked in an IKEA. The breakfast was very good and service was nice. Is pretty far from downtown or galeria area. Can walk to some great restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're coming to take th exam its great because its just five menutes from the cs center but its far from everything else. The bus tours and local hotspots are quite far whic becomes toruing a problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel centrale, personale disponibile, camere molto pulite, piccole ma funzionali (come di norma a Manhattan), eventualmente prendere opzione con 2 queen. Per fare colazione locale sulla 34st prima dell'incrocio con 9 ave, (100 mt lato sinistro molto buono e non caro).  [END]
[BEGIN] Beds too small for two people. The hotel and rooms were clean and nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was nice, but the front desk service was EXCELLENT. Sandra Esp, our attendant - AMAZING. Very nice, thorough and helpful - being fairly new to NYC, she was kind and patient with our questions and offered some great tips! Only neg - - -Hotel restaurant was horrid!  [END]
[BEGIN] This property is attached to the Galleria Mall and to several fantastic restaurants. The rooms are quite spacious, comfortable and clean.

[BEGIN] Well located on side street just off of Times Square. Approx. 2 blocks from Bryant Park and the Grace Building. Great little boutique hotel. Clean, quiet and comfortable. Great little bistro bar next door, with secret hallway to from hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] Het is een redelijk hotel, zeker gezien de prijs. O.k. je hebt een gedeelde badkamer, maar deze was altijd heel schoon. De kamer was klein, maar comfortabel en ook schoon. De plek is vlakbij 33th street met Metro, zodat je snel overal heen kunt.  [END]
[BEGIN] The position is great. The rooms are spacious but there are some drawbacks. The lobby is like the departure lounge of a busy airport. The room service is extremely expensive. The concierge is overworked and needs to be chased up. However, the pluses considerably outweigh the minuses.  [END]
[BEGIN] I certify that this review is my genuine opinion of this hotel, and that I have no personal or business affiliation with this establishment, and have not been offered any incentive or payment originating from the establishment to write this review.  [END]

[BEGIN] Very easy for 1 night layover with 2 small children and 1 small dog. Great service, very friendly and helpful staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small cosy hotel in a great location. Stay for 7 nights, good service by hotel staff. Easily accessible to uptown and downtown with subway just round the corner. Am using single room which is a bit small but just enough for my size and cosy enough.:)  [END]
[BEGIN] Perto de tudo Muito bem localizado Organizado e limpo  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent located, no need for taxi here. Check in was good, room was clean, large, and bed was so comfortable. No complaints, since special rate of $98 made my wallet happy. You walk 3 blocks your in the middle of Times Square.  [END]

[BEGIN] Sehr freundlicher Service, sauberes ruhiges Zimmer. Absolut nichts zu beanstanden.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was clean and comfortable. Original request for quiet room resulted in claustrophobic view of brick wall, but able to trade for room with some street noise. Bottled water appeared to be complimentary but charged $7 per bottle. Comparatively good value in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went with 4 people and had 2 separate rooms. Simple but decent breakfast. Very nice location. Small but clean bathroom. 20 minute walk from Times square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Please, look at my homepage: [--] All was good, but the "hotel" (West Side Inn) was very simple - but cheap. In any case I was pleased with the town! Below you can find two pics showing the average standard of my hotel room...  [END]
[BEGIN] Had heard bad reviews recently about the Soho Grand, but had good experiances there in the past. Stayed over the weekend and had a wonderful stay as usual. Beautiful room with a great view of NY. Attentive service, particularly at the front door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Hotel, typical Airport style, good food well located... I opted for a smoking room, but big mistake... I wanted to give up smoking as soon as I walked into the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Classic hotel with old school cha. Ceiling in lobby is beautiful. Needs a few tweaks here and there but a classic property. Service in the bar in the lobby was very slow. Hotel staff good in some areas. Needs a little more consistency.  [END]

[BEGIN] This Joint is no more. It has closed and is sold. It's a shame. I'm happy I managed to spend a night at this "museum". Not for the comfort, but for the atmosphere, history, architechture, art and just for this "been-there" thing. http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2028125/Hotel-Chelsea-New-York-closes-Where-Dylan-Thomas-drank-death.html  [END]

[BEGIN] For the most part I'm a fan of the Ace chain. I LOVE the NYC Ace. Great location, super hip scene, fantastic food, nice staff and great design. The "no.7 Sub" around the corner (owned by Ace) has THE BEST SUBS IN THE WORLD.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here on our first visit to NYC. Excellent hotel lovely room and good attention to service from staff.  [END]

[BEGIN] Subliem hotel op een schitterende ligging. Top ! Twee kleine opmerkingen. De airco in de gemeenschappelijke ruimtes staat veel te koud zodat je in het hotel moet voorzien zijn van een pull en jammer dat de schitterende bar op het terras reeds om negen uur sluit.  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent three nights here with a seven year old. The location is great for shopping and tourist attractions. It is four or five blocks to the red line CTA stop. The hotel was clean and quiet and met our needs very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel and excellent location but in beginning of August with temps of 88 outside AC did not work. Came out as a fan. Called maintenance who said he could bring us a box fan to help blow air. Humid in room. Otherwise great staff and hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] I needed a cheap (but classy) place to stay while in Chicago. While some might be taken aback by the size of some rooms (like the ones reserved at a very low price) the quality of room is very high. I have a video on my review here-->http://youtu.be/5vGtEUet3fg  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was nice. I was fortunate to get upgraded to a junior suite or I probably wouldn't have been happy with the room size. Bar drinks run 20-22 dollars each. Room service food was "fair". Breakfast for 1 was $50.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed over a weekend in August 2004. Rooms small but clean. Pleasant service. Great deli/bagel shop downstairs-good food, good prices. The FREE secured in and out parking is one of the best features of this hotel. Walking distance to subway too. Will stay again.  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel was reasonable, compared to others in NYC. The room was clean, the bed comfortable, with lots of hot water. The best is the location, close to Grand Central to uptown, and to subways. Plenty of restaurants in the area and a good lounge.  [END]

[BEGIN] Recently stayed at the Hotel Chandler after reading reviews on TripAdvisor. We found it to be very well located, in the middle of Manhattan (2 blocks from Empire State Bld) and 3 blocks from the Subway. Service was nice. Room very clean. The bathroom did have a small mold issue.  [END]

[BEGIN] Gelegen tussen 5th en 6th Avenue, om de hoek van het Empire Statebuilding, is dit een prima uitvalsbasis voor een korte vakantie in New York. Met een Subway station op de hoek (koop een weekkaart!) bwen je binnen 20 minuten overal op Manhattan...aanradertje, ik kom er al sinds 1996!  [END]
[BEGIN] l'albergo si trova veramente vicino al centro nevralgico della citta'. Pulizia buona , quartiere sicuro,personale attivo ed attento, presente in gran numero.

[BEGIN] Hotel situato in posizione estremamente strategica, a due passi dalla maggior parte dei luoghi di interesse. Camere non lussuose ed eleganti ma spaziose e pulite. Ottima sistemazione per una vacanza con la famiglia. Colazione a buffet ad un prezzo aggiuntivo onesto.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bedroom was ultra-modern and a gadget geek's dream. The beds and sheets were super-comfortable. Service was helpful. Check-in was smooth and staff replenished the mini-bar daily. Foot bath didn't work but the rain shower more than made up for it. Overall a pleasant experience. Would definitely recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was the perfect fit for our girls weekend in Chicago. It was a great price. It was clean, and the customer service was great. There is nothing fancy about the hotel, but it met our needs and is in a great location. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big and soulless - but in an excellent location. Spent too much time waiting for elevators - some of which were not working. Rooms were good and kept in immaculate condition by friendly and attentive staff. Breakfast is a frenzy - not relaxing and ludicrously expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has a great location, very close to Central Park, near Columbus Circle, the staff is very nice and the restaurant i very good too. But, the room was very small. I do recomend this hotel.  [END]

[BEGIN] the place is small and cramped, but you're in the city and getting around is fantastic. the subway is 2 blocks away. Central Park is across the street - and there's a ton of little restaurants just down the street in a 5-7 min walk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for three nights on business. Hotel is excellent, staff very friendly and price a litle bit higher than some but was worth it. Plenty of food places around and times square few blocks away. Would love to go back!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic location, 2 streets from central park, a 10-15 walk to Times Square/Rockefella Centre and bang in the middle of two subway lines serving lower Manhatten. Rooms are spacious and well equipt and service was great. For the price you can't ask for more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right off Times Square and near a subway station. Room had plenty of space. Comfortable bed. Shower could've used a bit more water pressure, but otherwise a pleasant stay. Staff was very helpful. Room service quick and very good food.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a bad hotel for business travelers. Very close to airport and not too far from a wide range of 'chain' restaurants. The beds are the most comfortable I believe I have ever slept on at a hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 blocks for Art Institute and MP and Michigan Ave. Classic hotel lobby with gold ornate fixtures, but the interior rooms could use updating. Was clean and well kept up but what you miss in new room updates you receive in location. Parking is much more economically priced under MP.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two blocks from Times Square, small sef-catering apartment, really nice. Certainly recommended if you'd rather cook your own food than stay in a traditional hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Three subway stations within a block, family restaurants nearby and across the street from Carnegie Hall. Clean and affordable. We stayed four days with wife and two teenagers and we all liked it.  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice hotel, quiet, clean, updated rooms with great A/C. The price is good as well, especially for the location - 50th and Lex. Enjoy! However, you may want to skip the free breakfast - too many other choices in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice boutique hotel on the Upper West Side. It's a pretty good price for New York but don't expect any bells or whistles.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have nothing to complain about. Roomy room decorated in an american taste that is not correspondent with our own but I guess carpets are found in every NY hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brian couldn't have been more helpful and courteous in getting me a cab right away. Service with a smile!  [END]
[BEGIN] ruime kamers, geluidsarm en schoon; behulpzaam personeel. Bar met uizicht op een geweldige skyline; prima binnenzwembad en ligging uiterst gunstig. Goed en goedgeprijsd eigen restaurant met zowel kleinen als grotere gerechten.  [END]
[BEGIN] Louise Rechlis has to be the best reservation agent ever. Always smiling and ready to help.  [END]

[BEGIN] Spent 5 nights there recently on vacation. It's a good value. Clean, convenient and a friendly helpful staff left a positive impression. We would gladly return. The(free)continental breakfast could use some improvement, but the Blake overall takes good care of their guests.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Novotel at the enf of February. The location was excellent, the view from my 27th floor room was amazing. The front desk and concierge were very helpful. I would definitely stay here again, the rooms were a very generous size, particularly for New york.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there for 6 days at the end of May 2009. Pleasantly surprised at the high standard of the rooms. The Hotel has recently been refurbished. Good location, 5 mins to Grand Central Terminal.  [END]

[BEGIN] Clean, functional, right in the middle of the Village. Other than that, nothing memorable. Price was decent ($225) for small hotel in NYC at this time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent hotel right in theater district offering excellent amenities. Breakfast croissants should have been warm. Espresso, tea and lattes very good  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location; easily accessed from the Lincoln Tunnel. Easy valet service. Rooms on the small side, but good value. GREAT water pressure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Airport shuttle was good. Room was as advertised. Pictures were identical to room. Clean, comfortable beds and room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Value for money, it was definitely my best choice in NY in all my trips there. Rooms are small but enough for a couple. It's NY, you can't expect much more space. Staff is friendly. Subway just round the corner and Soho restaurants and bars 5 min walking.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall my recent stay at the Wyndham was a pleasant experience, the location suits my professional vendor visits and meetings  [END]
[BEGIN] Our visit to the Four Seasons was very nice, but less than we expected. While it's a lovely property (regal lobby; spacious, well-appointed rooms), and well located, the service was not consistent with their properties elsewhere....in say, Maui or Whistler. Disappointing....  [END]
[BEGIN] What a joy to stay where the staff are great and extremely helpful. Rooms are very good and the location is right where you can access everything new York has to offer. Thankyou for making my first trip to NY so great. C  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel tres bien place (proche ligne Metro), meme si nous avions vue sur un mur. Nous etions au 5eme etage, et nous entendions le metro, sinon rien a dire sur la proprete de l'hotel et l'accueil. Nous avons meme eu notre chambre en avance.  [END]
[BEGIN] In love with Madison Avenue! The hotel is very beautiful, and my room was just gorgeous. It is expensive, but NY is not cheap. Service is quick and very professional.  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel is in Greenwich village nearby the Washington square arch. Metro is everywhere. In a day you see a lot (min. 4 or 5 days). Rooms with airco and our bathroom was renovated. We had breakfast and in the city you can eat everywhere. Do it with a tourguide.  [END]

[BEGIN] Having a kitchen was great and it was close enough to walk to Times Square  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location off Michigan Ave. Rooms were clean with nice street view. Shower leaked all over the floor due to lack of shower door and the shower water was lukewarm. The doorman "Showtime" was very nice and helpful. The front desk staff was very friendly also.  [END]

[BEGIN] No bedbugs and helpful staff. OK there is no elevator, so we did have to carry our bags up 5 floors - however they had offered to help. Bathroom clean, great location. Couldn't ask for a better hotel at this price.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a great stay at this hotel. We had two rooms and oth of them were great. They were very large for a ny hotel. Very close to grand central. Housekeeping did come knocking early on our checkout day, which was the only negative. Overall great stay!  [END]

[BEGIN] Great Westin Style...in the middle of the hubbub..just opposite the Port Authority Bus station, a block from Times Sq. perfect oasis of corporate comfort in the city's heart. Upper floor rooms with a city view are perfect - quiet with a view! heavenly beds and simple showers...can't go wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] average room-but lobby freshener was overwhelming....I had to hold my breath walking through each day. I thought it was me, but I heard others complaining about it too. Conveniently located right by the subway and good shopping. I'd stay there again......they're in the process of redecorating it seriously needs it!  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a wonderfull time at the Roosevelt. We found the staff very friendly. The bar was a bit pricey. The rooms were clean. It is also very central, close to all attractions of NYC. We cant wait to go back and would go back to this hotel for sure.  [END]

[BEGIN] The Garden Inn brand has expanded a lot in NYC and this one is a good addition.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there with two elderly parents and three teenagers, we all loved it. The attentive staff were helpful and thoughtful. Touches like that take an average hotel up a couple of notches. The rooms were clean and comfortable after a long day of sightseeing.  [END]
[BEGIN] As I have said above this was a great base for the Tennis at the US open. A nice room but a little bit noisy (601), good housekeeping, helpful reception staff. Convenient for all the sights in Manhatten.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a great stay at the Edison over the weekend. The hotel was convenient to the theater district, the room was clean, quiet and comfortable, and the price was reasonable for mid-town Manhattan. All employees were helpful and polite. Valet parking is $29. We would definitely stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for the prices, room clean, good breakfast (not conventional in NY) Staff not friendly (sometimes stupid). Good, louder noises room to room. Good hotel for walk all day long and only sleep in the night.  [END]
[BEGIN] We've been staying at this hotel monthly for the past three years. The staff is excellent, and once one of the front desk staff moved their car so I could use their space! You won't find service like that anywhere!  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at the Michaelangelo in late July for four nights with two teenagers. Room was large, comfy and clean. Service was excellent, and James, the concierge, was very helpful. With Michaelangelo bordering on Times Square, the hotel was perfectly situated for Broadway shows, shopping and people-watching.  [END]
[BEGIN] Three of us stayed in the very nice sized room. We were impressed by the size and felt we received good value for the price we paid compared to other Manhattan hotels. The location is just perfect and in the center of it all.  [END]
[BEGIN] definitely a good place to stay in NYC, central and quiet....  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy check-in, clean room (with kitchenette!), good service and a great value for NYC. Don't forget to tip the door man if he hails you a cab - or he'll flat out ask you for one.  [END]

[BEGIN] This is a great hotel for the price. It is a safe neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at Crowne Plaza on a Friday and Saturday night. The location of the hotel was great and the staff very helpful. Upgrading their elevator system..abit of a pain, but overall we enjoyed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottima la posizione a 2 minuti dall'empire e sopra la metro...zona centralissima e ben servita.hotel enorme pulito, camere pulite e grandi....ci ritorneremo!!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] clean, hip hotel. great breakfast. a bit of street noise from room. very efficient use of space in rooms. staff were friendly and somewhat helpful. a couple of them were not very knowledgeable. overall we were very pleased  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms (NY standard) but very good position and price for mid Manhattan. The breakfast offered for 12$ has fruits, pastry, bagels and cream cheese, cereals, aso. Rooms equipped with coffee maker and tiny wardrobe.  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven't stayed there, but I'd recommend the rooftop bar. It can get a little sceney, but the views are worth it, even if you just go up for a drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very small, but neat and clean. We just stayed overnight and had 1 small bag. I can't imagine where one would put anything if they were staying for a week. The bed was comfortable and our room was fairly quiet. The location was perfect. I would stay there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Our family stayed here over the Christmas holiday. Weber Grill restaurant was very good. The staff was helpful, our room was spacious, and just steps away from shopping. We will stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visiting Chicago for business conference. Very well appointed hotel, what you would expect for a upmarket Hilton establishment. I found it very close to everything and you could walk to the city centre or to the conference centre very easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] First of all, the location is excellent. The room has a lot of space considering that most of the hotels at New York have small rooms. The interior design is very nice and contemporary. The staff is always ready to help. No complains at all.  [END]

[BEGIN] If you are looking for a clean room at a great price in the theater district this is it. Not plush, but adequate. Basically we used the room only for sleep. Staff was friendly and helpful. It's the place to stay for convience and value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location, within walking distance of all the theatres and restaurants. Clean and comfortable. Valet parking available. The hotel could use some refurbishment. Carpets, bathrooms looked worn. Friendly staff. A great value. When visiting to do the theatres or Time's Square we will be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was well-located near Times Square, and a very good value. There was wireless in the room and the breakfasts were fine. During peak times (check-in and check-out) the small, single elevator was inadequate for people and luggage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was very polished and professional for this type of hotel. The location was perfect for walking to Navy Pier(1 mile), shopping on Michigan Ave is right outside the door, and short taxi rides to The Shed Aquarium, The Field Museum, or great Greek restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Located beside of Willowbrook Mall and close to others major retailers like Walmart, Target, and others... A lot of restaurants just located within 5 minutes driving time. Staff are helpful and hotel was maintained in a good manner. Value for money for staying here.  [END]

[BEGIN] The staff were very helpful. The location was excellent, 2 min walk to trains station. Lots of good places to eat close by and you can walk to great shopping areas. The room was excellent, had everything i needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful mid-town location close to major shopping venues. Great lobby bar (Peacock Alley) and fun historical ambiance. Only two things kept me from awarding all 5 stars: very poor shower and inoperative stopper in bathtub; refusal of bellhops to help secure a taxi for trips shorter than airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there in Dec 2012 with kids, Very nice, with 2 bathrooms. Hotel staff was very nice and place was clean. They let us check in 2 hours early which was great. The hotel parking lot will also hold a full size Van. They will validate your parking also.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the first time I stayed at this Holiday Inn but would stay there again. The staff was very friendly and helpful, both in the hotel and restaurant. The restaurant had great pizza and a great bkfst buffet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there paid top dollar ....no amenities in room, recently upgraded bathrooms are strange at best....you take a shore in the middle of the bathroom water goes everywhere including on all the towels and walls...no hair dryer in bathroom of the suite.....wtf  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was great. It was near a lot of the things I wanted to see (Rockefeller Center, Time Square, lots of restaurants). The only thing I had to get used to was the really small rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] We travelled with our teenage daughter and needed a hotel room with space. The London NYC ticketed all the boxes. Spacious room, large bathroom, two t.v.s and perfect location to explore NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] We only stayed here one night, but we found the room to be clean and comfortable. The staff was excellent beginning to end. Not much to say other than this Four Points did exactly what we were looking for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are tiny like all other hotels in manhattan for this price range- but location is great and so is the feel. The rooms were clean and comfortable- perfect if you're not travelling with too much luggage.  [END]
[BEGIN] We may have been the only English-speaking guests when we stayed at the Standard. Of course, the views are amazing. The room decor is lovely, and the proximity to the West Village is a plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value hotel, great location, rooms could do with a refurb .. But over all good. I recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was very courteous. Great location for sightseeing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 6 nights on a "travelzoo' offer.......couldn't have asked for more ! The staff was very pleasant, the room was great.......but could use new carpeting & a new sofa in the near future. The location is very convenient for anything you want to do.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the W on Lexington for 12 nights! and I was very pleased with the hotel and staff! The rooms aren't big but clean and the location is central to everything, near park avenue and 5th avenue!  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent 2 nights at the Benjamin. Centrally located, very nice and clean room. Staff was very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice Hotel. I paid 150.00 Just a decent Hyatt. The rooms could use some remodling. The TV's are a joke. The are like 17" old junkers. I was kind of embarrassed for them. But overall a decent place, but Hyatt can do better.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Blakely was perfectly located between Central Park, Times Square and Fifth Avenue. Small and friendly staff - fairly large rooms, with baths not just showers. Breakfast was OK but unexciting. Wonderfully comfortable beds. We hope to return in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smaller than expected rooms, but we didn't spend too much time in the room. The staff was very helpful and courteous. The hotel was 3 blocks away from Time Square and 3 blocks away from Grand Central Station. Simple and worth every penny.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little pricey but sexy Midtown Hotel with chic lobby bar sure to impress tourists and locals, alike. Some rooms have fireplaces and soaking tubs. Excellent Midtown location. If you can stomach the room cost, definitely an impressive, hip New York City Hotel experience.  [END]

[BEGIN] une grande chabre et salle de bain + un debarras, bon hotel pour new york. chambre au 17 eme etage, peu de bruit. petit dejeuner tipiquement americain, assez peu convenable pour des francais. arriver tot dans la salle, sinon vous faites la queue  [END]

[BEGIN] This hotel has a great location right on Michigan Avenue. If you want to get to know the city you need a hotel with great location and this hotel has probably the best. The only bad thing of the hotel is the high price for WIFI about $14 a day.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room is very clean, a bit small but very well located near Time Square and one corner from subway. Breakfast included but small area. The only thing is the elevators are small And very long. But I still think it is a good deal. Iwould go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ein sehr gutes Hotel mit Pool der hervorragend war, allerdings keinen Bademantel und Schlappen im Zimmer oder am Pool und kein Hinweise darauf in der Hotel Beschreibung zu finden, das man beides mitbringen sollte. Hervorragende Lage, Service ebenfalls gut.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is perfect, but big risk to have bad room with noise from conditioning system. But this room can be changed, be strong )))  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was small but superb view. I also slept very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] After many trips to New York I have finally found the ideal hotel. Location could not be better, walking distance to Macy's, Fifth Ave, Rockerfeller Centre etc. Subway outside the main entrance, concierge service excellent. Good size rooms for New York. Good restaurant and bar, excellent breakfast. safe and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Hotel ist sehr zentral gelegen. Die Eingangshalle ist sehr freundlich, das Personal auch! Die Zimmer sind, wie oft in NY, eher klein und die Klimaanlage ist ein bisschen zu laut. Ansonsten ein sehr angenehmer Aufenthalt. Kritikpunkt: Internetzugang sollte bei einem 4-Sterne Hotel im Preis inbegriffen sein!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location in midtown, close to times square and central park. A no thrill hotel in NYC but the service is excellent and rooms are very big for NYC. Comfortable and clean!  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed New York during an overnight stay at Morgans on Madison Ave. Room was very nice, employees were attentive and cordial - especially Carmelo the doorman.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I stayed here in March. The location can't be beat! Convenient to just about everything. Everything was clean and comfortable. The shower is great. The staff is friendly and helpful. We'll be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stanze molto ampie e confortevoli. Ottima posizione a ridosso del palazzo delle Nazioni Unite e a pochi minuti dalle principali attrazioni cittadine.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is fantastic. The views are mindblowing. The staff are arrogant and snooty and the breakfast was some croissant with condiments. Stay here for the location, but for nothing else.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a very nice hotel. The room was nicer than the room at the Hilton Chicago. It was also cheaper and internet was free. It had a great location to get to the Navy Pier, a ton of restaurants, shopping, and clubs. I would definitely stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Would definitely recommmend the hotel for its locations and the panorama from the rooms. Front desk staff could be more helpful though!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic modern art deco hotel. Good location, helpful staff. Daily room service/ towels changed daily/very clean! Great location; fantastic Diner near by for breakfast, lovely chic Indian Restaurant on way to 5th Av, 'Mint'...overall a great, simple, no frills stay & reasonable prices for NYC!  [END]

[BEGIN] loved the size of the rooms, the staff, and the view! needs to be attended to a bit (stains on hallway carpet, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel ligt heel centraal. naast hotel ligt captains cafe, een goede gelegenheid om te ontbijten. Tegenover het hotel ligt het meer trendy Silo, ook een prima eetgelegenheid. Hotel heeft alles voor een stedentrip. Empire State building ligt om de hoek.  [END]
[BEGIN] I could not fault this hotel in any way. The location was fabulous and the breakfast was super. The roof top bar is great but I would prefer soft classical music playing instead of loud rock - just a small gripe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Contemporary hotel, helpful, kind staff. Very clean and comfortable. We stayed in a Jr. spa suite, plenty of space for 1 adult and 2 teens. Great location!  [END]
[BEGIN] De ligging van het hotel is erg gunstig, vlakbij central park. Even doorsteken en je bent bij het Guggenheim. Alle bezienswaardigheden zijn lopend te bereiken en dat is zeker aan te bevelen. Onderweg proef je de sfeer en ontmoet je vriendelijke New Yorkers. Restaurantjes in de buurt.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Casablanca is in a really covenient location and their amenities cannot be beat. Happy hour 5-8pm, wonderful wines, snacks. Breakfast in the morning. Wonderful ambience not often found in the City. Only 48 rooms, well appoined and comfortable. Great Service. Check it out  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff at this hotel are uniformly focused on great customer service. Our interactions with front desk staff, housekeeping, and maintenance were very positive. We have stayed here in the past and will continue to stay here when we are in the area. Across the street from Texas Medical Center.  [END]
[BEGIN] De kamers zijn groot en netjes. De ontbijtruimte is zeer klein. Van de (droge) bagels mag je zo veel nemen als je wilt en dan per persoon nog 2 pastry (daar moet je van houden ).Zelf had ik liever toast gehad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Hotel hat eine echt gute Lage mitten in Manhattan! Hatten ein ruhiges Zimmer mit Blick aufs Empire State Building. Das Personal war sehr freundlich und hilfsbereit. Preis und Leistung haben hier voll und ganz gestimmt. Kann das Hotel nur weiterempfehlen!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic stay - Great fun loving staff. Made you feel right at home from the first day. Being first time to NYC the staff's recomendations where right on the money. Rooms were comfortable with everything you need. Will be back for sure!!  [END]

[BEGIN] My experience was very quick, as I used this hotel to be close to airport for early departure. As a Diamond, I felt that the room was very clean, and comfortable. I would use this hotel again.....  [END]
[BEGIN] A stay at the Ace Hotel is refreshing. Not your typical hotel. Very cool amenities (lobby, restaurant, toiletries, etc.) LOVED the decor, small touches like the quotes in the bathroom. and the room was clean too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely nice management and staff under very difficult circumstances. Not a glamour location but nevertheless safe and convenient. Modern clean rooms - new TVs and free wi-fi. Good value for NYC. Free coffee in the lobby and hot cider in the p.m.  [END]
[BEGIN] ideale per chi ha poco tempo, centrale, posizione strategica per girare in lungo e in largo NYC  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel conveniently located across from O'hare. Rooms are clean and modern. Service is great. Seriously, excellent service. Fitness center is outstanding. $8.50 for a beer in lobby sports bar is ROUGH, but it is what it is... Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very nice. I like that it is close to downtown/ the Galleria and restaurants.... The room was very nice.....Will stay again when I return to Houston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here july 20 - 22 suite 2211 and couldn't have had a better view of ground zero. The hotel and our room was very clean.Many other things to do in the area .Wall street and the Hudson river are walking distance  [END]
[BEGIN] Small room, bad view, no breakfast, no minibar. Clean, good bed and sheets. Great location. Terrific breakfast just in steps nearby and great dinner in french vine bar Buvette at Groove st. Walking distance to Stomp show. <$10 taxi distance to Central Park. Limousine service to JFK $70 with tips.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel tiene un lobby muy amplio y comodo para realizar platicas de negocios comfortables. El mobiliario del cuarto se ve relativamente nuevo, lo cual resulta comodo. Tiene una laguna fuente en el lobby interesante y relajante. El bar esta solo "ok"  [END]

[BEGIN] A beautiful hotel with lovely reception areas and bars Rooms are small and simple but very comfortable Great location for exploring the city Bars very expensive in hotel but good atmosphere  [END]
[BEGIN] I was only here for one night and, when I checked out , I forgot an item in my room. The Director of Housekeeping went above and beyond to see that it was mailed to me at my home which is quite far from Houston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Modernes, sauberes Hotel in zentraler Lage. Klein, aber fein. Helle Zimmer mit grossen Fenstern bieten einen schoenen Ausblick! Einzig das Bett war etwas unbequem, weil die Matratze zu hart war. Relativ ruhig trotz (wenn auch nicht allzu) exponierter Lage. Empfehlenswert!  [END]
[BEGIN] Goed hotel, schone ruime kamers. Heel prettig is het keukenblokje met koelkast, magnetron en koffiezetapparaat. Je eet wel altijd buiten de deur, maar het is prettig wat koud water of melk op de kamer te hebben en 's ochtends een kopje koffie.  [END]
[BEGIN] An ageing beauty, the Waldorf summons images of a golden age, it is an experience in New York glam history as well as a conveniently located, comfortable and quirky place to stay. Take the history tour if you can get the timing right - so much fun!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is a great value for the perfect location. It's right by Times Square and central to most attractions. While it may not be as modern as some other hotels, it has a certain charm to it. No complaints about housekeeping and the whole staff was friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I spent a week of our honeymoon here. It was a superb location and since this hotel has been renovated it looks really well. Not dated like some previous posters had suggested. Rooms were a good size, quiet and very clean. Couldnt fault it in any way.  [END]
[BEGIN] The front desk staff and management are very friendly and helpful. Room was small but efficient and the bed was very comfortable. For one person the room was fine with a queen bed. If my wife was with me it would have been a little cosy.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want a hotel smack in the middle of times square this is it. They have a cool elevator your kids will love if you bring them. The service was good, our room was nice but as expected the price is well, high. Great local, good service, huge hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here overnight as a Route 66 start point. Room was spacious, clean and well equipped. Free internet was easy to connect to. Parking was a bit pricey at $41.00 per night. Located within walking distance of Millennium Park and Navy Pier etc. I'd happily stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have arrived NY for weekend shoping after business conference. This is a great location, everything just near by. Rooma are allright, nothing fancy yet clean and comfortable. Breakfast is kind of nice though I wish they change the disposable dishes and make more room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large rooms, comfortable beds and attentive service. What more could someone ask for in a hotel/ How about free (FREE) NY Times at your door each morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel, quiet considering its position and the staff were great. Would stay again - loved it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in a great location. Walking distance from great food and shop. The rooms are small NY like but tasteful and comfortable. The people at the front desk are amazing with special mention to the charming, patient and accommodating HELEN CHIANG!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location - friendly and capable staff. Recommended for a traveler seeking great value for $$$.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looking for a clean (no bedbugs), conveniently located in the heart of the theatre district, moderately-priced hotel with a great breakfast and friendly staff? Give the Belvedere a try!  [END]
[BEGIN] location is more like chinatown than it is soho, but nice hotel, rooms, and staff. if you get upgraded the suites are very spacious and nice, but you have to be a body builder to open and close the windows.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het Edison Hotel is perfect gelegen. De subway is bereikbaar binnen een paar minuten lopen. 5th Avenue (waar heel veel leuke winkels te vinden zijn) liggen op een steenworp afstand, evenals het Rockefeller gebouw. Zelfs het Central Park is binnen 20 te bereiken!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful hotel. Great bar/restaurant in lobby. Wonderful beds! Can't beat the price for the quality, location, etc! Can usually get a deal on priceline, etc. Don't miss the breakfast buffet in the morning, totally worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is a good stay. They have clean updated rooms with all amenities. There are fast food places within walking distance as well as a cracker barrel. The only downfall is limited parking. Located off i45 just north of beltway.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are very nice. Rooms with a great view to the south can be had at a reasonable price if you look for specials. There are plenty of other places to eat and drink. Park in the millenium park underground garages.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff very friendly and could answer some of the questions I had about the city, I liked my room, it felt newly renovated and was clean, a bit small but considering the price nice rooms in a good neighborhood. I can really recommend it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel with a great location. Very nice staff. Good value for money with clean rooms with internet included. Will stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Located a stone's throw from Macy's on one side, Union Square on the other, a comfortable hotel with a beautiful stylish design. The rooms are OK - though sound proofing is inexistent between the rooms... Breakfast is OK. Beds are comfortable. Nice toiletries. All in all a positive experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stay here many times and it is a hidden gem with a good central location in Manhattan. I used to live in Manhattan, so know of what I speak.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel w Starbucks and weber grill within the hotel. Friendly staff, clean rooms and super convenient to a lot of restaurants...pf changs, rain forest cafe, rock bottom brewery. We had a group rate of $169 and it was a bargain.  [END]
[BEGIN] BUON HOTEL,POSIZIONE CENTRALISSIMA,CAMERA PICCOLA MA MODERNA E PULITA. ASCENSORE SEMPRE OCCUPATO O FUORI SERVIZIO, MUSICA TROPPO ALTA FINO A TARDI DAL BAR AL PIANO TERRA, TRA L'ALTRO FREQUENTATISSIMO.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at On The Ave on my first trip to New York overnight. The rooms are trendy and very clean. Service is friendly. i would recommend this hotel to anyone I know..  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at the this hotel for three nights last week and were really impressed. For the money ($170 Hilton website) this hotel is a real value for its excellent location. The staff was consistently helpful and friendly. Excellent management.  [END]
[BEGIN] ik had een kamer op de club level. kamer was ruim en netjes met oa. magnetron, koffiezetapparaat, bankje, bureau. 1x (op zondag) was kamer niet schoongemaakt, de rest van de hotelservice was prima. In het restaurant beneden kan je prima eten. Hotel is gunstig gelegen midden in het centrum  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small but spotless. The location could not have been better, literally just minutes to Time Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very clean but the decor is dated. It is located at the north end of Michigan Ave, across the street from the John Hancock Building. The hotel staff was friendly, shower water pressure is very weak. It's a good location for the north side of the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there for a couple of nights with friends and really enjoyed it. The hotel is clean (newly renovated) and the staff is very friendly. If you are looking for a good location next to Times Square, its very convenient. Cheers,  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here April 2004. Okay ... let's be realistic. This is a 2 star Comfort Inn. So, it's doesn't have the biggest room or nicest lobby. However ... it was less than $100 a night and half a block from Times Square. You can't beat this kind of deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] My son, 5 years old when we stayed there, call it "our home in NY". The location is excellent. The mini-kitchenette is sufficient if we travel in a family with small children. It's a clean suite, comfortable, with enough space for a couple with a kid.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was nice and the price is right. Though it is in Tribeca, it is not in the heart of the neighborhood. But it is near a metro stop. Nearby Canal street is sketchy. But overall we would stay again for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel stands out in New York as "the top of the mid-range" -- you're not paying $600 night, but the service will at times may you feel as if you have. A great property in a great location -- I'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The property is located at a very convenient location in the Galleria area. The location is suitable for business and family trips. Very close to the Galleria Mall and restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were big compared to NYC usual size, staff was friendly and helpful. Location was very good, full of bars on 3rd and restaurants on Park Ave. Would definetly go back!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Swissotel is a mighty fine choice with a great location in downtown Chicago. Relatively large rooms that are clean and feature the basic amenities you expect. Definitely the typical four star experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really loved the modern design of the rooms, the attention to detail. Space was tight but it all worked, unless you travel with a ton of luggage...The shower and it's wide rain shower head was wonderful, and I had my best night of sleep in a long time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Compact Rooms, do go swinging the cat, but they are well laid out and very clean. Staff was helpful and the breakfast was a bargain. Easy walk to Broad way and all easy access to subway. Would definitely stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff were very friendly and helpful, the terrace and free coffee were so relaxing in the morning and evening. Clean rooms and really great area!  [END]
[BEGIN] The room and bathroom was very small... otherwise it was perfect!  [END]
[BEGIN] Subway stop right in front of building, place is clean and close to Lincoln Park and River North - good location in Gold Coast. Convenient Supermarket right across street with deli counter. Lots of restaurants of all prices in walking distance. Rush street also nearby.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location - you pay for what you get. Basic rooms, basic hotel - cheap & cheerful with lovely staff. Would stay again for a short city break. Great places to eat next door too for brunch.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great hotel just perfect for the excitement of New Year at Times Square. Very comfortable room with good view, tried room service breakfast on two days and it was great - just perfect for a relaxing start to a busy day of sightseeing. Woiuld definitely return again!! Can't wait.  [END]
[BEGIN] Starbucks across the street, good central location, fantastic breakfast/lunch place (really surprising dishes) that is great for business meetings. There is a ridiculously loud jackhammer starting at 7 am as of the time of this review though so beware.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location at 48th and Lexington can't be beat and is convenient to the theater, museums and Grand Central. The bed was comfortable and the room was quite spacious, especially by NYC standards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, clean room; very comfortable bed; top floor balcony was a pleasant extra (we read the Sunday newspapers in piece and quite while sitting outside in the middle of Manhattan). Of note, very helpful staff member Dennis Krupp. We would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location, good breakfast. Nice room..It's not expensive. I'll go back.A tip :ask for the highest floors because of the street noise. Only one drawback: in the back rooms only one elevator...  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfy beds, new and clean rooms. One problem: couldn't plug tub for bath. Best: dining room hostess very kind and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went with the family. Perfect location ifor children and grandchildren. Rooms were spacious and staff was friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Within walking distance to Times Square. Comfortable bed and good price. The only thing is the valet parking is very expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quiet and clean. Good breakfast Room very dark because any view from the room  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Location 1.5 blocks from time square. Clean rooms but a bit small. good value and breakfast was well done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome property. Staff was great. Rooms were clean and large for NYC standards. Will return to this hotel. The R Lounge where Gold and Plat Elites have breakfast was awesome. great Views of Times Square  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, and the service was outstanding, except for the maid. There was mildew in the shower, and the sink didn't drain properly. Charging extra for WiFI is so 1990s. On the plus side we were near everything you could ever want: great coffee, several subway lines, bakeries, and shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay here generally once a year as part of a meeting. Rooms are good size, staff friendly and helpful. Great location for the heart of Chicago. To me, the exercise facilities are not up to the level of the rest of the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is clean and rooms are large. Connecting rooms don't do a good job of insulating noise from neighbor through the door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service at this hotel and within a few minutes of time square, just incredibly an small room (which was on the 2nd floor so the view was dreadful!). Very clean, modern and trendy place to stay and a great little bar!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very glad we stayed here. The hotel was in a great location. The rooms were clean and modern. Yes, they were small but that didn't bother us at all. We spent the day sight seeing, and this hotel was a nice place to come back to at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, I felt this was a great deal. I got a clean, comfortable room in NY without spending what it cost me to fly there from CA. Recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] checked our friends into this hotel and they loved it. small but everying you need whilst in NYC. PAX deli on the corner and within walking distance of the majority of the attractions. will definately return to in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Madison is a nice small hotel. THAT IS; IF YOU BOOK ONE OF THE NEWLY RENOVATED MODERN DESIGNED ROOMS. The bar is boring. GREAT location, friendly staff, nice room, GREAT bahtroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was very nice and the location was execellent. The room was quiet and the help was nice when we had a question. I would definitely go back there again  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to really enjoy the hotel be aware of not receivieng a room with courtyard view. It"s noisy and it:s only a wall. The location is the best  [END]
[BEGIN] It was my first time in New York. The staff at the Affinia Gardens gave wonderful directions, insight to the city. The hotel was very central, easy to come back to and as quiet as it can get in the middle of all the action. Lisa  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location town locks from Penn Station. Very cosmopolitan feel. Nice rooms and amenities. Good room service and restaurant. Join the Kimpton Club for free before your trip and get free Internet and a gift certificate for the well stocked minibar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Other than not having free wireless access in room I can't think of any negatives to this hotel. We stayed there one night as members of a tour group that was redirected because of flooding over Amtrak tracks. The restaurant offerings were very good although a bit pricey.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Hotel connects to Grand Central Station. Terrific Bar & Restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect location and fair price. Room is not very big, but nice bath. Only the A/C was a bit loud and you couldn't open the window, but I allways will recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] We always stay in this hotel every year. The rooms are a bit small but the price is good for the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent value, nice accomodations, clean, loved the new mattress and bed linens. I would definitely stay there again and I am very picky. Free breakfast, with juice, coffee, nice tables by the pool for relaxing, no charge for parking, free internet.....good job Hampton!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel's location and service are both excellent. My husband was surprised when the lady who took care of our room called him by his first name. The room is pretty average, but good enough for what we needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are spacious, for NYC, and the lobby elegant. Nicely appointed rooms, and competent service. Highly recommend it for families travelling together.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really liked the location and the room. It s not classy but just fine. Clean and Simply decorated. Rates was okay but lobby isnt good enougha which i dont mind :) i didnt spend time in the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is brilliant value for money considering the location. The rooms are pretty basic but clean and although we wouldn't normally be happy to share a bathroom, they're also clean and it's never a problem finding a free one.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed at the chelsea inn because it was a short notice trip and the $was right. first time i stayed non-midtown. great location, near city bakery, farmers market at union square and shake shack, and the villages. very clean and quiet. would stay and i do hope to there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] es un hotel muy limpio pero es muy incomodo la habitacion super incomoda para lo costoso que es no lo recomiendo pra una fanilia y digo familia cuando viajes con un bebe no tiene microhondas no tiene cafetera nisikiera en el lobbin no me volveria a quedar nunca mas alli.  [END]

[BEGIN] Stayed at this hotel in march over spring break with my daughter. Excellent location.. Spacious room and nice lobby. I recommend it because it is really centered and you can walk anywhere  [END]
[BEGIN] The best location. Simple. Clean. Good hospitality. Very good for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Somehow I got this room for $109, which I think is a great price for this area. I have really no complaints, everyone was friendly and helpful. Yes, no pool, get charged for wifi (but wasn't added to my bill for some reason), but such a great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice hotel just off Time's Square. The rooms were a little larger than average NYC rooms and still new. I will definitely return to this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] ...with beautifully furnished rooms and a comfortable bed. No high speed internet access however. The location is ideal for downtown business and is within walking distance to many of the skyscrapers.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for four days, three nights and found all the staff cheerful as well as helpful. The room was clean but as reported before the bathrooms have no ventilation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, in great location. Adjacent to Waldorf. Hotel was not as clean and updated as I hoped. Spa is mediocre but most spots in NYC are likely limited on space.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just visited NY with a bus trip. Stayed at the Staybridge. The service, complimentery breakfast was great. The hotel was immaculate; I would stay their again!! Two of the hotels employees, Jaimie and Sunny, were warm and friendly. They were an asset to the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was searching for a "deal" and found a reasonably priced hotel just half a block off Time Square. Nice, clean rooms, but most of all a great location! Good breakfast in hotel restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was nice and clean. It was about a 15 minute walk from Times Square and the Broadway shows. Service was spotty. After shows, walking home was easy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy bien ubicado en pleno Manhattan pero en una zona tranquila  [END]
[BEGIN] Within walking distance of all main attractions. Try Mary's Cafe for breakfast not West Egg that the hotel staff recommend. Staff were extremely helpful with all enquiries. Only small criticism would be the size of the bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was clean and comfortable. Great service and excellent food. A great place to stay in Houston. You have to take a morning walk in the park nearby!  [END]
[BEGIN] Esta muy bien ubicado,a pasos de la central station,a pasos de la 5ta avda.,todo cerca,.Coincido que el personal no es muy atento,pero correctos y eficientes,se duerme estupendamente bien,muy confortables las habitaciones.Volveria a ir,relacion precio calidad buenisima.  [END]

[BEGIN] We had a very fine stay at the Lucerne. Adjoining Nice Matin restaurant was fine as well. A number of other good restaurants in the area as well. The surrounding area (the Upper West Side) is a particularly fine one for strolling, shopping and dining.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottima posizione, in una zona abbastanza tranquilla, ma vicina a 2 stazioni della metro, a central park e al museo di storia naturale. aria condizionata ben funzionante, camera e bagno sufficientemente spaziosi e puliti per essere a ny, altra cosa positiva: niente moquette sul pavimento della camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Three friends stayed two nights at hotel and we pay a really good proce for the excelent service received. clean rooms, cool people, good a/c i recomend this hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Special request met lightning fast. Bed reasonably comfortable however the A/C didn't seem to work well overnight, I think they have it on a motion sensor so kept waking up due to the temp. Overall good value for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] First trip to NY but for what we needed the Newton did the trick. Rooms are clean and its close to the subway which we used (bought a week pass) throughout our stay. Room comes with microwave and good size bar fridge.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here a couple of days ago and we had a great time. The staff at the front desk was very helpful, they helped me print my boarding pass and even maps of nearby restaurants. The rooms were clean and adequate. I will definetly be back  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect location in NYC. Great condition to travel with pet. Free wi-fi for SPG guests huge +  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly and attentive staff. Good and ample breakfast.  [END]

[BEGIN] Was clean and good service. Great position to see everything  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was very good. The hotel was clean and the room was comfortable. Location is a bit far from the convention center. The breakfast buffet was good lots of choices. The fitness center is a joke. They need to update the equipment. If that is important don't stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has an excellent location. I stayed in a single and it was tiny, but other than that it exceeded my expectations. Bathrooms were usually clean and dry. Very friendly staff. No bugs, no dust, and air conditioning worked fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Larger & Comfortable Rooms with luxurious furnishing. The hotel has a small pool one can go to for cooling off. However, the hotel has nothing much to offer by way of food and you may have to go out to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Metro Hotel is a well priced hotel situated in a very good location. Macy's, Times Square and the Empire State building are all very close and the staff are fantastic. definately recommend staying there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very efficient and well located hotel. Rooms are comfortable and quiet. Nice pool. Norma's Restaurant has the best breakfast anywhere. Good hotel for casual or business visitor  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything that you've come to expect from the Hilton chain. Decent sized rooms for New York City. Ask for something away from the elevator as it can get noisy. Can't beat where this hotel is situated, walking distance to all the sights and subways  [END]
[BEGIN] planned last minute-as usual--got a hotwire deal--flew into JFK and took the Air train and E-line to 53rd and 7th--right at the hotel door stop--perfect! great location and helpful staff--rooms very quiet/comfy---first time seeing the Rockettes!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Mansfield is charming and full of character. The rooms are small, but for a couple just in town to explore the city for a weekend, it was perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, close to everything! The rooms were large and we stayed in one with a kitchenette which was handy and hard to find in NYC. I really enjoyed the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to nice diners and pubs! If we come back to New York, which we hope, we will stay at the Paramount Hotel. And not to forget - Brian - New York Citys friendliest doorman!! Greetings from Kerstin from Sweden.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed my two night stay at this hotel due to the location. The rooms are a bit small but very nice. I will definitely come back to this hotel next time I am in town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bottom line, the price for the service is outstanding. Free Continental breakfast, free wireless, and I had a fabulous view of the Empire State building...convenient to uptown or downtown...it ain't the Ritz but dollar for dollar this is the best deal in town.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1 perfectly adequate night in this hotel. Comfortable if a little tired looking. Friendly staff that helps with local eateries etc. Room very small, but not sure you can expect more in the heart of Manhattan for the price. Good sleep - quite room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good hotel with a very, very friendly staff that makes you few like home. Very good location, a few steps from Time Square. The breakfast is included but could be better.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed here on more than 10 occasions for business and this is a very nice hotel. It is only about a block from Times Square which is nice. The rooms are typical Westin and relatively clean. Service is as expected as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to stay and, located at 2 Times Square, right in the heart, you can't have a better location.  [END]
[BEGIN] A good hotel, with Manhattan prices, confortable. Near Empire State Building. Nice restaurant, nice staff! I would come back...  [END]

[BEGIN] I stayed here for a business meeting and the hotel was in a great central location. The room was modern and very spacious. The lobby was a little chaotic but the rooftop pool more than made up for it! Great views!  [END]
[BEGIN] great hotel in NYC for all kind of people, great staff and very good rooms...  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for one night on a layover in Houston. It is a good, clean standard budget hotel but the service from the staff was outstanding. Everyone there went out of their way to make it an enjoyable stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] would definitely stay here again - the only downside was the long wait for the elevators.  [END]
[BEGIN] Older hotel with small bathrooms but flat screen tv's and a good staff. Bartender was a snott.  [END]
[BEGIN] Die Lage ist Top. Direkt am Broadway unweit des Time Square. Fruehstueck ist gut bis sehr gut. Die Zimmer sind Standard. Der Service ist auch gut. Preis/Leistungsverhaeltnis ist top. Wuerde ich auf jeden Fall wieder machen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel 17 is wat je verwacht van een eenvoudig hotel: prima locatie, leuke buurt, simpele maar schone kamers, badkamer op de gang. Vergeet niet iedere dag een label aan de deur te hangen met het verzoek aan het kamermeisje om je kamer te doen, anders gebeurt het niet!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel. Perfect location in NYC. Clean, nice employees. Upgraded us to a suite because it was our anniversary.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to stay with a family...Denise the manager is really great to work with.  [END]

[END]
[BEGIN] The Carlton is a great hotel. The building is near the end of the remodeling process and is nice and clean and new. The rooms are big by NYC standards and normal size by standards everywhere else. The room was clean, especially the bathroom, where everything was new and shiny.  [END]
[BEGIN] Warkwick hotel is very well located facing MOMA and madison and most interesting shopping areas. The service is excellent, the concierge extremely helpful and the rooms quite large and comfortable.  [END]

[BEGIN] My daughter and I had to stay in the Wolcott while renovations were done to our apt. The rroom was great and the staff was hospitable, highy recommend for anyone  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely appointed rooms, good location, good security, VERY resaonable Manhattan parking. Near food shopping and not far from kosher restaurants. I would stay there again without a doubt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Helpful staff. Small but very tidy and quiet room. Great location right near the subway, Central Park, and Museum of Natural History.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel staff very helpful and friendl. y Rooms very clean -although a bit small they have all the basic amenities incl. coffee, fridge and even a microwave.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Westin Chicago River North is right across from the House of Blues and Harry Caray's. Its walking distance from the Clark/Lake stop on the Blue Line to / from the airport. The service is very good as are the amenities.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, the suite was small so I suspect standard rooms would be tiny. Bed was incredibly comfy which compensated for the usual din of the city. Great bar for people watching but the literary greats and Mrs Parker's circle are long gone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: clean, modern, location, bed, bath, terrace, top lounge, sliders Cons: paid wifi, small room, somehow dark. Highly recommended both for family or couple travel. Maybe not ideal for families.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, with small but very well furnished rooms, clean and with a very good cost/benefit ratio!!! Interesting location, with a metro station exit right on the front door!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is perfect and the hotel is easy to locate. The staff was friendly and efficient. The rooms are equipped with laptop computers on each desk. The beds are wonderfully comfortable and the rain shower is luxurious. Overall this hotel is an excellent place to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location, location, location--we found this property to be very convenient to the subway. Both the bell staff and concierge were helpful with dining recommendations and attractions  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice room, easy location. They didn't keep their promise to upgrade my room due to unavailability but the hotel itself is nice. You have to pay extra for the internet in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great views and spacious rooms! Beautiful hotel right in the heart of the loop. A little far from the heart of Michigan Ave.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a classic old club, complete with the weekdays dress code (no denim!). The meeting and dining rooms were exquisite but our bedroom was a bit on the not-updated side.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel di tendenza con una hall magnifica ! Gli ambienti comuni sono veramente molto belli ma attenzione pero'......le camere sono veramente piccole e non sono insonarizzate, percio' il rumore dei motori dell'aria condizionata fa la sua parte. Molto frequentato con un continuo via e vai di gente.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel met all of my needs for a 2 night stay with 3 Grandchildren. We walked to the Field Museum, Aquarium and to Millenium Park, hotel also provides a free shuttle one way to several major attractions. Great pool and very comfortable rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] it was clean having nearby ice and soda machine made it better only thing that wasn't so great was the air conditioning was stuffy and warm in the room,  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed here a couple of times for conferences. The rooms are good, especially the executive rooms with the option of breakfast overlooking the lake. What a treat. Service good, staff pleasant and you can easily walk down to the magnificent mile shops  [END]
[BEGIN] Como todos los hoteles de esta cadena incluye desayuno muy completo, algo muy importante para mi sobre todo en New York. Muy bien ubicado y a un precio muy accesible para lo que es Manhattan. Lo recomiendo.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is amazing, in the middle of Times Square and the everyone is very nice and helpful - a special mention to Fred who helped us with a check-in and is a great soccer fan.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is definetely an old hotel. Thin walls, a bit shabby. However everything was clean, service was good, and location across the street from grant park cannot be beat!  [END]
[BEGIN] ottima posizione in pieno centro vicino time square. discreto bar per colazioni e camere normali ma ottima posizione  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at Hotel 373 over Dec 3-4 weekend which was BUSY in NYC. The location was great - right on 5th Avenue - and easy walking distance to everything in mid-town. Did not find it noisy at all. Clean rooms, nice staff - would definitely stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] very good hotel in the full center of manhattan and midtown. central. just a regret = personnal is not sympatical.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the Park Central for 2 nights. The rooms were very nice, the staff was friendly, the location was great.....my only criticism is that there was no pool......A good tip: Check in early to avoid long lines!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Alex was great. Nice, modern design ad really quiet considering it's in midtown. The hotel is very convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed one night and had a nice time. Staff was friendly and helpfull. Food at the Italiasia was great. Getting to the parking is tricky it is combined with the Chicago Sun Times building and you need to follow there parking signage.  [END]
[BEGIN] No problems with this hotel. Close to everything in Central NYC location. Not sure if the price is justified, but lodging in this city is expensive. Hotel staff was pleasant and professional. I'd will stay here in the future, if possible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eccellente hotel per servizi,comfort della stanza e pulizia. Hotel di design con arredamento di sicuro pregio e ricercatezza. Situato nella zona nei pressi del Greenwich village vicino alla metro e a buonissimi ristoranti. Zona tranquilla lontana dalla zona eccessivamente turistica di Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in an area I was not too familiar with but I needn't have worried, it's ideally situated for most attractions and yet far enough away from the Times Square area. Super large room, tastefully decorated and clean. The restaurant offers a very good buffet breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] What impressed us most was the amazing atompshere of the lobby. The cool music and slick furniture gives the place a lot of energy. Also, our wonderful room overlooking the city was fantastic, and the staff made us feel like A-List celebrities!  [END]
[BEGIN] Park view tower room views are the best of NYC hotels, but rooms (especially bathrooms) are tiny even by NYC standards. Take some room design Inspiration from le meridian Philadelphia or others. Bar was great, lobby and other common areas: thumbs up. Good service - bell, door, getting cabs, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were very pleased with this hotel. Very convenient location, helpful staff, very comfy and accommodating restaurant. The lobby and check in area are very small but the rooms were a nice size. Our room was clean and nicely appointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hyatt Regency is a fairly generic hotel, with very little character. But in terms of the basics needed for business travel, it is a good choice: Comfortable rooms, pretty good restaurant, and a good and helpful staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've found that this hotel has an extremely good location (1 minute or less to the subway), near times square (which was a good position for the new year's eve). The bathrooms are small, but, c'mon...it's new york..the less you stay in hotel, the better....^_^ extremely good service. Recommended!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good hotel, great location, very close to Madison Square Garden. Staff polite and always helpful. Breakfast could be more varied.  [END]
[BEGIN] sejour tres agreable car idealement situe: pres de restaurants et surtout de la ligne pricipale de metro... et aussi de Central Park ! Donc je le recommande: chambre agreable, service tres correcte, peu de bruit(prende une chambre luxe pour avoir les etages superieurs).  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel in great location. Rooms are a bit tired and on the smallish side. No in-house gym. Great staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here because of a work trip. Excellent location - small room but to be expected in NYC. Not much of a view from my room, but since i wasn't facing the street, it was fairly quiet at night. Free wifi in lounge and bar/restaurant only.  [END]
[BEGIN] First important parameter for a hotel in NY is location. Flatotel was perfectly located. Rooms were spacy and clean. The View from the 46th floor was magnificent  [END]
[BEGIN] Location favorevolissima a due passi da tutto; personale cordiale e disponibile a cui rivolgersi con fiducia. Camere spaziose anche se la manutenzione generale potrebbe essere migliorata (filtri dei condizionatori sporchi e ripostigli non proprio pulitissimi). Comunque soluzione ideale per un soggiorno di media durata e godersi NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] The big rooms are quiet even with its proximity to the airport. Our parking was free. Nice breakfast buffet. All lunch and dinner meals are in the pub/grill so you cannot avoid TV screens. Rather than a reservation desk, there are several small "stations" around which are a little confusing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottima posizione,vicino alla metro e alla Central Station. Buona la pulizia. Ottima la colazione. Tutto ok................  [END]
[BEGIN] Check in/out was a breeze, room was clean, Hotel staff were friendly, great location, themed,unique and stylish,local transportation not a problem, relaxing nightlife enviornment, hotel its self is a eyepleaser.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice updated rooms. Walking distance to Central Park, Times Square, & Rockefellar Center. Very Busy Lobby. PARKING~ $45 EVERY 24 HR.....eg. late checkout: gets then charged by the hour which gets expensive....but it is New York. Overall, would recommend it!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was very nice and very artsy! We stayed in a 2 bedroom room. It was a wonderful stay - beds were very comfortable. The shower was wonderful with 5 shower heads! Would definitely stay here again. The location was magnificent as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great 5 night stay as a family. Service was good although drinks and minibar is pricey as you would guess. Rooms are perhaps a little tired compared to much newer hotels but the character of the hotel prevails and you can't help loving the place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel. We've been here for only 6 days but we appreciated the kindness of the staff, the breakfast (only the first day, 1st of january) the brownies were not so good, clean room and good to have a little fridge and a great TV  [END]
[BEGIN] The Wellington Hotel itself was not very special: room was small (but not too small); bathroom simple and clean. The location however is great: 300 ft from Central Park and next to metrostation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but practica rooms. Agree, a door to the bathroom would be a plus. Walls rather thin... can hear your neighbor...Staff very helpful. Quality of bedding and linnens very good. Clean room Great location. Would strongly recomend more security in every floor at all times!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Hotel experience. Great restaurant. Small exercise pool that families think is a recreational pool with jumping/diving and screaming kids. Room was pretty good and wifi excellent. Breakfast was very good too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel with great restaurant chef. I don't usually like hotel food, but out dinner was excellent. Service inconsistent--great front desk, bad doormen, terrible wait staff, good housekeeping. Nice bar with friendly bartender. Pool is OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right on the park, very clean and comfortable. Rooms are really small but one wouldn't spend a lot of time indoors in NY city, I assume! Friendly staff, great location, good price for a hotel so centrally located. Wifi was not free - only downside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location for seeing Broadway Shows and really nice restaurants - all in walking distance of hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Preis-Leistung ok. Spezial Angebote.....over 5 Days....  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the hotel in late December 2011 and was very pleased with the experience. Well-kept, clean and GREAT LOCATION!! Only one negative - WiFi was intermittent at best. Overall, highly recommended when staying in Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved this hotel. I went last winter to see the tree and shop. It was in walking distance to everything. The rooms where very clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I had a wonderful stay at this hotel, our room was great and the view was fabulous. Everyone was so helpful in helping us plan our days and giving advice on where to eat, we were not dissappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het NewYorker hotel ligt midden in Manhattan,veel bezienswaardigheden zijn op loopafstand te doen (bv empirestatebuilding). Mooie hotelkamer, niet groot maar ook niet nodig als je in deze bruisende stad bent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel. Convenient for the business traveler on a budget. Clean and modern. No frills but what you get is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Holiday Inn is a good choice for location in Chicago. The front rooms have a beautiful view of the city centre and Chicago River. Rooms are very comfortable, clean and other luxuries provided.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for two nights in Feb 2012. Very comfortable rooms and the staff very helpful also. Ideal location as it is walking distance from all the big named shops. We would stay again, defiantly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Neighborhood is ok, rooms are good sized by Manhattan standards, noise from ice machine, doors and street can be a bit much. Staff and cleanliness are excellent, which I greatly appreciated!  [END]
[BEGIN] Wat een locatie! Tegenover Carnegie Hall, tien blokken van Times Square en slechts twee blokken van Central Park. Een heerlijk plek. Het personeel is heel aardig. Het interieur kan zeker een modernisering gebruiken, maar alles is schoon. Ruime kamers. En tegenwoordig ook een continentaal ontbijt voor 4 dollar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed many times and some standards seem to be slipping. Pool area was dirty, wi fi was terrible in the room, elevators needed vacuumed out. Other than that, still an outstanding hotel to stay in, highly recommended. The staff are brilliant!  [END]
[BEGIN] Free Parking! Located right across from a police station! Two blocks away from the subway, one block away from Times Square. Wonderful deli downstairs/next door. Rooms are average and worth the price. Pleasant staff. It's a wonderful value and we WILL return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice stay, with no issues to report. Great location for midtown sight seeing etc, great value. We walked back from Columbus circle with the parade still in full swing and from the in-laws room we could see some of the parade. That was a nice bonus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was surprised to find such a newly renovated hotel and an extremely friendly staff. The 8th Floor Concierge Club is one of the nicer club floors in the Marriott system with plenty of space, helpful staff, free internet access and above average food offerings with honor bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel and fantastic location. Highly recommended. Thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice hotel with confortable room, very clean. All it's perfect. Perfect position to visit Lower Manhattan, Brookling, Ellis Island, Liberty Island. It's a pity Chinatown, dirty and smelly, is just around the corner, between Soho and the Financial District.  [END]
[BEGIN] Centraal gelegen hotel, in een rustige straat, zeer goede ligging om te voet stad te verkennen. Kamer voor 2 +2 kinderen is wat aan de kleine kant, bedden zijn nieuw, moderne, schone badkamer. Ontbijtzaal te klein voor aantal gasten, ontbijt weinig variatie, maar werd continu aangevuld.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel with well trained staff. But the beds are most uncomfortable! Get a room on the lakeside, the view from the higher floors is wonderful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good design, great big bathtub with a view, pleasant work table with window that opens, literally, onto the city. Feels more like an apartment. Nice walking neighborhood, very friendly vibe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our son convinced us to join a frequent stayer program and so we picked Choice Hotels which is a good mid-range bet. The staff here are excellent and very helpful. Rooms are big and the bed was good. This hotel also offers a great bang for the buck. Recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you to Angie and Earl Adams for accommodating my request. I'm looking forward to my first Chicago trip and Ramada Inn stay. will send another review after my vacation Sincererly, Ellyn  [END]
[BEGIN] My company stayed there for a tradeshow and this hotel really had much bigger rooms then many others in NY. We really liked it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Salisbury very centrally located (Central Park 5 minutes, Rockefeller Center 10 minutes, Lincoln Center 15 minutes), my room was really two rooms, with a lounge and kitchenette, clean, friendly staff, only the furniture has seen better days...  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed at the NY Hilton for 1 night Jan 5th. was upgraded to a renovated room, with flat screen TV. Very modern looking, almost like a room at a 'W' Hotel....  [END]
[BEGIN] The Park Savoy is not for the rich, the famous, or the stuffy. It is a simple place in a great location. Enjoy the complexity of New York in the day and the evening; sleep simply and comfortably at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Hotel for convenience if looking to be right in Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice stay, 10 minutes to Metro. 20 minutes walk to Museum Metropolitan of Arts( central Park). The room is very big and normally the room in NYC is very small. Supermarket\Deli\Pizza only 2 minutes walk. Very nice place and you feel you just stay in this city not a tourist.  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved this hotel, the style, the zone, upper east side of manhathan, loved it. I stay there for just 2 days, at the studio, in 2010. =)  [END]
[BEGIN] Won bid for $115 /night on Priceline - Room was very nice & quite roomy - Bed was so comfortable - Location was great!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Courtyard is far and away better than the one on West University- clean, modern, professional staff and all amenities. Close to mall and restauarants. i will be back I'm sure as my company got a great corporate rate here. No complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, nice rooms, friendly and helpful staff. I and several parties had to change rooms because of random banging sound at all hours. No logical explanation other than banging pipes in the walls.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is a standard courtyard offering. Standard clean rooms and friendly service. The location is great, within a walking distance to Soho attractions and stores. Good restaurants nearby that concierge can help you with. A reasonable cab ride from Pennsylvania Station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unbelievable location at Bowery and Grand. Close to Little Italy and Chinatown. Minutes away from Williamsburg. Clean rooms, friendly staff and very good free breakfast. brekfast ara could be a little bigger. Gets very congested.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a nice stay in this beautifully furnished boutique hotel. The staff at Ameritania were really lovely. Delicious breakfast. The standard room is a little small but well equipped with a bed wonderful. Location is excellent, in the Broadway x 54 street.  [END]
[BEGIN] E' l'albergo giusto per una coppia giovane in viaggio per piacere! 1- posizione strategica anche per una corsetta mattutina a central park 2- personale cortese e disponibile 3- buon club serale 4- stanze pulite (vero sono un po' piccole)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, very convenient to Penn Station (Amtrak) and and the subway. Hearty and good tasting breakfast included. Rooms are comfortable, but my particular room had a loud humming/vibration sound that made sleep difficult.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room had a peak view of Central Park, which was nice. In the morning, we got up and took a stroll through the park... can't beat the location. The room was clean and modern, we had a wonderful stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel staff friendly and helpful, great rooms and the beds fantastic you get a great nights sleep, couldn't ask for a better location and amenities well its all there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comme souvent, les hotels de NY offrent des surprises..... comme le fait payer le wifi alors que les chambres sont a 600 $ ! Dire qu en bas de la rue a Time Square il est gratuit. A quand faire payer l eau chaude?  [END]
[BEGIN] Great view of the bay and well kept rooms. Updated lobby area looks great. The only complaints are "forgetful" service and very cramp bathroom lay-out. The bar and restaurant are convienent but very expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] convenient location, nice staff. Clean room, good breakfast. Con: the rooms facing the highway are noisy at night. We asked the front desk to give us another room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for four nights from the 29th Nov until the 3rd Dec. Very well situated, rooms clean esp bathrooms. Free tea and coffee available all day and a free New York Times delivered to your door every morning are a nice touch. Staff helpful. Would recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was in a great location- close to 2 subway stations and Central Park, and the staff was extremely friendly. Some previous reviews mentioned bed bugs, but our stay was bed bug free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prefect hotel in central Manhattan, NY. Including lovely breakfast a lively atmosphere and walking distance into NY. I will go there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for three nights. The location was very good, being right next to Grand Central. Rooms have these great 'touch' light switches which make it easy to get find after a late night. Beds were very comfortable. Truly a first class hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is perfectly located for all of Manhattan, easy access to all the sights and ideal for shopping and shows. Breakfast was good, as were the staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a good hotel and it is with in your price range as its not as much high end or low end Its a clean hotel staff is good rooms are fine. its near to times square but you have to walk 15-20 min for that  [END]
[BEGIN] What a stay: stylish design, peaceful and elegant room, good location, helpful staff - wonderful! We highly recommend the Asia de Cuba restaurant too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely good value hotel in downtown Manhattan, very conveniently placed for seeing everything. Be warned the rooms are tiny and there are no coffee or tea making facilities. It does have its own breakfast and dinner places which are very convenient. Staff friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently stayed here for a business conference. No complaints other than the restaurant at the hotel was overpriced. The place was clean and the staff were professional. It is conveniently located. A little expensive but it's NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] buon posto, personale cordiale, silenzioso. peccato avere avuto una stanza (abbiamo chiesto con il bagno in comune) che non avesse finestre sulla strada ma su un uno spazio chiuso. Cmq lo consiglierei, anche per la zona, vicina alla subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the few hotels in the city that has good size rooms. The hotel is pretty good with good customer service and decent food. The location is good with everything you need in walking distance. Room service is only available for dinner and breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really enjoyed the hotel - it was a central location and not too expensive. We were upgraded to a suite at checkin - the room was HUGE. Comfortable bed. Small bathroom. Cool bar in the lobby. Not the fanciest, but it was fine. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice hotel, not cheap, but the views are mainly to the river there are better located hotels this one is close to the Millenium park  [END]
[BEGIN] The Sanctuary was a good fit, nice clean hotel in good location for all we were looking for. we would stay there again, did enjoy the roof top Haven as well, staff was very helpful, and breakfast was a nice added touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] We loved the location of the Manhattan ... right on 7th Ave with a view of Times Sq from the front door. The hotel itself is a quality product with good clean rooms, beds, and LCD TVs. Great indoor heated pool. Wish it had free internet though.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed for one night - had an amazing time. it was an anniversary. rooms were clean and beautiful, and the staff was absolutely helpful would definitly recommend you stay here if coming to NY!  [END]

[BEGIN] Groot hotel midden in Manhattan tegenover het Maddison Square Garden en Pennstation, wat prima gebruikt kan worden als startpunt voor het bezoek aan New-York. De kamers hebben een zeer oud sanitair, wat een minpunt is voor dit hotel.  [END]

[BEGIN] ottimo migliore location possibile a 5 minuti da Times square e la quinta strada;ottima colazione alla carta, camere grandi con letti comodi, il personale molto disponibile e gentile dovunque. Lo consiglio vivamente  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima hotel, perfecte locatie, erg aardige hulpvaardig personeel. Kamer was iets aan de kleine kant en aan de achterzijde van het hotel gelegen Was echter modern ingericht en van alle gemakken voorzien. Aanrader is het dakterras met prachtig uitzicht op het empire state building.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hilton is a reasonable priced hotel among other hiltons in New york. Lot of rooms. The executive lounge is an excellent one with lot of room, food and drinks. The beds are comfortable and cozy. The towels are not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like all NYC hotels, the room was small. But very modern, well decorated and appointed, very convenient to subway, soho, and downtown locations. The club lounge was terrific for free breakfast and drinks. Nice lobby with free internet. Great value and really nice choice for downtown NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Houstonian remains a top Houston hotel and property. The concierge level is excellent. the rooms are comfortable, but not very large. The exercise area, pool, and spa are also excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tal y como dice su publicidad, lo encontramos en el "heart of Chicago". Cerca de todo.... Lo encontramos muy bien de precio y tanto el trato como las instalaciones, geniales. Repetiremos cuando volvamos a esta maravilla de ciudad.  [END]
[BEGIN] kaum einen Katzensprung von ground Zero entfernt hat Anfang 2010 dieses Hotel geoeffnet. Preise waren in Ordnung. Zimmer auf dem neuesten Stand und sehr sauber. Es gab sogar ein reichhaltiges Fruehstueck, was fuer new Yorker Verhaeltnisse eher eine Seltenheit ist.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, comfortable room in a good location. Friendly, helpful staff. Restaurant attached. The only negative was that our roomoverlooked 8th Avenue and we could hear street noises (sirens, subway); the hotel has no control over that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large impersonal hotel, but very nice rooms and perfect location to be in the center of the theater district.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently stayed here with my daughter while checking out colleges in Chicago. Location is great, a short walk to the waterfront and a gorgeous view of the skyline. Room was great, bath/shower were nice - the rainhead shower was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and good price on a nice, modern room. Would definitely stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] O melhor deste hotel eh a localizacao. O atendimento tem todo o carisma e hospitalidade de NY :-p (SQN) Reservei em uma promocao que fez o custo/beneficio valer a pena. Fora dela, eh meio carinho para o que oferece...  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very good, but the best it is the location, just a few blocks of times square. Very clean and service is kindly. Recomend for everybody, overall for the price, very friendly for that location in new york.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very comfortable, clean, friendly and conveniently located. The rooms are not large but sufficient nonetheless. The great location and service make up for any shortcomings. Excellent value.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel accommodated my last minute reservation for an unexpected business trip. Efficient and courteous staff throughout my stay. Would recommend this hotel for both business travel and for pleasure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at this hotel twice. Both times, I had beautiful, quiet rooms, the most efficient, polite service. The location is good too, close to the galleria and restaurants. A relative bargain.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here for 3 nights. Our room was comfortable and we were able to walk to Michigan Avenue, the Navy Pier etc. The staff were very friendly and helpful and provided us with a list of good places to eat.. There was a swimming pool etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location right next to Grand Central Station but a fair walk to other sites...small rooms, fair service...no complimentary breakfast served...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel and good value. Very convenient for both uptown and downtown sightseeing. Loved the bed and pillows. Reception staff were very friendly. It was noisy at night but it's to be expected when staying in the middle of Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent facilities, cosy and well maintained. very business like, functional. the space is managed very well and the gym was good too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Parts of the experience were great other parts, well not do great! Had issues with our room key for 2 days and paying for wi-fi is ridiculous  [END]
[BEGIN] 7/17/12 Small no-frills hotel. Clean w friendly staff. Several bathrooms per floor. I would happily do it again for the price. Buliding did smell of bug spray (Not sure if that is good or bad.).  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for one night over the weekend. Neighborhood was soooo active. Our room was on a high floor in the back and was very quiet. Room was small and clean. Staff was wonderful. Thought it was a little expensive for the space provided but, I'll cope.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel impecable ,propre,personel a l'ecoute,placement ideal pour se restaurer ,a cote de central park, metro a 5mn pour visiter la ville pour 25 dollar la semaine.prix correct de l'hotel,sejour de reve n'hesite pas new york sa se raconte pas il faut y aller.  [END]
[BEGIN] After reading the reviews here I was expecting to be thrilled with our choice of staying at Sofitel. It is very nice and the bathrooms are extraordinary. But the best hotel in NYC - I don't think so.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really enjoyed the stay, the location, the service, the rooftop bar and the beds... We stayed in a junior suite for 5 days with 2 kids and 2 adults. My ONLY complaint, was that there is no room service or breakfast... otherwise, I loved it!  [END]
[BEGIN] huband & I stayed at this hotel during his conference. everything was very comfortable and our room had a good view. the rooftop pool was very cool too!  [END]
[BEGIN] this is my third time @ Cosmopolitan, a great hotel to stay in NY, wonderful team, great location,clean, friendly.  [END]

[BEGIN] As a frequent guest at your hotel, I can honestly say that the service, design and total experience are great. I have recommended this hotel to my business colleagues and in fact one of them stayed here last night! Will continue to make this my home in NY!  [END]
[BEGIN] Went there for the first time and was very pleasantly surprised. For NYC the price was reasonable. The service was excellent. We had booked an event at the Feinstein's night club which was amazing. What a great atmosphere. The only complaint is that they could use a face lift.  [END]
[BEGIN] What a gem in a perfect area of Manhattan. Close to many of the "places to visit". Across the street from Madison Square Garden and Penn Station. The staff is very helpful and attentive. Our room was comfortable and roomy for Manhattan. We loved our visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good choice by my wife (yet again), very friendly and helpful staff. Seemed to speak any language required(although struggled with my northern ireland mumble no doubt)very clean rooms. Good city hotel, within walking distance to everything in the most amazing city in the world. Great start to our honeymoon  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed here and at the New Yorker nearby. Everything was great, the service, the rooms, except perhaps for tired carpet in the rooms. It feels more intimate and refined than the New Yorker, at the same price.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place was clean and welcoming. Room was comfortable. It was fortunate that there were two sinks because one drained very slowly. The large tub was a good ammenity. Fast room service. Also there was a complimentary wine hour which was a plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location - great rooms on the upper levels - NO FREE WIFI :-(  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is relatively no-frills which is just fine by us. New York sized rooms: but clean, cleverly designed, and well-appointed. Location is near several subway stops, Grand Central, Rockefeller Center, etc. Especially a great deal on weekends as Club Quarters generally caters to business travelers. Highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] We really enjoyed our stay at the Buckingham. We got a really good rate from Travelzoo and the location couldn't have been better. The room had a lot of character, was very clean and spacious, and met our needs really well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good central location. Not your average Holiday Inn, this property was renovated a few years back. Great openness in the lobby with fantastic lobby bar with 180 degree views of the skyline.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had an absolutely marvelous stay. We especially wanted to thank Chris, the concierge, who was always available to help us figure out out to get around New York. The service was great and our room was beautiful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could only access wireless Internet from the lobby which was inconvenient. My wife was not a fan of the see thru bathroom door. Room was updated and clean but very very small. Only a few hundred square feet.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hilton garden inn at Times Square will provide you with a great location and excellent friendly service :).. The rooms are absolutely nothing to brag about but are at least very clean..would definitely recommend staying here as it is one of the better values in times swuare  [END]
[BEGIN] Brian was The Friendliest Doorman in New York! I would definitely stay at this hotel again next visit to NYC  [END]
[BEGIN] gute lage  [END]

[BEGIN] Very central lovely hotel just didn't find the staff friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for a long weekend. Great room with corner view, really cool stylish interior. Staff very friendly - the lobby has a really good buzz. Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bagno in camera, cassaforte, posizione perfetta, centro fitness, concierge efficiente, pulizia, davvero ad un passo dall'Empire..... totale una settimana,,, si puo' giusto dire che alcune stanze non sono molto grandi e che non esiste una camera apposita per la colazione... cmq torneremo!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a perfect hotel right near Times Square for a business trip. The rooms wer large and clean. Though we did not get time to try any of the hotel restaurants, it was easy to hop into the multitude of restaurants around the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a problem with an Expedia booked room. Hint to self, always book with the hotel. Crystar was very accomodating and resolved the matter quickly and efficiently. She is the reason I would consider staying here again. My 17 year old son says she's hot!  [END]
[BEGIN] Courteous service Great mid-town location Best breakfast in town Reasonable NYC hotel rates Unbeatable shower-power  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here in Oct 2011 with my two sons, 14 and 9. Very close to Empire State Bldg and Macy's. Lots of fast food nearby incl pizza and Starbucks. There is also a drugstore, Duane Reed, near the hotel. I would definitely stay there again, great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] lunch and dinner were missing room service was perfect burger restaurant is great but too crowdy wi-fi is noot perfect employees are very kind rooms are good  [END]

[BEGIN] We enjoyed our stay. Restaurant was Okay, not SUPER.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean with a great location. Much smaller than I expected for a suite hotel. Only complaint is the heating/cooling. The air would run until the room was freezing then turn off, then the heat would come on! We tried to get it fixed, but it was still not right.  [END]
[BEGIN] A lovely old hotel, brought up to date. Great common areas, small rooms. A very pleasant stay and good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 3 nights in December. Location was great, only 5 min walk to Times Square. Reception staff were helpful with any info we required. Room was fine but very hot. Would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a nice hotel near most major attractions and within the theater district. Quaint, charming, neat and tidy. Friendly and helpful staff.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great hotel if you're downtown for sports, business or entertainment. Very friendly staff, great shuttle van service and very good restaurant. Good bar and decent workout room. Large rooms too.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are planning to spend a few days in Manhattan and will be attending Broadway plays, the Muse offers a nice place to stay. Very comfortable rooms and pleasant attendant staff. One of their concierges, Mark, was extremely helpful to us.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent room, bed, etc. Perfect location on times square. You pay for the location. Good service that is expected at a higher end Marriott location. Skip the View restaurant or just go up for drinks-- food is overpriced and average.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is wonderful. Forget the loud, gigantic lobbies of nearby chains, here you have a small, fancy and comfortable welcoming lobby. Location is great - just off Times Square. High end Frette linens, small but comfortable rooms, nice bar, great staff. It's my favorite in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, we were pleased. Small, clean rooms with aveda bath products. Helpful staff... Thank you Carmen at the front desk! Breakfast is just bagels, juice, coffee. Would stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice suites with kitchen/bar (sink, small fridge, microwave, coffee maker), sofa, desk and plasma TV. Separate bedroom area with door and very comfortable bed. Staff very accommodating. Excellent location. Only drawback - the walls may be a bit thin if you are a light sleeper..  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent location, excellent location excellent location... what else can i say.. the staff were nice. our room had a very nice view of newy ork as we were very high up. rooms are small but nice we really liked it..  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a nice place to stay. Not too fancy, not too out of the way, just right to get things done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay at the "chic" Soho Grand to be pampered by the young and efficient staff; concierge recommended, booked and confirmed a special evening out for a group of friends. Sunny and quiet rooms complete the package of this fabulously located Soho niche Enjoy the cozy "Cupping Room" nearby for breakfast!  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent three days in NYC and Stayed at the Travel In Hotel. Very nice hotel with free parking. Convient to just about everything and has a pool on the third floor. Two block from Times Square. Clean rooms good service and police employees. Will stay there whenever in NY  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall: A nice hotel. Decorated well, great location, very friendly and accommodating staff. Pros: Location, 10minute walk to 5th Ave and the shopping areas. Cons: Small rooms. Hollow walls, you can hear other guests and plumbing sounds.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean rooms, great location and very helpful and kindly staff. 1 minute walk from subway and full of shops on the down street!!! Unfortunately no wiifii in the rooms and not a lot of seating in the lobby where you can surf the web.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me and my son had a lovley time at the Waldorf Astoria,we stayed for three nights,the room was nice and clean and the beds were very comfy,it is very central for getting around New York and i would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was nicely renovated (small though). Very functional for business traveller. Very fast and free cable internet. Right across from the Rockefeller Center  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel in a busy city area. Operated as most Hiltons in the world - very clean and high standard service.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a nice Hotel, without carparking and breakfast, but on a good location next to times square. Only negative points about this hotel are the short beds, (1.80/1.90 meter) and the amount of noice in your room if you sleep on the streetside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect hotel - set back a few block from magnificent mile Cheaps eats nearby Big, Safe & Friendly Free evening cocktails a bonus Rooms were perfect , fluffy towels etc etc Pool on ground floor was perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] I went the the wrong hyatt at first, the one across the street, but then the hotel's shuttle came and picked me up. The room was huge, and the breakfast was really good. I would stay there again. although I wish the bathroom was bigger.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were eight women from various locations meeting in NYC to reconnect. Big pluses for us were the location, the caring front desk staff, maid service and especially the accommodations.  [END]
[BEGIN] I agree with most posters, it's a noisy place, but hey,.. its NYC, after buying some ear plugs I was ok, slept very well. The rooms are small but very clean, staff is nice, never waited to access the washroom. I would return... at a good rate of course :)  [END]
[BEGIN] We were very happy with our stay over the Thanksgiving holiday! The room was clean, spacious, and quiet. The location can't be beat...so close to all the attractions! We would definitely stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Confortable and pleasant stay, I would definately be back there.  [END]

[BEGIN] i stayed there during a meeting i had during june. stayed for 5 days. actually it is a very nice hotel, not far from the city center. most of the employees are very nice specially the concierge, they were very helpful. mainly for business hotel, don't expect real holiday treatment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Marriott Marquis loved it,we stayed on the 43rd floor nice view,perfect location right in Times Square cant beat that,subway,resturaunts,tours right there we all enjoyed our stay the hotel is very clean,parking is expensive but other than that had a great time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms and service impeccable during this busy time of the season. The breakfast was less than desirable for the price. Better places to eat away from the hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Only slept in hotel as breakfast was not part of our package and so did not dine there. Rooms/beds were very comfortable and looked great after refurb. Only down side is $17 for wifi, no way, given price of the hotel! Free in lobby, hence it is always busy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Husband and I stayed here for 5 days in November. Loved this place. The location, on 64th between 2nd and 3rd Ave., was convenient for walking, subway or cab at the ready. Neighborhood is quiet. Room (junior suite) was really spacious and well-maintained. Staff was kind, thoughtful and always pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] A modern and friendly hotel. I liked the downstairs bar, but the real gem is the rooftop bar with amazing views. Nice sized room.  [END]
[BEGIN] We bid this on Priceline and were very happy with our stay. The rooms are very big but sparsely decorated, the bed very comfy. The bathrooms are particularly small. The onsite restaurant was acceptable. The staff was wonderful, the exercise room is well equipped.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was great. The staff was helpful. The view was not good.  [END]

[BEGIN] First visit in NY, stayed there for 4 nights with my fiancee in sept 2004. The hotel is clean, rooms are nice enough and the staff is very helpfull. The Location is simply ideal and prices are moderate. Would definitively go there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] A great hotel in a really good location for Meatpacking district restaurants and bars. Fun bar on the roof terrace  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was right on the Magnificent Mile, and had the easiest walk to Navy Pier out of all hotels on the Mag Mile. Try their 'Route 40 to Paloma' drink - AMAZING! I booked this hotel through hotwire for under $200 a night. Look for the 4-1/2 star.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely boutique hotel one block off the Magnificent Mile (Bloomingdales, Macy's, etc). Large room, well appointed, very comfortable. I'd definitely stay here again. The only negative is the small, slow elevators.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed 7 nights here it's so close to every thing,staff very friendly and helpful,breakfast great and the suite was very modern with 2 large flat screen tv's and we were upgraded as well.My husband plan the trip as a birthday present and would love to stay there again.  [END]

[BEGIN] We booked this for it's location but were put off by the adverts in travel magazines that it was a typical businessman's hotel. We found it friendly and helpful. Yes it is in a good location and we would be happy to return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only a few minutes from all of the best places in New York City.. you won't find anywhere else with this location at this price.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a really nice at this hotel, rooms had all been beautifully renovated, a little noisy because it is close to the FDNY and NYPD but no complaints otherwise, very friendly staff and great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have stayed here twice now and going back in September, great location, clean and price wise can't be beaten!  [END]

[BEGIN] great location, room was very nice, very good staff who actually make an effort. found a great deal on travelzoo so it was terrific value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much to add to the other reviews. Great location embedded among some of the most interesting buildings in Chicago. Check in was fast and they gave me the room early. The small room is just big enough for two adults. Quiet and nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a short way from time square. Classic art deco decor. We were on the 4th floor mid winter. Took a while for hot water to make it up there for a bath. Great convience store with good deli & goodies nearby. Stayed twice will be back soon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not your fancy brand name hotel, but has everything you need for a comfortable and productive stay in NYC. Free wifi, new/modern-looking lobby, decently sized rooms optimized for the business traveler (desk + lots of outlets). Staff is friendly and attentive. Location is excellent. I truly enjoyed my stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] My room was not fully finished from the renovations, and leaked cold air by the siding door. I liked the location and a lot nearby. I liked the balcony and the earplugs, but missed not having coffee pot and second tv.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for 9 nights and had no major problems. The elevator was out of order for a few hours one night but that was no big problem. The room was always clean and the staff was helpful and professional. I'd have no problem staying here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice to stay to Time Square. We walked a lot to the different places. Do you want to take a sightseeing buss there is just around the corner. Lot of breakfast-places 1-2 minutes away if you don't eat at the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1 nacht verbleven in dit hotel wegens evacuatie door orkaan Sandy, personeel was vriendelijk en behulpzaam. Verzorgde ruime kamer en badkamer. Niet ver van centraal station en de bezienswaardigheden. Er was geen electriciteit, wel warm water.Zou dit hotel aanbevelen aan families met kinderen, toch nog gelegen in een rustige straat.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel esta muy bien ubicado. Cerca de la 7ma avenida y del Times Square. El desayuno es muy rico y muy buena la atencion.  [END]
[BEGIN] ottima posizione, ottima accoglienza, ci ritornerei!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed here and at the Waldorf and this hotel is so much nicer. The rooms are fairly big for New York wtih ample room in the bathroom. The beds are comfortable and the rooms are clean. All the amenities are up-to-date.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location if you want to be in the middle of Times Square. Easy access to transportation and restaurants. The rooms have a separate living area with a sofa bed and microwave.  [END]
[BEGIN] The W hotel was great. Laurelin provided 5 star service booking us dinner reservations, club reservations and also getting us Cub tickets. She made our trip to Chicago seemless and lots of fun. I will absolutely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were nicely appointed and spacious. The bathroom was a little tight, but had a separate shower stall and bathtub. The bed was comfortable. About what you can expect from a decent business hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel in an excellent location almost next to Empire State Building but in a quiet neigbourhood. We loved the thick towels, bathrobes and the cascade shower. Very friendly staff - will definitively come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 5 night in october, fantastic location & nice clean hotel ! Breakfast could do with some excitement but you are in NYC so dine out ! Overall great stay :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 6 nights, summer 2008. Service was in top. Beautiful interior.  [END]
[BEGIN] Vengo a New York molto spesso, volo Alitalia e d'obbligo il Confort Inn. L'albergo gode di ottima posizione, in pieno centro e a pochi passi dalla Metro. Buon rapporto qualita' prezzo. Le camere sono spaziose, pulite e l'arredamento molto ben tenuto. Vale la pena consumare in hotel la prima colazione.  [END]
[BEGIN] close to Central Park and subway, in a residential neighborhood. Only problem is the elevators are slow so give yourself sometime to wait for them. Great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty much what you would expect from a Embassy Suites. Breakfast was good room was comfortable for a party of three. Great location. Enjoyed the Navy Pier.  [END]
[BEGIN] From the moment we arrived the attention to superior customer service was noticeable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Hotel in a good location in the centre of NYC. Walking distance to Central Park and to Times Square right on 6th Aveune. Some of the furnishings were old, ie: curtains could be replaced but the location is fabulous.  [END]
[BEGIN] the staff is wonderful and will go the extra mile. the rooms are extremely small - even by manhattan standards - but for clean and modern room in a great neigborhood close to all - this is your place!  [END]
[BEGIN] I LOVED this hotel! I thought that it had old world charm. So spacious and not at all claustrophobic like some other NY hotels. Staff was friendly too. We were so comfortable, I couldn't believe it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good experience at Sanctuary, the staf very friendly and helpful,room clean and beautiful but a little bit tiny. Near Time Square, Radio City Music Hall, Rock Feller Center. Maybe the only think that should be add is a restaurant inside the hotel. For the rest everything was perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are actually small cabins, not very large but manageble if you don't have too much luggage. Common baths and toilets are nice and clean. Service from staff is friendly and professional and the restaurant and bar in the building have a nice atmosphere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely hotel, room was clean and big by New York standards. Did not get disturbed at night by street noise, which to be honest, I expected with it being New York. Very nice hotel with access to Central Park literally round the corner, a beautiful location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Smyth over the weekend- really nice, great service, liked the restaurant attached to the hotel, they make an excellent iced coffee, good atmosphere. Nice sized rooms for NYC, really helpful staff, trendy. Would stay here again. Great bathrooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed a lovely three night stay at the Knickerbocker. Room are a tad small but the atmosphere is lovely. Check out the Crystal Ballroom - spectacular! A bathtub would also have been nice but the shower was great anyway. Would stay there again in a heartbeat!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location....nice rooms for the price. Bar is outrageously expensive. even foe NYC!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed overnight for a friends party in the city. The room was large for NYC and well maintained my only small complaint was a lack of help with baggage and a lack of luggage carts. I would definitely stay there again  [END]
[BEGIN] Just built in october, nice, clean and contemporary hotel. Located on canal street, right across the street was the edge of SOHO, short walk to the west side and Chelsea districts. Great shopping and galleries close by the hotel. I would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy bonito y las habitaciones comodicimas, pero no tienen forma de que una camioneta grande entre a el lobby y/o estacionamiento, tienes que dejar tu auto en otro estacionamiento a espaldas y caminar. Eso esta pesimo. Servicio de taxis del hotel super pesimo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went for a week in NYC and this hotel was both affordable and located right near Central Park. Considering the price the hotel was much better than we expected - I can absolutely recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic location - nice service, friendly staff The worst thing - noise. Affordable price comparing typical prices in N.Y. Carpet needs to be changed and TV set should be renewed. But who watches TV in N.Y....  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Walking distance to just about anywhere. Very nice staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location in the middle of Manhattan. Large rooms. Somewhat traditional decor. Good service. Well stocked mini bar. Perfect for business trips.  [END]
[BEGIN] One nighter for Rice University tour. Chose for free parking and wio-fi. Beds nice, room fine, staff helpful. Could have comfortably stayed another night. Breakfast is mediocre: limited choice, bad coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] If I'm traveling on my own nickel, this is where I stay. Good access to midtown - just a few blocks south of Grand Central - and prices much better than big name hotels. Clean, modern rooms. Free wifi if you join their free club. Friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Es una buena opcion. El desayuno bufete es normal, al menos mejor que los los otros holiday inn. Tienen transporte incluido al aeropuerto, al mall y a un Wallmart cercano. Lo mejor es la buena atencion del personal. Tiene piscina para el verano.  [END]
[BEGIN] good ,frenly ,the situation is very good and complete our expectatives. for us was very interestring all renovation programa and the only a little poor was the tv chanel number and quality of some chanel viuve.  [END]
[BEGIN] We certainly thought this hotel was well located and the staff were helpful and informative. All hotels in Manhattan are expensive and this was the one drawback but nowhere is going to offer a bargain.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel. Small but clean, near Time Square in the heart of Manhattan. The rooms are not that great, but always clean and comfortable. The pool is very nice and the staff is very kind and attentive to guests. I recommend this hotel to all  [END]

[BEGIN] My family really enjoyed this place. The location and the hotel was better than expected.  [END]

[BEGIN] My first time staying here visiting a new client in NYC. Will most likely stay again based on price relative to experience and the quality of the staff. Attentive and helpful staff upon arrival and exit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location....a few steps from Times Square, Central Park and 5th avenue. The staff is ok. The room is good and the hotel has a restaurant on the lobby. Its an old building, but it doesnt matter at all...  [END]

[BEGIN] Stayed here my last trip to NYC. Great hotel, stunning decor, especially in the lobby. Would certainly consider another stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] A fab hotel in an excellent location right on Times Square. Pop out in the morning and bring back breakfast from the deli opposite (excellent yoghurt with granola and freshly made pancakes) as eating in the hotel is really expensive! We will return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel and customer service. I highly recommend it. The one draw back are the elevators. There are only two for a 36 storey high hotel and therefore can be slow but other than that it is a great place to stay.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good hotel if you're looking to be plugged into the Times Square scene. Crowded at reception at our visit due to airline attendants checking in at same time. Not much for lounge/lobby meeting space like other large hotels. Decent stay for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms need renovation the location is superb and the price is high in the season.  [END]
[BEGIN] Getaway weekend with family - very convenient to shopping. Staff was friendly and accommodating. - Restaurant could use a menu update but plenty of other choices to eat nearby. Room satisfactory and clean. Pool and exercise room were adequate and clean. no issues or complaints. would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here before and had bug problems so we were wary.....but no problems and they have really stepped it up there much better than before. Good breakfast and managers reception. Nice pool area and easy to get to shopping and restaurants. Clean and worth the stay.  [END]

[BEGIN] I traveled with my whole family last March 2011 and we all loved the hotel, maily the good location and excelent service  [END]
[BEGIN] We recently stayed at the Warwick Hotel. Although an older hotel it is well maintained. We upgraded to the Warwick Suite and was pleased at the size of both the bedroom and living area. It was worth the expensive. We would stay there again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location, you can walk to central park and times square. Lovely staff who are cheerful and willing to help,great rooms too .We really enjoyed our stay. I would recommend this hotel, you certainly won't be disappointed with its location if you are planning to visit manhattan. Enjoy!  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location for financial/court district. The junior suite is spacious but curtains cannot close completely at corners - needed eye shades to sleep in. Best views of WTC site at 3rd floor restaurant (food was pretty good and not too overpriced for area).  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want the Times Square experience this is your hotel. Better than average room size for Manhattan. Rooftop bar has fantastic views. Price is very reasonable when you consider it all. My second favorite hotel in town.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location in NYC, next to Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown and by walking distance of the East Village or Greenwhich Vilage. Loved it, all Manhattan and Brooklyn were easy to access.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het hotel had alles wat het moest hebben. Het was schoon. Handdoeken werden dagelijks omgewisseld. De badkamer (en vooral douche) waren prima. De bedden waren wat kort en de kamer was wat klein. Dat was geen probleem, want we waren en dan ook alleen maar om te slapen.  [END]

[BEGIN] We were pleasantly surprised when arriving at Club Quarter. About a 30-40 minute drive from JFK. Amazing location. Safe area. Clean hotel, remodeled, bottled water for all guests.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just spent a wonderfuI weekend at this hotel. The location was perdect for experiencing downtown Chicago and the room was very well appointed and comfortable. I highly recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is from 15F to 26F. I think the night view in this hotel is wonderful around almost all the rooms. It's normal holiday inn, and always good quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] We came here for brunch and it was amazing. The decor, atmosphere and drinks were great. Hotspot in NY definitely worth the trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Centrally located by Grand Central, yet not very noisy. We had one of the tower suites, worked well for a family of 5. This hotel does not look impressive but is good value for NY.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel is well priced and offers a great location for manhattan. Rooms need a bit of updating but found the facilities to be reasonably good. Nice complimentary coffee and muffins in the morning. Lifts are very poor and the staff were reasonably friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Novotel is a good choice. The hotel should offer better rates and improve the conditions of the carpets of the rooms. I think it is a little expensive for the conditions offered by the hotel. But in general is a good choice with an excellent location in Times Square. Mauro  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima kamer. Schoon en ruim. Zeer rustige gezellige buurt.  [END]

[BEGIN] My wife, two small children and I stayed at the Kimberly last May. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. We found the hotel to be a great value and centrally located. The hotel restaurant is also excellent and family friendly. We will recommend the Kimberly to friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Here on business. The staff at the restaurant/cafe area was pleasant and very knowledgeable about the surrounding area. Room was clean and comfortable. Even being near the elevator the room was very quiet.  [END]
[BEGIN] An excellent location and good value for the area. The room was clean, but the shower tap kept falling off and didn't get repaired in the five days we were there. For such a modern hotel the lifts were extraordinarily slow! I would certainly stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location right by Times Square - noisy but all part of the NYC experience. Friendly staff. Not the cheapest hotel in the world but plenty of places nearby including a 24 hour supermarket.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay one night on Friday. Nice small hotel with pool behind bar. Excellent location. Lot's of ambiance in the bar at night. Bed is on a kind of plateau which was a litle bit shaky and dirty.  [END]

[BEGIN] We have chosen the Marriott Marquis in the past when visiting Times Square. This trip we wanted a smaller hotel and the Renaissance was just right. Spacious room, nice sized bathroom. Modern and clean. Great concierge service. We enjoyed appetizers and drinks in the R Lounge overlooking the city. Recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very nice hotel. The rooms were quiet (couldn't hear elevator noise, hallway noise, street noise). It was very clean. Breakfast was always stocked well. It is a very "tight" hotel meaning compact. But that is NYC.  [END]

[BEGIN] Older hotel but less expensive than most and gets you to the part of Chicago you want to be in.  [END]

[BEGIN] Posizione ottima per potersi muovere a piedi. La nostra stanza devo dire che era piccolina come vedrete dalle foto, ma confortevole. Erogatori d'acqua sul piano, gratis. Personale ok. Posso solo dire che lo consiglio vivamente. Buona Vacanza!  [END]
[BEGIN] Located in an up-and-coming neighborhood, the hotel is a quick cab, bus, or train ride to downtown. You cannot find a better price anywhere else...and the staff was great! Although hotel rooms were a bit sparse, they were very clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value, good location, relatively quiet. Workout room was excellent. Check in/out was efficient though staff seemed indifferent. About 20 min walk to midst of Miracle Mile. Had trouble getting service at the coffee shop on two occasions, and damage to fire suppression sprinkler in our room 1214 was unsettling.  [END]
[BEGIN] Een uitstekend hotel met goede, redelijk grote, nette en schone kamers. Redelijk geprijsd. Alleen je moet wel van enorme toeristenfabrieken houden - het is een gigantische onpersoonlijke torenflat. En de drank en eten zijn aan de prijzige kant. Lekker verbleven maar we komen niet terug.  [END]
[BEGIN] I personally feel that Ramada Inn is one of the hotels with reasonable room traiffs offering standard quality of food, rooms, services. Especially, we enjoyed the quality and quantity of complimentary breakfast that is been offered. Room service was good  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location in Mid Town. Remodeled and very modern. It was a roof top deck when the weather is nice (not the day I was there). I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very comfortable room with a great view of Times Square. The location is perfect for going to shows and getting to the subway The iron in the room stained my wife's blazer, but they had it dry cleaned free of charge. Overall a great stay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Service the way it should be... Seen and not heard. No problems with guest rooms or restaurant (Astor Court) of any kind.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel in a great area !! The price was great and the room was perfect.  [END]

[BEGIN] My wife and I stayed at the Barclay for the second night of our valentine's weekend trip to NYC. The location is excellent near the theater district, St. Patricks, Rockefeller Center, and Times Square. The service was above average and the room was nice, although a bit small.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great. Staff friendly and helpful. Continental breakfast good (makes life a little easier!) The hotel is a boutique hotel - our room was small, but the bathroom was a good size. Our suitcases were literally between the bed and the wall. Other than that, all was good.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location with very helpful concierge(s). My only complaint is they nickel and dime you to death(internet, gym - pool is free, ect). They are charging InterContinental rates already. The family had a great time at Chicago Art Institute, Fields Museum and shopping. Fabulous eating within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was comfortable and accommodating in spite of its small size. Every inch of the room, as well as other areas of the hotel, was maximized. The interior design was pleasing. I would stay here again, given the chance.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great for business stay, right downtown, no fuss, clean, good price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent hotel, excellent location, but very cold for those who look for a warm mood, specially in soho. Exactly the opposite of a BB. Normal, 4 stars, but just to share. For 100 euros less, we did prefer really the Washington Square Hotel in the village.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not a chain hotel or upscale place, but the location and size of the rooms makes it worth it. It was older but clean. Great choice  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything great except the lifts too slow and too busy , in addition one of them out of order at a peak period  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima verblijf. Leuk hotel. Jong publiek. Kamers zijn wel ECHT klein, maar dat is nu eenmaal voor die prijs op zo'n centrale plek. Bed was ook iets korter en smaller dan gebruikelijk, dus geen aanrader voor lange mensen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seemds like a new hotel. Very busy. Staff is very attentive. I paid $99 for a room. High speed worked well. Close to airport, not too noisey. Very clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fortunate enough that I am in NY for work. I have been in 3 hotels, and I like this one the best. However; due to my experience with the unprofessionalism of the front office management, I would not recommend this particular location to anyone working or vacationing.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I stayed here 6 nights in September 2012. The room was clean, The bed was good, the air conditioning did not work well, but they fixed it. Breakfast was good. We liked that the location which was 2 minutes from Macys.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here on our last trip to NYC. We loved it! The room was beautiful and spacious. The location is perfect for visiting Central Park. We were able to explore New York City and come back to relax in a nice hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was visiting from LA. My room was a bit small but what do you expect from Midtown Manhattan? Met friends for drinks at the bar and the staff was wonderful. Would stay again for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Parker is in a great location, close to Central Park, restaurants, bars, etc. The rooms are somewhat dated, but still OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value in a good location. Morning coffee and muffins a nice plus. Tv's could use some updating in rooms but overall a good budget hotel  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location for using subways to almost anywhere in the city. Service personnel friendly and very helpful. Comfortable beds and well furnished room.  [END]

The staff was exceptionally professional. Cafe and restaurant provided tasty and easily accessible meals.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best thing about the Hotel is the location, a few blocks from great shopping and dinning. I would recommend this Hotel for leisure as well as for business travel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel at fantastic value. Friendly and helpful staff. Modern and clean. Decent size for New York City. View was lacking. Hotel was easy walk to subway, central park, restaurants. Totally different experience from staying in Times Square. Would recommend to others.  [END]
[BEGIN] posizione centralissima, a pochi minuti da times square, dalla stazione centrale della metropolina e dalla quinta strada. Servitissimo sia per quanto riguarda i mezzi, sia per quanto riguarda il servizio taxi. Personale gentile, paziente e cortese. Camere un po piccole, con lo stretto necessario, ma comunque pulite! Consigliatissimo.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, spacious clean. With a view of the bridge. Simple breakfast. In the heart of Chinatown with European clientele. We will stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel for the price. The rooms are small but when visiting a city like New York you normally don't plan to spend too much time in the hotel. Shared bathrooms wasn't a problem either - always clean & usually available. Great location for exploring the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay there regularly as I visit NY regularly. It is hard to fault it except to say it would be great if they could serve wine with room service. Crossing the street to a liquor store is annoying.  [END]

[BEGIN] belle chambre pour new york , terrasse sympa ( sur rue ) pour prendre les petits dej prix raisonnables  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice room with good bed and great shower. Nice staff. No restaurant operating in the hotel presently - will be nice when there is. Regardless, 2 good restaurants across the street from it - one a 24 hr diner which will deliver!  [END]
[BEGIN] For a meeting at MD Anderson this is a good choice. Nice and quite, good location and service, efficient valet parking and shuttle service to the medical center.  [END]

[BEGIN] Excellent location right in front of Radio City Music Hall, really close to Central Park, Times Square and Rockefeller Center. Rooms were nice, big bathroom and updated. In here you will paying for the great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] The omelet cooks were a great start to each day. Many ingredients and cooked to order. Those guys deserve a raise. This hotel was of course like the other embassy suites in many ways. It was louder than some with our room being next to the elevator.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well located for all touristy things, funky decor albeit our room felt a little dated, but great design and really comfortable. Great staff too, very helpful tips on restaurants and the door staff organised airport transportation which was well priced and on time. Would thoroughly recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in great location in NYC. Very clean. Friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, nice staff, clean room with updates. Conference rooms are clean, carpet could stand to be updated. Fair warning - the elevators at this hotel are very very slow!  [END]
[BEGIN] If I had just one thing to say negative about this place would be the lack of WiFi. Rooms very nice, clean. Pets allowed which was very nice and centrally located which is even nicer. Great people watching location. Close to the beach as well as plenty of fine restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice Marriott hotel, with usual amenities. Starbucks in the lobby is a nice touch. Room was large and clean, flat screen tv. convenient fast food and drug store across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel in an excellent location. Rooms are quite small but very nice and it is expensive but I think this to be expected in big cities. Attended a function whilst staying here which was excellent, well run and the food was amazing!  [END]
[BEGIN] It's clean, the rooms are large, and the location--for a business traveler--can't be beat. But not worth the rack rate (over $180/nite) so stay only if you get a deal here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome location for those interested in Michigan Ave. Hotel is a little...um, let's just say not on par with the great Westins we all know and love. Chopped up spaces--wall-paper peeling in spots! But easily over looked if location is what you are after.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff muito simpatico e quartos optimos. Hotel muito trendy e jovem.  [END]
[BEGIN] A Bit Pricy But....The rooms were nice & roomy for NYC... Wonderful view of Times Square... Ask for upper floor & you get a King or 2 Queens & Sofa Bed... Lots of Space!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel its just OK but needs some upgrade, I stay in the 12 Floor and the elevator wasn't working, The room was comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great place to stay for breathtaking views. Shabby chic atmosphere and very accommodating staff. I would not recommend for business due to the inadequate work space. Definitely would stay there again. I do recommend booking a corner room on a high floor (23rd floor) to get your money's worth.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at belnord in December 2011. Me and my boyfriend we stayed here for four nights.I must say that the rooms are small but they are modern and clean. Flat screen t.v and clean towels.I would stay here again and recommend this stay.it's really affordable and staff was help full.  [END]
[BEGIN] With the Reno almost done, the lobby and rooms are great / bathroom was very small and I hate that there is no minibar just a fridge - this needs to be fixed it's crazy. Wireless is ok and I'll return  [END]
[BEGIN] Das modern Hotel befindet sich im Herzen von Manhattans Trendviertel Meatpacking District.New York ist eine fazierende Stadt.New York ist eine Reise wert. Fazit Service: super Service Fazit Hotellage: zentral gelegend  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is simple, but very confortable, clean and tranquil. The breakfast is varied and the prices are very cheap: U$37.00 daily. The localization is excellent for purchase. He's close of the Best Buy, Macy's, Target, Krog's, DSW, Marshal"s, Walgreens ,and Starbuck's. Great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything okay. Rooms are small, but quite all right. Would like to return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walking distance to Rockefellar Plaza and Times Square. Room in good condition.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent the night at this very convenient Manhattan hotel. It is just caddycorner to Macy's Herald Square. Right by the subway. Friendly staff. They upgraded my room to "city view" since they didn't have a king available and was delighted with the Empire State Building view.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful lobby, nice room, excellent location on the subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location right behind St Pats cathedral and 5th Ave shops. Wonderful staircase. Bar staff were a little less than friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel was in the heart of the financial district with the tribecca film festival building owned by robert denero around the corner. you are close to a variety of restaurants. the hotel staff is very good and the gym downstairs was quaint but adequate for a nice workout.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are very, clean love the area, great view and location out from hustle and bustle of New York loved fitness room staff very accomodating  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, comfortable bed, good business centre. Bedroom was a little small, and we were dissapointed by the lack of coffee/tea making facilities in bedroom. Overall this was a nice comfortable hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an older hotel that has been well maintained. It is in a great location. Just minutes off Time Square. Staff was very helpful. Bathrooms are very small. I would definitely stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed for the second time at this hotel. The conditions of the room were excellent. The sleep number bed could use some explanation. Megan was particularly helpful and accommodating during my stay. 31  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value for the money and an excellent location. Above the 7th Ave subway (23rd st) for the 1,2,3 & 9 lines. One block either way to the V & F or A,C & E lines. Quiet neighbourhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] lo bueno que tiene este hotel es que son departamentos muy lindos que en el caso de ser una familia podes alojar los chicos en el comedor, tiene lavavajillas, heladera microondas esta muy bueno para pasar tus dias en NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only thing that I did not like was the mattress was a bit uncomfortable and the shades on the windows didn't close all the way. Great place to stay otherwise especially for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heel goed en super schoon hotel met vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. Echt een aanrader. Wij verbleven daar 1 week met 2 tieners op een familiekamer, ruim en een grote kamer voor New Yorkse begrippen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Having had a long flight from South Africa the rooms were great as well as the staff. Have stayed there twice and has got better and better. For a tourist it is the best place to be. Close to Times Square and other major attractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] We get upgraded to higher floor. Good view, not much space. But it works. Internet was okay, not much speed, but work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good location in downtown Manhattan in front of Madison Square Garden, 2 blocks from Macy's, 2 from Empire State Building and 10 from Times Square :D It's Old But it's really clean and good service. Really good price for the location  [END]
[BEGIN] Me decidi por este hotel por su situacion y por referencias de amigos ya que antes de mi fecha de viaje las fotos en internet heran muy antiguas estaba en obra, pero una vez alli fue estupendo todo, la habitacion, limpieza, trato etc.no me equivoque.  [END]
[BEGIN] Workout facility is in an awkward location. No restaurant was available. Granted, being in the Mall offers many opportunities, however often business travelers are tired and may not want to leave for a meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] 45 min wait for a burger at the bar because "they were really busy" Bed looked like it had been slept in No phone book in the room  [END]
[BEGIN] Pode ir tranquilo. Muito bem localizado. Excelente staff. Nada a reclamar!!! Nao vai se arrepender! Recomendo...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great find in Wall Street area. Walk to Bankruptcy Court. Nice bar. Reasonably priced restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] I always use Marriott hotels and this one was worth the money. It was in a good location with plenty of nightlife and places to eat near by. Easy to walk everywhere. Staff very pleasant and room was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at this hotel in december 2011. It was really modern and clean and the views from the roof garden were amazing. Friendly and helpful staff flagged down taxi's for us whenever we needed one and the subway station was just over the road. Would defo go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] New, clean, modern, and convenient. Room was good size for a Manhattan hotel. Blocks from Times Square. Staff was very helpful and friendly. Great large flat screen t.v. on wall in room, with a modern bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a lovely old hotel, but one that badly needs renovation to regain a luxury status. The furniture is worn, the bathrooms outdated. The concierge is knowledgeable. The staff is courteous. The location is ideal. If spruced up, this would be a first-rate choice. A New Yorker  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location for business trip,,, subway stations, restaurants, grocery nearby,busy but exciting street,,,weak wifi connection which might be caused by wifi traffic from luxury apartment located across the hotel (improvement needed in this area) ,,,excellent front desk service by Kumar,,,,will definitely go back to this hotel,,,  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location in Times Square. Noisy but expected for the area. A little impersonal but typical of a big hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 2 nights at the end of June. This location is unbeatable, even if the decor is not the most modern it made no difference to us. The place was clean, the bed supper comfy and the cost very competitive in comparison to its neighboring establishments.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there once for business - great hotel, everyone at our company stays there.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed many times at the Muse. A terrific hotel, well appointed as all Kimptons are. 100 yards from the heart of Times Square. An oasis from the crowds and bustle. If you're in NYC to take in some Broadway shows, this is the place for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there for the first time in March. It's a wonderful historic property. Room was elegantly appointed. Staff was great. I attendedd an event at the hotel, so got to see one of the meeting rooms. Very nice and the banquet staff were courteous and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are a gold/platinum member your free breakfast would be a regular coffee and a muffin (or an equivalent combination) from a Starbucks in the lobby. Room service is quite slow. Otherwise, it is a nice hotel in a good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I stayed here in April 2009 and I have no complaints at all. The location is great (right next to Herald Square) , the staff were very helpful and welcoming, the complimentary Breakfast buffet was hearty, our room was large, clean and cosy. Would definitely stay again!  [END]
[BEGIN] great, quaint place! 2nd time staying there. located near 3 subways, awesome breakfast included, fridge in the rooms for leftovers. I have shared a bathroom both times with another room and wouldn't have known i was sharing with someone, get a room facing the courtyard, its quieter.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff where very helpful and friendly. Rooms where very clean and comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location like all the other reviewers say. Surprisingly good service -- not always a given in NYC regardless of the price. The rooms are small and dated, but perfectly fine for business travelers, and you're unlikely to spend much time in them anyway.  [END]
[BEGIN] In a great location close to Carnegie Hall and three blocks away from Central Park, with a subway station below, this Hotel offers good value without unnecessary frills. The breakfast is good and the staff generally very helpful and friendly. For the price, one could hardly ask for more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buon hotel situato nella zona di Soho/tribeca. Vicinissimo alla metro e dentro a Chinatown. Buon Hotel pulito, personale molto disponibile e cordiale.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought at the price this place would be a dump, but it was lovely! Room was clean and well-appointed, bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable, staff was warm and friendly. Location was perfect for my purposes. Good breakfast in their restaurant. I look forward to staying there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Check in was flawless, staff very friendly. Based on other negative reviews I was really surprised. King room was perfect. For the location and price, this hotel cannot be beat. You are not at the Ritz, so dont sweat the small flaws.  [END]
[BEGIN] My daughter and I and dog stayed here Christmas Eve. The rate was extemely good for a NYC hotel. It was well under $200. It is not my favorite of the Kimpton hotels, but it was clean, and the staff was friendly. I really enjoyed the wine hour.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small but it is spotlessly clean, the service is exceptional, and the location is unbelievable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice location near central park i was there three times but hotel is old and i think dirty...bigest problem is that hotel is very big and old...but nice ...  [END]
[BEGIN] Less than 1min to Times Square.the reception is helpfull and sympathic.the housekeeping always clean the room and change towels.i will suggest this hotel to all my friends  [END]
[BEGIN] One couldn't really expect more from a USD $210/night hotel in midtown Manhattan. The location is obviously excellent for most intents and purposes, and staff is generally friendly and helpful. Don't come here expecting Peninsula-level service, but Roosevelt is definitely a strong contender for a centrally located hotel in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tres bien a tout les points de vue sauf pour les dejeuners l espace est un peu reduit et il n y a pas toujours de place mais la nourriture est bien et il y a toujours quelqu un si il manque quelquechose  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel close to the Time Square and Chelsea action. Very reasonably priced for what you get. Staff was very friendly and helpful with suggestions. Highly recommend if you're not on a Waldorf-Astoria budget.  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Hotel ist soweit gut, alle Vorteile von Ambassador mit freundlichem Service. Das Badezimmer war etwas veraltet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed recently for 27 days and as per me, this hotel gives good value for money with reasonably good breakfast and decent rooms.Quality of the staff services are good. Internet speed could be better.  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent 3 nights in this hotel and it was good! the rooms are comfy, free-wifi, good breakfast, employees helpful, not really far from Brooklyn bridge, close to China Town!! Next to the subway  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful central location for exploring NY. Friendly staff and great food. Pity we had to go across the street to Starbucks for free Wifi. The hotel charge is ~$15 per day for this service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the design of this hotel. The lobby was more like a trendy bar rather than a hotel lobby. The rooftop club is also cool with a great view. The room was nice with a very comfortable bed. However the bathroom wasn't too great...  [END]
[BEGIN] 4 nachten in St James hotel doorgebracht in kamer aan straatzijde. De entree en lobby waren prima. De kamers zijn gedateerd, maar schoon en goede douche. Locatie is top, 100 meter van Times Square, maar in een rustige straat. Op zaterdag markt voor de deur.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and good service with spacious rooms for the Mag Mile area. However, the a/c didn't work too well. Lobby was a bit dated but nostalgic. Bathroom in the room was fine All in all a good choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Centraler kan bijna niet. Als je de deur uitstapt sta je midden op Times Square, van waar je trip door New York kan beginnen. De kamers zijn schoon en het personeel is behulpzaam. Let wel op dat je het type kamer krijgt dat je geboekt en betaald hebt.  [END]
[BEGIN] We appreciated the early check-in and free WIFI but not being charged for local calls. Hotel was easy to find, and its location met our needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very cool uptown boutique hotel. Very modern rooms and common areas. The roof top bar is brilliant with great views. Staff were very polite and helpful. Loved this place  [END]
[BEGIN] It is localized in the heart of times square!!! The petit room was small, however enough. Big bathroom for Ny's standard. The check in was very fast, nice songs in the lobby!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Business Travel is not always the pleasure thing in my career. By staying Hilton Garden Inn, talk to he staff Mr. Domingo comforts my resistance to the business travel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very convenient location. The hotel is very functional, but rooms are somewhat impersonal. The wireless internet worked fine. Service at the restaurant (breakfast) is better than it used to be a couple years ago but still has some room for further improvement.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is clean, and the staff was friendly but the breakfast needs some work. I've stayed at a few Homewood Suites and this one needs to learn from the Homewood in Falls Church, VA and cook real eggs.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was great and the price was even better especially for NYC. Our only problem was when we were leaving I had trouble getting my car out of the garage as there was a street festival taking place.  [END]
[BEGIN] To be downtown Chicago, only a few blocks from Michigan Avenue, have a suite, and have hot breakfast and evening reception - well worth the price of staying at this hotel. Friendly staff. For business or pleasure - a very good choice!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a great location. The staff was attentive and the room was great--quiet and large by NY standards. I would recommend this to anyone and will definitely return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here during a business trip last year. Square footage in NYC is expensive, but I found my room to be pretty tiny considering the price. There is an attached restaurant. My reservation included a lovely free breakfast that was pretty substantial.  [END]
[BEGIN] The entire hotel was a little intimidating when entering on a Saturday night at 2am. (check in) but we learned to love the place over 12 days The SMH review pin pointed the mains points http://m.smh.com.au/travel/hip-on-a-downtown-strip-20111208-1okys.html Would stay there again if given the chance  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, close to shopping district, attached to Grand Central station. Staff were, on the whole, very pleasant. This is reasonable value for money. Rooms are quiet, but although my room was spacious, it was a little dark.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Moderne in June 2003 and I would do it again. It's really close to everything and the price is right!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for one night while in Houston. Enjoyed the breakfast, staff was friendly. Rooms spacious. Overall good value. Although I didn't get a chance to use the pool, they have a large atrium and indoor.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're looking to stay in mid-town manhattan there are few places that are both inexpensive and of good value. This is one. While the rooms are small, they're clean and well maintained. And the location can't be beat. All-in-all a great option for someone on the go.  [END]
[BEGIN] 4 blocks walk to Michigan Ave shops. Usual W decor and feel. Rooms comfy and quiet considering how busy the hotel is. Both rooftop and lobby bars always packed. Fitness and pool very nice. Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was very clean! Great location in Times Square! Friendly staff! Comfy rooms! Nice but expensive bar! I would have paid twice as much to stay there!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel matched its reputation - good location, friendly staff, clean and tidy rooms (indeed a bit small, though) and so quiet that we had a great sleep. Location is good as well - 10 mins walk from the Penn Station, if you come from Newark Airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] This updated hotel in the heart of NYC- 1 block from Empire State Building- on the Korean Way-provides a pleasant atmosphere, FREE breakfast (needs less carbs & more other choices), and the most comfortable beds! Just returned home and we're going to buy one of those beds this week!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed a week over Easter at this pretty basic hotel. Room was clean and well maintained. Reception personnel were reasonably helpful and (for NYC) friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recommended to this hotel by a family member and it didn't disappoint. We loved the roof top bar with the brilliant views of the Empire State Building. Great atmosphere better in the cooler months when it is not hot and sticky.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want a view- good sized room, clean bathroom and nice staff stay here. Best deal in Manhattan. Room service pricey, if you need a driver ask the doormen for Osama. World class driver.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bed was so comfy. Location could be better if your are tourist. The hotel is well decorated and kept. Quiet and relaxing. I would definitely recommend this hotel to friends and revisit this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location - only 2 blocks from the subway station and 2 blocks from Times Square. Rooms were okay size-wise; not plush but adequate enough. Good restaurant downstairs and friendly staff. Recommended for business and leisure travelers.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are very small, but any room I've ever been able to afford in mid-town Manhattan has small rooms. That's the only con. Everything else about this place is top notch including the location and the staff. I'm looking forward to staying here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very nice hotel in a great location. Everyone was very helpful and friendly. There is no free internet in the rooms, only in the lobby. The only negative. But the rooms are very clean and the beds are very comfy. The location is the best!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice large room, very well appointed. Great location. I stayed in March when the weather was changing so they had turned off the heat. This made the room a little chilly. But over all a nice stay  [END]
[BEGIN] I felt cool just walking in. Stump town coffee rocks!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel had a nice clean room newly updated. It was a few blocks from mag mile. The service was good. It did not have a workout room or pool. Also some hotels in this class have complimetary breakfast and this did not.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 3 nights in March 2012. Clean room, good location for main tourist attractions. Staff were extremely helpful, particularly Ms J Villanueva, who provided great local knowledge and quietly arranged a limo for the return journey to the airport. A nice touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service that my sister and I had from the hotel staffs was great. We felt really welcomed! Strategic location, easy to get to Times square, new york public library and the eateries around :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, room was very comfortable and the staff all friendly. Nothing bad to say about the hotel, nor did it blow my mind. Recommend staying here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hip place. Not for older crowd. Saw models walking around bar that were topless. Like that! Beds just ok. Location and value good. Will stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location in the upper east side, quiet neighborhood, bus and subway quite close room booked was a junior suite, with kitchenette, high floor bathroom a little bit small  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoyed our stay at the Edison very much. Staff was friendly and efficient. Our room was neat and spacious. The walking distance to most important streets and main attractions in New York is a plus for senior citizens. I would definitely recommend it to family and friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are teeny-tiny, but comfortable and clean. Staff is friendly and helpful. It is very quiet. Close to the subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great boutique hotel, friendly staff, in a perfect location for Broadway shows. Room service was excellent! Will definitely consider staying at the Hotel Mela on my next NYC visit.  [END]

[BEGIN] we booked 3 rooms , they were clean , reception staff were v.nice , breakfast buffet was good.Hotel location is great ,you can walk to Macy's Galleria ,alot of good resturants are in the same area  [END]
[BEGIN] Marriott people do seem to try that bit harder and this hotel was no different. Facilities correct , nothing special. Locality quite mixed ,as near Grand Central Station Views on Chrysler building spectacular,at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] You can't beat the location of the QT. While the room was quite small, the bathroom was expansive (I had a corner room). No frills, but clean and modern. Continental breakfast is included and makes this midtown Manhattan hotel quite a good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smack bang in the middle of everything.Great location,great staff,highly recommend  [END]
[BEGIN] Ruime kamers (grote woonkamer en twee aparte slaapkamers met beide een eigen badkamer), goede bedden. De keuken is basic, maar goed, met gasfornuis, oven, koelkast en magnetron. Zeer goede ligging vlak bij Grand Central Station.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location fine rooms and service. Apart from minor air conditioning issue, where room was changed all was fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here in Sept 2011. Great SW Houston location. Freindly staff and they welcome pets. I thought the hotel showed a slight bit of aging, but nothing major. I would stay here again. A very good value and breakfast is included.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location was excellent and rooms were very nice. Loved the overall experience. Would have to say though that the lack of being able to print boarding passes, lack of consistent delivery of solid doormen services were a bit disappointing...but overall great value and great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent 2 niights at the doubletee suites in time square. Suite was adequate size for me, wife and 2 samll children. Very clean and modern, friendly service. Would stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was very friendly and helpful. Room was comfortable and well designed. Restaurant was elegant and expensive - especially for breakfast. Terrific location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was my third stay. Rooms well appointed and good sized. Nice bar menu and staff. Iced tea and fig newtons at reception a nice touch. Food very good. Setting around the museums nice, but scarcely anything to walk to, tho' ZaZa does offer a ride service. Will stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Generally, a good stay. Central location on side street just east of Grand Central. Pros: homey room; excellent housekeeping; nice linens/towels Cons: officious service; staffing of front desk is spotty; no ice machine (need to call room service); bed too soft  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff is so friendly. Especially the bell boy Marcin, he was kind enough to shoe me some magic tricks he happened to know. He was up beat and definitely reflected the true spirit of new Yorkers  [END]
[BEGIN] I will definitely stay here again. The rooms are small, but they are like brand new, very cozy, modern, and clean. Check in and out was quick and efficient. Great location - I walked from the Pod Hotel to Times Square and Grand Central Terminal.  [END]
[BEGIN] I honestly don`t know why the reviews are so negative for this hotel! ... if you go to New York you are going to spend very little time in the hotel! ... If you want a well priced base in an excellent location this is a great hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The first time I visited New York. Me and my wife are enchanted. Roosevelt is really above average and the location is the best. Nearby 5th and Times Square. You can walk to Empire State, Rockefeller Center, Broadway. Good Service and nice people.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff aim to please and try very hard to keep you happy. The location is ideal, every thing is in walking distance and you do get value for your money. I am planning on going back in October 2010.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was pretty used to Hilton when going to Manhattan but this hotel has really surprised me. Fast check in and out, wonderfully suites and espetacular location. Breakfast $$$ above average but you are plenty of options around the hotel. Will be back for sure.  [END]

[BEGIN] Beautiful old hotel. Very clean. Room was small but efficient. Bathroom, towels and sheets comfy. Could use some new carpeting.  [END]

[BEGIN] Found staff to be pleasant and helpful. Excellent location. Room spacious and very clean, but front facing rooms can be noisy. 24 hour coffee a great bonus! Would return to this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Een goed hotel. Heeft ook een fitness afdeling. Er was een klein minpunt: internet werkte niet op de kamer. Voor een internet verbinding moet betaald worden. Aardig personeel, elke dag werd de kamer schoon gemaakt. Wel is het hotel aan onderhoud toe, echter de prijs, atmosfeer enlocatie zijn erg goed!  [END]
[BEGIN] you couldnt ask for a better location with this hotel, time square on 1 side and central park on the other. hotel itself is fine, lobby area is lovely, rooms are abit dated but does it really matter when your in NYC? staff very pleasant and helpful.  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice atmosphere; closed for badly needed renovations; I hope the bathrooms and elevators are redone. Colors inside are dark. brighten the place up. Staff is plesant. Meals are overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] enough space to read and study and take a break not far away from congresscentre envirement dark at night Could the lunch also be open on thursday and friday? Friendly service day and night:you do not loose time by waiting  [END]
[BEGIN] The Pod is a well located hotel, with modern room with flat panel TV, Ipod dock station and a style bedroom. Its lobby look like a boutique hotel. Very fashionable. It worths the price.  [END]

[BEGIN] Returned this week from NY after a 5 day break. This hotel is perfect in location and size. Staff are very helpful and my only negative comment is some minor decoration would benefit the overall experience but aside from this minor point this hotel is good value and good accomodation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: Best location, very close to Empire state building walkable distance from Penn Station and more than that the rooms are very clean and staffs are friendly Cons: The mini bar in the room is tempting and they should give some complimentary items  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed with my here Mom while she was getting treatment at the Burzynski cancer center. I was very impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of the staff. The place is kept neat as a pin. It was very much a home away from home during a trying time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small hotel with friendly staff and atmosphere. Room rather small but good looking. More nice/modern than practical. Clean. I liked the bed very much, soft but firm. In the middle of Manhattan, but quiet nights, insulation seems ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed staying in this boutique hotel. A convenient location. I enjoyed their breakfast, and their coffee was delicious. Room lights difficult to figure out so I thought initially the room was dimly lit. But once I found out how to turn up the lights, it was fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our family of 4 sayed here for lots less than the Loop. Loved the free parking. The rooms were large and nice, even had a fridge in addition to coffee maker. We walked to the L station in Chinatown. Staff was friendly and helpful in finding restaurants within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was renovated shortly before my stay and didn't disappoint on any aspect. A very dark moody lighting sets the scene in the bar area, along with roaring fires (perfect for December). The breakfast was superb and the staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. I would definitely go back.  [END]

[BEGIN] The room was modern and clean. The location was great. As well as the bed!  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed the unique shape of the room. Fun ride in the glassed elevator. Restaurant quite nice. Went to conference and it is really far from the conference center. The conference did run busses, however traffic hampers their movement. Transit is tough and makes careful planning of trips critical.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Choice in New York. Room was in good repair. My room didn't have an HDTV. Expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel room was great - liked the small wet bar area with plates et al. The pillow menu had so many exotic and unusual elements when I what I would have appreciated was a simple down pillow but that was oddly missing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Minor remark: the front desk should use (as a standard practice) an envelope to handover to customer the receipt/invoice after payment. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- All the best JM  [END]
[BEGIN] As the other reviews mentioned I was really impressed with the friedliness of the entire staff. We had a corner room and were pleasantly surprised how much room we had even with 2 double beds. Will definitely stay here again for our visits to New York City.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am a member of "La Quinta Returns". The check in was fast. The in-door swimming pool was nice. The breakfast were good enough. The wireless internet were pretty fast. Hotel website: http://www.lq.com/lq/properties/propertyProfile.do?ident=LQ505&propId=505&WT.mc_id=EMCFNAME  [END]

[BEGIN] Traveling on Amtrack to FL my train was 6 hrs late so they put up all the passenger that had a connection to DC  [END]

[BEGIN] The room was very nice. The workspace was excellent. The bathroom was nice, but there was a mildew odor. I would stay here again. Great location near central park, shopping and restaurants and away from the craziness of times square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite pleased, especially since I obtained a discounted rate through Priceline. Nice sized rooms, well-appointed. Bathrobes in the room. Decent work-out facility. Professional staff.

Quiet district but not so many restaurants and/or pub nearyby.  [END]

[BEGIN] Clean, Tidy and all that you need when in NYC for 5 days!!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel was lovely. We had a view of 7th avenue from our 7th floor corner room. The room was huge, yet sparsely furnished. The hotel is located a few short blocks from Times Square. It couldn't have been more perfect. The lobby was beautiful. Overall, a wonderful experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] We've stayed at the Belvedere a few times in the past. The rooms are comfy and the location is ideal. It's nice to have a fridge and microwave in the room. Easy walk to Broadway theaters and to restaurant row.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very comfortable rooms and located well just a stone's throw from the Hancock building. Quick check in, excellent water pressure, has fridge and microwave. Why pay $50+ more for the original Hilton  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel, a bit too pricey but in great location. The rooms are average, and no view from the windows. Breakfast is very poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottimo hotel, pulito, moderno e in posizione centrale (praticamente di fronte all'Empire State Building). Metropolitana a un isolato di distanza. Nelle vicinanze ci sono inoltre il flatiron district, il grande centro commerciale Macy's e Times Square. Unici punti negativi: stanze molto piccole  [END]
[BEGIN] i didn't recieve an invoice from you, the hotel is o.k. they need more resturant, the front desk is o.k. not more  [END]
[BEGIN] Ganske nytt og fint hotell plassert 8min gange fra Time Square, 10 min fra Central Park og gangavstand til Rockefeller Centre m.m. Mange gode restauranter i gangavstand.

[BEGIN] The hotel is in a great location. Keep in mind it is a Comfort Inn. Rooms are a bit small, but lets face it, your in mid town, and for the price you are getting a pretty good room for it. The staff were friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean, great location, quiet, friendly and helpful staff. Loved the decor. The beds were very comfy. Continental breakfast needs a little more though, maybe eggs and bacon or sausage. Can't beat the price for NYC!  [END]

[BEGIN] Just like all the other reviews, a great location; generous size rooms; huge comfy bed; good bathroom; plenty of storage; kitchenette by the entrance so didn't affect the bedroom; heating just right; lifts fine; staff helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] For $179 plus tax, it was OK. Rooms are small. No free WiFi. Cant believe a hotel these days does not offer free wifi. Just 2 computers on 10th floor Parking down the street for $25. Otherwise it was decent and newly refurbished  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are Hilton-style (neutrual but excellent) but overall hotel atmosphere is rather so-so (lobby situated on the 14th floor realy lack a welcoming atmosphere). But the main reason why you'd want to stay there is its exquisite location, just a 3 minute walk from Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Tribeca location without the big price tag. Rooms are simple but super clean and bigger than most in NYC. Super friendly professional service. I haven't found a better hotel of it's class in the area - I've tried a couple and they only disappoint in comparison.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent, central location, off Time Square. And still quiet. Good size rooms. Very good value for money  [END]

[BEGIN] Stayed at Swissotel Aug '09. Very efficient. Nice rooms with good views. Good location. Clean. Would stay again. Keith + Kate Marsden  [END]

[BEGIN] I had 1 evening here in October on a trip back from Central America to the UK. Nice room, huge lobby, decent lounge for Hilton Honours members. Did not get to use any other facilities. Standard US Hilton fare.  [END]
[BEGIN] Am Wochenende ist die Bar/Disco sehr gut besucht und eine gute Stimmung. Das Hotel/Zimmer sind sehr angenehm und empfehlenswert.  [END]

[BEGIN] I will continue the review in a later day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Front desk--lacks hospitality and knowledge of area.

[BEGIN] I love the location of this hotel and you will get great views of the city or the Hudson. A very short walk to times square and many places to eat and shop all within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hebben 3 dagen verbleven in het Belnord Hotel. Verzorgde en schone kamers, maar wel klein. Maar ach wie gaat er naar New York om op zijn kamer te zitten. Personeel heel behulpzaam met suggesties en vragen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel. Great modern hotel. Everything is a little dark because of the style but this is a happening hotel. The bar in the Lobby was awesome. Good location and excellent service.  [END]
[BEGIN] On Hotwire, got a very reasonable price <$150 for a pre-paid rate. Good sized room for an older hotel, clean, very attentive staff, great location, especially if you come into NYC on Metro North to Grand Central (just 3 blocks away). Bathroom is older style but good sized.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location and good quality. Prices are good. Some thing to improve in the hotel: the kitchen appliances are old. The rooms have good sizes and the beds are comfortables.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took the family for a NYC vacation. Great central location in the heart of Times Square. The room/suite was comfortable with 2 adults, 2 teenagers and an 8 year old. Way more cost effective than two rooms!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine business hotel. Staff was helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, comfortable, modern room in a great location. Free wifi. We were able to park for free on the street, even, on the same block as the hotel. Plenty of restaurants in the neighborhood. We would return again if we ever need a place in the Chelsea area.  [END]

[BEGIN] Convenient to many things and transportation. Free breakfast. Nice room.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there recently on business and had a perfectly fine stay. The room was clean, modern, and well-maintained. I was in the western tower, which I think is a lot quieter than the main building. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Centrally located this hotel is great for both business and family travel. Common areas are clean and comfortable. Breakfast every morning saves you some serious $$.  [END]
[BEGIN] the rooftop terrace, which foursquare calls a bar isn't true but a great way to spend the evening hanging out with friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] I rarely stay downtown -- generally in midtown instead. Gild Hall has very nice common areas that are warm and old school feeling in a trendy way. good experience. If I needed to stay downtown again, I would definitely consider again.  [END]

[BEGIN] staff is very nice and friendly. Ideally situated in the city center, near all metro lines. My room was a bit noisy because on the street.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel has excellent location. Rooms are a good size for downtown hotel. All the comfort you'd expect from Intercontinental brand. All-in-all a very comfortable stay. Would recommend this hotel. Had a minor issue with my credit card being double billed, but that was resolved with a telephone call.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dit hotel biedt een comfortabel verblijf aan op slechts 10 min. van Times Square en 5 min. van Central Park. Enige nadelen: de irritant kleine en trage liften, het niet altijd even vriendelijke personeel en de herrie 's avonds van de vuilniswagens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the W! It is not the best location, so you will spend extra on cabs or have to drive to get out. The rooms are a little small, but the bar is fun and had fun people at night. Friendly responsive staff. Overall great experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would definitely recommend this hotel: good location, convenient to subway We paid a little extra for a room with a view, and it was worth it: we had a nice corner room!  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect location super close to Time Square and everthing else. Very friendly staff. Rooms were comfortable,small bathroom but for the price you can't beat the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a fine hotel. We were busy and didn't really get to enjoy many of the amenities but everyone was friendly. The hotel was clean, linens nice. Location can't be beat! They seriously jack up the price for the New Year but that is to be expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, stylish and not too small rooms (which is not a given in NYC...) - and it of course helps I got a great deal from booking.com. Nonetheless, I love Thompson hotels, and at my first time at this one, it gets confirmed again  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in a perfect location for visiting the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loew's Regency needs updating of the rooms and bathrooms. The location and service are great. There are not enough plugs to handle my laptop, smart phone and my wife's smart phone. The bathroom is right out of the 1960's and is small.  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay was fantastic and major place in New York like Central Park and Times Square are very close by  [END]

[BEGIN] On 31th floor, looking directly to the Times Squares sights, its impossible do not love this hotel. Clean, very good rooms and the faster check-in ever. A little french atmosphere, without frills, combines with all the caothic rush that comes from street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location and nice rooms, the price is accordingly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have now stayed at this hotel twice over the past 6 months. It does what it says on the tin: good business hotel, new-ish, very clean rooms, anmazing view of the Empire State Building if you ask nicely, free wifi and free basic breakast. Good customer service, great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is NOT the Holiday Inn you remember as a kid. Very recently redecorated and nicely appointed, great location, quiet, bar/restaurant attached. Great value for the money. You have to park your own car but there are a couple garages within 1-2 short blocks.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a typical Hilton Garden Inn. It is clean, easy access to the airport and is the best choice for a quick overnight stay for an early departure. There are other airport hotels - most are tired, some are nasty - this is not.  [END]

[BEGIN] Design conscious hotel with excellent service and amazing bed, probably best in NYC Enjoyed the outdoor space and gratis coffee Sunday am.  [END]

[BEGIN] Had a great time at the W. The hotel was trendy, our room was really clean, and the service was wonderful! The location was a bit quiet for the weekend since its located in the financial district, but everything was easy enough to Our concierge, Eden, was especially helpful!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was quiet and clean. Would definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Street noise is pretty constant, but to be expected given its location. Omar and his staff are second to none. They're very professional and friendly.

[BEGIN] very nice rooms in a decent neighborhood- not too close to attractions, though  [END]
[BEGIN] Whatever you want; they prepare in a small room. Even I am an Asian girl. I feel the room is tiny; however, it is practical for a solo traveling in big apple. If you choose the location, this place is a good choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everytime I'm in New York I stay at The Time, the service is excellent, it's in the heart of the city and the rooms are big, Kenneth was a huge help both times we've stayed there, great service! I will definitely be back.  [END]

Location was ideal for everything, easy access to all main tourist attractions. Would stay here again without hesitation.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good location. Boring but comfortable. Room plenty big. Good views from higher floors, but windows were filthy. Breakfast was very nice if comped for Hhonors. For an expensive hotel, the constant sales pitch-everytime one left the elevator- to view time shares was annoying.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was clean. The staff was friendly. It may not have been fancy, but was a good place to stay for business near the airport. I especially appreciated the frequent airport shuttle service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location if you want to be away from tourist and close to the train and the park. The room was kind of small but not to bad for NYC. The only draw back was the horrible view of a brick wall even after I asked for a good view.  [END]

[BEGIN] This Hotel is old and quaint..I loved it! It has the old mail chutes!! It's a block from the bus station and 1/2 block to Times Square...PERFECT location! Only suggestion ~ bring soap, shampoo and a washcloth! The staff were very friendly! I will stay there again!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly staff, very small rooms. However, they are immaculate. Overall, a good value for New York.  [END]

[BEGIN] Very nice place to stay on 52nd St. Great place but on a quiet street. Near Times Sq. and Radio City. Rooms were large and held 4 adults comfortably. Beds were great and had very nice bed linens. Rooms/hotel were clean. I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent choice for a 4 night stay. Very close to lots of attractions include 205 Fifth Avenue- excellent roof top bar. Reasonably priced. Definitely take up their offer of booking a car to the airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel, as to be expected, is an older building that has been remodeled nicely. The stay was nice, but nothing to write home about. Parking is $45 a night with in and out privileges which seems a bit high but what can you expect in downtown Chicago.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was ok. Staff was helpful, room and bathroom were clean. Great location. It was the cheapest available hotel in Manhattan at that time. But it was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Echt Top immer wider gerne !!  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice place, stayed there 6 nights. Visit from Argentina. They charge 10 dollars for wifi. Too much!  [END]
[BEGIN] The only thing I didn't think much of was the pricing in the restaurant. 30 odd $ is just too much for breakfast. Otherwise everything top noch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place, nice neighborhood full of good restaurants, and close to transit for trips downtown. Good rates too, but remember to add ~$30/day for parking if you drive there.  [END]
[BEGIN] very clean and good service,nice room and bathroom. Ten minutes on foot to times square. We had a nice stay in this hotel and would go back again  [END]

[BEGIN] As mentioned by others, the rooms are small but we were happy with the location and price of the room. The Hotel is very near Central Park and the subway. Overall a satisfying stay. The resteraunt is pricy but it is NY and there are other options close.  [END]

[BEGIN] I had a wonderful experience staying at the Sanctuary Hotel. The staff was friendly, location perfect (only a block away from Times Square) and decor beautifully decorated. Although the rooms were small it still gave that "home" feeling. I'm looking forward to visiting again. You won't regret it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was there on business, but if you're a tourist this is a prime location. The rooms are a good size, and most importantly very quiet. I stayed there three times this month and never heard anything out of Times Square below.  [END]
[BEGIN] Also called "Riverview Hotel". I didn't realize it was a Club Quarters until check in. Good location- easy to walk down State Street or up Michigan. Very basic rooms...not much fluff. But clean and roomy enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] We wanted a boutique style hotel in Soho for a good price in a good location with good services and staff , and that is what we got. Very happy with the room, staff, breakfast, and bar area. The Thai restaurant was also really good. Recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super Lage! Super cool und stylish! Bischen kleine Zimmer, aber alles drin, was man braucht, vorallem sauber! Dachterrasse ist cool, vorallem beim Sonnenaufgang. Der wahrscheinlich langsamste Lift in ganz Manhatten :-)  [END]
[BEGIN] My sister and I stayed here last April, we were very pleased with the service and our overall stay. The hotel is in a very good location, easy access to the subway. Room was tastefully decorated and clean. Would stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a block from the miracle mile. Great bus connections. It is a small suite. There is microwave, small fridge. Two desks (although there is no light on the desk in the bedroom). Very happy with it. Nice restaurant downstairs. Starbucks also in lobby for quick snack.  [END]
[BEGIN] very clean, and stylish but pool and other places were much smaller than it looks on the website lots of gay people... right next to time square so easy to do out at night  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel and nice staff hotel. Although a little bit far away from Times Square, is next to a subway station. Very good option in New York. I tottaly recommend it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Still being reburished when we stayed, but we had a new room and were more than comfortable. The room was small for two people, but not unpleasantly so. It's a brilliant location and good value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed three nights: yes, the rooms are a bit small but the location can't be beat, the employees are waaaaay customer-oriented, and everything was clean and efficient. Would definitely stay there again (if we had any Marriott points left).  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at the Affinia Shelburne earlier this year for our Honeymoon. Nice, very clean, and a great location for the price!!! It was maybe a 10 minute walk to Grand Central & another 10 or so to Times Square. Would definately stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 night business trip. Prepaid on kayak for a very good rate for the area. Rooms recently redone. cafe in lobby offers good breakfast options without breaking the bank. Full breakfast also available. Gym in basement with Windsors for good people watching while on the treadmill.  [END]
[BEGIN] i stayed in this hotel for 2 nights over the weekend it is a small boutique hotel with very nice rooms very clean and cosy. located right in front of the rockefeller center, between 5th and 6th ave. recomended  [END]
[BEGIN] Large rooms with good facilities. Location is in downtown but quite remote - no decent restaurants close by. Restaurant facilities on site as well as pool facilities. Friendly staff. Good transport facilities in front of the hotel (tram line)  [END]
[BEGIN] The front desk staff were great! I love the indoor pool and hot tub. The carpet in the halls smell funny and should be replaced, but the staff made my experience a pleasant stay while I was away on business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Evening cocktails and breakfast! Concierge were very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gerry is a true gem! The hotel was more than I expected. Room was ok, breakfast was good, and everything was clean. But the hotel staff was awesome, friendly, and very helpful! Gerry was wonderful! Good luck to you Gerry and keep up the good work!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean and quiet, friendly staff, and a great location. I didn't need a cab at all. Walking distance to a lot of great shops and places to eat. I will definitely stay here next time I travel to New York City.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was fine size wise. Furniture (wood) was beaten up/tired, shower had some black mildew at the grout lines of a couple of tiles. Location was great. Bed comfort was great! Staff was pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] This time around we were treated to a very nice room (334) on the third floor. No view but quiet and very roomy (Essex Junior Suite). The staff are always very helpful and we had an overall great stay!  [END]

[BEGIN] Clean, looks recently renovated. Friendly staff (although the concierge was a bit testy at times). Excellent service. Would definitely stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little older property but very nice rooms. We were there for a special occasion and they had champagne for us.  [END]
[BEGIN] For just over $200 inlcuding taxes, you get a spacious (my Manhattan standards) and clean room, PERFECT location, and competent staff. Best value in the city it seems.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, comfortable, modern. NYC hotels notoriously expensive. (Why???!). Couldn't find anything, anywhere else in the city for the price that came near (we paid just over $100 per night). Doesn't have food or breakfast but free cappucino machine is a great touch!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is convenient to Time Square. The rooms are a good size for a New York City room. The desk staff were very accommodating and the morning breakfast was yummy. It was a good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to Broadway shows. Walked to Central Park. Great restaurants in Hell's Kitchen. Double decker bus at night. The room was OK, but you're in NY, go out and explore. Neighborhood was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location,convenience, value. GREAT staff in hotel and restaurant .Good selection and reasonably priced and the wait staff excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked this hotel through Expedia. Inadvertently we were double booked Be sure to check your credit card charges before going to hotel as they were unwilling to cancel our "second" room even though both room bookings were identical. Hotel appears to be very inflexible.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, the Holiday Inn Midtown had large clean rooms and a great location! I heard lots of horror stories about NYC motels, especially size and cleanliness. It was a pleasant surprise!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is right beside world trade center and a $13 cab ride to times square. Very clean comfy rooms....love the beds and pillows....rooms big for New York city and kid friendly! Would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 4 nights in early May. Room was clean and comfortable. Very close to the Lake and to the shops at 900 Michigan. There is a charge for wifi in room but it is free in the lobby, which is very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at Affinia recently; location was a short cab ride to/from LaGuardia, the people were friendly, and the bed comfortable. Location pretty good, 10 minute walk to Grand Central Station. Clean  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel and room sizes and shared bathrooms were exactly as promised. So It would be silly to comment on sizes. But the amenities, the cafe, the club downstairs, the service, the lobby are all more than I ever expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was a decent size and in good shape, the staff were very helpful, the location is convenient, and there was no street noise. For the price, you can't do much better in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was very friendly and rooms were spacious. Not much of a view from our room, but the bed was soft and everything was in order. Close to shopping, Central Park, Rock Plaza and the Theatre District.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are so spacious. Beds are super comfy. Room service was timely. Location is superb. Gym was large. Totally recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big rooms by NY standards. Great location for theater and times square. Several good restaurants with-in short walk. Hotel food and bar above average. Will go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value! Good hotel to choose if you are budget-minded. The pool area is excellent and enjoyable for kids and adults. It is a smaller hotel with fewer amenitites, but it was clean and comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for three nights in one bed apartment. Basic accommodation with good facilities within walking distance of major attractions. Staff friendly when asked for directions quickly found us a map and gave advice. Breakfast ranged from cereal, waffles, fruit and pastries all fresh and readily available. Would use hotel again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ligging van het hotel is perfect, midden in het hart van Manhatten op 10 lopen van Times Square. Kamers zijn prima, schoonmaak van de kamers dagelijks en dus perfect, alleen het hotelpersoneel aan de receptie mag wel wat vriendelijker. Aanrader voor een citytrip naar NY!  [END]
[BEGIN] Chambers is a small friendly hotel just off 5th avenue close to Central Park. It has a nice small restaurant attached, friendly staff and interesting decor. The decor is warehouse modern, with modern bathrooms and appointments. A good recommendation for a reasonably priced small hotel in NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely hotel, great location! All the best shops & great restaurants are really close by!! Rooms look a little tired, but the beds are really comfy & staff are very friendly. Would stay here again DEFINATELY.  [END]

[BEGIN] Loved the location. Close to subways and right behind Carnegie Hall.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed here several times and have found the rooms to be clean and the staff friendly. Along with the good location and affordable price, what more do you want? I will be staying there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cool and chic atmosphere. Be prepared for the nightlife...it's crazy!  [END]

[BEGIN] Very beautiful hotel! Rooms were amazing and the service was fabulous. I did not care for the food in the hotel. I found the restaurant to be very overpriced and did not like my food.  [END]

[BEGIN] Only 1 block from House of Blues, Easy walking distance to main street ,shopping,staff was helpfull with directions  [END]

[BEGIN] Came in handy when many other hotels were over priced for a Thursday. Fine size room, friendly service, nice lobby.. No complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very well situated in "boystown," for those looking for LGBT nightlife. It's listed as a boutique hotel--not quite sure how accurate that is, but it is a very nice place. The staff were great--very helpful and friendly. Thumbs up all around.  [END]
[BEGIN] We would like to recommend the Blake. Rooms very nice with neat view. Great location., nice employees  [END]
[BEGIN] Fashion 26 was lovely. The service, although not excellent, was pretty good. The rooms, though fairly small, are nicely appointed though there is no full mini bar. They offer smoking good deals for NYC and it is a great location if you like to be in Chelsea or that neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] No big deal here. Your basic airport marriott; nothing fancy, nothing wrong. Lounge was fine for breakfast; room was fine. A good thing to do if you have a morning flight out of Houston and don't want to worry about getting to the airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent 4 nights at The Muse....location fine (100 mts from Times Square / 500 mts Rockerfeller Centre etc) Hotel was top class , room small but elegant. High standard of cleanliness. Front of house friendly and effective. Decoration modern .Would have no problem returning.  [END]

[BEGIN] Not a fancy hotel but well situated and clean and friendly. Located opposite madison square garden, and just a short distance from empire state. Breakfast is best eaten just up the street, restaurant next door is good value. Also has an interesting history.  [END]

Del resto e' un po' lontano dal centro ma servito bene dalle varie linee della metro.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here due to the close proximity to Soldier Field. The free parking, nice bar and restaurant, along with the excellent customer service, are the major reasons I will return to this hotel for business or pleaure trips. Big spacious rooms as well. Thank you Jackie for your thoughtfulness!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel with clean and quiet rooms (we had 2 King suites). Excellent breakfast included in price, which is a great added value in New York. Close to Times Square and subway station, but the place itself is not very nice ... Would definitely recommend !  [END]
[BEGIN] I went here recommended by a friend and my experience was pretty good small but very cute and clean. Great location if you are there for business. Close to everything. I will definitely consider this place again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was clean, comfortable and well staffed, and I had no problems at all. If I have to make a flight out of O'hare, I will be staying here again. And the $9/day parking beats the $13/day at O'Hare any day!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is great it's nice and clean though a little bit too far away from the 'action' of the magnificent mile. Easy walking distance to the lake from here and shopping not too faraway. Staff very friendly and helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] A colleague recommended the Lucerne after a recent stay. The staff was most helpful, the lobby and the rooms are very nicely appointed and the bed was fabulous. I will go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to sublet the very top apartment (Room # 1030) from a rich guy from Luxembourg who lived there for a long time. You had to sidestep a lot of silliness and drama, however, it was a great place to be.  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoyed the week's stay! & thank especially Frank & Dion for their helpfulness & friendly advice. Certainly would like to come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the doormen. Room was very spacious for $99. Right behind the John Hancock building. Just off MIchigan Avenue, so can take your goodies back to your room rather than lug them around all day. Hope to return soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] From the minute we walked in the service was excellent. We wanted to be on Michigan Ave. and this was south of the shopping but only a brief walk. Room was very good with wonderful lake view. Old charm in the hotel but updated throughout. I would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Though small, room is very well organized. Bed was comfortable, linen was of good quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel was very nice, quite and just love the comfort but will need to get king size bed the double was ok was all they had during labor day weekend staff wonderful  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place to stay. Friendly staff ! Very close of time square!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very Very comfortable bed and super dark rooms, The 12 pillow menu will have you dreaming. Cozy, comfortable and clean. The late check out allows for late sleep in and breakfast before you go about your day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brian the doorman made my visit!!! He was friendly, helpful, sweet and gave that great New York friendly vibe. I would come back just to have him find me a taxi!!! Thanks! Va Bertholet  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location - close to Wall St for business meetings I had to attend, and also great view from the hotel overlooking the 9/11 memorial. Funky designs in the hotel lobby, cool stylized furnitures in the room. The rooms are slightly smaller than most standard ones, but comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is my second visit here. Staff is excellent and attentive. Good on the first floor, easy to get around. Excellent value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice Hotel with an excellent location perfect nice rooms with very good beds morning breakfast is simple but more than enough subway stations not even 50m away from the hotel so for moving around what can someone ask more surely a place where I will return  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice hotel. Cleaning could be a little better as there was black stuff in the bathtub that we thought were scratches in the finish but the next day were gone...ew! Otherwise it was a nice hotel and the staff were friendly. We got a great deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here last weekend. Rooms were nice and big which is true or all hyatt place hotels. No nearby neighborhoods which was good because this means no foot traffic in the parking lot. Only complaint was the pool was a bit dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, great location, half block from Times Square. You can walk to most of the main Broadway theaters. The room was quite comfortable. Superb attention from staff, specially Nathalie from Front Desk  [END]

[BEGIN] Really loved the hotel stayed there only 12 hours but had a great sleep and good room service ,staff was friendly and got upgraded to a suite ..the good lighting was also a nice detail really lovely hotel !  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was friendly even when we showed up early. The pool was clean and warm. The bar has a nice view. Bed was comfy. Taxi stand in front. View of Chicago... priceless!  [END]
[BEGIN] Never stayed in a hotel like that, on Saturday night the hall was like a club, a real party was happening, but private. Very cool terrace. But the tinest bedroom I ever stayed, but cool decoration. Great location close to Central Park.  [END]
[BEGIN] i have stayed in this hotel 3 times now. what more would you need on a fun break in New York. Great location 5 min. from Macys, very secure, nice and warm and clean, great coffee and muffins to kickstart a long busy day in NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] net modern hotel, prima prijs/kwaliteit verhouding, goed bed, dagelijkse schoonmaak en aanvulling handdoeken ed. en ze hebben een persoonskamers. met een goede privebadkamer. helaas geen minibar. lokatie was redelijk goed; vlakbij empire state building en 5th avenue. times square en the village waren te lopen maar wel iets verder weg.  [END]
[BEGIN] Boom! That's a choice. Walking distance from main NY attractions. Great rooms. Great Service. Sometimes lobby a bit noisy, but...  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice shops to walk to. Starbucks one block away!!! Staff welcoming. Room was quite nice, priced high for the area, but it was close to where I needed to be. Buffet breakfast, very nice. Taxi available  [END]
[BEGIN] Except for some mold (or is it mildew?) on the bathroom ceiling, this Hotel was perfect for Broadway. Valet parking, check-in, breakfast and overall organization was efficient and reassuring. Having so many theaters within steps of the Hotel was an added treat.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was a stop-gap until my prefered hotel had availability the following night. However, i actually prefered this hotel!! I was basic, but good location and clean and friendly. Wish i would have stayed here all week!!  [END]
[BEGIN] New York City was great and this hotel was very convenient in terms of walking out the door proximity to public transportation, stores, restaurants. Even at midnight it was well-lit and safe to walk around. Room was clean but average. Doormen were very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is more like a members only club. The rooms are efficiently organized, clean, and very comfortable. The staff is very pleasant and professional. You get wi-fi and coffee in the room. I recommend this facility to the busy business traveler.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel & good location. Very nice room considering the price. Would definitely stay there again. No unwanted critters found!  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms ok but nothing flash? But location is fab! We stayed 3 nights and would recommend friends and family to stay!  [END]

[BEGIN] The best part of this hotel was the great location. Nice clean rooms with lovely bathrooms. Try to ask for the highest floor possible. You might get some kind of a view that way. Concierge was not very helpful, but whatever.  [END]
[BEGIN] he estado en ese hotel en dos oportunidades y tanto la atencion como las habitaciones, limpieza, confort, han sido inmejorables. lo recomiendo tanto como para viaje de placer, como para viaje de negocios, lo he recomendado y toda la gente quedo encantada. !!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] A lovely hotel with pleasant, helpful staff. Only negative is that the location is not as central as I would have liked.  [END]
[BEGIN] More 'Urban Amercian' than the New York, Chicago is cool and being i the W makes it even cooler Great views, location and bar  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was super and the service was great. Bill made sure that our stay at the Iroqouis was fantastic. I would definitely stay at the Iroquois again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, safe and excellent location. I'd recommend Doubletree for families, since the rooms are big, have a fridge and the location is so good. Whenever travelling with family we return here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean,no carpets,bug free environment Free credit towards minibar great way to get water without being a "platinum" Good location. Complimentary coffee in am and wine after wk all in lobby.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good value for money; nice design; very close to Times Square; great roof top bar views!  [END]
[BEGIN] very affordable, very cute hotel. rooms were very small, but very charming! computer with internet in the room was very helpful. above all...LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION was great!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm planning on staying downtown later this week....is the neighborhood ready or should I stay in midtown? I've enjoyed staying at this hotel before and have found it be very convenient and reasonably priced. Are the restaurants in the area opened for business? Any insight would be welcomed!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not exactly in Time Square, which is a plus for me, closer to "Hell's Kitchen". Talked to a guy who had stayed there every other week for a year and was back on business. Staff are noticeably friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location - close to Times Square - but far away not to be too noisy. Staff was courteous and rooms were simple and clean. Close to subway stops. Not spectacular, but a solid place to stay for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here for a wedding we attended that was near by. We had no compaints and it was a nice stay and Andrew and Jackie were awesome at checkout!  [END]
[BEGIN] you couldnt ask for a better location, sometimes in manhattan you cant sleep but at this Madison ave location you can...Room is kind of small but the emenities are fantastic. The roosevelt to me is the only place to stay..FANTASTIC service all the way around.  [END]
[BEGIN] Met name de ligging - centraal in Manhatten - is uitstekend. Dit maakt dat veel attracties zoals warenhuizen en Broadway theaters op loopafstand liggen. Verder zijn de hoger gelegen kamers lekker rustig,  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of the more unique places I've stayed. The hotel is very tall and slender. Our room was on the 34th floor, and we had the smallest room on the floor, but our view was stellar. The room was clean, the staff friendly, and the location fantastic!  [END]
[BEGIN] Plusses: Quiet, clean room. Low rate. Good TV with good channel selection. Near some nice restaurants and bars. (30's-40's crowd) Free cookies in the lobby. Minuses: No room service available. Only one elevator - could take some time to get to your room if busy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely beautiful. The only bad thing is that it's a shame that the people in New York can be so cold sometimes. It would be great if they were alot friendlier.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed for five nights, very nice place. the room was clean, but a bit small whitout space for hanging clothes, but i went there only for sleeping so a very good experience in New york and i recommend this hotel whit free internet ...  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 2 nights. Staff is wonderful. Rooms are clean and nicely done but for 1 person. The same with the bathroom. So small. The James has the same look and feel just a lot bigger and closer to it all.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is located in a very good central location. Room are a very good size for NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Last min. trip.. super easy to get to, and easy parking ($20- better than most at $40). Amazing view!! Great location. Bathrooms are a little small & rooms are dated, however, rooms are clean and a good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a great location that is walkable to everywhere. Central Park, Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Radio City Music Hall etc. We stay here often and the staff is always great and the rooms are always clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] I chose this hotel because it was the most inexpensive of trip advisor's top 15 in New York City. It was a home run. The hotel is clean and the rooms are modern. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value, friendly service and overall clean and neat. They comped us breakfasts for no reason which was very nice of them. Had a good time would go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just came back from Swissotel a couple of weeks ago. Amazing location, literally steps from magnificant mile. Hotel is very nice! nice decor! only downside was that we had a view of the construction right next door. Other then that i would have given it 5 stars!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a few blocks from the Hampton Jitney. We had a renovated room. So cool. Very comfortable, great linens, quality furnishings. The Empire State Building was right outside our window. I'll be back and tell lots friends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excelent hotel, perfect location, good staff overall except front desk team (aboslutely tragical). I had serious problems to check in, front desk team unprepared, lack of understanding and really unpolite, a complete headache. It seems that totally out of Hyatt usual first class standards. Too bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gild Hall is a nice change from bland hotels with a nice interior lounge bar area, small cafe on the side giving a dark, winter feel. The rooms are good in lounge with comfy bed, but not sure it offers value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great staff. Great location. Needs renovation but all in all a great place to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] After staying so many times in different hotels in NY This was a great surprise. The location cannot be better , the rooms are clean and spacious and the price........ very very reasonable  [END]
[BEGIN] Een prima basic hotel, dichtbij alle bezienswaardigheden. Heel centraal gelegen, de Gray Line tours op de hoek (en in hotel) Safe deposit box niet in kamer, maar achter receptie (no charge) Goede security bij deur en liften. Lekker authentiek USA style. En goed geprijsd.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great hotel at a good price. All the staff was helpful and nice. The room is small but has all that you need, lots of outlets which are important to me. The neighborhood is good but not great for shopping. I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the Sam Houston in late August for approximately 2 weeks. It has a very modern decor, and extremely professional staff. The hotel restaurant had awesome food. It was a very enjoyable stay, I would definitely go back again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was only in the hotel one night, but it was clean, comfortable, and well maintained. Several restaurants nearby and easy access to the freeway. Will stay here again when I am in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was small, and the sink area has no place to put toiletries, but it was clean and the beds were comfortably firm. Service was outstanding. Each request (towels, kleenex, etc.) was responded to with lightening speed. The breakfast was decent and the location couldn't be beat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima hotel, schone kamers, heerlijke bedden! Uitzicht was niet zo best, echter maakte dat niet uit daar we er alleen maar sliepen. Midden in centrum, dichtbij alle highlights. Ontbijtzaal beetje aan de kleine kant, ontbijt is voldoende.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was above average. The location was fantastic and the price was unbeatable through www.hotwire.com. There is a pool but it is set up for laps (exercising) not really just available for soaking and relaxing in the water.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice staff, clean property, great location & spectacular views (the Lakeview in West Tower is at the end of the hallway and thunderstorm rolling in was incredible; my riverview room was also just terrific you should ask for the Murphy bed room) - hard to ask for more  [END]
[BEGIN] Of course you cannot beat the views of Times Square - but the staff are amazing and very helpful, as well as fun!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hilton New York is large hotel and impersonal, but rooms are comfortable and has great location. Service work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hier pas geleden bijna een week gelogeerd, prima hotel, kamer was ruim zat, twee grote aparte bedden, schoon, voldoende linnengoed, niets dan lof. Personeel was vriendelijk en meewerkend. Alleen het reisgezelschap viel tegen, maar daar kon niemand van het hotel iets aan doen !!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here three nights for a conference. Good room, updated nicely. Small new York bathroom. Room service very limited. No food onsite at night, which you need if you just want to collaps in your room. Went to a deli close by.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, clean, breakfast- pancakes, sausage, eggs, toast, juice coffee etc. Manager, Nicole was nice. However, if you book from Hotwire you will likely be given a bed with king size and will have to pay extra if you want 2 queen beds.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would definitely stay here again for three main reasons. The rooms are very spacious for a NY city hotel and spotless. The location is spectacular. MOMA is directly across the street and so many places are within in walking including some great restaurants. The staff was great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is excellent, rooms are a good size. The view is lacking, and the entrance/lobby is not flashy, but I didn't come to NY for the hotel views. It was a pleasant experience, and I would definitely stay there again (If I could afford it).  [END]
[BEGIN] Only complaint is no cupcakes spotted or offered the entire time we were there! Otherwise, easy in and out with valet parking. Good floor by floor security although area was good, never felt unsafe. Restaurant loud, but food ok. Good location and clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got back from 3 nights here. Delightful staff from front door to the desk. Everyone was very accomodating. Clean as a whistle, great shower. Damn construction starts at 7 a.m., surely not the hotels fault. Would I stay here again, oh yes. Location, location, location.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here for 3 nights Dec 2011. The front desk was helpful, the room was a good size for New York City. Was very clean, NO BEDBUGS! Good location for walking to Times Square and Macys. Housekeeping came everyday. We were very pleased. Free WiFi too!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was my first visit to times square Hilton.The hotel is very well located in the heart of the city. Very nice breakfast with lot of options.The bed was very comfy and well equipped and modern room.The shower was nice and clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here in October 2011 with 2 friends of mine, we had something like an apartment /2 rooms + kitchenette/, it was spacious, clean. The location is very convenient if you want to explore NY city. Deffinitely recommended. Price was ok, too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved this old hotel. Huge rooms ! Great price and warm and friendly staff. Would stay again and the location is fantastic. Grab the $4 breakfast, wow !  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very good hotel, located centrally in Manhattan. The perfect starting point to discover Manhattan. Very cheap for what you get. Whenever we are back in NYC, we will definitely stat at this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] abbiamo soggiornato un asettimana in questo albergo ero io e la mia fidanzata ci siamo trovati molto bene stanze accoglienti, bagni grandi, colazione buona locali puliti ottima esperienza vicino alla metropolitana  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, two minutes from I-10. You can walk inside a tunnel with A/C to the Memorial City Mall or next door to the Memorial Hermann Memoriay City Medical Center. Hotel has a complimentary shuttle to business nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in 2419 recently. Paid extra for the lake view. Yes, you can see the lake but it is partially blocked by some buildings. This was a nice hotel and cleaner/nicer than most I've stayed in. The staff was great too. I have no complaints!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and clean rooms. Didn't spend a lot of time in the hotel but it was comfortable when we were there.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location, large clean room with dated furniture. Pleasant surprise  [END]
[BEGIN] Although smalll and a little tatty. Comfortable clean. Get a room with a bathroom. Great location walking distance to empire state. If you want luxury, no way. This place is convinent, clean, and brill value. New York is amazing. Invest in good shoes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, clean rooms, friendly staff. They helped us get around the city, made recommendations for restaurants, and overall were a great help.  [END]
[BEGIN] Likes: - location direct in chinatown - restaurants nearby - close to travelbus - NY business district nearby - close to underground Dislikes: - the rooms are facing the Manhattan bridge, hence noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and good,accomodations ,room was small but newly rennovated. Our room seemed to have lots of noise from outside which was somewhat bothersome. Parks and Museums are close and within walking distance. There was a nice breakfast buffet in the restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] This grand old hotel has been restored beautifully. Great stay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a great price on this hotel. Love the location. Had breakfast each morning next door in Viande. Markets across the street were handy for snacks and drinks. Subway at 72nd St. is very convenient, and Central Park is only a few blocks to the east.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is my favorite New York hotel. It can be a bit pricey, but is a lovely, very safe property. Their customer service is excellent and you absolutely cannot beat the location. Very close to the subway, Broadway and some excellent restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exciting interior decoration, the most beautiful mini bar ever. Wonderful roof top terrace and drinks to die for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Breakfast and Airport Shuttle. This hotel should be a 3 star. I were at this hotel two years ago, they have done a lot of updates.  [END]

[BEGIN] Really good location just off 5th avenue at the Empire States Building. Staff were helpful with everything we asked of them. Close enought to transport link to everywhere in Manhattan and beyond.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobby has nice mellow atmosphere with lit candles and nice low-key lighting. Some of the rooms are a very good size, with large closets and nice, new furniture-- modern. Views can be very cool if placed in right room. They're doing a good job. Luxurious feel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was friendly and the rooms were comfortable and clean. I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average Rooms but very clean, awesome staff, great location... well worth it for the price  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel was peaceful and clean. It was close to the wall street subway stop and the area was very secure and safe. The complimentary chilled water stations are great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had one complaint, i got charged 25.00 for each room i booked on my credit card. without any explination. I would like to know why. It was paid for before i left on my credit card. what was the 25.00 fee for?  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel has a great location, it is possible to go walking to many attractions. The staff was very helpful and the room was very comfortable!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a lovely small hotel, in a central location (just off theatre district) great for exploring Manhattan. Rooms were tiny, but when in New York, there isn't much point staying in your hotel room! Helpful concierge who suggested a fantastic steak restaurant - Ben Benson's Steak House.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Affinia Manhattan is located right in the center of the city, directly across from Madison Square Garden. It offers old world charm in a contemporary boutique style hotel. Very comfortable and extremely clean at a very affordable price. Renovated with a contemporary look and a home-like feel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location...attentive staff..clean rooms...Very quiet .no street noises...Breakfast in 540Park better than the normal hotel fare....2 closets one a walk-in..lighting could be better and bathroom hotwater hard to regulate....  [END]
[BEGIN] The location one block East of Michigan Avenue is convenient to shopping and good to great restaurants. Some rooms can be a bit on the small size and you sometimes feel like you have to squeeze into the bathroom, but it works for me and my husband.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was at Metro Hotel during this summer. I think it's really one of the secret of New York. The room were clean and quite large for 2 people, but the cherry on the cake is the breakfast, a big continental buffet with deliciouse baggles and croissant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location. We had a 2 bedroom suite. This was a great choice for my uncle, myself and my 2 daughters. It would be nice if the internet fees were not so high, but a short walk to the Starbucks kept my oldest from internet withdrawal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location wasn't great, the adjoining mall was very basic and had average shops. Only 5minute walk to Macy's though. Room was stylish and well appointed. Staff very helpful. Hotel atmosphere was nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] surprisingly quiet and great location. the bed was so comfortable, very nice expereince. Lobby leaves alot to be desired, but service and concierge was fine. would stay again  [END]
[BEGIN] Sono stato al Park Central con mia moglie,e' un buon Hotel e logisticamente perfetto,entrale e ti permette di arrivare facilmente nei posti piu' belli ed importanti della Grande Mela.....Il prezzo e' buono contando che e' e situato al centro della citta'.  [END]
[BEGIN] Econo Lodge, a simple but cosy hotel, was our best (and cheapest) option to feel and live Times Square! No, you won't be treated exclusively, but, for its price, you'll feel like a VIP in an easy ambiance with friendly and helpfull staff! We'll be back: that's for sure! Ourtravelingwithoutmoving.wordpress.com  [END]
[BEGIN] Allure van Park Avenue zonder overdreven gedoe. Kamers zijn goed, badkamer klein, maar voldoende. Staf en bediening zijn vriendelijk. De bar is niet echt gezellig, maar er is genoeg in de buurt voor wie buiten het hotel iets wil eten of drinken.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Whitehall is a good basic hotel, recently renovated providing clean well furnished rooms. Two downsides, internet charges for an inferior system and elevator service that is inadequate. Don't expect frills like restaurants, but a good clean experience that is often a great buy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well, it's a big hotel in need of renovation, but the location is good and the rooms are quite comfortable. The reception staff was surprisingly attentive, especially reception manager Rita. Considering NY prices, it's a reasonable value. Perfect for a business traveller.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff. Clean. Easy self park. Most importantly, right across the street from the Galleria and a bit pricey as a result.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked this before it was refurbished as a hotel, got great rate. Was not disappointed nicely decorated very clean, good location, very pleasant staff, nice room decent size. Don't drink too much though, bar prices are high. Some excellent deli's nearby for good breakfasts and lunches.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was our second stay at the Westin. We were upgraded to a beautiful corner room looking at the Empire State bldg. a very very clean upscale hotel with immaculate service. This will be our go to place to stay in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, rooms are very clean, a bit small but larger then some hotels we have stayed in Manhattan. The bar was bustling, bartender was awesome, the sushi was excellent, best we have had in a long time. Will definately stay again!  [END]
[BEGIN] had a 4 night stay here. Room very comfy, staff helpful and polite, restaurant excellent. My one grumble though, for a high end hotel that has everything you could possibly need, it lacks the one thing that most people want, and thats coffee/tea making facilities..  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been there with my kids...very great location,clean and great service..  [END]
[BEGIN] Just returned from a weeks stay and it was an excellent experience. Friendly staff, clean and quiet room close to Time Square. I would definately recommend this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a great stay in this quite new Hotel. Good location in Tribeca/Soho. Will stay there again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Excellent location, walking distrance to all attractions New York has to offer Friendly staff and comfortable beds TV's could be a little larger  [END]
[BEGIN] We found the staff very helpful and the room was clean and very pleasant. The bed made a big impression. It was centrally located for all sightseeing especially the shopping experience. We would heartly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New York. Great Value for Money  [END]

[BEGIN] I love the affinia hotels experience, with the pillow menu. But there is no free WiFi, for God's sake we live in 2010.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really clean and tidy. Nothing amazing but perfectly nice and good locationn  [END]
[BEGIN] Brief trip through with one night stay. Shuttle pick up worked well. Rapid check and escort to room. Good breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel, especially for the price. The people were nice but you do have to sign a "no partying" clause.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small, quiet and very comfortable hotel. Wonderful bed and shower. Great location!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotels location. was great in the middle of everything. Staff was friendly when asked a question. Loved that they kept our bags for us even though we had to check out so we could still sightseer until our bus left.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful hotel. Great beds and pillows. For the price of the room, they should provide tea or coffee and news paper in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Location, heart of New York business district. Comfortable stay albeit at a steep price. Basic services but convenient location pays for the flips. Recommended stay if one is traveling for business in Manhattan or downtown New York and obviously can afford the room rate  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great deal. Fabulous location, near Central Park. Easy to get to from JFK on the subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel,Very elegant lobby.Rooms are tasteful and elegant with comfortable beds and pillows.Staff was courteous but NOT extremely friendly.Good deal on Priceline for $110/ nt.  [END]

[BEGIN] alles ok in dit rustig gelegen hotel vlak bij Times square; een aanrader  [END]
[BEGIN] Vicino alla metropolitana e due passi da central park. Quartiere tranquillo con tutti i tipi di servizi (ristoranti di tutti i tipi, negozi e due supermercati aperti 24h). Personale gentile. Bellissima terrazza panoramica all'ultimo piano. Lo consiglio sicuramente.  [END]
[BEGIN] Locatie is perfect, dichtbij Times Square. Kamers waren erg warm, bedden iets te hard. Badkamer eenvoudig. Wel schoon en geen lawaai-overlast. Personeel vriendelijk. Ontbijt prima. Je kunt je koffer gratis en bewaakt achterlaten zodat je op de dag van vertrek nog even de stad in kunt...  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved the location of this hotel. The rooms are a bit small but clean and comfortable. It sucks that the only complimentary wifi is in the lobby and you have to pay $10 to use it in your room. So, the wifi area in the lobby is always packed.  [END]
[BEGIN] This very clean, small hotel is on a quiet street with a large variety of shops, restaurants, groceries, and transportation (bus as well as subway) in a two to three block area.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great location - out of the craziness of Times Square. There are limited amenities except the 24 hr free coffee but the rooms are clear and spacious for NYC and convenient to the theater, Bryant Park, Penn Station and 5th Ave.  [END]
[BEGIN] Verblijf was op zich ok, maar mijn kamer was te dicht bij icemachine die zeer luidruchtig was. Dit maakte het slapen en daardoor het verblijf op de kamer minder aangenaam. Mvg. Patrick Van de Vorst  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, relatively local to MSG where we went to see Metallica in concert. Great central area for sightseeing midtown, close to Penn Station and MTA Subway access. Clean room, very comfortable bed.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great historic hotel. Big rooms. Pool is under renovation. Great MJ steakhouse and wine bar in hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for business purposes. They stored my bags since I arrived early and stayed late. The rooms were very spacious by NYC standards and there are plenty of good restaurants within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very good hotel but no free wi fi in room or lobby.Spending $14 to access email for a few minutes is a poor note in this day and age.  [END]

[BEGIN] These people work hard to please you. Never have I had a bad stay with them. I travel with a little dog,and La Quinta doesn't charge extra for him. Plus they have a nice breakfast. Try them, you'll like it.  [END]
[BEGIN] i was pleasantly surprised to find a good size apartment for me and my kids staff were extremely helpful and friendly room was clean and comfortable the hotel is dated but for value it is excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] Eenvoudig maar prima hotel. Goede ligging. goede prijs kwaliteit verhouding. Elke dag netjes schoongemaakt. Slecht uitzicht maar dan kom je ook niet voor. Je bent toch de hele dag op pad. Zou het dus weer doen. Tip: kom in mei. we hadden perfect weer.  [END]
[BEGIN] We select this hotel because the location and the price. We have a none smoking double queen bad room. This is a big room with a good bathroom. The breakfast was good and not expensive. We enjoy our stay in this hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel, very clean, good sized rooms, quit rooms, great breakfast selection. only a short walk to central park and about 20-30 mins to times sqaure. Only pronlem i had was the elevators are very slow. Well worth the money  [END]
[BEGIN] We've stayed at The Berkshire before and this hotel is one of our favorite. The location, rooms and staff are all wonderful. And just as advertised. Sign up with Omni and enjoy free WI-fi and room upgrades.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is centrally located, has great rooms (plus plenty of fresh towels too) and is reasonably priced- what more do you need?!! ooh plus free wifi was a big plus too! I will definitely be staying here again if I'm lucky enough to return to NYC  [END]
[BEGIN] The warmth, coziness and the friendly staff makes it a great hotel. It's location is attractive as it's only couple of blocks from Central Park/Columbus Circle. Though a little pricey, but worth it completely. Only caution is on the size of the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super Lage, direkt am Broadway. Preis - Leistung top  [END]
[BEGIN] Booking this hotel was the best mistake I ever made. Perfect no-fuss New York stay.  [END]

[BEGIN] This is a very nice hotel and is just a few blocks from Central Park. The beds were comfortable and clean, the bathroom small, but adequate. I would highly recommend the Wellington.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location and we had a very quiet room. Breakfast included is pretty average but great service. Near to the shopping and plenty of bars and restaurants. Rooms have small kitchen and built in robes.  [END]
[BEGIN] We couldn't have asked for a better locations for shops, food and proximity to the subway. The room was clean, turn down service each night, and the staff couldn't have been more accommodating. Will definitely be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] A real quaint boutique European style hotel across the street from the Museum of Natural History. Right on the subway line. Next door to where Seinfeld, McEnroe, Stossel, Pandit live.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everyone--from the staff behind the desk to the ladies cleaning my room--were very accommodating and courteous. Great location. Rooms were a bit spartan, but clean, spacious, with a nice work area. For the modest price, an excellent value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not my favorite W experience...but not a bad one by any stretch. It's what you might expect from a W - swanky decor, groovy bar, delicious food and well appointed. Worth the stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a nice view of the river. We could here the room next door. A mistake was made and we were charged for valet parking. The front desk staff quickly resolve this issue upon check out. Overall a very nice stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel had a lot going on. Great people watching, great Chelsea location, very good restaurant and outstanding staff. The one drawback: the rooms are very small.  [END]

[BEGIN] I like this place. It's old school NYC. Amazing location and fab service. I've stayed at St. Regis properties in Washington DC, Shenzhen, Beijing, Miami and now NYC. I totally dug my room and the staff is world class.  [END]
[BEGIN] En general esta bien el hotel el problema es lo lejos que se encuentra lo que dificulta trasladarse a los atractivos no saben como explicarte como irte nadie habla espanol tu no conoces ellos no te explican y es frustrante  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed in this hotel in May, 2012. The location of the hotel is excellent; the rates are very fair and the rooms are very comfartble. I trully recomend this hotel for couples and that desiree to have a great time in NYC. Regards!  [END]

[BEGIN] I stayed in 3 'business' hotels in Houston and this was easily the best. Nothing fancy but big light comfortable room and bathroom. Would happily stay there again on future visits.  [END]
[BEGIN] perfect hotel for business. located one block from the express subway. rooms are spacious for new york and designed with ample desk and closet space. bathroom is sleek and modern. nice bar and restaurant. new favorite boutique hotel in NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] nel complesso un albergo meritevole, posizione, servizio e pulizia ottimi. nel mio caso l'unico neo era rappresentato dalla camera che affacciava sul "cortile interno" senza vista e con il sottofondo permenente dei motori degli impianti di condizionamento, meglio richiedere da subito camere upperfloor e con vista sulla street.  [END]
[BEGIN] In a real neighborhood, the hotel is one block to the subway and a short walk to Central Park. Booked a superior king and opened door to a suite...nice The staff couldn't have been nicer...yes, it's a bit old, but it has old school NY charm  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for business. All staff very friendly. Room was a bit noisy being close to the elevator, but cannot do anything about that.  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoyed staying in this hotel! I regret having to leave. Rooms are good, bathrooms bit old and small. Food is very good, breakfast and dinner. Personel in this hotel is very service minded and friendly. A reason for us to come back next time we are in New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] A beautiful hotel in the heart of Manhattan, well appointed rooms with a touch of class. Good value for such a plush hotel. A few gripes, long reception queues, everyone has their hand out for a tip, poor reception on many TV channels.  [END]
[BEGIN] An extremely cute place. Good value if you can find a rate under $100. Air conditioner loud in room but created a constant noise for me, which I liked. Would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to IAH, friendly service, very good free breakfast, great rate*********************************************************************  [END]

[BEGIN] We loved staying at the Staybridge.. Free breakfasts and meet and greet nights... The locations was fantasic.. Loved our stay  [END]

[BEGIN] the hotel had excellent service and was nicely appointed. place is eerily quiet on the weekends when the business district shuts down.  [END]
[BEGIN] As usual all Sheraton features are present. In addition a discount on food and beverage is offered when participating to the hotel green program which aims at limiting water spillage. I have been impressed by this green attitude.  [END]
[BEGIN] en face central park avec une superbe vue. Pas tres bien insonorise, preferer un etage eleve pour la vue et le bruit. Ne prenez pas le petit dejeuner a l'hotel : trop cher. Chambre sympa, propre mais c'est vrai, un peu vieillote.  [END]
[BEGIN] proche metro / quartier calme , tranquile, securisant / magasins a proximite / micro onde + cafetiere. climatisation bruyante / internet payant  [END]

The rooms were nice, a little small, but completely functional. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would recommend this hotel, good price for location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and a nice tidy hotel, 5-10 minute walk from most of the midtown sights, including Top of the Rock, Times Square, Broadway, and Central Park. The Room had been recently refurbished, but not all the rooms in the hotel are so its worth asking at check in.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a wonderful weekend at this hotel! The staff were fabulous and the rooms are comfortable and quiet. Only negative is lack of free wifi. Will definitely stay here on our next visit to NYC!  [END]

[BEGIN] New York is truly the cit that never sleeps. The wife and i were pleased with this hotel and recommend it to others. The location and convenience to restaurants and shops. It was also near my aunts which made it even more appealing. Clean and generous in space.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a great location with great views of the city/Lake Michigan. The lobby is really nice, but seems a little stuffy. The staff is wonderful and the rooms are comfortable (aside from the tiny bathrooms). We enjoyed our visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Vanaf Lincoln Centre (opera, balles, theater) is het maar 10 minuten lopen terug naar het hotel. De buurt Upper West side is een heerlijke buurt met bijna dorpse sfeer.

[BEGIN] I had an awesome time. It's always good going back to my home town.  [END]

[BEGIN] We stayed here for three nights. Everything was great,the service, the help and most of all the LOCATION was the best. You really could not ask for better. Definatly stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great spot in the Meatpacking/Chelsea area for anyone that wants a step up from the McWyndamSuites, but without the soul-crushing irony-laden attitude of a place like The Ace. The rooms are a bit small, but it's close to everything and the staff there was awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great ambiance particularly where guests get to mingle with other guests. Great position easy walk or subway to anywhere in manhattan. Can't wait to return there. A little bit expensive but worth it.  [END]

[BEGIN] I stayed here with friedns for a wedding. Four of us stayed fairly comfortably in a suite for one night. I really liked how they were set up. We enjoyed ourselves and had no complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and clean room. The worst front office staff you can come across...no greeting, no welcome...they stare at you as to say " what are you doing here "  [END]
[BEGIN] da preferire per un viaggio alla ricerca della concretezza. vicino a time square,dietro ai battelli per le crociere notturne. la camera a me assegnata era grande e comoda. in sintesi da prendere in seria considerazione.  [END]

[BEGIN] The front desk help and the manager were always very helpful and willing to make our stay as comfortable as possible.. W.Greer  [END]
[BEGIN] en general por el precio el hotel llena las espectativas , aunque no deberian decir que desayuno continental esta incluido porque la verdad no hay variedad de alimentos es mas casi nada, al punto que preferimos desayunar afuera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at warwick hotel end of june beginning july for eight nights. Found hotel staff pleasant and helpful. Room reasonably large and clean. Great location within walking distance of many attractions. Would definately stay here again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good location in midtown. The suites are spacious and good for family or group of friends at a reasonable price in a pricey town. Continental breakfast is included so you can start your day without looking for a place to drop $30 for a meal.  [END]
[BEGIN] just the place for a quick stay in manhattan. close to the underground, close to the airports, hassle-free check in and out. rooms are small though, and shared bathrooms make it less than ideal for longer stays (or something bordering on romantic). no complaints though!  [END]
[BEGIN] A nice hotel with an excellent location. We brought a group of 25 law school students and everything was ok (reservations, charges, invoices). Breakfast may get too crowded.  [END]
[BEGIN] An excellent hotel to stay in as it was located near all the main sights. There was a slight mistake about our booking but the problem was rectified very quickly. There was a also a place called Susie's nearby which served excellent breakfast!  [END]

[BEGIN] We stayed at the Hotel over the weekend of Oct 14, 2011. The hotel was old inside, rooms adequate size. Very nice accomodations near all shopping, restaurants, and sightseeing. Would definite stay here again. Staff could not have been more helpful !  [END]
[BEGIN] Such a great experience in Chicago! definately the Windy City, especially in November. Very close to Navy Pier where there is alot going on in the fall.Very close to downtown. The managers meet and greet was very fun every night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Stayed in room 1303, although not large, nicely updated and clean. Service in the lobby bar a bit slow and waiters disinterested.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel - though located in a more quit area than midtown west - is great value for money. The rooms are not big but comfortable and clean! Unfortunately most taxi drivers don't know that this hotel is now the Tudor Hotel, so ask for the Crowne Plaza at 42nd...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location across from the Central park and very nice personnel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel, food pricey and slow elevators. But overall nice room and polite help.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there March 6-8 2012. The service and people were excellent. I had an issue with my toilet and they came as soon as I hung up the phone. Food was good. Location was good also. I would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] 7 Nights at the Omni in April, great location and was very quiet. Close to Central Park and transport, would stay again without a problem.  [END]

[BEGIN] Doesn't look much from outside but was a brilliant find for our two nights in New York. Rooms aren't huge but kind of what you expect in city centre. Location is amazing with times square two mins away and a station across the road to catch the underground.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went to a conference an the people serving us stole my heart. They were very helpful, friendly and happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Of all the doormen in all the cities in all the World the Paramount Hotel has the best of the best of doormen in BRIAN!  [END]

[BEGIN] The lobby was very charming and the rooms were confortable. Not overly opulent but I would stay there again in a heart beat.  [END]

Facile accesso ai quartieri di "downtown" e metropolitana comodissima per raggiungere qualsiasi destinazione a Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, good location and very friendly staff. Complimentary breakfast is a bonus - not very common in NY. We had a very pleasant stay, except for the first night - rooms facing Watts st are noisy!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel. Quick service, nice people, comfy rooms. Good location close to subway. Good if traveling with kids. Just plan on being in room by 9, streets crazy after that. Nice pool area. Good breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] Heres the long and short of it .Was here on business Wonderful loc for theatre door and bell staff were very attentive upon checkin and departure. Front desk needs to be re- trained. rooms fantastic to tech savvy nice hotel but not 5 star.  [END]
[BEGIN] No frills hotel but clean and safe. Our room was on the 8th floor with a bit of a river view And small but we spent so little time in the room that it didn't matter. Staff was friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay at many hotels in New York. I like the Affinia a lot, especially because the location is near my clients. Rooms are a bit dated and one of the elevators was down for a while while i was there. But otherwise no complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] Located a block away from the subway in a pleasant neighborhood, the location is excellent. Can walk to many museums. Staff friendly and helpful and seemed to care about your experience.

[BEGIN] Se dovessi tornare a New York non ospitato da amici tornerei in questo hotel, cortesi e disponibili, anche se capita che si incasinino ACCETTANO LA POSTE PAY, ma comunque chiamate prima nel dubbio. Alla reception parlano correntemente anche lo spagnolo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Albergo comodo, tranquillo e vicino a Times Square. Pulito anche se le stanze non sono molto grandi ed il bagno avrebbe bisogno di essere ammodernato. Nel complesso ci siamo trovati molto bene. Metro a poche centinaia di metri.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here to staff a business event. I found the room to be comfortable and very nicely appointed. No complaints whatsoever. Staff was great and promptly accommodated my request for an early check in. Would stay here again without hesitation.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have stayed here several times and it never disappoints. Rooms are large for NYC, have couches and great city views. It is pricy (getting a room for under $400 should be considered a deal), but what hotel in the heart of Times Square isn't expensive!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, great staff (very friendly and helpful), and very comfortable bed. Only complaint is that there was recurring static on my television and sometimes when the heat when on and off there was a clicking noise. But overall, I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was clean and spacious but the wifi a bit on the slow side. Remember to reserve some time for the breakfast as most hot things are prepared for you. Not in the meaning that they are slow, but it is worth using the time on an excellent breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall this is a fantastic hotel with nice clean basic rooms, friendly staff and a great location. Would stay again. It is unusual now a days to have to pay such high charges for Internet but they do let you print off boarding passes free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed the modern design of the aesthetic And the alternative service by staff in checking in. Rooms are modern and comfy. one draw back, it's pretty noisy even at higher floors, I realize it is NYC but other hotels are just a bit more tranquil  [END]
[BEGIN] Ontbijtruimte is inderdaad klein maar je kunt je broodje, fruit,etc. mee naar de kamer nemen. (ontbijt is beperkt). Het personeel probeert het je op alle mogelijke manieren naar de zin te maken en is vriendelijk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Hotel HUGE by NYC standards good beds clean nice and well taken care of ! all in all a very good hotel A word of Warning aboutr "black cars" vs taxis taxis are usually WAY cheaper and metered please please if you have any questions ask your bellman.  [END]
[BEGIN] a little expensive, but overall great hotel and great location. Stayed there a few nights and my 10 year old son was treated with milk and cookies every night, service was impeccable. very clean and soundproof rooms. definitely recommend and would probably stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice hotel if you want to stay close to Town and Country and City Center. Its very modern. Only downside is you can hear your neighbors. Also ask for a room with view of city center...otherwise you will stare at a building..  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, comfortable hotel room for 3 people. No problem with bathroom for average size people! Fantastic view of Chrysler building from hotel room.Overall a great find in new york for a first time visitor :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Radisson Martinique is a perfect hotel, in a very good location. The staff is helpfull, I recomend to someone will visit New York.  [END]

[BEGIN] Clean very nice rooms. Little pricey but understandable for location. Staff helpful and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Praticamente in centro, quasi di fronte al MOMA, vicinissimo alla 5th avenue e a central park. L'albergo ideale dove alloggiare qualche giorno ed essere vicino a tutto. Accoglienza e camere eccellenti come in tutti gli Hilton, aria condizionata altissima e macchine del ghiaccio nei corridoi. Fantastico.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at your hotel in April of this year for Business. The service was phenomenal, the rooms pleasant and your fitness room was above expectations. When I go back to the Houston area, I plan to stay at your Hotel again.  [END]
[BEGIN] was very nice. Great new spa. Great location. Loved the Bentley!  [END]
[BEGIN] The prices in the city were insane. Yet this hotel provided reasonable cost. Rooms are relatively small yet comfortable. The walls are very thin. You can hear the "morning music", which may provide a strange wake up call. Well, changing vocals are perhaps better than the alarm clock...  [END]
[BEGIN] Very comfortable furnishings which enabled a good night's sleep every night. Good work space setup. Friendly and attentive service... especially Domingo Martinez who greets guests dining for breakfast with a smile each morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] On 38th and Park Ave. Very clean classy hotel in good area. Very good service from staff. Price, not too bad for NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Modern, nice and cozy hotel in New York City. There's a pantry in every floor where you can have nice coffee and drinks. Times Square is walking distance from the hotel, but that would be a pretty loooooong walk,  [END]
[BEGIN] You really can't beat the Park Central if you're looking for a hotel in Uptown Manhattan. Inexpensive, clean, and enough character to be undeniably NY. We stayed for 4 nights in April 2012, and we will be back for our next stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was very friendly from the moment we arrived on Thursday afternoon and checked out on Saturday morning. I would like to stay here again but I would like to try another Microtel in the Houston area.  [END]
[BEGIN] this is my first time in Down town Chicago and the attencion in the hotel are exceptional  [END]
[BEGIN] Could not fault any part of our trip. Staff were so helpful and room was excellent. Were given an upgrade and on 30th floor. View was tremendous!!!! Hotel was very central and within walking distance of many attractions. Would definitely recommend. Hope to go bck soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] rooms a great size for NYC, very comfortable...corridors a bit dated and vending rooms very smelly. Hotel staff very helpful and accomodating, hotel bars and restaurants very good tho room service and some meals very overpriced. overall FABULOUS hotel and fantastic city  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived in Houston after a long flight, picked up rental car, then an easy drive to the Hilton Garden inn. Very quiet hotel, considering the distance to the Airport. Enjoyed a great uninterupted night's sleep, then headed off the next morning refreshed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Suite with Queen size bed was fabulous! Very quiet on the 18:th floor. The location to the Subway line 1 just two blocks away. the neighborhood is littered with god restaurants, nice food market just across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed two nights in May. The room was small but had enough space. The room was quiet and clean and aircondition worked well (it was hot when I visited NY). Subway #6 station was nearby and bus stop was close. Very convenient location and affordable price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: Clean place to drop your bags and go, vintage feel, old New York appeal. Reasonable price for NYC. Cons: Tiny room and bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have a very unexplained entrance to this date but after we talk everything get very well.after all we just traveling 4000 miles to stay one week and we were trap in the heat wave that day only. The rest is very good and the breakfast and service are excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reasonably sized rooms for Manhattan. About 20 blocks to Times Square. Breakfast bar was average. Don't expect NY bagels. You'll get the regular Hampton fare. The breakfast room was tight and very crowded. The room was well maintained and clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, the room was small, but I was surprised by how nice it was. And, having paid only $100/night on Priceline, I felt it was a very good value. I would certainly stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] great location for times square, subway, Broadway etc. nice rooms, great complimentary breakfast, would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] arrived, checked in early, straight to room which was a small double and bigger than I expected. Usual free water, nice coffee machine in room, free wifi....perfect location. Would defo stay here again. Did their Rockefeller hotel last year at same time and was also superb....personal preference is Midtown (location)  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Location- close to subway, manhattan attractions Many free extras: WIFI, HOT Breakfast Great Bar off of Lobby!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a wonderful hotel, old world style like others have mentioned. Away from noise, beautiful bar...very quaint. If you stay longer than a few days they know you by name. Would defiantly stay here again. We did "chauffered" in the Rolls Royce!  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent three days at the Westin and enjoyed its location. Within walking distance to all of the Times Square hot spots. Room had a great view of Times Square. Front desk was efficient and helpful. Room was immaculate, and bed was very comfortable. Would definately return!  [END]
[BEGIN] Affinia Manhattan - We stayed in a 10th floor corner room that was quite large. View of Empire State Building. Kitchen was fine. Very nice room. Staff friendly. Highly recommended. Lower midtown location is fine after you learn to avoid the crowds at Madison Square Garden/Penn station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel, super clean, knowledgeable staff, would recommend the place without any reservations. Highly recommended hotel, close to the main road Westheimer road which has every possible place on it that you could want.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location just a short walk from times square and very modern and clean. Would come back again any time. Perfect hotel for a five night stay in New York. Cabins were well laid out and thought through. Plenty of places to eat and drink nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent 3 nights here. Room was fine if a little dated but there was nothing wrong with it. 10 minute walk to city centre so brilliant location. Large pool and Gym. Buddy Guy's Blues club only one block away so had great evening there and Buddy was at the bar!  [END]
[BEGIN] This location is close to what you need. Just 6 blocks to Michigan Ave. The place could use some updating but everything worked and was clean. The front counter folks were helpful as well. I would book again  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable hotel, close to airport. Only about a five minute drive from the airport, which was great for me. Room was comfortable. Breakfast was good and the wait staff very effecient. If I needed to stay close to the airport again, I would probably stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a quite nice place to stay in. We think it is situated well and it is a good choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had an excellent stay in this hotel. We asked to be put in a room away from the street as this is a nightlife area and it was nice and quiet. The staff were friendly and helpful. I would stay here again and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean room, great location. The room is small and kind of dreary, and loud in the a.m. from nearby trains, but considering how affordable it is compared to nearby hotels that's about what you'd expect. I'd stay here again, definitely.  [END]
[BEGIN] We took a room with double bed, private bathroom with the view on a street. Everything is new, clean. Fresh towels everyday. A lot of young people from around the world.The building inside will be renovated this Year. Very nice neighborhood.Deli just around the corner, open 24/7, I recommend!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is perfect for a leisure trip- just minutes walk from Times Square, clean, comfortable, pretty good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time visiting NYC and stayed at this hotel. It was very convenient to everything. we walked to Times Square and other attractions with no problems. Very close to Penn Station in Madison Square Garden. LOTS of shopping in the fashion district is close by. Rooms were comfortable and clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot central to all. Older building with great old style stairway but rooms are a little small but nice. Room service very expensive as well as bar even for NYC. Was happy that it's now a part of Marriott Very nice staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] although the rooms are small, they are nicely decorated and interestingly laid out. Service was good, looby was pretty and location in theater district was perfect. The price made it an absolute deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friend and I meet at the Soho Grand every December. Every year we are treated well and the doormen greet guests with a smile! The hotel is clean and staffed with professional, courteous people. Wonderful hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got back from a 4 night stay at the Roosevelt Hotel... The hotel was fine but our room was very warm and could not get it to cool down. I called about it but nothing was done. It is a great location to stay at though.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel is very crisp, elegant and modern with a hint of European class. The lounge/Bar is absoutly devine. I was very impressed with the professionalism of the staff, and the precise cleanliness of my room. Top star and great price. I will stay again and again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was clean, plenty of space and the staff was very helpful with all of my plans for our large group.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the ALoft for two nights on a business trip. Large (for New York), comfortable room with personality. The staff were very attentive, polite and welcoming. Many good restaurants within easy walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to book caused problems before the trip with writing emails, that I would have problems with my Mastercard. I contacted the hotel in front and it was not true. A lot of trouble for nothing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The title says it all. This is a very good basic hotel that met all our needs. The room was tiny and we had to ask for adequate heat (which came soon enough); but one doesn't go to Manhattan to hang around one's hotel room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Major advantage is vast and clean rooms, great view of the roof tops. Ideally located. Excellent value.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a ideal location. It is a really lovely, clean hotel with good bars and resturants. We had a really enjoyable stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our second stay, and again can't fault it for value for money and location. Suited us down to the ground. A better room as we paid a little more which was definately worth the money, if we had one with us we could have swung a cat this time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were outdated, needs updating - especially bathroom. Location was the reason for the stay at this location. Has McDonalds next door for meals. The kitchenette was a nice additions.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is right around the corner from the Empire State Building and walking distance from Times Square. Staff was very helpful and the hotel was very clean and comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Per chi non ha particolari pretese, per chi utilizza l`hotel solo come punto di appoggio .... sicuramente il compromesso che offre il St.James e' accettabile e non ha nulla da invidiare agli altri per la posizione nel cuore di Time Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our Group went to NY for a conference. We were greatly surprised when we checked in to the Staybridge. The rooms were larger and very clean. The staff was great and always a pleasure. Breakfast was included and this helped with our budget.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had an amazing stay at the night hotel. Everything is so cozy, dark and quiet. Location is perfect, employees nice and helpfull.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was afraid that it was in a noisy position, but our room and the street of the entrance are ok!  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived at 12:15 am, but service was exceptional, and the rooms were beautiful. The hotel has been bought over and renamed to Hotel 31, but you could never tell just looking at it. Literally. They haven't gotten around to taking down the Holiday Inn sign. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] My mom and I stayed for a weekend. Check in was a breeze. Room clean if a little scruffed up. Hotel is large and smack in the middle of Times Square but quiet inside. Bartender in restaurant was nice, as were doormen who hustled to get us cabs repeatedly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have stayed here many times. Service is always very good. Had Internet and tv issues, but they were resolved. Wish they would upgrade tvs to a flat screen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great spot to stay for business or leisure travel; very clean (no bedbugs); friendly staff; great location near subways. Breakfast could use a little help!  [END]
[BEGIN] I choose it because of the location. Fantastic. Great value. Hilton usually comes through. Lobby very busy but we got to our rooms quickly. Also, the rooms at the Hilton are a nice size. It's a good value for the price. Great family hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Hotel I would definitely stay again. I guess the only problem that I could think of would be the fact that the hotel offers valet only parking. $23 a night. But the valet staff worked quickly when called upon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent stay. Nice conference facilities. A bit dated in some areas, and obvious that renovations have been ongoing to update. But overall a good hotel with friendly staff. Turn the A/C down in common areas folks - wouldn't have been surprised to see snow in the lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] We needed a place near Grand Central. Priceline got us there for $195/night and the quoted price at the hotel was over $550. Midtown - East for business, this was perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there in august. For being so hot outside the room was actually a nice relief from the heat. Although they were a little on the small side, it was inviting and accommodating. Service was nice, very personable.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is great for people on a budget! Although rooms are not the biggest they are a comfortable for two people. Room was very clean and staff were extremely helpful and so friendly! Would recommend this hotel for both long and short stays.  [END]
[BEGIN] This cosy hotel is very nicely located two blocks away from Michigan Avenue, very close to the John Hancock Center. The staff is nice, but nothing special. The breakfast on the other hand is amazing - certainly the best breakfast I had in a hotel in US.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very central hotel. 5 mins from Times Square. Rooms are not big but have everything you neeed except fridge. Bathroom very small but spotless with fresh towels and toiletries every day. Good place to stay if you are sightseeing and are not spending long in your room.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm in a group that meets here every week. Service is always amazing. The staff takes excellent care of us. We feel like they're family. The food is always freshly prepared and there's a nice variety.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect position right on Times Square and across the road from theatres (Lion King). Easy walk down Fifth Avenue and Central Park. Good sized bedroom and bathroom. Excellent breakfast - but expensive. Excellent restaurant across the road at very reasonable prices. Airport shuttle convenient - allow 1 hour.  [END]
[BEGIN] staff were very helpful room small but comfortable perfect location close to centeral park great resturants sybway very near would recomend this hotel to people on a budget best budget hotel on the upper west side will be back  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there a few weeks ago and had no problems whatsoever with the elevators. The longest wait? Maybe a minute or two. I think this hotel is great for the money. You can't beat the location, the rooms are large by NY standards, and they are newly decorated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have stayed at the Westin often for business travel. One of the best Starwood properties in Midtown NYC for the value. Rooms are good-sized, even if you don't get an upgrade.  [END]
[BEGIN] The St James is a great place to stay while in New York it has great location and good value for money. The staff are very helpful and it is so close to times square. There is a fab deli right next door for all you meals etc as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] we have stayed here twice and would go back again when the deal is right. fantastic location on times square buzzing 24/7 room are basic airport hotel style and could do with an upgrade  [END]
[BEGIN] hostess looked a little tired and smiled with difficulty but this hotel is nice, quiet and very will located between Time Square / 5th av and Central Park/Macy's  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at Sofitel 6 nights and it was a very pleasant stay. Very nice superior room and very good clean bathroom. A nice bed and very good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large rooms however I've slept in more comfortable beds. Sleeper sofa cushions thin and uncomfortable to sit on. Otherwise good quality you expect from Hilton. Million dollar view from enclosed pool and exercise room on 30th floor. Great location off Michigan Ave so quieter and less traffic.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed being inside Manhattan, near Madison Square Garden, on 7th avenue, with noises and lot of people, but it's New York! The stay was great !  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this hotel. I stay there about 3 times a year. It's a great location, extremely comfortable with great staff. Rooms are a decent size for NYC  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is one of the few decent hotels in the city that offers rooms with 2 queen beds. Location is great. Beds were ok, pillows were typically lousy. Parking is $40-50 per night which seems pretty standard.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms and service was good, with fun and clever design solutions. Our only complaint is that the pool by the poolside bar wasn't served by the bar. The staff was very helpfull and had good knowledge of local facilities.  [END]
[BEGIN] HOTEL IDEALEMENT SITUE. CHAMBRE PETITE MAIS CONFORTABLE. SDB ET SANITAIRES PROPRES. CHAMBRE DONNANT SUR COUR TRES CALME. PETITS DEJEUNERS COMPRIS APPRECIABLES, COMPLETS MAIS REPETITIFS. PERSONNEL ACCUEILLANT ET DISCRET. BON RAPPORT QUALITE PRIX POUR NY. RECOMMANDONS CET HOTEL.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location in theatre district off Broadway and close to Times Square close to restaurants of Hells Kitchen and easy walk to Central Park Friendly helpfull staff in all areas Well situated near subway stations No negatives  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima hotel. Kleine maar goede kamer. Prima bed. Goede badkamer. We hen een kamer aan de zijkant dat was heel rustig. De buurt was goed restaurants bars enz. meer dan genoeg. Ging er iets niet goed werd het direct door het personeel van de receptie opgelost wat zeer vriendelijk was  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked over the internet - got a good price. Delighted to be upgraded to junior suite on arrival - loved the bathrobe. Was luxurious and clean. Comfy bed and pillows. Friendly staff. Good location. What more could you ask for? Helped make an excellent vacation.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed for my business trip and everything goes well..staff are very helpful especially a lady named Juicy...Her name is as nice as her attitude..I recommend this especially for travellers going for new york exhibit in javits center..  [END]
[BEGIN] Very happening lobby and courteous staff. The rooms are pretty standard but the bathrooms are generous (especially the shower). Excellent location just off Fifth Avenue!  [END]
[BEGIN] Parking was a deal. We were pleasantly surprised at the view from our room. Kids loved the indoor pool.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is old but it has an elevator, private bath, clean room and comfortable beds. What is more you are in the middle of Times Square. And also it has free wifi so you can chat and keep in contacts with your friends and family.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel- good location, easy to catch bus to any location. Easy to walk anywhere on Michigan Ave. Very good price. The rooms are a little old and bathrooms are small. View was great from front side of hotel. Would stay there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] I should have given this hotel 4 stars (instead of 2) in my previous review - I just hit the wrong button. The hotel is in a good location, rooms are large and high tech. Room service was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel en times square, muy bien ubicado esquina con la misma plaza, decoracion moderna pero un poco anticuado, ideal para pasar unos dias en NY. Buena relacion calidad precio, creo que volveria. He estado alli durante una semana en familia.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, breakfast could be better every day the same and if it is busy the supply will stuck, so you must wait for your eggs and so.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel bien situe, juste a qulques pas de times square. Rapport qualite-prix tres convenable. Nous le conseillons vivement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 4 nites early June 2012. Excellent location, close to subway, Central Park, Times square, Rockerfeller plaza etc. Rooms clean, staff unobtrusive. Good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] This isn't that bad of a place considering all the awful review it's gotten. Stayed here for 3 nights for a business trip and was just fine. the place is clean, helpful staff and the location was perfect to get to almost anywhere in the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] The concierge is not a real concierge. They are there to sell you their products and tickets at a really high price. You can go across the street and buy Broadway tickets for 1/2 price or go tot the box office.  [END]
[BEGIN] We got two rooms for great price for the location. We asked for rooms next to each other. One room was nicer/spacious than the other. Staff was always eager to help you. Lobby was pretty. Mad 46, bar/restaurant/rooftop lounge was popular and busy, but we received good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Hilton with my family for a long weekend. Hotel was clean and comfortable. Great location to everything. We all had a great time! Parking was a bit pricey, but hey, it's NY!  [END]
[BEGIN] Really nice hotel at a perfect location close til Times Square Bryant Park subway etc I had booked a small single room but got a huge room which I did not expect so my expectations were exceeded The free wireless internet worked perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] We really enjoyed our stay. The beds were extremely comfortable and the room clean. The staff were pretty frosty when help was asked for but the location was very, very good. Coffee and tea making facilities would be a great advantage as would be the use of a fridge.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in walking distance to Central Park, Radio City Music Hall, and Rockefeller Center. The rooms are spacious. The staff was very helpful. My only complaint was stained furniture upholstery.  [END]
[BEGIN] RESERVE 2 NOCHES PARA 3 ADULTOS Y UN MENOR...ME DIERON UNA HABITACION CON UNA CAMA Y ME ACONDICIONARON OTRA CAMA EXTRA, COMO QUIERA NOS ACOMODAMOS Y A CAMBIO NOS REGALARON EL DESAYUNO, LA ATENCION DE TODO EL PERSONAL ...EXCELENTE!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location downtown with lots of restaurants in the area. Clean, quiet and has a good fitness area as well. I stay here almost exclusively when in Chicago.  [END]
[BEGIN] Were there from oct. 9 to oct .12 , '08, great place to stay, clean beds, clean bathroom, relatively quiet. Small elevator and small room , but enough for what you want if you are a tourist in NYC. Definitely will stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, larger than usual room for Midtown Manhattan. Very convenient to subways, a block from Times Square! Also, there's a fantastic French restaurant across the street...really great for breakfast and lunch!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excelente hotel! Muito bem arrumado, todo novinho, muito bem localizado, perto de metro. Um dos melhores custo-beneficio. Fiquei encantado com o banheiro mesmo sendo coletivo. 4 banheiros por andar! sempre limpissimos, grandes, novos.. Voltarei com certeza!  [END]
[BEGIN] friendly staff, quite large room for New York, good location although the design is a bit too much and the hotel is a bit dark. Apart from that very good value. They overcharged me with 400 $ on checkout so be aware of the bill!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] room is big enough, good housekeeping. near penn plaza and a few blocks away from times square, which is a very big plus! free internet on our stay, though no complimentary breakfast, it is near food establishments.  [END]
[BEGIN] Whitehall location is excellent, near to the Magnificent Mile. Room space is more than enough, good bathrooms, and high quality beds. Room is clear and service is attentive. Hotel reception, elevators and corridors are not well maintained and deserve a renewal.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was very helpful and professional. Rooms are smaller than other Kimptons, but it is NYC and that is the norm. Clean rooms right in Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Even though my company would pay for a room at twice the price, I wouldn't stay anywhere else, comfortable, funky--great neighborhood--easy access to midtown--and a great mix of guests--  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location within midtown new York. The hotel is clean and tidy with pleasant hotel staff. The nearest subway is half a block walk - 2 minutes. I would use hotel again as the location was perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in midtown about 4 blocks from the Chrysler Building and we felt safe walking around the neighbourhood. Plenty of restaurants to choose from. The hotel suite was very nice and the staff very friendly. The price was right too, so all-in-all we'd definitely recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Estivemos neste hotel e gostamos muito do atendimento, limpeza e principalmente da localizacao do mesmo .Proximo das melhores lojas de New York ,a 1 quadra da Macys Se voltar pretendo ficar neste hotel novamente  [END]
[BEGIN] We went for the week- end and found this euro-style hotel. The hotel is small, as is everything in it but it was stylish, modern, and clean. The staff were very pleasant and helpful. We'll go back I'm sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really not much to add to the other positive reviews. The location is great, the rooms are well appointed, the hotel is clean and efficient and the staff is professional. Considering the price I paid, I'm even more impressed by the value. Definitely a great find.  [END]
[BEGIN] After reading the reviews I was skeptical about the hotel we booked. Loved loved the staff, great locations and fabulous bath products. Anyone who says they had a bad stay, clearly expected the four seasons. Fabulous studios for a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, good food within the hotel, courteous staff. Great location in Times Square....no complaints! We spent the weekend with our 4 boys as a Christmas gift to them along with tickets to see Wicked. Good show although I think they would have enjoyed other Broadway shows more.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel is very good and welcming. When ever I come on business I stay at this Hotel, The staf at the Hotel is very nicw and helpful especially Ann Mara Gayle from Guest relations. Also the location is excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay here often for business because of it's proximity to Penn Station. It's just a few blocks away so I can check my bags coming and going. I have always enjoyed clean rooms and courteous service.  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent rooms, clean and big, cheap prices. Subway station near the hotel. excellent diner beside: Pearl's Place But the aera is unsafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great space, large living room, large nice bathroom, excellent decor. Great service! The room service was great too, nice being able to get a Gordon Ramsay restaurant meal to the room. A bit overpriced, have stayed at similar or better for less. No views as surrounded by other tall buildings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Basic accommodation but in a great location. Staff were friendly and the room was clean and comfortable. Close to the trains, park and Michigan Avenue made it perfect for what we wanted at a reasonable price. And free wifi!  [END]
[BEGIN] Save energy, gas, by staying nearby your meeting. HGI is close to many companies on Energy Corridor I10, and Dairy Ashford, Eldridge. Comfortable, good value, reasonable Internet, food ok. Maybe a little boring if you stay more than a few days but, hey, we're here on business.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a good rate on hotels.com, just wish they had firm pillows. What is it with the infatuation of hotels and feather pillows? When I asked for firm pillows......I got more feather pillows. Nice bar. Room was nice. Modern. Worth $130 a night  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay there several times, close o navy pier. Movie theater is across the street. Michigan ave is close. Rooms are big and clean great views of the city or Lake Michigan. no complaints other than price of rooms is bit high. Also no free wifi!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location in the upper east side. Half a block from the subway station and Central Park. Across the street from the Natural History Museum. Relatively quiet neighborhood (for NY). Decent restaurant in the hotel. Nice room. Competent staff.  [END]

[BEGIN] Paid $150 a night here, split 3 ways with my fds. We were close to lots of places, time square, macys, msg... theres wifi in the rooms. They also hooked us up with some comedy tickets I wouldn't mind stayin here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here as a result of going into the theater. Very clean priced right. Would definitely return, bare bones but had ll you need. My visit was pleasure, but would be great for a business person.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super hotel , tres sympa, tres bien situe,petit bemole les chambres sont tres petites mais ce n 'est qu'un petit detail , quand on va sur New York ce n'est pas pour rester dans la chambre !!! Je recomanderais cet hotel et de partir avec expedia.  [END]
[BEGIN] can't beat the location. the room was nice with a great view to hell's kitchen and the river. lobby currently being re-modeled. bummer. staff friendly... great elevator system. generally very clean. NYC is such a great city... loved being back.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice hotel, we had a large suite, the interior felt like you were at a beach hotel. close to the galleria mall  [END]

[BEGIN] Briljant dakterras op de 15e met cocktails, ligbanken en uitzicht over de Hudson rivier. De bar van het hotel is hot en happening er staat een rij van buitenstaanders om binnen te komen met hotel sleutel altijd toegang en geen rij!  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked this hotel because it was walking distance from Penn station, had a good breakfast, and it was a nice overall hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean and spacious room with friendly and helpful staff. Good location and easy access to subway. Would stay here again.  [END]

[BEGIN] This hotel is great value for money. Absolutely loved it. The location is in chinatown and a block from the D subway. The staff, especially the night receptionist (I think he's name was Stanley) are extremely friendly. Clean, inexpensive hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice updated room, but small. Since we were only there overnight, the size was fine. I would definitely stay there in the future.  [END]

[BEGIN] Staff was excellent. Rooms were clean and comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here in November. Great service, SPACIOUS room ( i mean this is NYC) and centrally located. The person below who complained it's not "near times square" should stay in a hotel in times square. I would stay here every time i need a hotel in NYC.  [END]

[BEGIN] Modern, clean, comfortable and in the very heart of times square. Relatively well priced for Manhattan. The area is CONSTANTLY in action, so be prepared to drawn the blinds tightly to sleep at night. It's a safe area but stay in the populated areas after dark.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location, and well-maintained. Close to subway, restaurants, park. Room was very nice but New York tiny. Friendly front desk but not really much customer service. (Check out took a really long time because only one clerk and person in front of me had a complicated billing issue.)  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved the location of the hotel and the service was great. The rooms are small but very comfortable and quiet. Overall I would recommend it and it for the price it is an amazing value!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was clean, price ok. Breakfast is served in the lobby, so there is little space, but ok for an active city trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] have stayed here several times. Love the location and the rooms. They used to have a decent restaurant. security is good  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't need a fancy place if your touring NY, we spent so little time in the hotel that the room was unremarkable. Clean and nice bar area. Close to subway and shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Albergo con camere buone ma non fenomenali. da migliorare anche nel servizio a colazione. Nel complesso molto buono. Servizio all'arrivo ottimo e veloce. Posizione centralissima ad un passo da tutto il centro. Pero il terrazzo coperto vista Time square a colazione impagabile.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed our long anniversary weekend at the ritz. Everyone was lovely and very accommodating. The club lounge was fantastic. Just didn't like the pillows....too soft. But I won't quibble...great place to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Torno sempre all'hotel americano perche' il posto e' carino, camere design essenziali, il cibo ottimo ed il personale gentile ed attento. Sicuramente perfetto per chi viaggia per lavoro ed ha bisogno di un posto intimo. Colazione ottima.  [END]
[BEGIN] thanks appreciate it stay was great. staff was great, great, great, grea tthanks appreciate it stay was great. staff was great, great, great, great  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a lovely hotel in a great location. The staff is very helpful and friendly as well. My room was extremely spacious, and it was offered at a really great price. Their room service was excellent and very yummy as well. Would stay again, for business or pleasure.  [END]
[BEGIN] My last two visits were out of this world, management and staff equally helfull. Had established a good relationship with all and will always use the hotel whenever visiting New York. The hotel is my second home in New York  [END]
[BEGIN] Located in good area, near Magnificent Mile and John Hancock Building. Also, easy to get double decker tour buses. However, no breakfast included so you are on your own and parking for your car is way too expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is tastefully upgraded, excellent location for sightseeing with a pleasant and helpful staff. Highly recommended for a base to see Manhattan. Not a lot of amenities but good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed at the Bentley twice this year, and both times I have been given the room, I requested. I love the view of the bridge and the river. The new restaurant is a great addition. Only experienced breakfast and room service, but the service was exemplary  [END]
[BEGIN] We have stayed here twice and loved it. Yes the rooms are small but they are very nice and comfortable. It feels like staying in a guest room at family's house instead of a hotel. We will stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is within walking distance to times square,MSG ,Macy's ,empire state building. Subway right down the street from hotel.Hotel rooms are a great size,bathrooms are huge. Free hot breakfast,free Internet.Requested a room at back of hotel(garbage trucks out at three in morning can get noisy). Would definitely stay there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel for business stay, great service and amenities. It is, however, a bit dark and trendy, which is not for some people's taste. Also, Times Sq is not the best place to stay in New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family went here last week for a couple of nights. Lots of room, helpful staff reasonable price. Right in the heart of times square, the curbside staff will get you whatever you need. Only complaint was the bathroom and shower were adjoined, a privacy door would be good.  [END]
[BEGIN] As a Budget Hotel, you could not fault it, Although the decor was a bit tried, the rooms were very clean and the staff helpful. Great location for walking to the Pier, parks and shopping district.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good price,very nice service and the best location in NY for tourists.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location: 42nd Street, above Grand Central Station, just a few blocks from Times Square and Rockefeller Center  [END]
[BEGIN] just writing to say thankyou for the hospitality we enjoyed our stay very much if i ever come back to new york i will definitely be staying again, particularly service from one of your staff ray he made us feel very welcomed and was extremely polite.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not hear the jackhammers others talk about. Watch out for Norma's though. The service was not very good, the food was inedible, and everything was grossly overpriced. A third-rate diner would have been better than that place.  [END]
[BEGIN] pulito, confortevole, posizione ottimale, personale gentile e disponibile. l'unica pecca l'attrezzatura della cucina praticamente assente ma basta chiedere e subito e' stata fornita. eravamo in 4 con due sedie tre tazze e un pentolino.... ottimo per una famiglia con bambini.  [END]
[BEGIN] Creo que es un lugar bien situado, las habitaciones son limpias completas y seguras, el lobby del hotel tien un area para llegar hacer de punto de encuentro o darse un break. creo que vale lo que cuesta quedarse alli.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for only one night, so it is only fair for me to comment on the room. The room is spacious and clean. Plenty of parking space. One thing that they can probably add is breakfast like how Towneplace Suite and Comfort Inn have.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for a conference in November 2010 and it was a great choice due to the central location and great rooms. I would definately recommend the Westin Chicago to anyone on a business trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comodidad en las habitaciones, buen servicio y centrico.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typisch Amerikaans hotel: groot, attent personeel, ruime kamers veelal geschikt voor 4 personen. Goed ontbijtbuffet, ticketbureau in de lobby. Centrale ligging in Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is in a very central location and you can walk to most attractions. Restaurant in Hotel was a disappointment - only French cuisine. Could walk to most attractions and grand central station. Rooms were very roomy which is rare in New York City. Would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is a great location and the staff was excellent. Room was large and perfect for the 2 of us!  [END]

[BEGIN] Good Location.staff very friendly.Ideal for times square and Broadway shows Bedroom very good But could do with a coat of paint would recommend this hotel..  [END]
[BEGIN] The Skyline was very clean and kid-friendly. Overall, it is a good value because of the 8 dollar a day parking. The negative side was the terrible showers....no hot water!  [END]
[BEGIN] This Comfort Inn is not luxurious but suited our needs very well. It is very well located for access to the Park and major Art Galleries. A hot breakfast was provided. We would stay there again  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but clean rooms in the heart of Manhattan Midtown. GREAT location-wise and a nice breakfast -to-go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay at the Edison for the location. Right in Times Square. Rooms ok, very clean average size. Hotel has a gym. Rooms are quiet. No fridge in the room but there is a convenience store on the same block. Will stay at Edison again  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel. Very clean and friendly staff. But, there is a rooftop bar that is very loud. Do not stay on the 22nd floor. They did move me to lower floor, but it took several phone calls. Close to the 1 subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] The St. Giles was an excellent base for our recent stay in New York. The hotel is certainly in transition, but the size of the room and friendly staff, more than compensated for a few minor problems with the finishes. Will definately return to the same location again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were exactly as pictured. Fairly spacious for NYC, love that all rooms in the hotel are non-smoking. Was on a high floor but no view. Beds were "heavenly" with down filled pillows and comforter. Would recommend this property and would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staybridge was roomy, comfortable, friendly and a great value. The lobby is spacious and modern, the bar is trendy and even breakfast is included.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great hotel in a good area. Rooms were lovely and the bed was to die for. Only complaint left ipod in hotel safe but they did not find it!  [END]

[BEGIN] This hotel has one of the most breath taking views of Times Square and has great location. Can recommend it for its overall ambiance, friendly staff and room size not to mention the fact that it is easy to find after tracing around the city. Not cheap but very memorable.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have spent our first time in NYC and we were cery impressed. The location near of Broadway and Times Sq. could not have been better. The room was very clean and big. The hotel staff were friendly and helpful. We will definitely stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall, a quality place to stay if you get a deal. If you are payign there exorbant rpices, then there are much better options like the Standard Hotel, the Gramercy Park Hotel, or the Soho Grand, all of which are much mroe Modern and do not desperatly need a remodle.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can only give my best recommendations. Good hotel with perfect location in NY. Friendly staff. Good standard of hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was just a bit away from Times Square, but easily walkable. The staff were really good. The room was clean and very nice. It's great having a microwave and fuill refrig. I was very happy with this hotel.  [END]

[BEGIN] Rooms are comfortable, service is good... Great food 1 block away at Vento.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a good experience at the hotel. It is definitely close to everything. The halls look old , but I thought our room was very nice. The bathroom needs a makeover, and the sofa bed needs a better mattress, but all in all, I was happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in buona posizione: a 5 minuti a piedi dalla metro e 10 da Time Square e Rockfeller Centre. Camere comode e spaziose, bagni recentemente rinnovati (noi avevamo una exclusive con one queen bed). Personale cordiale e disponobile, insomma un hotel da consigliare  [END]
[BEGIN] Ligging, kwaliteit en service prima in orde. Enige minpunt was dat de gereserveerde (grotere) kamer niet beschikbaar was bij aankomst, maar pas de volgende dag. Een beetje slordig voor een dergelijk hotel. Personeel was wel uitermate behulpzaam.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location. Room a bit tired and in need of fresh paint etc. but clean and comfortable and remarkably quiet given the level of street noise  [END]

[BEGIN] I travel to NYC frequently and was reluctant to stay here because of the mix-reviews. I decided to try the hotel out and found it to be a nice experience. I did stay on the executive floors, that may have made a difference.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het hotel is makkelijk met de metro te bereiken , blauwe lijn We vonden het hotel duur maar netjes In de lobby kan je koffie of thee pakken en op je kamer is de mogelijkheid om koffie/thee te zetten  [END]
[BEGIN] This was my first time staying here - a girls weekend. Location is perfect for walking everywhere downtown. Close to stores, El, and short walk to river and Millenium park. Staff didn't clean room until late in the afternoon - but thats likely because the hotel was so full.  [END]

[BEGIN] The rooms are comfortable. The staff is well trained and nice. The only improvement I would recommend (as other reviews have already mentioned) is the quality of the breakfast. For example, the muffin was dry and not tasty. Overall, a great hotel find in New York!  [END]

[BEGIN] Had a very relaxing stay, very nice and helpful staff. Will defnitely visit again. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price, good location, good service, very pleased. Only problem was a 45 minute wait to get linens in the evening. Otherwise, everything was very good. Rooms are well decorated and charasterically small as is common in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is hard to beat the Ritz Carlton in New York. The size of the standard rooms are almost double compared to the overage NY City hotel. The staff are efficient and friendly and the service very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, nice rooms, great location. I'd only recommend that you try to get a room other than the one next to the service elevator. But boy, you really can't beat the location and friendly, knowledgeable staff, like Anna.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stylish hotel, good location, very comfortable beds, perfectly clean. Only reservation was the room safe, which after several attempts at fixing, remained broken for the duration of our stay.  [END]

[BEGIN] Zentral gelegenes Hotel. Sehr sauber und freundliches Personal  [END]
[BEGIN] Beliggenheten ved Penn Station gir rask togforbindelse til/fra flyplassene - og til undergrunnssystemet. Kort vei til handlegater og severdigheter, og et kvarters joggetur til Central Park for den som vil trimme. Greie rom, betjeningen er hyggelig og veldig service-innstilt. Et godt valg !  [END]
[BEGIN] Large rooms, friendly staff, good restaurant. A bit out of the way, but actually it's just a 20-minute walk to midtown. Might be noisy if the room faces 11th avenue. Recommended nevertheless, especially if you can find good rates.  [END]

[BEGIN] Found the hotel to be very clean, staff quite friendly and well situated. Only complaint is the charge for in room Internet service. Why every mid price brand hotel gives service for free and upscale hotels persist on charging for something that is a necessity and not luxury is Rediculous!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got back from our 1st visit to NY. Hotel was clean and ideal location and we found the staff to be friendly. Matthew the doorman was very friendly and helpful. Looking forward to our next trip to NY and another stay at the Metro.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good location downtown. Rooms adequate but not extremely special. Staff very polite. Only compliant was the price. Somewhat high for the quality offered.

[BEGIN] Cool place with a nice vibe to it. Small basic room, but with everything you need. I was quit busy when I was there, but didn't even one time have to wait for the toilet or shower. Great location, good price and I would for sure stay again.  [END]

[BEGIN] But, an extra $14.95 for the use of the hotel internet in the room???!!! The three free connections off the lobby don't meet demand. Otherwise, friendly folks, nice budget room (I like the modern decor) and lots of great food in the neighborhood. Two blocks from the Broadway Subway. Recommend.  [END]

[BEGIN] I was surprised here. For the PRICE... As it was a good deal on a very last minute stay. Room was good.. but small lobby was clean. service seemed okay.. only a night... hallways are old ... but overlooked  [END]
[BEGIN] Tres bien place juste a cote du terminal, tres belle chambre, et service impeccable.le seul hic, c'est le bruit, nous avons entendu le bruit de l'ascenceur toute la nuit.Les chambres sont mal insonorisees.sinon rien a dire...  [END]

[BEGIN] The Tremont is old and needs to be updated and better maintained. But the location is great and the price was right for a long weekend in the windy city. Also being in the hotel with Ditka's as the restaursant was a big plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very nice luxury hotel. Pricey but really great location across the street from central park and close to Columbus Circle (which has a delicious Jamba Juice). Everyone had a good time. Only minus was how stuffy the employees were. A snobby type attitude.  [END]

[BEGIN] Ottimo hotel, tranquillo ma soprattutto comodo, sulla brodway e fuori dal caos della city! metro a due passi!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Average service. Rooms are fine. Sales people are the problem. Because of its location I would recommend this hotel. You only sleep a few hours when you're in New York so for that purpose the hotel are fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tolles Hotel; alles in Ordnung, gerne wieder  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location. Great service by reception staff!!!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] good location v helpful staff large comfortable room free wifi bad breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value! Spacious room and great location in Chicago. Walking distance to Michigan avenue, rush street and all the hidden gems Chicago has to offer. Only issue is that the elevators, only two, are too small and very slow. So be patient and understanding.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am a senior traveler. The people at the reception desk helped me with dinner reservations, taxis, stairs and responded kindly to my every request. I would certainly choose to stay at the Ace Hotel again and would recommend it as comfortable and fun.  [END]

[BEGIN] Pros: -good location -friendly staff -decent price for NYC (under $200/night) -unusually comfortable bed Cons -tiny bathroom even by NYC standards -sink didn't drain -small reception area that gets crowded easily Conclusion If you can get this hotel for under $200/night, go for it.

[BEGIN] I enjoyed my stay at the Affinia Dumont. The pillow menu was a nice touch. So was the fresh fruit. The room was very clean, beds were comfortable. Really, for a hotel in NYC, what more can you ask for? Thanks TripAdvisor for helping me pick this hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] A wonderful find in New York City. Good location... large room with floor to ceiling window...very comfortable bed....efficient, modern furniture...very clean...free newspaper...and last, but not least, turn down service and fresh towels in the evening.

[BEGIN] La camera (matrimoniale) in cui ho soggiornato era davvero molto piccola, ma assolutamente funzionale e pulita! L'hotel ha un ottima posizione, a pochi passi dal cuore di Manhattan (Rockfeller Center, St Patrick, Fift Avenue). Consiglio assolutamente!  [END]
[BEGIN] My daughter and I went to stay for 7 nights and found it a very pleasant hotel with very helpful staff  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel motlo grande, molto centrale, molto bello. Unico piccolo disagio, il letto matrimoniale standard di misura ridotta (una piazza e mezzo?). Scegliere se possibile i letti king. Pulizia curata, personale professionale e gentile.  [END]
[BEGIN] Per le camere non lo riprenderei piu'(vecchie,strette ma pulite) ma siccome a New York in albergo ci vai solo il tempo di dormire...lo riprenderei altre 100 mila volte perke' e' situato in una posizione strategica.consiglio vivamente.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Plaza benefits from perhaps the best location in New York. Whilst an expensive hotel, the service is excellent and far from stuffy. The public areas are buzzing but the rooms quiet and well appointed. If you can afford it why stay anywhere else  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful art-deco building on the river with big rooms and a marvelous view at the rivers and skyscrapers -should ask at arrival room with view.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm surprised by the negative reviews. I stayed there for a week in April 2003 and everything was just fine. I guess things have changed since then, but I had no problems whatsoever.  [END]

[BEGIN] We stayed at the Affinia for 3 nights in july 2012. The location is great, in walking distance from major attractions and close to the subway. Our room was nice, clean and unexpected large! The staff is friendly, but one bellboy was way too pushy for tips.  [END]
[BEGIN] The great thing about this hotel is that unlike many others in Chicago, the rooms are large and have two queen (not double) beds. Also having the Weber Grill restaurant on property is convenient, if for no other reason than its bar. Be aware, however -- no complimentary continental breakfast!  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were comfortable, staff all friendly, convenient to Hobby Airport. The hallways are long here. Great shower. Attended a conference here and the food was served nicely and was good for conference food!  [END]

[BEGIN] This hotel was very convenient for business at the Willis Tower. Check in and checkout were speedy and efficient. Club room was small, but for just myself it was cozy.

[BEGIN] good business hotel, well located, clean rooms with comfortable bedding, nice health club to work out.  [END]

[BEGIN] I recently attended a work meeting at this hotel and stayed for several nights. The accommodations were fine. Cool elevator system (high tech), though there was usually a line to get on an elevator. The food was par to sub par. Good location. Nice views.  [END]

[BEGIN] This place was decent enought. The rooms and the hotel did seem a little too worn in. Could use some updating. However, the property was kept clean. Can't beat their warm breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall good hotel, nice location for just about anything you want to do and good staff. Will be back for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] As always, the standard excellent rooms at a Renaissance. Its located a bit south of the city which is OK if you don't want to be downtown. The only thing i was less than happy with was the food service. For a Renaissance, the food quality was pretty average.  [END]

[BEGIN] Albergo in ottima posizione. Buon servizio, camere accoglienti. Soltanto un po rumoroso (dovuto essenzialmente alle apparecchiature esterne del condizionamento d'aria). Ottimo il servizio a buffett della prima colazione. Senzaltro da raccomandare  [END]
[BEGIN] Voor ons belangrijjk dat er goede bedden waren, een goede douche, schone lakens en handdoeken. Ontbijten deden wij elders op weg naar een toeristische trekpleister. Het hotel ligt perfekt!

[BEGIN] The location is really great... A short walk to Times Square, Macy's, Bryant Park.. and there are plenty of cafes nearby! The room is pretty basic and the bathroom is very clean. The most important is that it's bright and airy.. no creepy sense at all.  [END]

[BEGIN] We spent 1 week in NY, stayed in Skyline Hotel and were very satisfied with everything. The room was clean, service was very friendly and the hotel was just a short walk away from Times square. I would definately go back again!  [END]
[BEGIN] You walk into a Beautiful boutigue hotel, tastefully decorated and cosy lobby/ lounge area - only to be dissapointed by the size of the bedroom albeit expensively finished. It was very ideally located for 5th avenue - therefore great for career shoppers. Breakfast was delicious, fresh and good quality!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there for 5 days (129 + tax/day). They had a good continental breakfast for $6. The rooms had good size with closet and a small kitchenete (refrigerator, sink and microwave0. The only problem was that they didn't have free wireless. Good place for the price.  [END]

[BEGIN] The property was well located for the events and places we wanted to go. The subway does make most things convenient, and the value and service provided was well above standard. The breakfast buffet is excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location midway between Times Square and Central Park. Rooms are adequate in size for Manhattan, but those overlooking 7th Avenue are noisy at all times. Cafe on ground floor is very good for breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobby was beautiful. They had helpful and friendly staff. There was a parking deck RIGHT across the street. The room was nicely decorated. The room was crazy small, though, even by NYC standards...  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall good stay, great location, somewhat friendly staff, with the exception of one short and an indifferent front desk agent. I would come back though the location was my selling point.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was OK - we had a small room but the beds and pillows were fantatics (memory foam). The hotel is right next to Empire State buiding and 10 min walk from Time Square. I recommand this hotel for the confort and location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a spotless hotel with free parking and in and out privileges...can't find another one like it in the city. Certainly not fancy...but clean and in a good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel near Times Square, Central Park and lots of other Manhattan attractions. Although a bit outdated, the rooms are (for New York standards) large, clean and comfortable. The on site restaurant is a good start of the day and very convinient is the subway station right outside the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed mid week for about 120$/night. Staff was helpful. Great location and decent bar. Rooms are small but clean. I had one (?queen/double) bed and that was enough for 1 person. Would definitely come back if the $$ is right.  [END]

[BEGIN] Stayed three nights and found it to be a fantastic location. Room was new (ish). Would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] While this is a two star hotel, with Cassie at the front desk, I felt it was a four plus star hotel. She remembers your name, wife's name and even your preference in food. They need to pay this lady very well! Thank you Cassie!  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked the room through Priceline-got a great deal.The room was nice,the staff was friendly and the location and the view were great.The only drawback was the price of parking and the fact that they parked your car in a lot blocks away.  [END]

[BEGIN] This was one of the cheapest hotels we could find in a great location. Everything was clean and tidy, room was always made up and staff were always friendly and courteous. Definitely recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay at the Intercontinental Barclay almost every week. It is very consistant and the staff makes the repaeat costomer feel special. Particularly the Ambassador guest services representitive Annmara Gayle. I am always making my plans last minute and she always finds a way to get me a nice room  [END]

[BEGIN] The place was clean. But the hotel has a slighly outdated feel. We always had to wait in line to check in to check out to check in our bags and to check them out. The walls are very thin. We could hear everything out neighbors were saying. No breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fourth stay at the Metro and as usual eveything okay. Great location, great view and helpful staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location 2 min from subway and central park. Drainage in our bathroom slow when showering and air conditioner very poor. Rooms good size.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Rooms small for Hilton but good size for NY. Room wasn't ready but they held our bags and called us as soon as it was.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do you like running in the Park like I do? If so, this is your hotel. Big rooms, coffee bar in the morning, free newspapers, convenient to shopping, bars, and restaurants - but especially, to the Park. Leave the hotel lobby and you're on the 10k loop in 5-7 mins.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for museums and central park. Upscale, good service, great bed and bath.  [END]
[BEGIN] top of the line hotel and service except for - the doorman has a pass key for all rooms and entered my room twice showing other guests to their (my) room...  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location, great price. Stayed for three nights. Rooms were clean and everything was as promised. A/C, TV, fridge,microwave and shower were in excellent condition. The elevators were the only problem with the hotel. Always broken and full at peak times. Otherwise everything was great. Would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] good service and niece hotel,a little bit expensive,but still a good hotel,need more friendly employees  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy ,muy limpio esta en una zona segura y a 2 cuadras del subway ,el personal muy amable ,lo unico malo es q hay que desayunar muy temprano x q sino se termina todo muy rapido ,volveria seguro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel located directly across Port Authority and close to Time Square. Friendly service, but not a much variation in breakfast. Walking distance to Time Square and cruise lines at port 63. I can reccomend the hotel and will properly stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed 2 nights. Not a bad place to stay, although Bell Captains can be very slow, but besides that all was well. Location ideal. Would recommend although I believe there are better values out there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but comfortable rooms, great breakfast, helpful staff and superb location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfy hotel with good location. Few blocks away from the grand central station made it very easy to use the subway to go around the city. Only bad thing was that a Hotel with this standard should have free wifi in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] From ythe moment we arrived for the weekend until we left 3 days later, the service and staff weere great. I forgot some toiletries and they were delivered in less that 5 minutes by housekeeping. Great bed!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny rooms, but clean and the location of the hotel was perfect.breakfast was not great but you could not complain based on what we were paying.would definitely go back  [END]
[BEGIN] Fab hotel for what you pay, its old but well kept and just recently been renovated, would stay there again within reasonble walking distance to everywhere (but we like walking).  [END]
[BEGIN] A very nice and warm hotel to stay in while you're in NY. the pricing if fair, the bar is overcharging though.  [END]
[BEGIN] - expensive for a small room (350$ per night) -right downtown - good experience - its a Hamptons -got a free coupon so thats why I went there, otherwise sleep in New jersey its more affortable  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima hotel. Gedeelde badkamer was altijd schoon en altijd vrij. Gelegen aan een rustige straat. Op enige afstand van de belangrijke bezienswaardigheden: het hotel ligt tussen Midtown en Downtown. Goed bereikbaar met metro via Union Square. Aanrader voor rustige nachten in de drukke stad tegen een relatief voordelig tarief.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was small, bathroom tiny, but everything was clean and comfortable. Location great. Staff friendly and helpful. Only downside is very slow elevator service; high speed internet service intermittent. Even so, I would definitely stay again.  [END]

[BEGIN] good hotel, clean and in the mddle of time square, Een echte aanrader om Manhattan te bezoeken, Alles op loop afstand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, friendly and informative staff, great location. However, the $15.00 per day wireless charge is unwarranted and insulting. (and hard/impossible to find on the hotel website).  [END]
[BEGIN] The Manhattan Club timeshare in NYC is unlike any timeshare we've stayed at. It is more like a studio apartment. It's half a block from Broadway, several blocks from Central Park, walking distance to Times Square. It's a great place to stay for a visit to NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Montana in security at the W Lexington Avenue took great care of me during this stay. Professional, warm, attentive and caring..she made sure that the front desk enhanced my brief visit with a room upgrade, wine & chocolate strawberries!  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel is stylish and comfortable and the location abounds with a great choice of restaurants and shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] You just can't get a better location in Times Square. Staff were very nice and made sure we had a better room close to the top! Very clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Honestly, they did a great job. The door guys were great, the people at the front desk were great and the price was cheap. Not all that close to a subway station but it is within walking distance. All and all a great visit! And and the gym/pool were wonderful!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Marrakech is an upbeat place to stay in a great location. A lot of young people were staying there and it was a perfect place for a night in New York. The staff is exceptional and room was clean and quiet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Eventhough we stayed only 1 night;I can tell you that the location was great.Very clean rooms,the hotel staff was very nice and friendly.I would stay again...  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel met goede prijs-kwaliteit verhouding. Kamer was klein, en sanitair aan vernieuwing toe. Hier staat tegenover dat het mooi ingericht was, erg netjes en schoon, vriendelijk personeel en een metrostation voor de deur!  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice location, elegant atmosphere, rooms are clean and well maintained, front desk was not friendly at all, worried about security in the hotel seemed uncontrolled, restaurants were ok but no more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal for $135 and my son got his for $100. I can see how it would be noisy, but we had a corner room. Rooms are small but clean and nice hard bed.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a very good experience, the staff is very warm and the atmosphere is relaxing, we will gladly go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cassa is centrally located to all the Midtown attractions. We liked that it was far enough away from Times Square but still close to all the other fun places. Front desk was friendly. The rooms were appointed nicely. Really liked the open shower and bathroom vanity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Midtown, right next to Grand Central Station, the location couldn't be better. Hotel is very modern and chic, but rooms were surprisingly small. Bathroom could have be cleaner. Snack shop in the lobby charges $3 for a soda. Staff is super nice and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in the Hilton for 5 days, very comfortable and clean room and close to everything.. Pretty expensive but all staff were friendly and helpful..Would stay again..  [END]
[BEGIN] Other reviews mentioned that rooms are small and outdated; I agree with them, but as far as service, location and convenience, hard to beat! Took transit at front door to get to many sites , museums, walked to Chicago architecture boat tour, shopping galore! New funky looking lobby area.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at this hotel twice during our mini-tour of the US. The hotel was about a 5 minute walk from Grand Central Station and provided a great base for us to explore New York. Rooms were clean but not that spacious. Would definitely recommend if you don't mind walking.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable lobby with good drinks, excellent restaurant in times square, close to broadway. Well furnished rooms and friendly, problem solving staf, plus an otopark right infront of the hotel.. We stayed 3 nights and were happy with the service and hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just to reiterate the positive comments of previous reviewers. Huge rooms, clean and comfortable. Excellent value, prime location, great city.  [END]
[BEGIN] And the hotel itself - not so bad, it was oputdated, but there is a charm in it. I liked it. My back is a very special creature :) But those matresses satisfyed it. Nice place, nice hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The doorman, Brian, is so friendly, warm and helpful. He made our stay extra special!  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently returned from a 5 night stay at The Casablanca. Extremely helpful staff and a good, clean, comfortable hotel albeit a little too expensive for what it is.  [END]
[BEGIN] Um hotel bem localizado, com quartos limpos e moveis novos, cama pequena mas muito confortavel, otimo atendimento por parte dos funcionarios que foram educados e atenciosos. Voltaria com certeza!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Jefferson while in NYC for a conference. During Ad-Tech Hotel prices always sky-rocket. Spent a week at this hotel. Rooms were small. Door wouldn't open fully even, but hotel had everything you need and was clean. Would recommend this hotel to anybody who's on a budget.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here on business and it was pretty good for its price. Negatives are: no conditioner, so my hair looked like dry hay; oddly shaped and somewhat small rooms; and reaaaaaally slow computers in the business area. Good stuff: good location, decent fitness room, free wireless.  [END]
[BEGIN] No bugs or animals loved the room lots of space worth the stay  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location. Very friendly staff. Could be a little cleaner. Well lit at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Right in the middle of Time Square. The rooms are nice size and were very clean. Only issue is the elevator system.  [END]

[BEGIN] Oud hotel vlakbij het Empire State Building. Op loop afstand van Time Square en de metro, Macy's. Geen echt ontbijt, maar wel koffie of thee met muffins in de ochtend. Kamers zijn oud, maar de bedden zijn goed. Airco maakt wel veel herrie.  [END]
[BEGIN] Elevator noise in room was terrible; wifi very expensive; business section very small; rooftop Bar very nice, but expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place with a very good breakfast. Small nice rooms. The cleaning of the room could be better. Great service for informations and tours!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean,Tidy and comfortable.. The Staff was extremely gracious and helpful. Will definately be back once the referbishments are complete. The Location is excellent handy and within walking distance to most tourist hotspots and subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel continues to be a honest choice price/location wise. Front desk people could be less smily and more effective, perhaps lack of experience, but concierge has it all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our first visit to Chicago for just a visit to see the sights.. The Whitehall was recommended by a friend, and the location couldn't have been better for a first time visitor. the room was very nice and service was excellent. Only downside was the small elevator.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location. Slept well, but ridiculously high beds. You practically need a ladder to get into them. Good swimming pool. Thought the bellboy could have been a bit more polite. He obviously thought he wasn't tipped enough. Even the taxi driver commented on it. Would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The London Hotel for me has a great location,also very comfortable rooms and suites. The bathrooms are larger than any average NYC hotel bathroom. The staff is very friendly and will make you feel at home always.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, nice outdoor space, small and old fashion rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Exceptional people at the front desk. Good room at a reasonable price. Could not ask for more at check in and check out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic location 1 min walk from Times Square. Hotel could do with a coat of paint and updating. We unfortunately didn't have refurbished rooms but our rooms did have very comfortable beds and a good shower. When I go back to New York I would definitely stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at this hotel for St. Patrick's Day weekend (03/13-03/15/09). Clean, comfortable, easy access to parking. A bit of a hike to downtown area, but window shopping along the way was pleasant. Would be very convenient to Soldier Field.  [END]
[BEGIN] A good hotel close to everything but the best aspect was it is quiet, great after a long flight from Melbourne. The room had everything one needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] A modern and comfortable hotel that is just a block from Time Square. High tech with large flat screen tv and touch screen computers in each room. Attentive and friendly staff. Too bad about pay wifi - a cheep move straight out of 1999.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel has undergone extensive renovations that bring the quality up to much greater than their current rating. The management appears to be very focused on providing great hospitality with pleasant staff and lovely rooms. My stay was for business, which gave me all needed amenities while providing great comfort.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love being at the Hilton Ave. of Americas. Convenient to everything. I stay in the lower tower and the renovated rooms are great. I love the waiters in the Marketplace for breakfast. I slip back in for coffee refills.  [END]
[BEGIN] very central and good location. clean and kind. no frozen .polite and kind staff. good choice  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel in a very nice area of Manhattan. Employees are very welcoming and friendly. I higly recommend this hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Very pleasant stay... The service of the staff was very professional and accomodating!  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was great, I got a free upgrade into a suite. The only problem was the windows are poor builder grade windows that are original, if your room faces the freeway and the window wont shut all the way like mine it can get a little noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're worried that NYC is overwhelming, hectic and full of stressed out strangers, you're partially right BUT don't worry about that, as this hotel is the 100% antidote: relaxing, warm, cozy and primed to make you feel at home.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice pool, good brunch, good front desk & shuttle service  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here during the Columbus Day weekend and thought it was a great deal, especially the free garage parking. Within easy walking distance to Time Square, the Circle Line, the subway, anything you could possibly want. Hotel room and was fine. Don't understand the recent negative reviews.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure what the great reviews are all about. Normally top rated hotels are unique or provide great value. This was just a Hilton Garden. Service is what you'd expect, pretty good. Location is great, but there are thousands of hotels in great locations in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hello, I just would like to say that for the price we paid (228$/night) the rooms and the accomodations were very good. One thing could be bettre: breakfast! There is not much room for a lot of guests and the food could be better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful stay at the New York Marriot!! I stayed at the hotel with a friend during the week of June 20th to the 24th and it was a great experience... Very friendly. Employees are quick to help any way that they can.  [END]
[BEGIN] This property is in the perfect location for a Chicago getaway. Close to shopping, dining, and the waterfront. Nicely appointed rooms and professional staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Likes: Rooms great, view ok, very clean rooms and staff very friendly. Dislikes: Hallways are not airconditioned! Thats on all floors :( might not seem like much but when your there in 102 degree heat you might be suprised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable room. Great view from the rooftop bar. What I have come to expect from Kimpton. The only downside was the location. Nothing striking about the neighborhood but still only a cab ride from anywhere I wanted to go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good compared to its cheap price. Good location. Bathrooms clean. Elevator too small. Very narrow hallway. Spacious room for 2 bunk bed dorm.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have stayed at this hotel about 4 times and never had any problems. The Hotel is located a block away from 5th Avenue and a block away from Times Square. The rooms are clean and a nice size. You won't be disapointed with this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was very reasonable for it's location. We were able to walk to Central Park and Times Square. Our room was a fairly decent size for NYC and we even had a window looking out over the outdoor patio (another rarity in NYC).  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very good, located at 45st almost in the corner of 3rd av walking distance to most atractions , nice rooms with Loccitane amenities and has a nice staff The only downside is the shower , difficult to use I will definitively go back  [END]
[BEGIN] hey everyone this is riyadh a legal adviser at STC i stayed at Park Central for two days i have met a very nice people over there especially (Ellen) who is working at the front disk ,,she is so helpful and more than nice to our family,,, regards riyadh  [END]
[BEGIN] The room would have been perfect, only marred by cigarette burns here and there. The pillow top mattress would have provided a nice rest, if it weren't for the very loud and generally inconsiderate displaced New Orleanians.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a grate hotel for young copuls traveling to NYC. We spened 5 nights. It was clean, had a helpfull concierge. Small rooms, but we did not go to NY to stay in a hotel so it did not matter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Also bid on Priceline for about $140 which we felt was a great price for NYC. Room was nice, clean and efficient. Only problem we had was luke-warm shower in the morning. Every staff member we encountered was very friendly and willing to help. Would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had stayed in the Hampton inn for seven nights in june 2010 which was great in every aspect.Stayed again in June this year for one night with family and freinds following a cruise. Enjoyed our stay as much as last time.Will return again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Again, I found this hotel while searching for an affordable place to stay in New York. The Lucerne is a nice hotel, good amenities and very good service and staff. A little out-of-the-way location for much of New Yorks key areas but the value makes up for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for one weekend night, the room was on the small side but nice, and for the cost (<200) and the location, definitely a great value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent experience.....spacious! Good location and great service! Good for the price! Very clean! The corner suite with double beds was enormous!  [END]
[BEGIN] Location location location very good. Nice service. Cannot beat the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical Hampton Inn. Clean good sleep quality and decent breakfast. Will chose again if in the area  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location. Room was adequate, but as the hotel is practically on Times Square you probably won't spend much time there. It was also the cheapest hotel in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel in a good location with attentive staff. The rooms were above average size exceptionally clean and well equipped. This helped to make our holiday a memorable one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Before going to the hotel, I read mixed information about this hotel, and it is true that there are very different kind of rooms: very simple to very nice. Location is very good, niche neighborship, many subway lines near by.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location!!! Very easy access to Galleria shopping. A bit challenging finding the right parking spot.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a very comfortable hotel to enjoy your trips in a very good location  [END]
[BEGIN] For NYC, this place was great. Spacious room, good location, very smartly renovated recently, good service from housekeeping, reception/concierge adequate. Would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed at the Roger Smith several times and never been disappointed. You get a lot of room for your NYC dollar and the staff has been incredible. Great location too!  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay at this hotel was a wonderfull experiance, the stuff memebers are very helpfull. one of the stuff member Yoselin Gil was very heplfull and extremly helpfull. I was impressed how attentive she is.I will definately come back and stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Centraal gelegen hotel vlakbij Times Square en Broadway en de opstapplaatsen voor de "hop on hop off bus tours". Nette kamers met airco en nette badkamer > (minpuntje: lage wc's vlak voor de spiegel).  [END]
[BEGIN] Roomy and accomodating. No complaints here! Staff were amazing and helpful. Couldn't believe the spacious room I received at the discounted rate I paid through Resorts Plus International.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel. Clean and friendly staff. Pricey hotel food...but it is NY. It definately was trendy...possibly a little too trendy for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] This one has it all: decent rooms, good services and friendly helpful staff. Best choice in the neighborhod I have found. The bed was great and i like the style. I would recommend this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in a studio room with a kitchenette, large living area. Staff were friendly and helpful. Close to 5th Ave. Times Square, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] La habitacion como tal no pareciera tener una limpieza a fondo pero es habitable y el bano tambien es bastante decente. La cama era King size y bastante comoda. Lo que si es que el hotel es viejo pero muy cerca de todo  [END]
[BEGIN] We were in town for a 36 hour "guerilla" weekend trip, just a back pack and our clothes and needed a LOW COST no frills place for one night. Good reasonable rate for NY, clean room,loft bed was fun, good location  [END]
[BEGIN] Very big and spacious rooms...clean...near to Premium Outlet Malls and food outlets around...good breakfast spread...free wifi...good saundry stall...cheap last min toliteries...laundry room is fantastic...  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the Burger Joint in the hotel; amazing. Also great breakfast/brunch restaurant (Norma's).  [END]

[BEGIN] Das Hotel Edison liegt sehr Zentral, nur ein paar Meter enfernt vom Times Square. Es gibt mehrer U-Bahn Stationen im Bereich von 3-5 min. Das Hotel ist sauber, die Zimmer werden ordentlich gereinigt. Leider hatte ich ein Zimmer zum Innenhof, dort war es relativ laut.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overnight at 60 Thompson Hotel. Service and staff are excellent! Room small but comfortable. Has all the comforts one can want....sans kettle and tee service in room. But that can be said about most American hotels. Great roof terrace... Definitely the place to stay!  [END]
[BEGIN] A great hotel in an excellent location. English pub attached to hotel which served good food and was buzzy and convenient. I was upgraded to a suite which was a pleasant surprise and the hotel staff were excellent with special thanks to the excellent Krasimira, the Front Office Supervisor.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are hunting for a hotel with wifi, free breakfast, great staff, clean rooms, and close to attractions this is it. My family visited on vacation and stayed here. Well worth it. Note: there is no pool or fitness center  [END]

[BEGIN] For the price this was a great hotel in a very central location. It is not luxury but it is comfortbale with a little character; it is not a cookie-cutter budget hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel has a good location with easy access to various restaurants and night spots. The room is small and we had a wall for a view. The room was clean and fully equiped though. Staff was very friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is netjes, ruim en ligt uitstekend, vlakbij TimeSquare. Personeel heel behulpzaam bij regelen van kaarten, taxi's etc. Minpunt was dat er op onze rekening minibar drankjes waren gezet die we niet hadden genuttigd. Gelukkig werd dit snel verholpen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charming hotel in a lovely neighborhood. Friendly staff, helpful concierge service, and extremely convenient location. One block from the subway, and cab service within minutes. Central park, The Museum of Natural History, Zabar's Market, and the iconic Big Nicks Diner just around the corner. We will be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a new and simple hotel located near Central Station and Empire State. Clean, nice people, simple room, not so big as desired but comfortable. Amazing and romantic rooftop in the 17th floor with Empire State views!  [END]
[BEGIN] After a 'choppy' beginning things got a lot better. A room change necessitated by "smokey' smell, broken mirror and vanity light in bath resulted in immediate room switch. Great location in Flat-iron district. The staff was very accommodating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean, comfortable and friendly. Rooms are spacious, very nicely appointed. I-Pod docking station, flat screen TV, great lighting in bathroom. Though it is away from midtown, I discovered all Chelsea has to offer, great little neighborhood.  [END]

[BEGIN] Very close to the 911 memorial. Plenty of good restaurants nearby on Greenwich St which is about .25 mile away. Rooms were very clean. Staff was very helpful and courteous.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff of this hotel is very welcoming and warm. Especially Ann Mara Gayle who always assures that every detail is always perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family stayed at the Salisbury for New Year 2005/2006. The room was comfortable and clean. The staff were helpful and friendly. We chose the hotel for its location and access to the subway system (subway station a short walk up to Broadway/ 7th Avenue) Would visit again.  [END]
[BEGIN] CLEAN! Friendly staff. Great location with local markets around the corner. Room was small but clean. Anyways, all you need is a bed and shower. BTW-the bed was the most comfortable I've ever slept in! Quiet-lobby construction was not an issue. I would definitely stay again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Omni provides excellent ambience and access to the business district. The staff is very courteous  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location, rate & clean. Near port authority and main attractions. Quiet, good beds. Breakfast area really small you better wake up early. They took care of our belongings the last day while we hanged around. Very nice staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was clean and the room was large. Free Wifi and air conditioning. Quite as well and close to Empire State and subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely staff, room huge and spotless, but couldn't turn the heating off so had to keep turning on the air con to cool it down and leave a window open at night but that did the trick. Was pleased overall and would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, friendly staff, reasonably priced... The rooms are spacious and the finishes are quite nice. My only complaint is the blanket, which is not the duvet that most new or newly renovated hotels use. No noise problems at all.  [END]

[BEGIN] Excellent location right off 5th ave. Lobby and rooms are small but clean and comfy. Very nice  [END]
[BEGIN] It woulld be nice to hava access to a computer, more breakfast items and include hot items. The reception staff was very freindly and helpfull, as well as teh house keeping girls, tehy were frindly, active and quick  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottimo hotel in posizione centrale, le camere sono un po piccole ma molto pulite. Alcune stanze sono state rinnovate in stile moderno, altre sono un po vecchiotte.

[BEGIN] Very nice place, trendy, clean, nice crew... Just alittle bit expensive... But a very nice experience....  [END]

[BEGIN] Of course the rooms are small it is new york. but they are clean and we got lucky and had a great view of the empire state building. And the noise level was not that bad. plus its about three or four blocks from time sq.  [END]

Struttura non nuovissima, ma camera spaziosa e accogliente. Buona pulizia. Staff non particolarmente cordiale, ma comunque buon servizio  [END]
[BEGIN] No frills but great location. Hotel is older and a little run-down but clean and friendly; bedding and towels are good quality. Parking free and safe. Attached diner is also no-frills but handy, affordable and clean. Given the prices in Chicago these days, this is a great bargain.  [END]

[BEGIN] It was like stepping back in time. The place is 100 years old and still looks great. They kept the decorations the same. Wow  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel on excellent location just one block from Central Park If you like burgers: Burger Joint is hidden behind the curtain in the atrium lobby and if you'r a guest you don't have to wait in line( which is extremely long) Starbucks just across the street  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect Location in NYC. Herald Square is just outside the door, 5th Ave is a block away. Subway stop on the corner. Friendly staff. Clean and quiet rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for a wedding in August and had a lovely stay. The rooms are pretty and decently sized, the bathroom was immaculate, and the lobby is very grand. There's a bar/restaurant (I didn't visit it), and apparently there's a fitness center too. Expensive, but very nice hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Superb location, fine beds, hospitality fine, terrible noise 24/7 due to airco in narrow shaft behind hotel - like being on a never landing turboprop plane. You need earplugs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buona la posizione, in pochi minuti si raggiunge la metropolitana. Bella la zona. Molto professionali nella gestione. Wireless internet sempre ok e veloce. Due bagni per piano sempre liberi e puliti.  [END]

[BEGIN] there was a nice room with a fridge and microwave...the staff was wonderful and extremely helpful...the hotel is in a perfect location to times square and the subway station...id stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] The view from my upgraded corner king was fantastic. The staff were very helpful and the hotel has been updated and very clean and across the street from the Merchandise Mart.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was great, large desk, good wireless, spacious bathroom and bed. Do not disturb signs were not always respected, which was annoying. Breakfast is a disappointment with a la carte service only and long waiting times, when busy. Positive was the free shuttle service, which was very flexible.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellant room,very comfortable far superior to your usual large American hotel chains.Nice views and good location in the city.Good breakfast buffet.Pool and gym average but acceptable.Dated lobby area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location (theater), great people, great 24-hour library with free latte/cappucino. Small gym, microscopic bathroom, small room. But the amenities are excellent and the room is clean, well-appointed and comfortable. Construction on street was noisy in the morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was wonderful; a spotless (and fairly sized) room, great service, very good food, and a convenient location. Perfect for tourists who want to see Time Square; we were able to walk right to it. A great stay that I'd reccommend to almost anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great room, I stayed here with my family on a week trip to New York. The staff where very accommodating, There was no entertainment in the hotel and the Bar was expensive, but other than this the hotel was a very nice base for our visit to New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 mins walk from the Empire State and just off 5th Ave. Really pleasant and helpful staff who really made an effort to make our stay a success. If you're a family, get the suite and you'll be fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location- walking distance to Rockefeller Centre. 2 blocks from the Subway. Arrived around 3am and managed to check in after emailing them of my late arrival. Very clean, very small. But plenty of storage given it's size. Rooftop garden great. Heating in my room was a little temperamental.  [END]
[BEGIN] Van Hilton iets meer verwacht, Hotel is OK, maar niet super. Personeel is wel bijzonder vriendelijk en voorkomend. Ligging in centraal NY is perfect (als je daar wilt zijn). Continental breakfast is OK  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here for 2 nights mid-November. We had a great time. They staff were friendly, the room was clean and not noisy, which was great given the location of the hotel. I would definitely recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel found thanks to booking.com. Good hotel, very good location walking distance to metro, 5th Ave, Times Square, Macy's, Madison Square Garden. Deck staff helpful, clean rooms, breakfast included, all at competitive price! The place to stay if you want to enjoy Manhattan without spending a fortune.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location, location, location AND nice people too! The breakfast at the hotel is fine but each time I've been - we have all enjoyed the Deli just three doors down. Also for dinner there is a wonderful Italian restaurant next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was great for the price. Good location, quite rooms. Breakfast was fine. Better than expected gym. Only real down side was slow elevator and inability to adjust heat. Would stay here again, but would try their Times Square hotel if available.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the Manhattan Club for its location and the energy of New York city. The hotel is well kept and the room size is large for a typical Manhanttan hotel. I can't wait to get back  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely hotel, but please fix the 3 other elevators!! 1 out of 4 is not a good percentage. Internet should be inclusive  [END]
[BEGIN] I had a great experience. Great staff. Room was big for a NY hotel and the location is perfect if you need to be in the West Village, and who doesn't need to be in the West Village.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione vicina a tutte le principali attrazioni, rapporto qualita'-prezzo eccezionale, cucina attrezzata con possibilita' di avere in prestito le cose mancanti dalla reception. Silenzioso (a parte il riscaldamento in alcune stanze). Unico neo le pulizie solo settimanali ma complessivamente ottimo soprattutto nei periodi di alta stagione degli altri alberghi.  [END]
[BEGIN] As usual our stay at this hotel was excellent. The only negative thing about this hotel is it's lack of free wifi. Aside from that, the hotel is in a good location and is serviced by friendly staff members.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice little hotel, decently priced, clean with friendly staff. It only loses a single point because the location feels a little unsafe. We never had a problem to be fair but it does feel -like I say- a little unsafe at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two women working the front desk were very helpful. Hotel was vintage Aloft in decor and offerings. Rather smaller than the Brooklyn Aloft but near subway and area restaurants and bars. Would definitely stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice and especially friendly hotel. the room was quite small but otherwise everything was o.k.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed April 19-22 and couldn't have been happier. It is a busy location but centrally located to central park, Rockefeller center, Bryant park and a short cab/subway ride to meat packing district and lower Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the everyday business traveler, this location will suffice your needs. Located in the northwest corner of Houston, it has immediate access the highway system and a wide selection of eateries. The room, bedding, tv selections, and service were good. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the aesthetic was pleasant the finishes felt cheap. The room was large by NYC standards but the shower temperature was difficult to control. The towels were rough to touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel is a very nice place to stay if you have buissness on the Uppewr East side... If not it is a bit out of the way. The rooms are nice and large. Very comfortable. The decor is OK but not fancy. Beds are comfortable, clean and well maintained.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great location for the whole family - easy to get uptown or downtown. The staff was very friendly and assisted us whenever we needed it. The rooms were comfortable and well appointed - love the Aveda bath products! We will definitely stay here again when visiting Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was in Chinatown, just a short block from Littly Italy. Less than 1/2 miles from subway. Room was very clean & updated. Breakfast had multiple selections. Staff very friendly & helpful. Free Wi-fi and no charge to print our boarding passes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly staff willing to accomodate your requests!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very near to major attractions, the subway, etc. Very small room but would not complain, as it was affordable. It would be perfect if they had breakfast included and kitchen facilities.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the Cosmopolitan Hotel in March and really enjoyed it - very clean, comfortable room, great location, great cafe next door. Would definetely recommend it and will probably be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the HC from 29th to 3 Dec for my wife's 40th Birthday. Room was small but nice. Hotel staff and in particular Charlie Loors where exceptional and catered for all our needs during our stay. Rooms was a bit small but had all the amenties required. Sukh  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quality, Very nice design, Expensive breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay at Hotel at Rivington was terrific! It is a smaller hotel with an intimate feel and very responsive and polite service. I loved the modern/minimalist decor, not to mention the privacy. I look forward to staying here again when I'm next in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just arrived back from a break with my Mother. Hotel in a perfect location, staff are great, very friendly, nothing too much trouble, breakfast very good, room perhaps in need of a spruce up but other than that would thoroughly recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oh my God, stay here, it is fabulous! It's crazily huge, you can wait a wee while for the lifts, but fabulous views if you ask for a high floor room, brilliant restaurant that revolves up top. So central, just brilliant, we walked everywhere as everything is walable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Belvedere is in a great location - 3 blocks from Times square and is reasonably priced. The rooms have refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker and safe. Rooms are clean and staff is helpful. I try to stay there everytime I visit NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] We checked into a spacious room that was well appointed and quiet. Hotel is near to everything and very impressive. We enjoyed every minute of our stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Inexpensive and functional, ideal for a short stay in the right location. The restaurant on the top floor is a plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room and bathroom were clean and fairly new. The beds were comfortable. The most annoying thing was the poor wifi service-it almost never worked. This needs upgrading.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very smart, clean, well appointed hotel. Tucked away at Lexington and 55th, it is still within walking distance of Central Park, Fifth Avenue, Times Square and the Met...We spent our visit walking everywhere and it was great to come back to such a comfy room. Would definitely visit again.  [END]
[BEGIN] We rented. Junior suite. The hotel staff ere excellent, the chairs in the suite were really cheap and uncomfortable. And the bathroom area with the toilet was not completely clean, and the toilet paper was not replaced. Other than that the view was fantastic!! Great city location!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoyed our stay at the Edison Hotel. It was ideally located for our visit to the city. The room was ready for our check in when we arrived at 2:30PM. The room was clean and comfortable and the hotel staff that we encountered were curteous and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, near subways, shopping, theaters, restaurants, and in the middle of everywhere. Been staying here for 2 years now, just wish they would finish construction.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very decent hotel with friendly staff, especially in the restaurant. The Executive Lounge is only serving breakfast on week days. As remarked earlier, mobile phone reception in my room was very poor, so was very depending on the Internet connection.  [END]
[BEGIN] After reading other reviews was a bit nervous on arrival however pleasantly suprised. Reception staff friendly and helpful. The room was large enough, clean, cool and had all facilities with a huge bed! The lifts were fast and the location great! Free safety deposit boxes although in reception for valuables.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms very nicely finished, little on the small side but very comfortable. Reception is fab. Wifi free if in the reception area, charged for the rooms. Great local bar across the way, can't remember the name but full of boxing pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a long weekend in Ny - and stayed at this nice hotel. Perfect location close to 5th ave, and loads of small shops, restaurants around. Easy walking distance to more of less all of manhattan. Staff friendly and helpful. Would love to go back  [END]
[BEGIN] Enjoyed the Carlton's quieter Madison Ave, location close to many restaurants and less touristy. The rooms are nice and the lobby environment very pleasant. The restaurant has good atmosphere but the food is not overwhelming.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for two nights. Yes, the rooms are small, but what hotel room in NYC isn't in this price range? Very cute, modern. Friendly staff -- thanks Joanna! Excellent location as well, close to Times Square. I'd come back again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Fine for a place to sleep for the night. Limited breakfast and TV options, but there was a nice little gym and a nice little fajita joint next door for lunch before I checked out. Room was clean with working AC and the water was hot. Would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Otelin yeri alisveris yapmak isteyenler icin cok elverisli. Otelin genel servis ve kalitesi de guzel ama biraz otelin tarzi bu oldugu icin biraz da eski bir otel oldugu icin odalar biraz eski kalmis. Modern otel sevenlere pek guzel gelmeyebilir. Hizmet konusunda hicbir eksigi yok.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location of the hotel is great! We had a quiet, smoke-free room, with good service. We propose that the hotel provide free WiFi in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Huge rooms, comfortable beds, extremely affordable ($70 for king room) when all other options are super expensive, warm, well serviced - lovely housekeeping staff. Coffee pot in room, close to great food options both restaurant & take away, not as super touristy but close to tourist attractions & subway. Recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for a Business Trip during Memorial Weekend. stayed in a king room with Sofa. good size room, had a partial view of Times square. the Hotel is HUGE and some may feel lost but if you are up for the adventure I'd recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] They were able to accommodate a last minute reservation at a decent price for the area. Rooms are small and outlets are few and far between. It's a nice place but the rooms are a bit small.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very convenient location for this Midtown hotel The bedroom suite was really clean, spacious and full ,of light. The staff welcoming and helpful. A good address in Manhattan!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, conveniently located, efficient staff, all you need. The only drawback was the heating - when it works it is noisy which is rather irritating at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Un hotel antiguo, pero completo en todos los aspectos, me hospede 10 dias y la verdad que no tengo quejas, el personal muy amable, el desayuno muy confortable. Solo gracias al prsonal  [END]
[BEGIN] Hampton Madison Square Garden was in a good location and rooms were a little small but decent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lieu ideal, en plein Time Square. Beau lobby, bar - restaurant tres sympa, moderne, belles bouteilles de vin. A recommander  [END]
[BEGIN] Was a really nice and uncomplicated stay. Friendly people and good atmosphere in the whole hotel. Cabins don't have a lot of space for closets, that's not so cool and the muffin-breakfast is quite nice but i prefere non-sweet breakfast. All in all i would totally recoment that nyc hotel!!  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent location, good value for your money. Don't go to the Brazilian Restaurant next door, food taste terrible and drinks are over charged. Trhere are many good eating places around the area. Hotel front desk staff are very helpful if you ask for information.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beware if the bell boy's trap. USD 2 / bag. Restaurant has excellent quality food. Sometimes the reception is under staffed hence waiting time could be long.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nice to sit on the sundeck in the morning and watch the city come to life!  [END]
[BEGIN] the Senior Rooms Operetions Manager and all the persons that work there are Exellent, they know how to threat you so they make you feel very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Newer hotel with contemporary design, very clean and helpful staff. Good room size for midtown location and block away from Time Square. Hotel should consider adding a coffee machine to ever room so that morning coffee is not a bit of a hassle. Overall, could not ask for better stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was pleasantly surprised at the Barclay. A very comfortably sized room and bathroom with a beautiful entrance and lobby for a wonderful price through priceline. But, parking fee was $60! Close to all - lots of restaurants, nightlife, rock plaza, street vendors, loved the area! Would definitely stay again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Would certainly stay here again! Rooms were large and always clean. Fitness Room and Pool were very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recomend this hotel Excelent location and hotel service.  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice hotel, the only problem I had was noise from the water pipes. It happened on several occasions during the night. Staff was eager to fix the problem. The front desk staff were excellent! Kudos to Diane, Liz, Sophie, and Brenden  [END]
[BEGIN] Die Lage des Hotels ist einmalig zentraler und besser geht kaum. Das ehemalige Tudor wurde nett renoviert und die Zimmer sind fuer New Yorker Verhaeltnisse recht geraeumig. Man ist einen Steinwurf vom Chrysler Building, Central Station und der UN entfernt.  [END]
[BEGIN] went up for a recent weekend. staff extremely helpful and pleasant. room clean and dining room and bar staff were exceptional.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nice location central but away from restaruants and night life  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is a bit dated but makes up for it with it's excellent location on 48th and the staff are more than helpful. It is within walking distance to many attractions and reasonably priced dining opportunities Just came back from NY last week.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were of a good size, clean, staff was friendly and helpful, but not always very knowledgeable. Some tours that were suggested were awful - go on trip advisor before booking tours. The hotel was in a great location - walking distance to many site, tours and pubs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely located, convenient to l, subway and bus routes. Meals and services were pretty high; and I live close to NYC. Overall, a good hotel. Could use so renovations to keep up with surrounding hotels, but when the price us right...  [END]

[BEGIN] This hotel is so quiet...The entire hotel has calming colors-classy decor and a Botero fat cat in the lobby. The beds and pillows were comfy. Nice lobby-I never got to the Jazz or the bar. Parking was little expensive-it is in a nice residential neighborhood of Manhattan-close to everything!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel Blake is a great place to stay and go to a Bears game. Clean and nice place to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in ottima posizione, tranquillo, pulito e con personale cortese. La nostra camera non era molto spaziosa ma il letto era gigante, ci dormivamo tranquillamente in 2 adulti e un bimbo di 5 anni. Ci tornerei...anche subito, pur di tornare a New York!  [END]
[BEGIN] We recently stayed at the Novotel, the hotel was central, the staff were of help, and the room comfortable! We couldn't have chosen any better, and would definitely recommend it staying there if visiting New York City!!  [END]

[BEGIN] A friendly hotel in a great location. Good breakfast, best to go earlier to avoid queuing, great value for money and would definitely book again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the W on Lexington for three nights from 7/21-7/24; notice an odor in the room after the 1st night. Yesheara at the front desk upgraded me on the spot and changed rooms. Excellent and quick service. She and the hotel took great care of me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, but a little noisy at night. Breakfast ok. Coffee & tea bar all day. For a New York hotel, staf is very friendly. Rooms very good size.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location just at central park and close to the subway stations was great. Also the shopping at fifth avenue etc was close by. Breakfast was worth the money. The rooms had a lot of space. I would definitely go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very, very well located. Despite its location right off Herald Square, there was NO street noise in our room on the 11th floor. The staff was friendly and very helpful. Breakfast was above -average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really friendly, and helpful. Great location, especially for Christmas shoppers. Restaurant was a little too formal and didn't match the Despite the renovation they worked hard to make sure I had a good stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfectly located in midtown NYC. Comfortable beds. The fact that there are only 2 elevators is a problem, but once they come, they are fast. Recommended!  [END]

[BEGIN] Check in was one of the easiest at a marriott, room was small compared to other marriotts that I've stayed in. Service personnel were very accommodating. Excellent location to shops and restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice place, comfortable, but not lift and not smoking. Near of subway, sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] Despite many options I almost always stay in the Park Lane when traveling in NY for business. I like the location and the large rooms? Avoid the rooms close to the elevators, they are very noisy, the others are very quiet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Essex House has two advantages over hotels in the same price bracket, in my view: outstanding location and decent size rooms (something that can't be said for other hotels in the area). Service is very attentive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Conveniently located in Manhattan, yet quiet. Rooftop terrace is a great advantage in warm months. The hotel is nicely and cohesively decorated and very functional & its staff is helpful. Rooms are well designed but still very tiny. In summary, it is a great place for a NYC weekend base.  [END]
[BEGIN] My son got married in Chicago. Most of the guest were from out of town. Parking was an issue. This hotel provided free parking to guests. The hotel service was excellent and the accomodations were more than adequate. The family thought this was an excellent choice.  [END]

[BEGIN] Stayed with a large group here over 4 nights. Great location to see everything, and a few minutes walk away from some good eateries. Great Italian around the corner. Rooms were comfortable, clean and as expected. Staff were polite.  [END]
[BEGIN] Honest and clean hotel. But not free wi-fi in rooms. Small business center. Breakfast is ok, dont expect much. Unfortunately there's NO fitness center. Helpfull staff! Very good location in Midtown, close to subways and stores!  [END]

[BEGIN] I Found a croachroak on my window and corridors are always dirty. The Hotel is very well located but need desperatly some improvements in decoration. Rooms are too small, you have difficulty in opening your luggage  [END]
[BEGIN] Brilliant 4 nights here, would recomened. Location is about 15minutes walk to times square 5 minutes to Madison, 10 to Empire state. Pleasent and Helpful staff. Nice modern rooms.  [END]

Complimentary coffee and tea available in the foyer for guests Complimentary internet access with printer available. Staff were helpful and friendly. Deli next door with good range of food at reasonable price  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable, modern, great location, clean and quiet rooms, but expensive. Very busy. What can one say about being in the heart of Times Square? Large hotel with many options as to restarants and entertainment.  [END]
[BEGIN] posizione ottima. a due passi da times square. nuovo con letti molto comodi. la stanza era veramente piccola ma in fondo poco importa. l'armadio inesistente e senza frigobar. solo telefono come servizio extra. tv hd con solo canali americani. silezioso. in fondo ok. ci tornerei.  [END]

[BEGIN] Incredible location and very confortable rooms. It is really all you need in the heart of manhattan. The only thing they could improve is the breakfast. Particularlly  [END]
[BEGIN] Got it on Priceline for $ 115 a night; the best hotel bargain in nyc or perhaps the us. Wonderful, stay, wonderful people, wonderful service. We got a "renovated" room, but it could have used some polishing-up; thus, the four star rating rather than five.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tutto ok tranne che all'arrivo le camere prenotate non c'erano ,erano disponibili solo camere standard.Le camere con le caratteristiche richieste e PRENOTATE ci sono state consegnate grazie alla disponibilita' del'hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Strategically located along Avenue of the Americas. Walking distance to Time Square, Central Park and many many attractions. I loved the location. The hotel can certainly use some renovation. I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is a bit tired It is clean but could use a little updating/polish The staff is minimally attentive and not very polished either If you can get it at the reduced rates, it's a good deal  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is great if you want a modern, clean, no frills attached place to stay in New York that is central. A great price for what you get, probably the best thing going around if you don't want to have your passport stolen in a dodgey hostel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall the W was a great place to stay. Stayed one night, staff was very nice, room was clean. Room was smaller than expected. Very close to subway. No free internet was disappointing. Room service was expensive.  [END]

[BEGIN] Lovely hotel in the heart of Manhattan, it would have gotten a superb review, but my shower head was broken and they weren't (understandably) able to fix it during my one night stay...  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is fine for a holiday. The rooms are small (like all Tourist hotels) but OK. Great is the POOL at the 14th store with a view over the city. Great after a day shopping in the heatness of june!  [END]
[BEGIN] Muito bem localizado. Os quartos sao pequenos, mas pratico. Tem um supermercado otimo na esquina. O restaurante Serafina e sensasional, e o hotel dava 10% de desconto para os hospedes. A recepcao te trata com educacao, mas totalmente frios. O preco era razoavel,.  [END]
[BEGIN] location was a little far, but the place is exrtremely nice and quite, very difficult to find a cab from the place although, the breakfast felt like eating at home, cozy place, but the hotel has no restaurant (neighbouring one has although)  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotelet ligger midt i det hele og er man kun faa dage i NY kan man ikke taenke sig en bedre beliggenhed. Prisen kan man slet ikke klage over, god mad, rent. Det eneste der har generet os var tobaklugt paa vaerelset.  [END]
[BEGIN] my wife and I stayed right before thanksgiving, great location half a block from 96th station(express train) so even though you were uptown ,10 min. to times square,our room was smalland had a shared bath but both where clean good value would stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel offers the standard "Embassy Suites" experience with great customer service. The location is very convenient to the L. We were impressed with the staff who took the time to find out how our stay was going and what could be done to make it better. We'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] As a first time NY visitor having a great hotel was key. The San Carlos fit the bill by being in a great location to attractions and subway. The rooms are nicely sized and the personnel were helpful and friendly. Would definitely stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the location, this hotel was a great pic: very clean, good price, and within walking distance to Wills (Sears) Tower and Navy Pier. The parking lot is very, very small though. If you are staying here, get here early.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in this hotel for a business trip in August 2011. It is good if you are having most of your appointments in downtown Houston, but nothing that cannot be worked around if you have a rented car, as you probably should do anywhere in the US.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was wel een kleine bedompte kamer.Badkamer is aan vernieuwing toe. Prijs kwaliteit redelijk, maar het hotel ligt perfect en de service is goed, dus voor mij het perfecte hotel voor een weekje New York.  [END]

[BEGIN] I enjoyed my stay at the Courtyard Downtown River North. The staff was very friendly and the hotel was clean and comfortable. The location, on Hubbard Street near many bars and a short walk from both the Magnificent Mile and the river tours, is ideal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Connected to the tunnels downtown, high cleanliness rating, can't complain about the room. Its just that Houston doesn't have the most inviting downtown in terms of foot traffic. Crashed here for a night on Priceline and caught an Astros game. Aways from the ballpark, long walking trek.  [END]
[BEGIN] we had a great time, hotel was nice close to everthing, loved it xx  [END]

[BEGIN] We stayed in a suite (4 adults) and we all thought it was wonderful. The room was clean and served our needs very well. The staff is super friendly and you can't beat the price. The room was small, but again, you can't beat the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great midtown base for a long weekend in Manhattan. Comfortable rooms, attentive front desk service and a cool lobby bar in the long corridor to 57th. The current construction next door makes for appalling weekday noise so I would check before hand if you are staying during the week  [END]

[BEGIN] The hotel is close to Broadway and Times Square. There are good restaurants around, and th subway 50th station is on the right corner.The breakfast room is almost always crowed, but very good in terms of variety and quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there overnight. Was a clean, bright, and convenient hotel. Rooms were well layed out, and contemporary styling. The breakfast was excellent! The staff were cordial, but many did not speak very good english. Not all of the elements in the room were working, but I made due.  [END]
[BEGIN] great value for money, we were on a bus tour so this was a part of a accomodation, but for sure a great one, clean, great staff, complimentary beverages at lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two nights on this stay. Fully the level of consistant Hampton quality I have come to expect. SO close to restaurants, theaters and Times Square. Subway entrance for A-C-E right there at 50th/51st. Staff is very polite though maybe a little unseasoned.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel. just a few blocks from Times Square and Theaters. Next door to fire station but you could not hear sirens from room.

[BEGIN] You won't find anything in the city with so much space and convenience as the Flatotel's family suite. Not the most beautifully decorated room, but definitely the most convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Estuve en la planta 21 y tardaba 5 minutos en coger el ascensor, solo hay 2 y siempre a tope. Pero por lo demas, bien situado.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good hotel,10 minutes from Time Square.Good clean room at 14 floor,clean en nice.Little nooisy in de night,but we were to tired to notice that. Close by to everything in New York,absolutely worth the price.  [END]

[BEGIN] Modern hotel op een toplocatie in New York. Enige min punten zijn, lawaai van de lift in de kamer naast de lift en de badkamer mag vernieuwd worden. Plus punten, super locatie, lekker maar wel prijzig ontbijtbuffet, moderne lobby in Novotel stijl  [END]

[BEGIN] Un bell'hotel...immenso e ben gestito.Bella hole belle camere...bella posizione!  [END]
[BEGIN] Prijs/kwaliteit verhouding dik in orde. Verwacht niet te veel van de hotelkamer, maar tijdens een bezoek aan New York zal je hier als het goed is relatief weinig tijd doorbrengen. Elke middag schone handdoeken en een opgemaakt bed. Daarnaast een absoluut ideale ligging voor een weekje New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is great. Away from the bustle of Times Square but close to subway. Lots of eateries close by. Rooms are small but well appointed. Bathrooms adequate - great NYC water pressure. Our second time and we will repeat! Comfy beds. No pool or spa.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here while moving my son into nearby Marymount Manhattan College. Very consistent Marriott. Rooms seemed very clean and up to date. Amenities not over the top, but fine. Service seemed a little overwhelmed as I was leaving. Sunday was a busy check in/out day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing deal $54 a nyt , worth every bit of it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice staff, perfect position,clean. Little bit expensive for a 2 stars standard ,but if you wanna see more things possible is the best place to stay. just few step to time square. They don't accept the visa electron.  [END]
[BEGIN] while marked down in cleanliness, it is more of a reflection to the overall condition of the hotel. it is in need of some maintenance which will make it appear cleaner and will be crisper and more inviting. specifically common areas and elevator lobbies.  [END]
[BEGIN] This a relatively small apartment block. Furnishings and fittings are ok if a bit dated, double glazing would be an advantage. Kitchen well stocked, breakfast items included. Staff welcoming and keen to assist. Good location. Overall good value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] great location, lovely rooms, great view, staff friendly and helpfull, i would love to go back asap!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very quiet area. Numerous restaurants close by. Very nice staff. The breakfast bar needed addtl items, not much of a selection. Overall, would stay here again.  [END]

[BEGIN] stayed at this hotel in March it is in a fabulous location for all the sights, and was spotless staff were very helpful as my mother was with me in a wheelchair. For the price it was even better than some of the more expensive hotels.  [END]

[BEGIN] The old Life Magazine building is spectacular, and gives charm to the hotel. The rooms are great, with comfortable beds. The only downside is lack of certain services, but sincve it is New York it doesn't matter since everything is within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] They're going through renovations so there are some basic issues that come with that. What I liked was the staff: the staff was great. That made up for some other challenges.  [END]

[BEGIN] My husband and I stayed one night in March in a junior corner suite. Great furnishings, beautiful decor, clean and quiet. Ca Va Braisserie was great for dinner. I recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the place for finest continental breakfast in the world. The Managers invite (6pm - 7 pm) is a unique experience which I have never seen in any of the restaurants in the world.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not much to add to earlier reports. An excellent location, 5 minutes walk from Empire State Building and Grand Central Station. 10 minutes from Central Park. Clean, Tidy with efficient friendly staff. Only 1 drawback. no free internet access, only pay to use WI-FI  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice people, nice hotel, would stay there again, but I'd bring my earplugs for the early morning planes taking off close by. Very pleased overall with this LQ.  [END]

[BEGIN] A busy, busy spring weekend was well-handled by an exceptional staff -- especially Michael who just naturally goes the extra mile! The locale and price are great, but it's the folks on the front lines who make all the difference.  [END]

[BEGIN] I was impressed by the quality of this hotel - from check in to check out, everything was fantastic. My room was above expectations and large compared to a typical W room. The location is hard to beat, you are just steps away from the heart of it all.  [END]
[BEGIN] e' mai possibile che nessuno si sia accorto che le stanze sono rumorosissime a causa della miriade di condizionatori sulla facciata, (interna)tutti accesi giorno e notte, per non parlare del turbo reattore all'interno della stessa.  [END]

[BEGIN] We spent one night at the Red Roof Inn during our last layover. Hotel Shuttle was right there to pick us up, hotel is clean, nice room, staff were helpful. No complaints. Good for a layover.  [END]
[BEGIN] We thing that your food was to exspencive on the hotel, to many cakes in the morning. when we order from the menucard the menu was soo small. But we can say that is not the last time in your Yotel. Best reguards Mads and Carina  [END]
[BEGIN] Very near to Michigan Avenue, river and resturants.nice view and lobby with all services in the hotel. Net is not free and they were planning to charge me for a shipping that I received by DHL. Avenue restaurant is excellent and offer delicious salad and excellent packages  [END]

[BEGIN] Ho soggiornato qui per tre notti e devo dire che sono stata bene. Le camere davvero ampie e confortevoli (considerando quanto sono piccole in genere quelle degli alberghi a nyc) con una vista strepitosa sul fiume. Unico difetto: un po' distante dal cuore di Manhattan. Occorre sempre spostarsi in taxi.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a very good location in near of madison square garden and other sightseeing attractions... we had all a good time in this hotel! Thanks a lot to the very friendly staff!  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I stayed here in November 2011 for a week visiting NYC. Great location, great staff and very comfortable rooms. There's a restaurant next door great for breakfast. Walking distance to Times Square and Broadway districts. We would definitely recommend this place to family and friends.  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice but my room smelled of smoke Very hip, terribly trendy but each room has white noise knob to inhibit the bar noise! The rooms are fime not huge. Its clean well appointed and good lobby. I never did get my goldfish.......  [END]
[BEGIN] I travel to Houston often for business and this spot was a pleasant surprise. Hot coffee waiting in the lobby every morning...great staff...and just about every amenity one could ask for. The rooms even have balconies for coffee and a quiet morning newspaper read...I will be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value for money. Location was close enough to the centre to do everything we wanted. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms small but clean and considering we spent most of the time out and about it suited us perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went there for an afternoon snack and we ended up staying almost 3 hours. The view is amazing, the staff is great and the food is delicious. The burger is to die for. I recommend this place for a peaceful break.  [END]

[BEGIN] Absolutely beautiful bar and well worth a visit if you're in the West Village. High ceilings, gorgeous open fire and great drinks!! Cosy and old worldly feel. Friendly staff and not too busy! Worth a visit if your in the area and want a break from the madness!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to stay in a 1960s motel then Ohio House is for you. Reasonable rates for an expensive city. Central downtown location, tho some might find corner location noisy. Clean rooms. Comfortable beds. Breakfast not included. Poor wifi. Friendly and helpful staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] the room was quiet. The bed was comfy. Staff was nice. Starbucks in the lobby. Parking is $57 a day. The pool was cool but had to pay extra. Overall a nice stay at a nice location,  [END]

[BEGIN] Benny provided excellent restaurant service. Overall service very very good. Hotel rooms spacious; rates competitive.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great for business if you are in the East upper side. Very small rooms (like anywhere in NY), nice service, very clean, good bathroom. Probably not the best for families, since the rooms are small. Overall good value.  [END]

[BEGIN] Although the rooms are nicely appointed, they are NYC-tiny, tiny, tiny. Attentive and helpful staff make the hotel feel comfortable. The breakfast buffet, however, is overpriced and mediocre, at best. For a good meal at reasonable price, walk one block to the Ritz Diner. Don't miss their blueberry pancakes.  [END]

[BEGIN] Excellent location for my first trip to NYC, easy walk to Times Square and the Empire State Building. Friendly helpful staff. Room was rather smaller than expected but nicely decorated.

[BEGIN] Stopped over here en route from Europe to Brazil and it was the perfect base for my only two days ever in New York City.Hits all the right notes from cost, cleanliness, service etce tce  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are slightly larger than your average NY hotel room. In general worthy of it's 4 star+ rating. Breakfast was poor value at $27 ahead buffet. Has a nice bar. Overall a good experience. A little pricey at $430 plus tax.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice Hotel with room and service perfect for a business trip but boring with almost nothing around that .... Zero choices in case you just want to have a meal or a drink not in the hotel! Unless you are desperate for a cheese burger at McDonald  [END]

[BEGIN] I have been staying at this hotel, when I travel to Chicago, for nearly ten years now. The rooms are clean and in good repair, the price is unbeatable for a downtown Hotel and the location is awesome.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is a great hotel, very friendly staff. Rooms are a bit small, but wasn't in NYC to sit in my room :-) Great location. Would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are set up nearly identical an apartment! Very nice & spacious with full kitchens. The breakfast in the morning was great. Great pool that reaches a depth of 8 feet! Two basketball hoops & a volleyball net!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you use hilton honors make sure to show them upon check in. They will give you a couple little extras for your stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good hotel for a simple business trip in downtown Chicago. Not luxurious but adequate for my needs. The staff are always very friendly and helpful, rooms very clean, food quality very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] We loved the hotel. Smack in the middle of everything! The room was the largest room I have ever had in NY. Everything is up to date, clean, bright etc. Parking is next door ($35 per day). Other than the 12.99 per day internet fees. It was perfect!!  [END]
[BEGIN] netjes en professioneel, volgens mij was er zelfs een zwembad maar dat weet ik niet meer helemaal zeker  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel molto ben posizionato (molto vicino sia a Central Park che a Times square) che insiste in una street tranquilla e poco caotica. Molto gentile e cortese il personale alla reception. Due linee della subway facilmente raggiungibili.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ideal location if you want to enjoy Chicago summer! Access to the lake and it's beaches make it the most wanted hotel in chi town! It's away from everything else so would not recommend for a first time visitor. But all subsequent stays, this place is definitely worth a shot!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a fantastic way to spend a night on the town. The concierge organized our dinner at a local Italian restaurant around the Broadway play and we were given a free dessert, compliments of the Hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great check in service Nice friendly front desk person.Room was ready and waiting with AC on. Great Room.. NOT very Motorcycle friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] The receptionist Regina was very helpful!! I was having some issues with getting a room and she was so great about it!! I am having the best time!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in the hotel for 3 nights. Very nice and clean hotel. Wonderful breakfast. The rooms have fantastic view! The GYM is nice but too small and gets full. The major disadvantage - no free wi-fi in the rooms - unbelievable - in the middle of NY...  [END]
[BEGIN] Gemakkelijke ligging, continental ontbijt inbegrepen, kortom perfect hotel voor kort verblijf  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed 5 nights at teh Night hotel in April. Although the rooms are small, they are well equipped, funky and very comfortable. The hotel location is great, just off Times Square. The staff were also very helpful, assisting with travel arrangements and restaurant bookings. Would recommend to all  [END]
[BEGIN] Really enjoyed our stay here. Walking distance to major attractions and easy to get on/off the subway. Rooms are immaculate and generously sized, though decor is a little dated. Only caution is no Wifi and it's expensive to buy access. Would absolutely stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is convenient location, very good restaurant, rooms clean but small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Feels like you're on a ship - narrow halls, tiny rooms, great front desk. Incredible location - close to river, highline, west village, etc. Very quiet. Really nice cafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel has a great location; the staff (including Brian the Doorman) provided wonderful help when needed; the lobby is a trip; bed is comfortable; bathroom is small, nice design, and functional; room is very small; only complaint is only two small drawers in closet for clothes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and atmosphere--very well designed. Our only complaint was the basic room amenities--iron, phone, etc did not work. We may have had just a bad room. However, the bed quality was fabulous--great comfort!! Overall we would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel is nice , front desk are very helpfull and friendly but the rooms are small overall it's really was a great experiences and i would love to stay in this hotel again and again  [END]
[BEGIN] Pulito e con bagno di buone dimenisoni vista la media degli hotel economici di NY. Unica pecca, personale di servizio un po' evanescente: in 10gg non siamo riusciti a farci aprire la cassaforte in camera. Servizio di pulizia giornaliero puntuale e ben fatto. Rapporto qualita' prezzo comunque eccezionale.  [END]
[BEGIN] bon hotel et bon accueil chambre tres petite mais propre et tres bon petit dejeuner petit bemol chambre tres petite et refectoire egalement tres petit pour la taille de hotel(14etages)  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall the hotel was ok. Great location to everything nyc has to offer. Only complaint is the wall where thin you can hear everything that is going on in the rooms next to you. I had a budget room, which came with a bed, dresser and a shared bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the Hyatt for two nights in March. Rooms were decent and clean, and the location is good....just 1 block from Michigan Ave. many resturants are just a short walk as is shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] O hotel fica num lugar bem central em Manhattan. Vale a pena  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location opposite central park. Ideal for shops. South gate bar was tranquil spot for quiet drink overlooking park. Room a little cramped. Staff very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Millennium Broadway is a typical four star hotel. The lobby and location is excellent (50 meters from Times Square). The rooms are very good and clean. The service is ok. We can strongly recommend this hotel for travellers who are looking for a good stay at a great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rates can vary considerable so check for different dates. Check-in can be a little chaotic.  [END]
[BEGIN] We just spent two days at this Residence Inn. The room was huge by Chicago hotel standards. The facility was very clean. The one problem that we encountered was heat control. Even with the heat turned off we had to open a window to cool the room for sleeping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just back with 8 Friends from this Hotel. Hotel is perfect for a trip to New York as it is the centre of everything. Irish Breakfast is superb Staff are great and we will go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was nice & clean. Staff friendly & helpful. Within walking distance of good shops & deli cafes. Their breakfast & week day social hour with snacks was good. A BIG thank you to Jamie & best concierge Elliott!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location! Nice staff...rooms a bit on the smaller side (we are a family of four). Would stay again, it was a good stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] The stay was good. Didnt have any problems. They let me check in early and I could walk to all the broadway shows. Could walk to NBC and Grand Central Station too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ci siamo trovati benissimo,perche' la posizione dell'hotel e' centralissima,hotel molto pulito,con cambio di asciugamani giornaliero,ottima la colazione di "Capitan cafe" annesso all'hotel,ci ritorneremmo volentieri.  [END]
[BEGIN] An older Westin but very nice. Super customer service. Good restaurant with good service also.  [END]
[BEGIN] We got a deal on priceline, and paid the extra $30 for a view room with the "pure" air treatment. Rooms are small, but comfortable, clean, and well appointed. The beds and shower were very comfortable. Great location, and the bellmen will hold your bags for the day after checkout.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I stayed here last March and we enjoyed ourselves. The room, not surprisingly for NYC, was rather small, but it was clean and modern. The service was outstanding. We enjoyed the relatively quiet Upper East Side location and short walk to Central Park.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buon albergo situato nella parte nord ovest di hells kitchen, vicino ai posti "classici" di New York (musei, central park, etc.), all'interno di un quartiere pieno di locali e ristoranti. Camere ok, piccola sala fitness, wifi gratuito, personale gentile, vicino alla metro, ottima posizione. Consigliabile per il rapporto qualia' prezzo.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Roosevelt Hotel lobby is filled with old world charm. The lobby during the Christmas holidays makes you feel like you are part of the 1950's. Staff is very friendly and hotel accommodations very nice. The hotel is located close to Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool hotel, cozy, not so modern but clean and good rooms, you come here for the excellent location, but most of all for the mystique that surrounds this hotel, almost as you can feel ghosts around you. Beds could have been more soft  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel. Would recommend to others. Pretty close to the shopping mile and the pier. Extremely pleasant staff all around. If I had one issue the pool is almost so tiny you may laugh. Good place for families.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in 2 apartments with 3 of us in each. Very spacious but a bit tired decor wise. Beds very comfortable. Staff helpful and the location is great, a short walk from the subway. Good value for money compared to a hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really enjoyed this hotel. Great location near a variety of subways. Given the heat wave the great a/c was much appreciated. Loved the free water and wireless internet. Also liked having a small fridge and micro in the room. Will definitely stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I were booked there by a company I deal with. Comfortable hotel, kind staff but expensive. Small gym small reception hall and rooms are old fashioned furnished with a style though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Always a pleasure to return to this lovely, friendly hotel. When the doorman says, 'Welcome home.' when we return, he really means it and it feels that way. Not to be missed.  [END]
[BEGIN] in the right location, very good value, good breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly Service, Convenient, and a touch of class is what comes to mind. With all things considered, I would say the hotel is probably best value you your buck.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Grand Hyatt is a smart, big hotel in a big city, but we were pleasantly surprised by the caring attitude so many of the staff members. We accidentally left our camera in the room on departure and that, for us, major problem was quickly and competently solved.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice weekend in NYC, enjoyed the stay at the hotel, especially because of the friendly service provided by Ms Louise Rechlis. Thank you very much for everything!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, nice and clean room. Staff was very polite. Only negative - I cannot agree to pay for wireless internet in 21-st century  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an old hotel with a very good location, walking distance to Time Square. What i most like about the hotel is that the beds are very large and there is a kitchentte in the room. Internet is a bit problematic.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed on 4th July. The beds are comfortable. Rooms are nice n clean. Good value for money  [END]
[BEGIN] Well located, big rooms, kitchen, helpful staff (Ms.Negesti is one of them). It was not the first time I stayed at the Eastgate Towerand certainly not the last. Great value!  [END]
[BEGIN] We found this hotel to be clean and well furnished. The staff were all extremelly pleasant and the food was good. The glass elevators are an experience in themselves - if you like rollercoasters, you'll love them - otherwise they can be a bit scary.  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Hotel gilt ls super hip, und liegt im angesagten Meaat Packing District. Die Lage ist zwar unschlagbar, der Blick ebenso und das Personal ist nicht nur gut aussehend, sondern auch sehr zuvorkommend, Die Zimmer sind allerdings sehr und rechtfertigen nicht den Preis.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel for the price. Superb location 80th/Broadway. Rooms small and basic however, one comes to NYC to be out and about. If you prefer brand hotels skip this. If you're willing to be flexible it's great value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottimo per la posizione; veramente a qualche passo da Times square e di fronte alla fermata della metropolitana. La nostra camera, al nono piano, era pulita, spaziosa e silenziosa. Il personale gentile, disponibile e professionale. Secondo la mia esperienza, consiglio vivamente questo hotel. Emiliano.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there based on the other reviews and I have to say they are very accurate. Staff is great, rooms very well maintaned and the location is fantastic. Please, go to ginos east on your first day!!  [END]
[BEGIN] La verdad el hotel super bien ubicado, caminando a todas partes, habitaciones grandes y muy confortables. Ideal. Optima relacion calidad precio. Recomendable 100%  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the history, quiet...very comfortable. Hated not having free wifi without having to sign up for club... Which I found out online the day we were leaving. Great curb service for taxis... Whistles and wool coats were classic!! For the prices, shouldn't nickel and dime folks, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here while visiting New York. Beautiful hotel, great food and very comfortable rooms.. staff could have been a bit friendlier though !  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 4 days, brilliant location. Didn't have to get on one subway- all major tourist attractions walking distance. Our travel agent messed up our reservation too but the hotel staff were very helpful and made our stay enjoyable!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got back from a three day weekend at the Iroquois. We visit NYC every few years and this time we went to celebrate our 33rd anniversary. We had a great stay. Room was ready early, clean, and the hotel location was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and in stayed at the Omni Bearkshire on Febuary 11. The newly remodeled hotel provided nicely appointed rooms. The staff was pleasant and helpful. Not a bad deal for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you need to stay in Times Square, I'd recommend this hotel. The room was very quiet and there was plenty of space for an NYC room. It's definitely not the nicest Hilton but mid-range compared to others.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for three night last weekend. Very dark lift, corridors and rooms. Room 0906 not a good view - air vents and other bedrooms. Not a lot of room but understand this is normal for NY. Great shower. Lovely staff. Shame about the gloom.  [END]
[BEGIN] Een net, schoon hotel. Vriendelijke bediening en de koffie 's ochtends was redelijk. De kamers waren netjes en schoon en hadden precies voldoende comfort voor een kort verblijf. Je bent dan toch alleen maar op je kamer om te slapen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are big by New York standards, we had a King size bed and a Queen.It is close to Times Square and subway ( 3 blocks). Reasonable price, very happy with our stay  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was convenient and the staff were very available. The Galley was great! Clean, comfortable with a great location. The rooms are simple but elegant. One should be comfortable when sharing a room as the toilet was not a located in a separate room Viky from BS  [END]
[BEGIN] I am pleased to say that I loved this hotel. I enjoyed the service, the location, the room size, the room decor, the amenities, etc. The bedding and the bathroom were particularly impressive. Given the reasonable price (for New York), I cannot imagine finding a better value for a hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] ottimo hotel. risponde a tutte le caratteristiche necessarie per passare una vacanza cheap a new york. pulito, linee metro vicinissime, zona sicura, personale splendido. raccomandato anche per la morbidezza dei cuscini...  [END]
[BEGIN] This century old hotel has such charm, low prices, and central location that it may be unique. Even those not staying there should visit the French Palace lobby, and look at the memorobilia adorning its walls.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nous avons passe 5 jours dans cet hotel, il est tres bien place et bien insonorise,les chambres sont propres petit bemol pour les serviettes de douche ils oubliaient tous les jours que nous etions 4, les petits dejeuner sont tres chers mais bien garnis, la concierge tres sympa.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks to our wonderful contact in the Sales Dept. and Guest Service agent, Reina, I got a room with a fabulous view of Central Park. Although this is not the first time I've stayed here, the rooms I great a well without the view!!  [END]
[BEGIN] From check in to check out, we couldn't have asked for nicer staff in our hotel. Although the rooms are older, they have a lot of charm. The location of the Wellington Hotel could not be beat. We would gladly stay there again on a return visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Preis- Leistung sehr gur Free of Charge W Lan hat sehr gut funktioniert was man von viele andere Hotels die sogar das W Lan in Rechnung stellen nicht sagen kann. Fruehstueck inklusive und auch OK. Zimmer sehr sauber.  [END]

[BEGIN] Zeer goede ligging, mooi verzorgd, uitzicht was minder, uitstekend ontbijt  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was clean and comfortable. The rooms are small, but if you are in NYC, you shouldn't be in the room. The staff was friendly and I would definitely stay here again. Thank you Fairfield Inn!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at this property last night. It is on the expensive side, however the front desk staff is very freindly and helpful. My room was rather large and clean. The shuttle at 4:40 AM was on time.Overall I had an excellant experince.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice enough hotel although nothing special. Smallish room but comfortable. Opened cupboard under the sink to find the last guests trash still there but we just closed the door! Paid $300 for 1 night on Hotwire.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was good and quite but reception and common areas very loudly  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel proximo as linhas de metro, times square e entre a 5th e 6th.  [END]

[BEGIN] bellissimo arredamento di P.Starck, camere confortevoli, posizione comodissima, accanto a Dean&De Luca, ottime colazioni.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location on the Upper West side. Had never been to New York and so a good first time experience. Right on the main subway line. Safe at all times of the day and night. Only beef was that we had to climb four flights of stairs- no lift!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Lady at the front desk was great. The hotel was cool but it needs updated in the rooms. especially the bathroom. It could use some new bed linens also. It has a great location and we would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] In the tourist heart of New York, hotel is now a bit tired but the staff and security were first rate.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was in New York for business. The hotel is very centrally located, right next to Times Square and very close to the subway, 7th Ave Stop. The rooms were comfortable, clean and tidy. A Good 4-star accommodation in NYC.  [END]

[BEGIN] Front desk staff so helpful and considerate. Room was really lovely. Thank you Jack and Erwin. Did you find my earring?  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, stylish, clean, friendly. Everything worked fine, very tiny room. Good choice, maybe not for elderly people.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great.every thing is around, 6 blocks from central park,few minutes from Tim's squar,5th avenue. The rooms are very pleasant,but with out free wifi The lobby is like subway station.they charge 3.5$ for bag in the luggage room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good sized room.... Great location to all of the great sights in New York - especially with a subway across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location! 5-10minutes walking distance to times square and the hopOnHopOff bus, 5 blocks from empire state building, and several choices of small restaurant in the surrounding areas. Hotel and room is quite good, not the 5star but it is as what I expected. Check in process is very fast.  [END]
[BEGIN] The good: Whole Foods is nearby It's a value compared to other hotels Got a good nights sleep each night The bad Housekeeping didn't come on one day Long waits for the elevator Small, albeit comfortable rooms. Lack of light in rooms  [END]

[BEGIN] Great location and beautiful rooms. Service a bit stuffy for my taste. Overall, a great option when in NY. Walking distance to great restaurants and shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a mid town boutique hotel it was very pleasant stay, also the amenities and price was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at Affinia Gardens in February 2010 in a one bedroom suite and we were pleasantly surprised. Unlike many other hotels in NYC, Affinia Gardens has spacious rooms that are very quiet. Good value for money. Helpful and friendly staff. We would definately stay at Affinia Gardens again.  [END]
[BEGIN] + Helpful Staff Personalize needs and services online Kitchenette Closet space/shelves/vanity/dressing area Sofa bed Large mirrors Clean bathroom Room much better than the atmosphere of the hall, elevator, and lobby Location near good restaurants Quiet street  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely comfortable and staff is helpful, well located in downtown chicago  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall, I would consider staying at this hotel again. We were in NYC for a week and we would have been more comfortable with a little more space but you can't beat the location or service at this hotel. The balcony on the 16th floor is a nice feature.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here with family. Nice place. Staff is friendly walking distance to george brown center and surrounding places. I'd stay here again. Stayed on first floor. Pretty nice room.  [END]

[END]
[BEGIN] Honesto pelo valor da diaria e localizacao. Peca pelo banheiri muito pequeno. Compensa com otima localizacao e servico bom.  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked a room on Priceline and were pleased with the selection of Sofitel. Our room had no view, but was very quiet, great for sleeping and comfortably appointed. Marble bathroom was very upscale. The lounge area was very relaxing and friendly and the hotel staff was attentive.  [END]

[BEGIN] Everything was good but not exceptional. A good value. Have stayed on past occasions and would do so again. Close to good shopping on 5th Ave, but not a particularly good location for the better restaurants. Walkable distance to theaters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay there for internet summit - close to convention, service is good but room need a little bit update. Restaurant downstairs are very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although some of the staff at W hotel was mediocre. Eden at the concierge desk was excellent. She had wonderful suggestions for restaurants and helped us book tours. She made our stay in Chicago more enjoyable.  [END]

[BEGIN] We have stayed here a number of times. It is a great location to Boystown and steps away from two major l-train lines.Lots of shops, bars, restaurants. A short walk to Lake Michigan. Lots of sights and some beautiful neighbours for strolling. Close to Linkin Park, Wrigley Stadium and Andersonville  [END]
[BEGIN] An excellently located hotel with a good level of quality and service. Continental breakfast was basic but more than adequate and the staff were very attentive. Would certainly use it again.  [END]

[BEGIN] Top location, friendly staff, great rooms and views  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was clean, spacious, with good facilities. There was a nearby restaurant which provided good, cheap meals.

[BEGIN] I spendt there a week. Location is very good and there is a subway station in front of the hotel. Room is clean and it was pretty silent which was surprice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for five nights and found the hotel great for what we wanted. The room was certainly no frills, but was clean, decent shower, secure, and being as we were travelling on a budget was great value. Most importantly it was just off Times Square!  [END]

[BEGIN] small but very convient and reasonable considering midtown manhattan location. My wife and I have stayed here on three seperate ocations in the past three months on buisness.

[BEGIN] Rita was awesome - the whole staff was really great and helpful.  [END]

[BEGIN] Ottima posizione, praticamente a Times Square; stanze un po' piccole ma dotate di tutti i confort necessari e pulite. Molto bello il design e l'arredamento interno. Evitate i piani bassi: sono molto rumorosi a causa del locale al piano terra e della strada trafficata.  [END]

[BEGIN] Wir waren mit dem Hotel und der Lage sehr zufrieden.

Sehr zentral, dadurch auch etwas laut, liegt vor allem an dem Gehupe der Autos.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel itself was beautiful, centrally located, and a calm oasis in the hustle & bustle of New York City. Of particular note was the registration clerk Cesar. He was kind, helpful, and accommodating The bar tender at Shula's restaurant, TORI, was also extremely friendly, welcoming, and engaging.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfectly good. No complaints. Huge rooms.  [END]

[BEGIN] Het hotel lag overal dichtbij, dat was het grootste voordeel! Was schoon, maar wel wat gedateerd en niet erg modieus ingericht. Wel een erg mooi pand, Times Square en Central Park op loopafstand. Een aanrader voor niet te duur en een goede locatie!  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a good time in NY city. Hotel is nice. Trip advisor was very helpful when I seek for advices. My hotel is near by Times square, it was so convenient to access any where. I will come back if I have more time.  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice clean room on high floor. Position was ok, with great Burger restaurant next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] for the price and location this was a very good hotel. We got a hotel on the north side, but south side views of the hancock are much better. overall had a great stay, no complaints.  [END]

[BEGIN] Hotel is great, rooms are very modern and clean. The service is amazing and they realy do everything to make your life simple and make you feel comfortable.

[BEGIN] Great location for access to the great restuarants and sites around Manhatten and New York via the subway Services levels were very prompt with helpful staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel overlooks the WTC in New York which is one huge construction site. It is noisy except for the dead of night. On higher floors the sounds are not bad, on the lower ones, it can be pretty loud.  [END]

[BEGIN] The mussel appetizer at this restaurant is wonderful. We kept coming back to it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It did not live up to the expectations, but overall, being so close to everything was great. I am not sure it was worth the price in quality though.  [END]

[BEGIN] Gorgeous location, nice room, wonderful rooftop cafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Roger Smith Hotel was the perfect hub for us during our first trip to New York - close to shopping, attractions, museums, etc. The hotel was just so small and intimate as we wished, with a service that met our requirements. Recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very satisfied with the GEM Hotel and have even recommended that my parents stay there in December.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is pretty much your standard hilton. Rooms are about what you'd expect from a hilton. Location is great given its right in the airport (you don't even need to go outside). Only one issue with this hotel: $15 to use the gym?!?! You have got to be kidding me.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in just 2 min walking dist ance from TIME SQUARE .There r bar resturant nearby to dine in any time.CENTRALpark is 5 min walkawAY.u find the 5th avenue just on the backyards and 2min walking distance.Cab available 24 hours.  [END]
