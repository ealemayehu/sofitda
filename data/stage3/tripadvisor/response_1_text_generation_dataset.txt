[BEGIN] Too expensive comparing to the services provided. The room was not clean when I came. In the night people knocked on my door. Storing bagage was charged by 4$. I cannot recommend the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] We only stayed one night, but we found the staff to be unattentive, carpet in room very dirty and the toilet made a harsh sound when flushed. The Good Stuff - we got a discount on Parking, the shower and bed were amazing. Location was good..  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is located in dirty street, lifts are very slow, foyer was very small, not what I would have expected from a Hilton. When I got there the wireless internet wasnt working which is critical for business travel. Cancelled my booking and moved different hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was poorly trained, water was luke warm, breakfast met the spec but wasn't very good. Lots of other hotels in the area. I won't be back. Try for a Halliburton rate if you do need to get in here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Las habitaciones son nuevas pero estan mal cuidadas. El Hotel esta pegado al puente Mahantan por lo cual el ruido es permanente. El otro matrimonio le asiganron una habitacion que no tenia ventana, si NO tenia ventana era un cubo. Hay desayuno de cortesia. La zona es pleno Chinatown. Sucia.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were old and shabby the toilet and sink were cracked the bath was chipped not good at all  [END]
[BEGIN] Well, it is certainly a landmark with a lot of history and a great location - it is a shame that they haven't/couldn't keep the rooms in decent condition. Rooms experience equal to an old cheap $49 per night interstate motel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobby, library, rooftop are great to socialize. Rooms & hallways dirty are screaming for overdue foe renovation & upgrades. Rooms are the size of a match box, very over-priced, spend your money elsewhere and come here to socialize  [END]
[BEGIN] To sum up: Very Dated Rooms, OK Staff, Terrible Food.... Look somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Positives: Price, room larger than average for New York, location, free breakfast Negatives: Grudgy, stains on cushions and floor that are better not to think about; Very Noisy; Water in the bathroom sometimes ran brown; beds very uncomfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed on business in late June. On first impressions the room seemed spacious. However very tired. Service was lacklustre and tardy. Breakfast was mediocre. The whole hotel needs a serious facelift and then it can enjoy its great location. Won't stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical budget hotel. Looked like they just remodeled, so i thought i would try them. There was Mold in shower and room just didn't feel clean. Did not really feel safe as a single female. I travel often an felt the rate was too high for what they offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms very small, not very clean, very expensive as well. Breakfast is a scrum. It's only upside is the location  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was OK, specially because the bathroom was quite new, refurbished very recently. The street was quite noise at night and you could heard some trucks playing the horn! The worst was breakfast. Poor sitting tables, plastic clutery and a bit busy. The best, WIFI available throughout the hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed only 2 nights in this hotel on august 2010. The lobby is good, but my double rooms use single was very small, with mold smeel. Also the bathrooms was very old. With a free business center. I suggest to customers without expectations and who are in transit.  [END]
[BEGIN] We expected more than we received and were sadly disappointed. The room was small and had a large mildew spot on the ceiling. The restroom was dirty with mildew around the sink and shower. I would avoid this hotel in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] The walls in this hotel are paper thin, you can hear everything that is going on in the next room. Two nights out of our 5 night stay we were repeatedly awakened by people in the next room. Could not have appetizers only in the dining room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel estupendamente ubicado pero mu descuidado y sobre todo viejo El precio es acpetable  [END]
[BEGIN] Advise for the fb manager : google "continental breakfast"... It will help you to find the way... Advise for the owner : buy some ABB stock it will certainly help you to past the pain of your unusefulled investment  [END]
[BEGIN] the rooms were not clean, the toilets had mold the staff were not happy to help at all rooms don't have a mini bar or a safety box the carpets n lamp shades had stains on them  [END]
[BEGIN] Great locacation but! Small rooms, tiny bathrooms. Small bed or beds, No coffee facilities. Lots of clean linen daily Long queues at reception. Expensive bar. Would not return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was tiny. Bathroom design was weird. Water would splash everywhere every time we took a shower. We asked for an electric kettle, but could never get one, neither from house keeping nor front desk. great location though for sure.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is pretty disappointing if you are used to the service and style of a normal business travel hotel (Marriott, Wyndham, Hyatt, Hilton). I wouldn't come back here, I would walk or take a cab and stay further away next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lo mejor del Hotel Carter es el precio y la ubicacion, esta a media cuadra de Times Square! No tiene lujos, ni mayores comodidades pero alcanza perfectamente para quienes desean un lugar donde descansar bien por la noche para continuar recorriendo NYC durante el dia.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ho prenotato nel mese di Giugno 4 notti al Westin New York Times Square,la camera malgrado fosse una deluxe era piccola e non molto pulita. Il servizio "room service" PESSIMO,il mangiare scadente ed il tutto molto caro. L'unica nota positiva e' un'eccellente posizione dalla zona dei teatri.  [END]
[BEGIN] They never had adequate staffing available to service their patrons. Seemed not to care about poor service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its location is the only pro - 5 minutes walk from the 5th avenue and 10 from Broadway. The rest was a big disappointment: very tiny room, not particularly clean, bathroom requiring renovation. I would not recommend it to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel construction started at 8am on a Saturday morning on the floor above ours. Sawing, drilling, and loud radios were not appreciated. Hotel management did not appear to remind workers that there were actual guests present in the hotel. Otherwise, would have been a good stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I did complain to La Quinta HQ in regards to the poor service that I experienced in Oct 2004 upon check out. Good follow up from HQ customer relations. I hope that the service level is heading in the right direction.  [END]
[BEGIN] pulizia scarsa...ma OTTIMA posizione e prezzo! io ci tornerei!  [END]
[BEGIN] c'est malpropre, il y a des coulisses sur les murs et des moisissures dans la salle de bain. La douche ne fonctionne pas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently stayed three nights on business and couldn't believe they have no restaurant or bar (closed for rennovation) They have drink service in the hallway lounge on the second floor for a few hours in the afternoon. This is not a good situation for unwinding after a hard day.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good points - Room was clean on arrival and cleaned everyday Location was great. Unfortunately the good points run out there. The rooms were very small, staff rude, no breakfast supplied (restaurant was closed down), no capuccino bar, no hot water etc etc. Would not stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately the room smelled like sewage. Very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] We intended to make a reservation for a suite for a special anniversary and found the response cold and off-putting. Our experiences at Mandarin Orientals elsewhere has been consistently positive, particular in regards to warm and helpful service. We booked elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bed bugs and poor management, lack of ownership which ruined my vacation. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were small and very dark, just one small window. Sort of old and worn looking. While the did offer high-speed internet, you had to sit on the bed to use it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location , that's about it. Long line for check in and out , dark rooms , comfortable beds , great TV system, breakfast area to crowded and busy Bathrooms total disaster , like a very small closet , no place to put your stuff Not worth the $$.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room smelled of mildew. The staff was friendly. Next time i visit NYC I will probably look for another hotel. Location was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This new hotel was pretty nice with avg size rooms for NYC ,a friendly staff, and midtown sout location. The big knock is that the street side rooms are noisy ( ear plugs are supplied!!) as the builders did not spend the extra money on sound proof windows.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staf were ok but unfrindly. The room bed sheets were very dirty I had to go out and buy new so I can sleep on it. The location was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location but had expected a lot more of quality of rooms and service. Hotel could use substantial upgrade And staff was slow in their responses, for example when asked for towels since there were none in the room it took the 45 mins  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, rate, amenities, but I never encountered such a loud frig! It was like sleeping next to an ice machine! What a shame, everything else seemed perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Crowded, noisy, dirty. Service is poor, food is worse. Nothing like other Hyatt hotels I have visited. The room was dark and dusty. The Sunday buffet was tasteless and at 25.00 per person, not worth it. Too many nice hotels in Chicago to be wasting your money on this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location but........ No fine dining in hotel, very very loud everywhere including your room! I was on the 32 floor and heard every door slam and every siren, horn and street noise boom as if I was outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the hotel for two weeks on business. There is a fire station, police station and monestary next to the hotel. Between the all night fire sirens and bells from the monestary in the morning, it was very tough to sleep. A/C unit didn't work.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here the first of October and the hotel needs some updating - rooms were so small that I had to move the t.v. back to get around the bed. Bathroom was small. Location is was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] We felt that the hotel and our room was dreary and the breakfast room was a dreary bar with adjacent bathroom that was in need of cleaning. It looked far better on their website than in person.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff are unhelpful and the view of the water has a highway infront of it. But the rooms were ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] we had a large group of rooms reserved for our group...approx 20 rooms. Two different rooms on the 2nd floor and the 3rd found cockroaches !! staff was very apologetic. offered free breakfast!  [END]
[BEGIN] What a terrible hotel. Old, shabby rooms, dead service and ambiance. Priced like a mid price hotel, but everything else is like a shabby student dive. Only good point is the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, clean rooms, noisy aircondition, but worst of all the traffic noise from I10. The fitness centre can hardly be called a fitness centre.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff at the reception desk was not friendly, and did not smile, welcome me, or give me any real eye contact. The rooms were plain and very common. I expected bettter, unfortunetly, I would not return.  [END]
[BEGIN] Found this hotel to be an excellent location but in complete need of a refurbishment and a good clean. For the price paid, there are much better Manhattan hotels.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were incredibly small (European small), there was a disturbing wet spot on the floor outside my bathroom, the carpet smelled like dirty feet and the staff needed a serious attitude adjustment! Plus, the pitch for their roof-top bar was over-rated. Minimal drink selection  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for the location. Which is very good. Overall the hotel rooms were noisy and the heaters would not turn off which made it very uncomfortable. The floor in the hallway and bathroom was very slippery and unsafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stupendi saloni ottimo personale buon servizio camere vecchie senza bidet senza cassaforte con impianto di riscaldamento mal funzionante letti per nani magri (meno male che la mia era una superior queen) Ubicazione strategica .Nel complesso necessita di un restauro integrale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was ignorant, the room I had was tidy and messy, bathroom was a joke ... It was hot in the common rooms. It's rather far from metro station. The only good thing that I can recall is that I stayed for one night and not more ...  [END]
[BEGIN] Location was great, buy the hotel room was dirty, untidy and I got bitten by bed bugs. Would not stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I stayed here in the 90's and I remembered it as being very nice. Well, time has taken it's toll on this property. The room was very dated and the Club lounge had very little to offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rude staff. Overpriced. For $500 per night no fridge no coffee maker ("call room service") no free Internet. Never ever ever coming back. Ever. I would rather be in a boutique hotel for $300 permit and take a train to this conference!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location, exceptional staff - very friendly and accomodating. Clean and comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] posizione favolosa, hotel vecchissimo e da ristrutturare considerando la posizione e il pregio del quartiere. l'unica cosa positiva all'interno era il magnifico Lindy's dove abbiamo fatto delle ottime colazioni all'americana!!  [END]
[BEGIN] the room although clean, was very small. The staff not too friendly...I would pay a little more for a better room and somewhere where breakfast could be served. This came across as a back packers kind of place really. Not the best and wouldnt stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has a great name, but in reality it is the worst five star hotel I have ever stayed. Old fashioned bathroom, rusty shower and although I am a deep sleeper, I've been waken up several times during the night by people speaking in the corridor.  [END]
[BEGIN] The web deal room is way too small. And there is no room for clothes or other items. The bathroom is almost unusable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was very, very small. The bathroom did not have a vent. The telephone did not work, the tv did not work very well and the reading lamp did not work. It did have a very nice continental breakfast, but all in all in my opinion, not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't expect service, the hotel is in a good location but that is about it - the bathroom vents had so much dust so no air was getting in or out - a real health hazzard. from a traveller New South Wales, Australia  [END]
[BEGIN] Too big hotel , absolutely impersonal , location is good if you want to be uptown but my advice is try another place.  [END]
[BEGIN] We hadn't planned on staying here. It was "assigned" by American Airlines after we had a missed connection to London. The staff was friendly, but the property is well worn. We had a 2nd floor room, and could hear the bar music all too clearly in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed for 3 nights and was glad to leave. rooms cramped and hotel overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a mediocre hotel charging few hundred dollar per night and no free internet! Rooms are claustrophobic matchbox holes. Location is great though! Don't stay unless you have business in Manhattan  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent two weeks. Very antiquated. 13" TV and the remote didn't work. Cracks in the ceiling and very little soundproofing. I must admit the elevators are good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Flight to Chicago was cancelled but still charged for full night room. Decided to stay next night and was not offered any kind of upgrade or apology or reason to come back. Fees for fitness center and inattentive to room issues  [END]
[BEGIN] I don't know what beds the previous posters have slept on but the bed we got was so hard I was unable to sleep. So much for a comfortable bed. The bliss spa products were awsome though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would not recommend this hotel, the rooms are tiny and uncomfortable, the lift was often broken and did not work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service very polite, nice, helpful Room small, dark, bad smell, very noisy because trains pass very close location far from city center, next to underground station breakfast self service in lobby to take into room  [END]
[BEGIN] NYC is a difficult city to find an affordable, easy place to stay, but I wouldn't stay here again. The room was tiny, it smelled bad and apart from the room being painted like ALice in Wonderland, it really had no charm.  [END]
[BEGIN] For 265.00 you could do a lot better. The room they gave me had one bed eventhough I reserved 2 beds. They blamed it on Travelocity. The offered me a room with 2 beds at 60.00 more. The basically said take it or leave it.  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived there because we had no reservation and all hotels were full. They charged us 250 dollars per night (without breakfast) for a sad dark old room and the staff was extremely impolite and rude. Cleanness is ok and situation is not bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definately not what I expected for a Starwood property. Location is great but hotel is dated, expensive, and employees not very customer focused. Would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient location. Rooms are small and unless in the upper half of the building dark, with no view, and noisy (not from 7th Ave. but from the AC/ventilation); bedding is of low end quality. Overall: There are many better places for the same or even less money.  [END]
[BEGIN] A dated hotel, worn, tired rooms, elervators some times work, noisy aircon from other rooms (even when you turn yours off). tiny bathroom. Some staff helpful, others just couldn't be bothered. WiFi is a bit of nightmare, room keys sometimes work, sometimes don't.  [END]
[BEGIN] My advice is to stay away from this place. The sink and the bathtub had a layer of skum. Have stayed in many hotels before, but have never seen anything like this. Although the linens were fine, the bed was not firm enough. will never stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I went for the marathon and we found this old the hotel, all ancient, old baths, this hotel seems they be used to film old movies they should remodel evething,becuase is in an excellent location. is clean  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were old and small. The week leading up to Hurricane Sandy, they were $250 a night. After everyone's flights were cancelled and they were stuck there, they went up to $450 a night. The staff was also very rude.  [END]
[BEGIN] As a platinum member of Marriott Rewards, I'd at least think I would be told that I was being put in a handicap-accessible room when I checked in. I wasn't. It's a typical airport-area hotel. Barely tolerable for one night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shabby room. Excessively loud air conditioning. Very mediocre service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 1 week of my USA trip. This places was really loud, the staff at the front desk were not very helpful at all. The rooms were oldish and the house keeping was not that good at all! If you can i would avoid this place!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the hotel is nicely located in Manhattan when you enter the reception you have a feeling it is a budget youth hostel and not a 4 star hotel. The rooms are terribly small. Breakfast is expensive and not good at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is disgustingly old. The lobby is nice but the room is gross and carpet so dirty. For the same price do yourself a favor a stay somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm not happy with this hotel, poor in loungh, features, kids area, laggage staff (they Do not move do not receive It is good reception especially Mr. Sadk, location  [END]
[BEGIN] We will not return because: the registrar held my cc and license and walked out of sight; the shower did not work; the eggs were cold; no coffee packets left in room; back door was unlocked for 2 days. It was clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] So called deluxe queen room was tiny with closet space for a mouse (a large mouse, anyway) and a toilet that flooded the bathroom when I wasn't looking. Charming otherwise and nice staff, but not enough to overcome the rest or justify $220/nite.  [END]
[BEGIN] We paid 4 star hotel prices for a recently decorated, but tiny, basic room (queensize) with a bed & nothing more. Mandarin Oriental drinks are half the price! And otherwise no facilities in this room only hotel. V disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel sempre molto affollato, con code per l'ascensore, code per accedere alla reception, code per la colazione. Ottimo invece per la posizione, per chi predilige l'upper est side. Comunque non ci tornerei.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel has a great location but rooms are not very well designed. yes they are all semi suites but unless you are on a high floor there is not enough lighting to compensate for the lack of natural light in the rooms. The bathrooms are quite nice though  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price we paid per nite we would have here a 4 star hotel. The breakfast was poor and the room they held it was to small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Besides location was not all that impressed. Staff not super helpful, called 3 times for an extra towel. Rooms are cramped and pricey. But located right near all the action.  [END]
[BEGIN] I booked a room on line and when I arrived they were over booked and sent me to their other location 4 miles away. This put me on the other side of Manhattan. I have never has such an Awful experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] No Facilities. There is no restaurant, only one bar downstairs which was closed for a private function one night during our stay. We were very disappointed as this hotel is very hyped in Ireland. Location is good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Peeling paint, water damage, window would'nt close all the way with houling winds outside, one elevator for all to use, loud knocking noise all night from elevator shaft 1 room over.Location was great off of Michigan Av by water tower place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Historical hotel needs major refurbishement. Even if the Towers are far better than the Waldorf itslef, they really need a full refurbishement. Painting is needed in the bathroom, there are steains on the walls. Service is good and friendly. Amenities are good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] run down, needs money spent on it BUT it's turning over good money so why bother.WE will not book again great location but not again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was very small, for a hotel with the name Hilton, we expected a little more. Bathrooms need to be updated, fixtures were very worn. The hotel was nice, but not worth the money we paid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Below average hotel, indifferent staff. Only the location is good, but there are lots of other hotels nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for one night as a result of Groupon. There was no hot water in the bath room, paint peeling over the bath tub, two of the three phones in the room did not work. Very disapointed for a boutique hotel in downtown Chicago  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Antiquated rooms, poor service, expensive Internet with wireless only available in lobby. No plug ins for electronics, felt like a firetrap. I have read that there are plans to demolish it, needs to happen! Would never stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was very nice. I liked the theme and the room was ok although for the price very small. I expected alot more for what I payed for this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average hotel expensive tough for what it worth. No Free WIFI!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't stay on the side facing the fire station & police station.... two of the worst things to have outside of ones window in NY. But, it is a very safe area! The lobby is nice, but the room felt dirty. YUCK!  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobby is kind of run-down. The rooms are nicer, but the traffic noise from the expressway is unbearable.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have about 15 photos of how gross the room I stayed in really is. I don't know how the Hyatt name is associated with this place. The only reason I am staying here is for proximity to McCormick place. Never would I choose this place on my own dime.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reminded me of the hotel in the Blues brother movie! LOL  [END]
[BEGIN] I would not stay at The Standard again. It is too noisy. The problem isn't external noise but inter-room noise (voices, tv, plumbing) and corridor noise. Not good if you would like to sleep.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is not up to Hilton Standards. The carpets were dingy, the bathroom had dirty tile and drains. We went on points and were put in a handicapped room with a view of broken windows. DO NOT STAY THERE.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chicken chunks found on sink stopper, unidentified orange stains on bath tub, pillows with oily scalp smell (common problem found in most US hotels of the same class)  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked the room using an online discount website so the name was unpublished until after purchase. Linens were unclean and even had blood stains on the sheets, faulty knobs on shower and took he water forever to get hot. Customer service was good but comfort level was very low!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay at this hotel regularly for business. The attitude from the employees seems to get worse and worse each time. You would think you were staying in a posh boutique hotel in SOHO. The hotel itself is nice and rooms are great, but beware of the hotel staff!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the carter with my friends from Denmark. The best person to ask for anything is the tall black guy "Abdul". He is great. other than that the place is you get what you pay for!! Karen  [END]
[BEGIN] Certes facile d'acces cet hotel gigantesque ressemble a un hall de gare avec des queues interminables de check-in/out. La chambre est minuscule d'une proprete douteuse. tout est a refaire. Nous avons eu de la chance, nous n'avons pas trouve de punaises de lit!  [END]
[BEGIN] At Rm ending in "05" side of hotel...starting @ 6:45AM PILE DRIVING CRANE banging away made it IMPOSSIBLE TO SLEEP a minute longer! Otherwise, very nice "practical" , clean, hip would stay-again type of place D&M  [END]
[BEGIN] Dated bare bones hotel could use a facelift. Staff was friendly and helpful. Great location across from Lake Michigan and close to public transportation. There is not a restaurant in the hotel, but there is one next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] Check-in person poorly trained Lack of amenities in room - no bathroom rug available until next day. Level of service definitely not maintained for a property like this. Rooms and hallways are old and tired, both in main hotel and "towers". Not worth the price at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for a night. Wow, really not nice. Small room. Felt dirty. Stained. Grungy. Towels were like sand paper. I think a 13 inch television. I would never recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is this really a full service Marriott hotel? This old hotel is in a great location if you need to be at the airport but it is very run down and dated, I will not stay at this hotel again.  [END]
[BEGIN] for a new hotel it was worn.stains on the chair. carpet was worn. breakfast was fair beds where nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: Nice view of lake Soft beds Great food Nice staff Cons: Old/needs remodeling Weird smell Ice machine didn't work, had to go to 3 other floors to find ice Zip check-in didn't work Long check-in wait $10.95 internet charge Small bathroom  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty sheets. Ac was not working when we got to the room. Staff was not helpful. Couldn't get anyone to answer the phone when calling downstairs. Overall def would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] super sucio piso 15 pero bien sucio y muchos chinces, demasiado  [END]
[BEGIN] There is nothing terribly wrong with this hotel, but beyond that, it was run-down, not particularly clean, and with small, dank-smelling rooms. The whole place needed some love - furniture was scuffed, upholstery torn, drapes had holes in them, etc. I would not go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, good breakfast. Gave us a smoking room when we reserved a non- smoking room. Check in was slow. Hotel could be kept up better. Sheets were dirty. Taking two different elevators was not convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is good and price was kinda cheap...reception looked nice. Then found microscopic room with shared toilets and generally poor condition. Although cheap it wasn't that much above hostel or doss house level - but if travelling student you might find it OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was small. The atmosphere was definately not family. The restraunt downstairs was mediocre. The decor was bleh. The customer service was poor. The parking was outrageous ($38). And my GPS had a difficult time finding the hotel.The location was ok, pretty central. I would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the location and room but our Ipod was taken from the room. We were told insurance would cover it but then they denied ever saying that. So we're out an ipod.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros? Great location, good size room. Cons? Everything else. Service was lackluster and, at times, rude, way below Hilton standard. Maintenance problems were ignored despite numerous inquires; wake up call didn't happen one morning. Try the Belvedere Hotel around the corner instead.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is in a really convenient location. Walking distance from the time square.The staffs were very friendly too. Not a lot of space in the room. The bathroom was not very clean. This hotel is only good for one or two night stay to visit NYC and time square.  [END]
[BEGIN] To get straight to the point it was the smallest room I have ever seen, let alone pay for! My boyfriend and I didn't even have any floor space to place our overnight bag. DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE PRICE!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not clean. Staff unattentive. Rooms are small. Will not stay here again. Will not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has hotel amenities with MOTEL rooms. It is dated and dirty. I would strongly recommend staying at the sheraton at brookhollow near by. While the staff was fairly nice..this hotel was over priced and dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] lobby (if thats what you wanna call it) smells, halls smell, rooms smell. definately not worth the money. stay at hotel qt if you wanna go cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] l'hotel est bien place mais trop trop bruyant.Aucune insonorisation avec le monde exterieur (bruit de la ville avec les voitures, le ramassage des poubelles....). Literie trop molle mais surtout trop petit pour un standard americain (lit 140 cm).  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a great experience. Fleas infested the first floor. They messed up the reservation and tried to kick us out a day early. Charged us the wrong amount when we departed  [END]
[BEGIN] Tatty looking hotel. Seen better days. Due for a facelift  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrogant staff, limited help with problem, followed "comany line", absolutely no effort beyond the company line to assist you. Rooms are comfortable as are the beds, good location too. Good luck. If everything perfect you will be fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Habitaciones antiguas y sucias(sabanas sucias), Lavabos anticuados y con mal funcionamiento. No minibar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel room is very roomy but the upkeep is lacking. Rooms airconditioning was not sufficient to cool the room in summer and there was no hair dryer in the room ( a feature that I expect in any american hotel). The roof top bar is nice, and worth a visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay at this hotel was horrible. The hotel staff provides poor customer service, pretends to speak little english and very unfriendly. The rooms are extremely small with very little space to move around. The management cares solely about the business than the needs of the guests.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have travelled and stayed at many hotels over the years, this hotel was by far the worst. The hotel features: - paper thin walls - small rooms - no elevator - noise all throughout the night Overall I'd recommend you reconsider.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had friends coming over. The only place that was available eas this one. Not too clean, room lobby is overcrowded. had to wait too long to check in. The staff is not very attentive and my friends had to change room twice due to poor conditions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small very dated rooms. Last century bathrooms. Smelly carpets. Staff not so helpful or friendly. This hotel needs demolishing and rebuilding. Not everything is bad. Location is fantastic. I would not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my worst hotels in NY! Room was too small and air conditioning was very very noisy. Very expensive for the type of Hotel. I spent 160$ per night, 2 people. At least it was clean. Would never book again.  [END]
[BEGIN] $15/day charge for gym ($25/week) and no warning of fee. Water never really got hot. Otherwise hotel was fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Because Houston can be chilly in January, we specifically looked for a hotel with an indoor pool. While the pool as nice, the pool area was freezing. It was like we were swimming outside making it very uncomfortable for the kids.  [END]
[BEGIN] good location close to Times Square BUT expect a very worn and tired building and rooms. Was closed for a while recently ... gosh, should've used the time for a major renovation. Old furniture in rooms, old CRT TVs with few channels, lobby carpet worn.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in una posizione strategica; le stanze sono molto piccole e mal ridotte; i muri molto rovinati,i mobili vecchi e rotti,il bagno piccolo; ma nel complesso pulito e funzionale,per gente che sa davvero adattarsi  [END]
[BEGIN] Will never stay here again. When I tried to pour milk it came out solid. Very few items available. Chair and sofa had brown stains. We were afraid to sit on the furniture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Imagine a bed with four walls around it... no chair, no desk. Nice gym, library, bar, but at most this is adequate for one guest staying one night.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel needs a little TLC. Possibly some updating, and I was not at all impressed with the service I have come to expect from Hilton hotels.  [END]
[BEGIN] Part of Hyatt chain. Hip and high tech yet friendly, helpful staff. OK restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are small (even for NY), furniture and rug is worn out, walls and trim is chipped and beaten up, bathroom is smaller than the closet and the heat isn't adjustable... we melted even with the window fully open. This hotel is disappointing, go somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel, great room and bed - BUT the hotel is just upside Manhattan Bridge, and trains are running over it every minute - didnt get much sleep there, so only if you are a deaf person or can sleep in 91 decibels noise - then book this hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and beautiful building but......Apartment 4609, Streeter Building, leaves alot to be desired. 3 bedroom, 3 bath with only one television, no pictures on walls, no headboards, no dressers in bedrooms and in need of paint. Nice staff but I suggest you try a different place.  [END]
[BEGIN] I traveled to Chicao to celebrate a cousins birthday and wished I had read the reviews before staying here. Rude hotel staff and "way" outdated hotel. BTW, why have a swimming pool if it's BROKE!!!! On the plus side, the jazz band on Friday was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a hotel that is clearly on it's way down. Nice and convenient location, but the interior is grotty. Bed is comfortable and clean. Room and elevators have a musty smell and it's all very faded and well past it's best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Incredibly small room; there were no closets and even hardly any space to put our suitcases. The phone wasn't working and housekeeping usually didn't do the room until late in the afternoon. Nice staff though, but I wouldn't recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera deluxe inadeguata piccola senza poltroncina il bagno si allagava ,porte e finestre inadeguate entrava troppa luce durante la notte camere rumorose positivo le lenzuola e federe.personale disponibile la nh dovrebbe restaurarlo.prezzo inadeguato.  [END]
[BEGIN] When we first walked in it looked nice the bathroom was really dirty and one of the mattresses was in a terrible condition where you pretty much sleep on springs only. The carpet was also stained really bad. Would never stay their again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Check in took 1 hr too get a totally unacceptable room. Requested move and of course more $$$ but worst was the promised noon room was ready at 5pm and took 11/2 hrs to get luggage delivered. Should have stayed at the Palace  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is Great, room was dirty, needs a good cleaning.  [END]
[BEGIN] old and not charming building,tiny rooms which are not pleasant to the eye,the over all feeling is that except for a great location there is nothing good to write home about.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sinteticamente, camere piccole al limite dell utilizzo, poco pulite. Ottima solo la posizione. Consigliato solo per chi considera l hotel come un dormitorio e per chi si trova per la prima volta a new york. In alternativa consiglio upper est side!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess I got what I paid for. There is NO ELEVATOR in this 2flr building. I was first given a room key to a room somebody was in. There is a pool.. but it's smack dab in the lobby. Awkward to swim..  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was perfect, near Time Square, Central Park, and the subway station. Lots of stores, restaurants and coffee shops. The room however was terrible, the carpet dirty, the beds were lumpy, the room small. I would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] nunca recomendaria este hotel. la limpieza deja mucho que desear, 2 dias nos dejaron sin hacer la habitacion. pesimo. y la atencion de la recepcion lo mismo,reclamas y encima parece que les molestas.ademas el hotel esta en obras, y es bastante molesto.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the lobby continues to attract, the rest of the hotel is in bad need of some basic upgrades ( particularly the furniture, carpets, window treatments etc...)  [END]
[BEGIN] Very old and worn hotel, don't believe the claim that they have free internet in all rooms. The internet only works in the very cold, smelly and noisy lobby. Even there it is pretty slow. Very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] impressive lobby and thats where it ends. pathetic attempt at contemporary decor. small bathroom. paper thin walls with very noisy doors. only highlight of the room ...... a comfortable bed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione strategicamente perfetta:a due passi dalla metro,vicino a tutto anche a piedi. Stanze piccole,moquette vecchia e sporca,bagni vetusti. Consiglio una grande ristrutturazione.  [END]
[BEGIN] Half the staff are fine, the other half seem to be selected for their pure bloody-mindedness. The location is fantastic. Rooms are funky. But when I heard that the movie star Russell Crowe had attacked a receptionist, I confess my sympathies were with Mr Crowe.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very hot room with no air. The hotel is rather run down. Not what I expected for a W hotel at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is located in the center of the time squar It is very close to the attraction area. No hot water in the shower , no Fridge For two days no body clean the room No paper towles  [END]
[BEGIN] Old hotel in that is undergoing remodeling but needs even more help. Even the very small remodeled rooms are not a place I'd stay again. Paint was chipping, bathroom wasn't clean. Bed was very comfortable but the bathroom smelled of sewer gas. Escalator was broken.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hote is noisy with paper thin walls. Don't plan on sleeping if your neighbors are watching television. It's too bad- the beds are great with luxurious down quilts and feather pillows and noise from every direction. Good location-near Michigan Avenue and shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room is spacious and the staff is extremely friendly. the room cleanliness was terrible. The carpet is worn and horribly stained. The curtains were dirty. The towels were old.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to Times Square, but room was small and bed was very uncomfortable. Cell phone did not work in room or lobby..only outside. Room needs major updating. Staff was friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] We visited at New Years and had a junior suite which was nice. The restaurant was very overpriced and cocktails in the tiny, boring bar were $20.00. Service was nothing special.I wouldn't return.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for 6 nights, the staff was very accomodating but the whole building looked tired and for the price it was NOT good value. The room and especially toilets would probably passed muster in the 1970's. grubby looking think next time we will stay in a recognised hotel chain.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have been here two days and still can't get clean towels. I've been trying to access the wi-fi and have had inconsistent results. Ceiling is falling in in our room and the whole place smells funky. Definitely not worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Estuve en Congrees plaza hotel, a principios del mes de Junio de 2012 , es un hotel muy viejo, y el precio que pagas es mucho por lo que es, las habitaciones son muy viejas, olorosas y creo que hay muchos mejores hoteles en CHicago a menor precio, nada recomendable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is located to the north of downtown in a buisness district.There is no much activities in this area.The hotel rooms and furniture is outdated and the hotel requires a major renovation  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was very nice but the people that worked there were extremely rude. After spending thousands of dollars there, they refused to let me eat a bagel in the lobby and said i had to leave. How pathetic.......  [END]
[BEGIN] It had a good location, very central. The rooms very cleen but the hotel was very old and looked like it could fall apart every second. the bed were very bad and the windows were leaky so it must be cold in the winter.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed in some small hotel rooms but this one is in a league of its own! Hotel is well decorated, clean and wonderfully located, but the room was so small as to be comical. We're talkin' tiny. You can do better for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is very good, the lobby is beautiful...but the rooms and the service are below standard. I am a Hilton Honors guest and they gave me a terrible room, unrenovated, dark and dank. I called to complain and after waiting 30 minutes they gave me a barely acceptable room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Albergo carino, ma camere piccole, non particolarmente accoglienti e non in buono stato. Io, e numerosi altri turisti, lamentavamo problemi di apertura della porte (serrature vecchie e difettose) di pulizia delle camere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very very small rooms, clean enough, however not a great location, close to Ground zero and century 21 shopping. About a 20min walk to Soho. Got stuck in lift twice, not very helpful staff  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was the smallest I have ever seen, it is the cheap version of the other w hotels, definitely below the w standards. location is ok but spending the extra $ to be on union square is worthy  [END]
[BEGIN] Paying $560 for two nights we would have expected to get a better overall service. Breakfast area in the reception are and staying in a smoking room was not what we anticipated.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was not helpful, the room was tiny and not what I had reserved. Very run down, needs a lot of work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Okay little place for the money, but I had a bad experience with bed bugs. I had five bites on my arm, and even caught one little guy in the act...gross. Beware room 407.  [END]
[BEGIN] everything else as expected. $15 to use gym which was just crosstrainers and treadmills essentially  [END]
[BEGIN] Great security at the door, always smiling NYC police officers. When you arrive inside the entrance, different story. The male employee that stands beside the escalator, always in my way. He definitely had an interest in me, back to the NYC officers.  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel does not worth $ 1 , it is dirty and outdated it needs complete renovation  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is nice...clean..great location..BUT...dont park your car there!@ The valet scratched my car and the hotel employees, manager and parking attendant have forged documents and are trying to say the damage was there prior. Save yourself the aggravation...go elsewhere!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, but the darkly lit stairways are invitations to disaster. The room I had made rooms in Paris look gigantic. I could only get from the telephone to bathroom by climbing over the bed  [END]
[BEGIN] Extreme costs charged for every small thing including Internet ($15.00 per device per day) and $8.00 for a bottle of water that costs $1.69 across the street)  [END]
[BEGIN] Here are the pros and cons of this Hotel in a nutshell: - Pros 1 Central location 2 Clean towels every day Cons 1 Basic rooms in need of decoration 2 Rude and extremely unhelpful reception staff 3 Fittings and fixtures not working  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, the location is good but the service generally lacking. A lot of noise outside the rooms and to access the laundry there is only one option in the day. Not believe it is a cost-effective.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought when I left the hood, I left the roaches there too....not so! I purchased some roach baits to help with the infestation but it was to no avail. Awesome price for this room, but you may get charged extra for the roaches!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was not upfront about drilling and construction ALL DAY. 840am-5pm. They withheld that IMPORTANT point at booking. What shadyness! Never never again. They didn't even offer 1 discount. WOW ! (in a bad way)  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is not up to Doubeltree standards. It must be one of the most rundown ones in the network. It is average at best, stay here for the location only not the rooms. The bathtub looked like it was on its 2nd life and needed to be replaced.  [END]
[BEGIN] The furniture is old and worn. The hotel is very very basic. As a Marriott Rewards member, we stay in a lot of Marriott properties. I am very surprised this is a Marriott property. Adequate but barely, marginally clean, won't stay here again but it was very cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not a hotel. It's a place to sleep and store your suff while you are shoping and enjoying NY. I booked two rooms via hotels.com and while a check-in they could only find one reservation.  [END]
[BEGIN] From previous experiences with different holiday inn's in America, I found this hotel to be very old and outdated. Overly priced for what you get!! Staff were not very friendly and helpfull at all. Would not stay here again or recommend it to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] check in very slow, staff were unhelpful, room was ok, bit dark but excellent location.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have travelled the world, have stayed in many NYC hotels also, and I have never stayed in a room this small. It is ridiculous.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room for families (2 adults + 2 chlidren) are small. Service is poor and typical of big hotels. No restaurant for the breakfast. The only advantage is its very good location close from Time sqare.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was unimpressed with the Hudson, largely as a result of the poor service. In short, the staff were just too 'cool' to serve you properly. I shall not be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hi, I stayed at the Travelodge in Chicago during 4 nights and it was correct if you don't mind having bedbugs. The people didn't offer any nights for it and they were laughing...  [END]
[BEGIN] Billed for more than agreed upon. Rude staff. Very small room and bathroom. No tea /coffee. Stairs to climb. No view. Clustrophobic. Stripped bathroom toiletries. No one to talk to to discuss billing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location with walking distance to everything but the room is small and smell like mold. i could not sleep all night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very shortly ,great brand but need's full renovation ! rooms are less than 3* quality ,service is very slow ,would not recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] had the best suite on the top floor....opened the door and smelled like an old wet towel.... in wall air conditioner units show that this hotel is an old crusty building with some new paint... very high rates for parking & internet(shouldnt this be free everywhere?) stay away!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not recommended for recent transatlantic arrivals. No breakfast available before 7.00 a.m. in the morning, which is not convenient if you are awake from 5.00 a.m. Restaurant very dimly lit in the evening. Impossible to read at the table while dining.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably from someone's pet dog as this is a 'pet friendly' hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Old hotel, not friendly, sade room, no decoration. Not to recommand for a touristic stay in New York  [END]
[BEGIN] Here for a conference and the noise at 11 pm is unbelievable! I asked for a quiet room, but there is construction on the street and the noise will never allow sleep!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nice place no one spoke with you however it was like a statue of one person would say hi and offer assistance and that was the bell staff my god what a hotel that miss the meaning of tangible service  [END]
[BEGIN] First it took us thirty minutes to check in and we were the only ones there. When we got to our rooms they were the size of other hotels closets with no amenities. Stay somewhere else!  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was fine, although small. The staff is unpleasant, even rude. Front desk unhelpful. The worst experience I have ever had.  [END]
[BEGIN] Checked in.....toilet was backed up....heat did work....engineer worked on heater for 1 hour.....coffee maker did not work... light bulbs missing..no place to eat breakfast... but the price was $260 per night...... never going back  [END]
[BEGIN] The night crew are complete morons. They tell you nothing is available when it is. They barely speak english. The hotel attendant had his friends hanging around in the lobby smoking. I was not happy with the safety factor. I must admit the rooms were clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice comfortable room. Staff friendly enough. But the noise from the nightclub next door was incredible. Might recommend this hotel because of the good location and overall quality but you would want to get one of the top floors if you want to sleep before 4.00am.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel viellot mais assez propre personnel peu aimable chambre cote tres bryant impossible de dormir un rapport qualite prix tres mauvais 190 dollars par nuit ttc et taxes n' esite pas a payer un peu plus cher pour un bien meilleur hotel .cette hotel na d'interre que son placement.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was infested by bed bugs and I woke up with huge, itchy welts all over my body. It was been a month and even after taking medicine, I can still see the bite marks. I will NEVER stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] HOTEL OTTIMO COME POSIZIONE, MA SCADENTE COME PULIZIA, SERVIZI OFFERTI E PREZZO TOTALE NON CORRISPONDENTE A QUANTO PATTUITO PRECEDENTEMENTE PERCHE GRAVATO DA TASSE INCOMPRENSIBILI. PERCHE' NON SIETE PIU' CHIARI SUI COSTI TOTALI ?  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is good, great location! When we got to the room, it seemed clean but the bathroom was dirty. Then we changed rooms, and it wasn't clean either. We didn't make a big deal but we never got the attention we deserved. I will not go back there.  [END]
[BEGIN] solamente ben posizionato per il resto un tre stelle non all altezza. Della nomea il bar sprovvisto di campari e grappe bicchieri sporchi camerieri scontrosi non giustificabile il prezzo pagato considerando i disservizi Gt  [END]
[BEGIN] Very small room, old and not clean. Too expensive for nothing. They are not open to provide help, support, changes or even a comprehensive NO. Old towels + old ripped bed linen. I do not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Noisy room (the air system does not turn off), poor tv reception and very slow internet access... enough 'incentives' to look elsewhere in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bis auf Lage und Sauerkeit gibt es nichts positives zu berichten. Der Service war sehr aufdringlich. Das einzige Interesse war wohl einen Transfer mit einem privaten Limo-Service zu verkaufen. Das Zimmer war eine Zumutung. Zudem wird direkt neben diesem Hotel ein neues Gebaeude errichtet.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is quite interesting and has some advantages for the price. There are a lot of things to improve ............................  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall not bad-- but not great either. I booked a good rate (I know, you get what you pay for...) Bathrooms had no ventilation whatsoever, wallpaper was peeling and the entire bathroom stunk of mildew. I went to CVS and bought a can of Lysol which helped somewhat.  [END]
[BEGIN] looks are deceiving.downstairs room ......... bedbugs. i woke with all my body like i had severe chicken pox. we changed rooms, no bed bugs but smell of pee in the tile floor in the room upstairs, but very dirty feet, don't go without shoes.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the hotel has a great location. It was quite dingy. Pillows were 1.5 inches thick and room was less than clean. Ceiling was peeling and bed coverings were very dated. Check in was less than pleasant, considering we were paying full rate. Parking was reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was very small. Decent price for location. Ammenities were ok. Staff acknowledged us.  [END]
[BEGIN] We overpaid for our 3 night stay in this 3 star hotel. The cashier said it was because the UN was sitting but no one from the UN goes 3 star! $529.00/night was scandelous. Book last minute!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there on the weekly rate,so had to leave 100 deposit.when i checked out they said the deposit was added to the rent.The service at the front desk was bad (no one ever there).And forget about the wifi,it doesnt work.Dont wast your money!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great reception but over priced, over rated and getting a decent sleep on those terrible beds was impossible; ended up sleeping on the sofa's.  [END]
[BEGIN] never mind that the room was small, windowless, noisy and had cheap carpeting -- the bed was the worst i've slept on. stay away if you want to sleep!!! (plus, the nightclub music goes on till 3  [END]
[BEGIN] location was perfect ,rooms overheated and our welcome on arrival was unfriendly  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were adequate. Negatives included, Open lobby issue - cold air coming through front entrance, minimal towels left in rooms, grill smell engulfing atleast our floor (31st) and hot water issues.  [END]
[BEGIN] My boyfriend and I stayed at the Marcel on Sept 4. The room was very small, I'd say 10x9. As we opened the door, the bed was right there. It was clean and quiet. If the rooms were bigger, it would be a nice hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Management are great at giving excuses about why the internet doesn't work but they are clearly not motivated to fix the problem. Wouldn't recommend staying at this hotel if you need a working internet connection. Refrigerator and A/c very noisy and bathrooms need remodelling.  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived at noon and had to check our baggage into the luggage room until check in time of 4 pm. We were shocked that there was a charge of $3.75 per item checked in. This has never happened to us before.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two nights with interrupted sleep thanks to out of control neighbors. Two calls to front desk seemed to have little effect. No recognition of issue at checkout and apology only after I brought up the problem. Nice room but in need of refurbishing. Some great doormen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the front desk were trying their best, they couldn't compensate for the poor condition of the room. The room was large but very poorly kept - dirty. The facility needs updating and upgrading, and we were happy to leave it behind us.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been staying here two times. The first time my carpet was wet nearby the windows, so I could not stand there without getting wet on my feet. The last time I stayed, the room was better. The breakfast is okay, but sometimes they don't have the brown bread.  [END]
[BEGIN] L' hotel e' in una posizione centrale , vicino a fermata di bus, metropolitana e graziosi bar per la prima colazione; la mia camera (tipologia Queen) era un po' piccola ma pulitissima e confortevole  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic price, great location, classy lobby and complimentary breakfast are whats nice about this place. BUT, the hallways smell like urine, the bathrooms are freezing, heaters not working and unprofessional front desk staff are downers. Try the other applecore hotels, they all offer the same price  [END]
[BEGIN] Way too expensive for the mediocre quality. the place has old and quite dirty carpets, rusted electrical plugs in the bathroom, etc... It was a very disappointing experience!  [END]
[BEGIN] Was recommended by friends, room was ordinary, totally run down and shocking. We asked for a better room and was told that was the exec. Location was good, but looking around there is definalety better value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy amable la atencion y la localizacion estupenda pero el estado del mantenimiento es pesimo, no entiendo como Worldmate o Hotels.com lo catalogan 4 estrellas. Este hotel requiere una urgente remodelacion con cambios de tapete, pintura de paredes y reparacion de mobiliario en la habitacion.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is old and in desperate need of updating. Poor ventilation in the rooms. The bathroom was the smallest I have ever been on. I definitely do not recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room the width of a good TV, clean but no: closet, safe, refrigerator and only modestly quiet with view requiring you to keep window shades drawn. Breakfast acceptable, not included in room rates.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel es viejo , sus habitaciones son amplas y las camas comodas La atencion del personal es pesima Ignoran al huesped  [END]
[BEGIN] Obviously caters to one timer tourists who come to the theater district. Lousy value for the price unless you consider that close to $400 a night entitles you to paper plates and cups and absolutely no service.  [END]
[BEGIN] One place to stay which people should avoid in NY is this! The room service is terrible and the facilities are well maintained, but are limited in regard to access by all i.e. not enough for everyone. Food especially for vegetarians, it is a bad place to dine.  [END]
[BEGIN] No breakfast, ok outdoor swimming pool, smelly room, noisy aircon, terrible noise isolation from other rooms and surroundings, ok kitchenette but noisy refrigerator. Stay somewhere else if you can.  [END]
[BEGIN] ottimo per la posizione, ma deludente la stanza! porta che non si chiudeva bene e senza una chiusura dall'interno, cassetta di sicurezza non funzionante, solo 1 shampoo mentre la stanza era per 3 persone, bagno vecchiotto..  [END]
[BEGIN] What a let down to get up in the morning and not be able shower. Room was not great and we paid a lot for it. Location was great and the bar was nice, so it didn't spoil the whole trip, but will look elsewhere next time!  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, bfst was awfull, prices are very high. Good location. I guess this is standard for NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] not the greatest hotel in the world but if your looking for cheap and cheerful with a central location this is the hotel for you  [END]
[BEGIN] Goede ligging maar verder matig hotel. In ieder geval veel te duur voor wat je krijgt; klein kamertje, dunne ramen waardoor het erg lawaaiig bleef etc. Nee, het is een middleclass hotel en mag deze prijzen niet vragen!  [END]
[BEGIN] Paar blokken vanaf Grand central ligt het Hotel. Dat is erg handig omdat je dan makkelijk verschillende metro's kan pakken. Ook liggen enkele belangrijke bezienswaardiggeden op loopafstand. Hotel heeft goede prijs kwaliteit verhouding. Comfort van kamer was goed en personeel vriendelijk.  [END]
[BEGIN] If your looking for a hotel that has got a bar and restuarant, then this ones okay. If these are not points of concern, I'm sure you could find better. These's nothing really wrong with the hotel, but it's a bit tired and dated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything is vey very old. Service is poor. This is the only hotel that had availability post Sandy, when many folks werelooking for any place to stay. Essentially this is the last choice for many. they do not have coffee makers, etc  [END]
[BEGIN] Old outdated hotel, not very clean and poor breakfast table. A lot of other hotels in neighboorhood which are better value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was very small - so small you had difficulty getting in or out of bed. No comfortable chair, small tv, ok bathroom. Location was across from a park but neighborhood was certainly not charming. All in all, very disappointing -especially for the cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] I booked this hotel for 2-3 nights, the room was tiny one queen size bed, the bathroom was awful pretty much like out of a 1 star hotel the only upside is that its so close to times square only a couple steps away  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, nice hotel for the most part. But we found bed bugs in our room. Management did come to our room and confirm that we did have bed bugs. They did comp our rooms, but what a hassle do deal with everything after the fact.  [END]
[BEGIN] The loction nearby the central park is ok. Small room, no comfort, noisy. not worth the $250 we had te pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Vies roestig bad (kmr 808) vies matje in bad geplakt, oud!  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently stayed at the mercer with my girlfriend and the hotel and restaurant was great EXCEPT for the fact that the a/c in the hotel and the restaurant was NOT WORKING!! At $700 a night I think you'd expect a little more from Andre Balazs....  [END]
[BEGIN] when you pay for the service for bell men it would be nice after along day of shopping and walking for a bell men to just open the door instead of talking to the fornte desk girls  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very tired. Although the location is great, the room I had (concierge level) needed new carpet, wallpaper and more. The bed was comfortable. The lobby is the ugliest I have ever seen.  [END]
[BEGIN] These rooms are so small you can barely move!!!! Also, very far from Michigan avenue. We have stayed in Chicago numerous times, by far the worst experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is dated and decrepit. Furniture is ready for Goodwill. Unattractive lobby. Chipped paint and tiny bathroom. Depressing. Good location does not make up for the run-down quality of the hotel. Stay somewhere else and use the good Chicago public transportation to get to the sights.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here October 2006 very disapointed with the hotel as soon as we got of the lift i new what was coming.Needs a big clean up.  [END]
[BEGIN] In a city with hundreds of hotel choices avoid this one at any cost. Dirty, overpriced and old. This hotel is a dog. Yes it's close to Times Square but that is only reason to stay here. Cost is ridiculous at 500.00 a night!!  [END]
[BEGIN] They boast of renovated rooms but I can't tell the bathroom is dingy the sheets are questionable. Great location, great price but you can't be picky about a spic and span room. My other colleagues are happy with their room. I am checking out right away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay at this hotel if you simply can't afford NY hotel prices. Rooms are small and dark.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very, very poor service. If you're looking for good service, suggest you consider other options. The management and staff of the hotel don't get the concept of good service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was noisy; hotel felt dirty; service was less than acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The title really says it all. It's more of an extended stay kind of place in a slighty dodgy neighborhood. If you want a place with a full sized fridge -- then here you go. My other choices were sold out -- next time I won't stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] het hotel ligt op een perfect ligging naast pennstation en tov madison square je bent overal dichtbij de intree is prachtig maar de kamer zijn oud en slecht onderhouden het stonk op onze gang naar de weed dat was erg hinderlijk zou er geen tweede keer meer naar toe gaan  [END]
[BEGIN] really a dump with shared baths, worn out furniture, dirty corridors, and no internet. I've reserved it by mistake for its proximity to Columbia University. Location is OK - in the Upper West Side near Central Park but close to Harlem  [END]
[BEGIN] con la pretesa di essere di tendenza cerca di farsi perdonare camere minuscole , dove non puoi portare bagaglio , bagni senza specchi e con poca luce( un problema farsi la barba!), una hall, pure se di design famoso , di aspetto tombale Prima colazione carissima e inadeguata alle pretese.  [END]
[BEGIN] se dovete soggiornare qui portatevi i tappi per le orecchie lavori in corso credo per ampliamento dell'hotel, nell spiazzo adiacente iniziano alle 7 del mattino. prima o poi termineranno!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have not stayed at the Waldorf for a few years but the Service was outstanding! Unlike most of our customer service industry, the Waldorf has managed to get better. The room was great, and the Sunday brunch, although pricey is over the top!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, my room was a disaster.., blood on the bed, white stuff spilled on the floor, black hair all over the bathroom... Had to call and go down 3x to get the room clean..., I had to put towels down on the floor!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location. Poor common areas. Terrible breakfast room. Hotel in need of makeover. Room just about passable but poor standard for price. Bathroom low standard. Very old and tired hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just an OK hotel - location is in middle of town but....there's nothing to do! They charge for parking at USD19. Tiny bathrooms  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is not up to usual Marriott standard. The service is horrible. I suggest staying anywhere else. The internet didn't work. Paper not received. Desk staff rude and not interested. The area is far off of the tourist and business areas.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wasn't expeting too much, but we received an uninvited visit from Mickey mouse. We changed the room 3 times due to rats in our room. The hotel manager could just say: "I am sorry about that". I wouldn't reccomend this hotel to anybody.  [END]
[BEGIN] There was no hot water and there were no free outlets, and none at all near the desk. In order to plug in a laptop, it was necessary to unplug a lamp and work while sitting on the floor or bed. Will not be staying here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfriendly staff, they just looking tips. Litle but clean rooms. Air conditioner is very noise. No street views, you can look to the another guests. My recommendation: look for another hotel, you can find better service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very old hotel, old rooms, very small bed. If you are going to a theatre then this is the hotel for you. It's right on Times Square. The subway is just around the corner, starbucks is just across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very small rooms, lobby that looks like a bad YMCA, and the TV requires a PhD in physics to understand. The doors do not close automatically strangely, and the hallways are very noisy. The only plus side was a comfy bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] AC window unit let in all the street noise and cold air. Couldn't believe a 4 star hotel would think this is acceptable. Don't stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced, tiny rooms, shabby, dirty, rip off, poorly furnished with no taste  [END]
[BEGIN] with the same price u pay, u can book the other hotel called double-tree suites times square, much better location, much better service! seriously..i dont recommend this hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was recently re-done to look more hip. Rooms are awful. Bathrooms are tiny. Windows in rooms are tiny. Gym is ok. This is a huge hotel and I would imagine very difficult to keep up. Very conveninent to Grand Central, but all-in-all not where I would choose to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stolen my iPad and Mac book air in 5/october/11 and the hotel don't reimbursement yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zero reception in these rooms. Wifi drops in and out. Television never worked. Three business partners of mine had the same experience. Made it very hard to work. Location was great though.  [END]
[BEGIN] very well located hotel but I was very unhappy with my experience. Unfortunately 2 newly purchased Guess handbags were taken from my room and despite been advised that I would receive correspondence re same from hotel security nothing was done or checked out to my knowledge.  [END]
[BEGIN] sconsiglio di sceglier il park central.E'solo un grande casermone poco pulito,poco curato e vecchio. L'unica cosa per cui vale la pena e' la posizione sicuramente strategica,ma conviene trovare di meglio nei dintorni  [END]
[BEGIN] Small over priced, in the getto, same price as ritzs carlton. I think the people that gave this place a good review either work for the company or got this trip for free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, but the hotel itself sucks! The staff were extremely rude and did not provide the level of service expected of a four diamond hotel. Never staying here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not clean, poor maintenance, overpriced, air circulation issues. They say this is newly renovated, but my room must have been missed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ci avevano dato una camera rumorosa e piccola, la pulizia scarsa, e una puzza di muffa permeava la stanza, aprendo la finestra i rumori della Brodway erano intollerabili.  [END]
[BEGIN] more than an hour to check in. when asked if this was the norm, the answer was yes during the summer. No ac in room. I expect small in NYC but not dingy. Uncomfortable bed dirty room. Great location but if you can afford anything else, take it.  [END]
[BEGIN] ottima la ubicazione ; scarso il confort in camera : piccola , senza luce centrale , da un lato del letto manca il comodino ; insufficente la pulizia nella camera : due volte rinvenuti insetti grossi vivi e camminanti  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is awesome but wouldn't come back. It has a terrible appearance but didn't have problems with mold, bed bugs or staff. After a long day walk it was a decent place to crash. Wi-fi and internet connection $$$$$$ expensive. No alcoholic drinks allowed inside the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny room, tiny bathroom... Had heard some noise from my neighbors. No wireless internet (but could have it on a PC near reception). But! Free toothpaste and free sneakers. Can recommend it if you just want to spend a night in a hotel and to see NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] The entrance lobby looked very eloquent but when arriving at the room, the floors, walls, ceilings and bathroom were all quite dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has bedbugs, I was bitten fairly severely. Check out the NYC bed bug register for more details and many more reports. It's a shame as it's a nice place with friendly staff and a nice cafe.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is an older one but the rooms were clean. There were no elevators and the night staff didn't speak english. Parking for the hotel and other businesses are about a block away and if you get a parking pass, you can't leave in and out.  [END]
[BEGIN] We did not stay at the hotel , however had lunch. The view is fantastic, the crowd pleasant to study. The service was TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. Waiters rude and in the end complaning about the lack of sufficient tips....... i will NEVER step ito that place again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for a couple of nights - for a job I had in town, but rooms are really small, didn't seem every clean, elavator didn't work half the time. I would try somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] 1. So much noise from inside the hotel 2. Need for restoration 3.Old towels 4. Not so clean 5. Good location  [END]
[BEGIN] Not happy with my stay- a lot of problems due to renovation, not too friendly a staff. It took me several calls to have my room made by 7 p.m.(!) The room itself was somewhat small and "busy". Despite the great location I will stay away from this hotel. Alex  [END]
[BEGIN] the good- Alex at front desk,James the maintainence man,the free breakfast,free coffee.location,cleanliness,fast yes fast elevator-never had to wait the bad-terrible noisy banging radiators,too much heat,noise if your room faces the street  [END]
[BEGIN] paid $200. per night to stay in a rabbit hutch size room,booked deluxe studio room with trailfinders,checked on internet back home appears we were put in a standard room,plus point it had been recentley decorated,stayed 3 nights,room not cleaned or made up on second day  [END]
[BEGIN] Got there in the evening, got a dirty room. After wait, very nice front desk gives me new room key and says; check this one...not su funny when you find out they're actually not sure! poor water pressure, annoying. Will i go back? No  [END]
[BEGIN] Room were very small, charge/fee were high for the size of the room. You need a key card to access the elevator, it almost never work. It is not a place for family with children. There is nothing for children to do in hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The general heating system went on at nights and made a loud, constant pingning noise. The hotel is aware of the problem but I don't think they are planning changes any time soon. Ear plugs is not enough to get a decent night's sleep.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoy taking a vacation from my apartment and trying different new york hotels. This hotel was just ok. It was nice and the rooms were nice, but I had some problems with staff. There are other hotels I prefer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as great as advertised. Not worth the price. Poor management and service. Their suites are considered rooms that are connected, not like the pictures posted on their website. Would recommend only if you want one room, and hopefully the bathroom is clean upon your arrival.  [END]
[BEGIN] we booked before reading all the terrible reviews & was tempted to cancel... the room was basic but alright.. my mobile charger would not work in any of the sockets.. but the location was FANTASTIC.. and am planning to go this december again but will book an upgrade  [END]
[BEGIN] I have never stayed in such a small dark room, really depressing so had to stay out as much as possible. There was not even room to put clothes away and the loo was so close to the wall it was difficult to sit on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was clean, good location.. They double charged my debit card on a Thursday, called Friday and no one was available until Monday to issue a credit?! Got xfered on the phone 4 times until it reached someone's voicemail. Won't stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] albergo assolutamente al di sotto delle aspettative. Ambiente angusto e assolutamente trasandato. Servizio di pulizia praticamente inesistente. Buona la disponibilita'alla reception. Ottima la posizione centrale a: 2 min a piedi da Time Square, 5 min da Macy's, 2 min da due diverse linee metro  [END]
[BEGIN] placement moyen. mais chambre nulle moche, proprete de la salle de bain suspecte personnel limite enorme hotel type usine. tout est payant wi fi business center parking hors de prix 53 dollars pour un SUV, personnel pas tres sympa. je suis alle a new york ds des hotel vraiement mieux  [END]
[BEGIN] Customer service is so bad. If you need anything for your room don't ecpect to get any help.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed in the hotel. For $162/night before taxes not much to off as far as the room is concerened. Small rooms and showing it's age badly. Won't stay there again no matter how early my flight is.  [END]
[BEGIN] Noisy hallways and unfriendly attitude from hotel staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Benjamin has been our favorite home away from home in NYC for many years. Our family LOVES the pillow menu! Unfortunately due to a steady increase in price and steady decline in the quality of customer service coupled with the deterioration of the premises we will not be returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel looks hip in the photos but it's aging badly. It's 60 degrees in our room and they tell me they can't turn on the heat. They brought a space heater but not exactly the accommodations I bought. View from the 21st floor is great but don't eat there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, pathetic operation. Two out of four elevators out of service for a week! Wait for 15 minutes and a crowded lift or climb 11 stairs. Charges 20* more than advertised for phone calls. Nice pool on photo is more like a bath tub in reality. Highly unpleasant experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am a Hilton Honors guy. This is in a decent location, but besides that, this is the worst Hilton experience I have had in the city. Stay somewhere else. I think the Garden Inn on 35th is a much better option.  [END]
[BEGIN] very small rooms , bar is closed at 21:00, value for money too expensive  [END]
[BEGIN] Very average hotel, room was very warm though pretty quiet. Breakfast was excellent but when checking out the reception staff were busy trying to kill a cockroach. Also waiting a long time to leave and receive our bags which we left with reception on our last day.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was clearly grand in it's day, but sadly that day has come and gone. Just the fact that it was older and not well kept wouldn't have been bothersome but it felt seedy  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in decadenza. Stanze vecchie e non proprio pulitissime. Se non fosse che e' a due passi da Times square e da molte altre cose raggiungibili a piedi non avrebbe nessun senso andarci  [END]
[BEGIN] Goede prijs kwaliteits verhouding gezien de uitstekende ligging op 7th Ave. Liften kunnen wel erg druk zijn en wachttijden geven. geringe ca;pactiet voor ontbijt service maar prima ontbijt aan de overkant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Relation price/quality terrible. Small room with very bad odor. In general the hotel needs a quick renovation  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked 3 rooms here...first they couldn't find us all rooms...then, same night elevator dropped 4 floors..It scared the hell out of me..I will never stay here again...  [END]
[BEGIN] Some restauration must be done!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had high hopes this hotel could cater to a business traveler. So disappointed to find its charming ambiance meant I'd spend first hour of my stay trying to figure out wireless access. Charm can only go so far without the basic amenities. Won't stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very mediocre hotel; scruffy and dirty reception area, small and old rooms with nothing in terms of views. Amongst the cheaper rates you can in Manhattan, though, short of going to a hostel. Good location right next to the Empire State Building.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hallways and corridors need revamping, the rooms a new carpeting, a lamp would not get fixed after three requests in three consecutive days, the desk phone was replaced on request, and to have to pay for wi-fi on top?  [END]
[BEGIN] I knew the room is small, but if I knew the mattress is hard and lumpy I would never have booked this hotel. The worst sleep ever in a $280 hotel room. Staff was fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] I expected much for it being a ramada. There was no continental breakfast which pissed me off being i was there for a week. Its only good for an overnight stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are very very small, not good value for money. Atmosphere very dark & unfriendly. Very disappointed with the whole experience, would not recommend you stay unless you wear "Designer Gear" as you will not fit in. Stayed 5 nights too many.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Holiday Inn is nothing special. At the cost of a luxury room the hotel's ambiance is akin to the below average inerstate highway hotel you can pick up for $59.00 The pizza shop is decent but avoid the hotels lackluster "breakfast" buffet. I would reccomend looking for other occomodations!  [END]
[BEGIN] Construction all day. Peeling tubs. Minuscule rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Essex for two nights with the hotel football package. Our tickets were not with our friends as promised at the time of booking. The room we had was not real clean and the staff seemed not to care as they had our money in advance for months.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you can find another place go for it....Belle Claire was very disappointing. Semi-clean/filthy windows that didn't work....Room 702 Staff is friendly and helpful but I wouldn't stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny place. Just room for a "full" size bed, and about 18" on each side. Even finding a place to store a single suitcase was problematic. Smallest hotel room I have seen. That said, the place was clean, safe, and in a good area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel ok for the low budget. Near Union square: position ok. The room and the bathroom are clean. But we stayed in the hotel for 5 night and they never cleaned the room...  [END]
[BEGIN] A poor approximation of a boutique hotel. Rooms too small. Neighborhood is in the middle of nowhere. In today's market, you can do much better for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dirty rooms, dirty corridors. First night had a dark room with absolutely no light for more than 400 dollars, had to ask for a change... Room service extremely expensive for less than average quality. Will never come back  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was VERY small. All of the furniture was covered in dust. Bathroom was dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Hotel war sehr zentral gelegen, direkt an einer Subwaystation, was sehr praktisch war. Die Zimmer waren sehr sauber und das Personal sehr freundlich. Wir hatten Zimmer im 23. Stock, dass war sehr gut, da man so direkt auf den Central Park blicken konnte.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lack of hospitable receptionist and $1 per 2.4 minute stay beyond due checking out time ( i.e $40 USD per 98 minutes), deteriorate the strategic site of the city. So unless you are insensitive to hospitality and over charging, I don't recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a terrible experience! the only good thing about this hotel is the position! it's really really dirty. and during the night you can't sleep well!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel really has a swanky look with all the modern decor. That said, service was quite poor - I arrived close to midnight and it took ages to check in despite being the only client t the desk.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was looking forward to stay at this hotel but it's so dirty , the stuff are like running and cheap shop not a hotel !  [END]
[BEGIN] No corresponde la categoria que le han dado de 4 estrellas con las instalciones y servicios que tiene  [END]
[BEGIN] I am pretty positive I brought home bed bugs from this hotel. They started infesting my apartment around the same time we got home from our vacation. They have made our lives a nightmare.  [END]
[BEGIN] W prices but poor service,smallest rooms even with an upgrade as a platinum member. Location good but many other hotels in the area are a much better value.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are very small for the money and even though breakfast is included in the stay, the breakfast area gets very crowded during morning. This is in the main lobby so you also keep bumping into travellers checking out. Overall not very impressed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Never got a wake-up call and almost missed my meeting, which was the reason for my visit in NYC. I was told it was a computer glitch. Unacceptable!  [END]
[BEGIN] I booked a non smoking room and when I checked in they told me only smoking rooms were available. Then when I went to close the curtains before I went to sleep I noticed stains all over the place. This was not the quality that I expected at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location and friendly, helpful staff incl concierge, but do not expect to sleep well - one could hear everything from rooms next door and above, plus plumbing or some other mechanical grating sounds.  [END]
[BEGIN] I reserved my room on hotels.com a queen size 1 bd rm, however when i checked-in they automatically assign me in a small room packed with two beds. called the manager, didn't get any help. The staff at check are helpless. will never back to again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was whatever service was bad, 45 min to check in no staff available. Left a couple items in the room, called the hotel and they said there was niching found. Bathroom smelled musty. Don't think I'll stay there again  [END]
[BEGIN] Staying here right now. This hotel is great if you're a little person (under 5 feet) traveling alone with no luggage...but otherwise stay elsewhere. Plus the walls are all scraped up and there's nowhere comfortable to sit. This is faux luxury to the core, don't get duped.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bathroom was falling apart and the price was too expensive for the room we had!! It is definitevely not a good place to stay and we expected much more luxury for the 600.- bucks we paid. Breakfast really poor .Do not go to this hotel!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean place, but it's as if the hotel scrimped on wherever it could scrimp. Front desk also acts like they're being bothered if you ask them anything.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really small room. Uncomfortable bed. Poor AC. Maybe this is a good value for NYC, but anywhere else, this hotel would die a horrible death at this price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very very small rooms. The rooms are closet size and you hardly have enough room to open a large suitcase. The room however was clean.I would not stay at this hotel again - it is just not worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is overrated and deserves only 2 stars. It does not have ice machine, and exagerated # of room occupancy. Rooms are old, wallpaper peeling off, and pipes noisy at night. The manager & front desk clerk are uncompassionate, inhumane, disriminating and liars.  [END]
[BEGIN] The black woman that ran the front desk was HORRIBLY rude. The smell of the sewage is getting worse. I will not stay there again until you get that smell contained and it smells healthy.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little too small for me. Had problems with the toilet which backed up every day;. And the restaurant where we had breakfast needs to be remodeled -- it's looking a little shabby. For this price I'd consider staying elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny rooms, couldn't control the room temperature, staff ssssslllllllooooowwww to respond to request for heat, breakfast was overpriced. Felt like I should have my wallet surgically attached to my hand to get any member of the staff's attention...wouldn't recommend this hotel to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had heard so much about The Pierre. What a disappointment. The hotel is jaded, rooms and public spaces need urgent refurbishment. Unfriendly staff. We had a large suite, but besides its square footage, little else worth talking about it. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very bad service, especially given the Four Seasons name and price. Stuffy lobby and room interiors. Overpriced. There are a lot better hotels in New York. Find them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Front desk staff were indifferent as to our existence. Bathroom grouting in the tub was brown and missing. Valet parking is on 41st not 42nd! Be CAREFUL! I got a $115.00 ticket. convenient location, but not really the four-star experience I paid for.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here one night before leaving. The neighborhood was a bit sketchy and the room was grungy. It was okay, but I would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location like everyone says is great but the hotel is terrible shape-old broken furniture, peeling wallpaper, broken drains, broken lampshades and stained carpet. I have stayed in better motels! was clean and the staff was friendly enough though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kwaliteit van de service laat te wensen over. Kamers er koud en veel herrie van straat. Geen minibar. Te kleine ontbijt ruimte. Voor het bewaren van koffers bij vertrek wordt extra toeslga gevraagd. Tip: ga buiten de deur ontbijten, is helft goedkoper en gezelliger.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel location: fantastic - next to Times Square hotel accomodation: scruffy -absolutely awful!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We stood there for 3 nights when we were stranded for one week in New York because of the vulcano. Design. No window view at all (wall). Oldfashioned bathroom wich doesn't match the bedroom. Very unpleasant staff at the reception.  [END]
[BEGIN] we only stayed there one night and would not stay there again. The room stank of smoke and the hotel staff were not very friendly. they did not help us with our bags and we had to carry them ourselves to the taxi in the pouring rain  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location not so friendly staff. Great deals in the area t shop & little Italy just right around the corner. Rooms need updating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mala atencion, sin ascensores, si te tocan pisos altos estas complicado, me ha pasado. Se oyen todos los ruidos del pasillo y las demas habitaciones. Por lo que pagas, conseguis algo mejor seguramente.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bed linens had stains. The staff was very rude (with the exception of one lady). The towels had tears in them, very old and roughly used a few of them. It was more of a self service hotel. Definatley not a classy joint.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel's location is excellent. The lobby is beautiful and that's the only good thing inside. The elevators, staircases, the hallways are very old. The ice machine was broken. The room are very outdated, small and dirty. Bathtub was clogged and dirty. The old A/C made very loud noise.  [END]
[BEGIN] De locatie van dit hotel was perfect. We weren vrij goed geholpen op het begin. Je hebt wel geen last van de drukte buiten. Op wandelafstand van Times Square. Kamers waren vuil en de tapijt lag er precies al jaaaaaaaaaaaaaren. Ik zou niet meer terug gaan naar dit hotel !  [END]
[BEGIN] Very basic hotel - the rooms dont even have a safe! The hotel needs a serious facelift - especially the lobby! The room keys always kept resetting (not working!). They dont even gve you bottled water every day! Overall - a clean romm but thats about it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Continental breakfast either did not open on time, had no coffee, and always had the lowest quality bagels, muffins, etc. you can imagine. Location is right in the middle of Chicago's homeless/begging district and is rather unpleasant. Room was clean and nice though.  [END]
[BEGIN] + very friendly and helpful staff, great location, big room - old, very noisy, terrible matress, airco made a lot of noise, dusty room for a slightly higher price, you could stay in a Best Western, which is a better value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed 1 night at LQ Park 10. Location near Kaboom V-Ball Facility. Decent size room, beds not very comfortable, ac thermostat did not work properly, decent Continental breakfast w/waffles, and staff was friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] prezzo/prestazioni insoddisfacente molto pretenzioso (hall con pesci tropicali, luci diffuse, grande televisore in camera, etc.)ma carente negli aspetti essenziali(camera minuscola, rubinetteria dei bagni arrugginita,aria condizionata non regolabile).  [END]
[BEGIN] Room, including sheets was dirty. Not worth staying here.  [END]
[BEGIN] freezing shower. No warm water.. no towels.. was horrible........foreigners cnt speak english,, dirty hotel. charge you for everything,. they are very money hungry.. not a warm quiet place.. i went there for a MODELING SHOOT  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location but pretty lousy hotel. We had a great view of scaffolding and could hear people talking from the street. We opted for the bathroom in the room and it was ok; a little moldy but we've seen wayyyyy worse  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed four four days. Had problems with the room being too warm, no AC!!! Very noisy, with construction and garbage collection going on because we had to leave the windows open (3 inches, big whoop!) No atmosphere in lobby area, very cold. Would not stay there again!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Cant believe that you pay all that for you room then they charge you for breakfast! I've stayed in hotels all over the world and it's the first time this has happened. The Rivington charge you for everthing. I found them greedy.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place , with no prior heads-up, tried to add $250 to my already exhorbitant tab , because one of my guests smoked a cigarette in my suite.No Irish hospitality here.  [END]
[BEGIN] In Manhatten I expect a small room, buth this was ridiculous! The comforter was solied, the sheets were scratchy and the A/C was so loud I hardly slept. There are other, better choices when looking for an economical place to stay in Manhatten.  [END]
[BEGIN] hmmm...lots of continual airplane noise from the nearby airport, barely competent front desk staff, and glacially s...l...o...w internet access -- what's not to love?  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad service, Crappy room.. just terrible.. If I had paid 25-30 dollar pr night for this hotel, maybe I will shut upp.. But I did pay 100 dollar per night for 120 bed for two persons..  [END]
[BEGIN] Not quite sure how this made 4 stars, the shower had black mold everywhere and there was a layer of hair on the floor throughout the room and bathroom. Smallest room I've ever stayed in out of many different hotel stays in the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is great, but this hotel is in need of a MAJOR renovation. I barely got sleep because the smell of old/dated wood made me sick. On top of that the heat kept changing on its own thru the night...annoying!  [END]
[BEGIN] the sink overlapped the toilet. The plastic shower floor seemed dirty and no place to hold the soap. I have never seen a smaller bathroom, even in hostel type hotels in Europe and the blankets were skanky and old. the work out facility is 3 machines. Good location, tho  [END]
[BEGIN] This is right next to the 9/11 site and construction starts early so can't sleep beyond 7 am on Satuday.The rooms are tacky, mostly Ikea like furniture. The service is ok at best. They don't have mobile phone chargers, so make sure you have all the battery life you need.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff is friendly and helpful, but walls are very thin and facilities are in disrepair. Wish I could give this a higher review. It seems like good staff got stuck in a lousy building. Noisy, noisy, noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] room was a bit cramped but furnishings nice. however there was a VERY strong perfumed smell on all the bedclothes which gave me a sore throat and nose and made me head for a similarly priced but more comfortable hotel pronto  [END]
[BEGIN] suffering under successive changes in management. still beautiful rooms and a great downtown location. the rooms have great views. the arcitecture is very modern. if you are not a VIP you might want to look for a hotel more suited for the 99% of us.  [END]
[BEGIN] We would never stay here again. This place needs some TLC. how does it get four stars?  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel needs a serious over haul. The staff upon check needs a serious over haul as well, like remembering they are in the hospitality business. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel should be children friendly. the rooms have a problem with air ventilation we stayed in #607 the toilets had a problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] They are rude it's as simple as that. The only positive experience was making the reservation. But from checking in to trying to get the bill it was the ultimate in rude. And who wants to pay to be treated rudely?  [END]
[BEGIN] room very very dirty (bathroom carpet and sheet above all) and quite rumorous but hotel in a very very central position -near trafalgar square...and not so expensive!!! if you have more money to spend change hotel!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Siamo stati 5 notti a Dylan hotel,,,, molto vecchio.. New York e sempre un UNICA!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The only reason this hotel is worth considering is the location. Other than that, be prepared to experience confused/unhelpful staff, long waits for an elevator, and less than perfect standards of cleanliness. In other words, you can do better than this place.  [END]
[BEGIN] des moquettes qui n'ont plus d'age, du simple vitrage, une odeur de cigarette froide, des peintures qui s'ecaillent... il est temps pour les proprietaires d'investir dans leur hotel. Sinon cet hotel est idealement place pour les amateurs de soho/tribeca.  [END]
[BEGIN] Distressed traveler situation. Very noisy room, windows not suited for airport noise. They did placate me with 5000 Marriott Points, and on next stay upgraded me. Staff was very nice. Just an avg. airport hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great but that is about it. The rooms are small and the room service is sub par especially for what you are paying. I will never stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff is arrogant and the room standard is poor. The only good ting about whitehall is the location, but there are many other hotels in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Where to start. Hair in the sink, sticky carpet, thin pillows, broken security lock on door, broken faucet handle in shower, small number of channels on tv. They did have truck parking and the clerk was pleasent. The hotel needs updating though. It's getting worn out.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Hampton, below average Hampton's good quality, ask for a price that is defenetly too much. Rooms are clean, service not that great. Some time noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location, potentially very good hotel let down by some of the rudest staff I have ever encountered. I wouldn't have been surprised to see the staff wearing Do Not Disturb signs.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you dont mind staying in Tiny rooms which are badly lit and cost a fortune, you are in for a treat. great bar and funky public areas (which you can enjoy without being a guest)  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed Friday and Saturday nights, Location is great, staff friendly courteous, had to call to have maid service at Sat. 6:00 pm. cereal available Sat. am but not Sunday am. I've had better for $400 a night but it is New York...  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived and my deluxe room not available. Front desk have an attitude problem. No ones room was ready even when they were arriving late afternoon/early evening. there are some great hotels in NY for this price, id stay in one that makes you geel welcome....  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was big and spacious for NYC. Location was "off the beaten path" 40th and 1st ave. The rooms were very dated, they need an update. The light switches were disgusting dirty filled with crud! Heater was noisy. The one thing positive was the staff was great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clearly, one chap at recpetion at 8pm, what a bummer! The chap excused himself many times for waiting, but still, its a total shamble fr running a place like that. Its just much to expensive, wornout rooms and old furniture. i wil lnot go back  [END]
[BEGIN] Buono solo per posizione (West Side), e per brevi pernottamenti. buon prezzo, ma camere fatiscenti e personale un po' scorbutico.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location and good hardware, but rude staff, poor food & beverage facilities and very expensive WI-FI. Improvable.  [END]
[BEGIN] We like the location, but this hotel needs upgrades. From the toilet that wouldnt flush to the $100 cocktails in the bar, this place is a rip off. We were not impressed and will not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The floors have not seen a vacuum cleaner for years, the garbage bin is overfull and the coffee machine still had the filter of the previous guest in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really not a high end hotel ; rooms are small and old fashionned, very poor service, desorganized. Unable to transfer a call coming from outside. Small and disapointing swiming pool... for a very high end price  [END]
[BEGIN] Incredible small double room with no space besides the bed.  [END]
[BEGIN] A room is a room, no veiw, smelt of smoke in a non smoking room, needs up-dating and a good clean  [END]
[BEGIN] The pictures posted here are of the better rooms. Good if you're 19 years old and on an adventure around the world, with only a few bucks in your pocket and lots of friend. Otherwise, stay away. One of the more depressing low-budget experiences.  [END]
[BEGIN] Weak hotel...it is NOT NEWLY RENOVATED (at least it doesn't look that way). Old and tired hotel. No A/C on warm days in the fall (hotel switchs to heat throughout...you sweat). Dingy and dirty. Cheap furnishings. Very disappointing. On my "bad hotel" list of places to avoid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy descontento con el servicio del hotel la primera habitacion sin ventanas con un olor tremendo ,pedimos cambio y nos dieron una algo mejor con el aire acondicionado de l siglo pasado,no refrigeradora no cafetera. NO volveria jamas  [END]
[BEGIN] - location is ok - rooms and bathrooms are very small - air con is integrated in the window, which does not close correctly -> nearly unpossible to sleap there - very unflexible service at the front desk - no restaurant, bar etc. XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX  [END]
[BEGIN] No hot water in our room at all. They changed us to another room and guess what? No hot water. The housekeepers steal too. My wife lost a couple of clothes. The location is good, but with that price you can get better deals.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only stayed one night, but got bit several times on the shoulder by bed bugs. I should have read the previous warnings by reviewers. You pay for what you get.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing wrong per say but the room was tiny and plain. The "W" or Marriot Grand Marquis would be much better choices for the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] There was a cockroach in the bathroom, the room was very small, staff not very kind, air conditioned very old and noisy. Noisy room. It smelt bad. Too expensive. At 4 pm my room wasn't cleaned.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looked nice, but wouldn't even hold our luggage for 2 hours while we walked around the city since we had to check out by noon and didn't fly home until later. They have limited space and made many guests angry. Other than that it was adequate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobby smelt like an indoor pool Chewing gum on wash basin in room Postage stamp sized towels Only 1 bathrobe No room service between 1 & 5pm Not cheap, but with so many great hotels in NYC why go here  [END]
[BEGIN] ... And it cost $350 a night! Am I mad to have expected more? Oh and it stank of stale smoke. Oh, and in this 24 hour city, room service stops at midnight. Useless if your plane into town was delayer.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is nothing like it suggests! Far away from Michigan Avenue, Navy Pier and everything else in the city! Pay a little extra for The Hyatt or Marriot downtown...the cab rides will make up the difference!  [END]
[BEGIN] if you are used to 5 stars European Radissons, don't go to the Lexington one: small rooms, even by NY standards, mediocre service, lousy b'fast. Overall pricey and aged. But the location is good. really, it is a 3 stars -even if they do not say so.  [END]
[BEGIN] The people who work at the Four Points are really nice, but the property is really gross. I am not a picky person and this place was just really way overpriced for the room not being very clean and the small size of the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is not very well run. The room was not cleaned, junk on the floor, no bath mat on the floor, and they left dirty towels in the room for us to use again. I would never stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our first surprise when we arrived at noon was that we would be charged $2 per bag till the room was ready at mid-afternoon. Considering we were guests, this seemed a bit much. No complementary coffee in room. No battery in TV remote control. Weird layout to hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wallpaper, bathroom- just about everything could use an update. The vacuum cleaner does not get in the corners or edges and it showed in our room. There was an unpleasant smell in our room every time we walked in. I ended up buying a plug-in deodorizer to help with that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could have been lovely, close to perfect....The room was cheap and look clean... But there was Bed bugs....If your are allergic to any bugs bite don't go there. I'm still recovering and I hope I didn't bring them back home.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small old dirty rooms with small old dirty beds. Bathroom ridiculously small, shower head didn't work and shower curtain let water all over the floor. Rated 3 stars, but not even close. Housekeeping didn't even empty trash cans.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3 elevators for 32 floors. Waited 20 minutes then walked down 8 floors. Breakfast and happy hour included but mobbed and no place to sit. Worst, no taxis available in morning or dinner time, reported cheerfully by doorman.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms in this hotel are very small - there's almost no place to walk around the bed. Location on 3rd avenue is also problematic as the windows are not noise proof  [END]
[BEGIN] For a many starred hotel, save your money. Pretenious staff..., cleaning details omitted in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, but rooms are cramped, have no sound-proofing (ahem) and not so clean. Staff is friendly, but they never got the bathroom cleaned even after asking 3 times over a 2 day stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess all New York Hotels are expensive but this one was extremely expensive in comparisson to what you get. Old beds with old bed spreads, not a good service. Old carpets, old bathroom, everything very very old.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not stay at this hotel if you do not want a luxury closet. The hotel standard of rooms is very poor. They charged us for the mini bar and we did not even touch it. Hotel advised 'that it might be the cleaners'.  [END]
[BEGIN] staff verry nice changed rooms 3times stayed inroom 841 bathroom door did not close properley toilet dlocked on several occasions would not recomend stay somewhere else pity because staff very nice  [END]
[BEGIN] There's nothing wrong with this hotel; except you can do better for 1/2 the price; rooms will really disappoint you  [END]
[BEGIN] This Hotel has a great location for visiting New York and has a wonerful history - this is where Glenn Miller wrote "Pennsylvania 6500" during a stay there sadly it has not been decorated since then!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been there for St.Patrick's day. Its best quality is the location as it is in Times Square with metro and supermarkets in the surroundings. The toilet was not that good, little and unclean. The room was noisy, I could perfectly hear the neighbors talking.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel its being renewed, the service is rude and the breakfast it terrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am afraid that I can't compliment the hotel and agree with the other comments further down. A truly mediocre hotel with slapdash service.  [END]
[BEGIN] slowest wifi on the planet. literally. terrible room service food. HORRIBLE RESTAURANT EXP.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to 400$ for a small room, no view, no hot water in the morning, shirts brought on hanger when asked for boxed... Nice personel, good lobby but still It was really not good. To avoid! Period! I don't understand how you can charge so much for so little  [END]
[BEGIN] I will never stay at this hotel every again, the Customer Service was awful, the room was very tiny. I asked for a double bed and got just that a double TWIN bed horrible.  [END]
[BEGIN] The look of this hotel is horrible it looks like an old fashioned night club... the staff is OK !!! their concierge is pretty nice... BTW their complimentary breakfast is crappy....  [END]
[BEGIN] central heating system of this hotel was so noisy. and worse thing is its not working. the room remained freezy. the location of this hotel was good. little bit stinky area. need a 3or 4blocks from subway st. but only a block from 5Av.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was very nice. My room was quite small and untidy. Also the shared bathrooms werent so great. Overall it was a place to sleep at, rather quiet and cheap! (Can only recommend to people without children.)  [END]
[BEGIN] estuve solo una noche en este hotel, pues una de las sabanas de la cama tenia agujeros de quemadura con cigarro (ya no habia habitaciones de no fumar). las cortinas que dan al pasillo estaban demasiado sucias. el servicio de internet (wifi), no llegaba a la habitacion  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was nice, charming decor. Photography for the 'room' and representation of available space was quite generous with the truth. Downtown Houston is expensive and supposedly exclusive, as well as NOISY. Facade and other appearance upgrades for the hotel should have included noise abatement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was not ready when they said, gave away our suite  [END]
[BEGIN] Bedbugs!!!! No acknowledgement, no bill adjustment, just fill out a form for Security. I showed the manager a bite, and I am still itching like crazy! Only where my body was in contact with the bed did I have bites.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got charged for a room which I had cancelled. I tried to talk someone with no response. Left a MSG with the manager -- no call back. Hotel may be nice but customer service doesn't exist. Wouldn't stay here after this episode.  [END]
[BEGIN] despite great rates and clean rooms the sour attitude of the front desk staff affects my wanting to return. We would be willing to pay more to have front desk staff say hello or goodbye and thank you for staying here. The housekeeping staff were fabulous.  [END]
[BEGIN] location is vey close to time square, great shopping and subway. the hotel itself is not impressive at all, below average. rooms are small and a little scary, i was just waiting for a ghost to wake me on my sleep or something.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel's lobby has been rredone since my last visit years ago, but the rooms are not as clean and certainly not as well equipped. The air consdtrioneer, which is a necessity during aNew York heat wave was very noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to find. 2nd floor hallway smelled like urine. Room was small, smelled like smoke, but very clean. Nice bathroom but poor lighting for make-up. Had to call for iron & board. But, great location for Times Square, Central Park, Rockefeller Center! Staff was pleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] room was extremely small and very noisy, however this could be overlooked if the staff were friendly and helpful. Most unpleasant experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location but the service sucks. The receptionist was rude and wasn't helpful at all. I am paying for a service and I hope to receive that. Besides the rooms are old, but it's fine cause it's and old building, but the service is two fingers down.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed in this hotel one night before flying out early from Midway. Thank goodness we didn't have to stay any longer. The hotel was filthy. I would never stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] spent New Year in this Hotel. Over-rated, beds uncomfortable, staff unfriendly and unhelpful. Not worth the money!!  [END]
[BEGIN] What a sad place. Everything is grubby and tatty. The room lighting is abysmal, but then I suppose it makes it harder to see the dirt. The staff are friendly enough, but the place is just so depressing. Yuck.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everyone was very nice, but the room was the smallest I've ever stayed in and the air conditioner probably the noisiest I've ever heard. Everything is tiny - you need to go single file to get into the tiny "lobby." Not for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] The images on the website and its location brought us to book this hotel. Very disappointed. Overpriced.The rooms are very basic, need refurbishment urgently. Tacky. The restaurants too resemble a Diner on the highway. Yes - great location, but little else. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very convenient to medical centers and they have shuttles. First room was about 78 degrees with AC set to 65. Complained and then after 3 hours moved me to another room. Weak wifi signal. There for one night only thankfully. Could not wait to check out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotellobby is Great, so are the elevators........................... For the rest bring your creditcard as every move you make has to be paid extra.  [END]
[BEGIN] Habitaciones viejas. En la bodega de las maletas hay ratones  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel tries to look fancy but lacks basic things that cheaper hotels usually have. In paticular no coffee maker and the hotel doesn't have a swimming pool as they claimed to. To use a swimming pool, you must go to a neighboring health club and pay for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel lobby nice along with staff but room size very small. Bed size smaller than British standard double bed. Hotel great location. Restaurant food good with good atmosphere. Very disappointed in room size, lots of extras Plasma TV and excellnt sound system and lighting.  [END]
[BEGIN] The morning after my arrival i discovered a blood stain on the blanket. Manager promised to change the blanket, but they just turned it over! It took 5 phone calls to get a clean blanket.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely small rooms with poor heating and a/c. Dirty and very dated lobby. No doorman. The location is good but that unfortunately is all you can say about the hotel. The price was inexpensive but in this case you get what you pay for is an overstatement.  [END]
[BEGIN] quite disappointed after stayed in ritz carlton cancun we arrived in this expensive business hotel it was just ripoff and the worst they tried to overcharge me the gym and mini bar didn't believe me and off curse no thanks you at last......  [END]
[BEGIN] pros - well decorated hotel cons- all rooms are facing the street, and the noise is unbearable. staff is not familiar with the surrounding as they could not refer me to a descent place to go at the evening  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel s old, rooms are in poor shape. Yet I have to say the staff provides a great service! ( I will never stay there again)........  [END]
[BEGIN] HOTEL TRES VIEILLOT CHAMBRE TRES OBSCURE BEAUCOUP DE BRUIT DE TUYAUTEIE QUI NOUS ONT EMPECHES DE DORMIR NORMALEMENT AINSI QUE LES ENFANTS;SEUL AVANTAGE SA SITUATION GEOGRAPHIQUE SOMMES TRES DECU DE CET HOTEL/A LA PRESENTATION SUR LE SITE EXPEDIA  [END]
[BEGIN] Found the eddison great for show glitz and glamour then went into the room which i found poor should concentrate on the important things like the room clealiness, comfort and appearance  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms.. Ok for a day or two's stay. No space for large luggages if you take the standard room. Does not have an elevator.. So if you are staying on the 3rd or the 4th floor - u need to use stairs all through..  [END]
[BEGIN] Going to New York should be a fun experience, so don't ruin it by booking this hotel. It is truly gross.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a very convenient location, but it does not live up to its grandeous reputation. We were very underwhelmed by the room and breakfast was mediocre.  [END]
[BEGIN] how do they get these reviews? the rooms are just fine, but there are zero amenities. no real lobby, either. beds are comfy but hardly worth the extra $$. i would stay here at a deep discount, but that's it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Aunque esta cerca de las atracciones turisticas el hotel es horrible. La habitacion olia fatal, muebles viejos y rotos...Evitar este hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is very good, very small bedroom, shower broken, the staff of the reception is poorly educated, they neither help nor with information about the city, they are superb and arrogant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice staff and grounds, lobby, and restaurant are in excellent condition. Rooms are ok, but seem old and lack quality for the rate we paid  [END]
[BEGIN] Be careful.. you may stay in a smoking room even if you have booked 2 rooms in the hotel for more than a month ago. Terrible experience and the inconvenience of having to change rooms. Will never come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location.the hotel is old so don't expect anything spectacular.The rooms are big. internet does cost but is wireless.its a good hotel considering its in NY. the bed was horrible.really old.would be good if they changed them  [END]
[BEGIN] Won't book here again. Disappointed some business folks who were staying for the first time. A hotel that doesn't offer coffee in the room is no longer understanding their customer. Hope this is reconsidered because this is a number 1 priority for our folks.  [END]
[BEGIN] We watch guest check in one after the other for 2 hours.... All the check in desk would tell us is it's because you have a suite. So Pay More Money to be treated like garbage!!!! NEVER again! Not worth the $$. Better treatment a Holiday In Express!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: Great location Beautiful architecture Cons: Grumpy staff Slow service Tiny rooms No place to store clothes, except closet  [END]
[BEGIN] Generally mediocre hotel but the Internet service has to be the worst i have experienced in years - and for $15/day i expected better. Surprising given that this hotel caters to business conventions (it appears).  [END]
[BEGIN] Room heater would not shut off with thermastat. I had to turn off heater and open window to cool off room. Outside noise too loud to sleep. Mattress was unconfortable Room was clean but was not updated.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was small. The Bathroom was tiny. Who gave this hotel a 4 star rating? Very overated  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great but that's it. The rooms are filthy and very noisy The food quality is poor. The staff is very rude and unprofessional. W hotels are usually good value and quality but not this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Check in was a minimum 30 minutes queue at all times of day and night. The room was tiny and old. The included breakfast was disgusting. The bathroom and shower was impossibly small. I defy anyone to get constant hot water out of the shower system.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was nice until I found a cockroach on the floor and the middle of the night. Also, we left a juice on the desk and when we went back there were a lots of ants !  [END]
[BEGIN] Dark,dank, not kept up, tiny rooms, needs overhaul, 2 star at best, never return  [END]
[BEGIN] Noisy. No individual control of room temperature. No bathmats. $55.00 per day to park the car. Extremely slow elevator service. The staff was nice and the hotel was convenient but not worth the money.  [END]
[BEGIN] L'hotel correspond a un 2-3 etoiles francais. Chambres tres petite (10m2), television cathodique des annees 90, propriete moyenne (couche de poussiere sur les meubles et dans les coins..). Nous avions une reservation pour 5 nuits, nous avons change d'hotel le lendemain...  [END]
[BEGIN] We needed transportation back to the hotel after the ballet and the best the hotel could do is a car for a minimum 2.5 hours at $95/hour. After paying $1200 for a suite, I thought they could have done better.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel spartano, camere piccole per lo standard americano, prima colazione povera e carissima. Unico vantaggio: la ubicazione  [END]
[BEGIN] La posizione e' davvero strategica, di fronte ml MSG, a due passi da time square e con molte linee metro vicine. La struttura e' vecchia e poco confortevole, pero' i servizi peincipali non mancano ed e' molto economico.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed at the Waldord a number of times, but now old has gone from acceptably elegant to simply shabby. Aircon on high floors can't keep up with the heat, i couldn't get it cooler than 24c/75f in the room, indifferent restaurant service, though roomservice remaina excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] In der Lobby war alles noch gut... die Zimmer, etc. waren jedoch nicht wirklich angenehm....  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobby gives a false security--once we got to our room we saw the real hotel. Mold in the bathroom, drips, missing tiles, peeling wallpaper, etc. The ice machine in the hall didn't work and there was crumbling cement around the bottom.  [END]
[BEGIN] I travel frequently and was very disappointed in this hotel. The hotel is badly need of remodeling. I had requested a non-smoking room and when I checked in all they had were smoking rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay at other Embassy Suits was juast as nice however the breakfeast buffet was not available to guest. The spread of food just was not up to par. The beds and rooms were very comfortable,  [END]
[BEGIN] The sheets (hair on them) and floors were dirty. There were no hand towels or wash cloths.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was okay, location was great, next to Coach Mike Ditka's restaurant. Only thing, no fitted sheets! Called front desk, they said they didn't supply them...  [END]
[BEGIN] I was expecting them to charge by the hour by the looks of the place. This is just an amazing location with a real east village feel but it's tiny rooms, seedy guests, hallway bathroom, and no reservations necessary. I'm thinking it's used for unsavory purposes more than for tourism.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pets encouraged. Sleep impossible. Dander, flea fears kept this from being a viable option for the future despite its proximity to son's new home. If you are allergic to animals, it's not the place for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent size room is about all you can say. Zero amenities, zero character, and outrageous up- charges for basic things. And beware the sales pitch for the timeshare units in the adjoining building. Good location though -- close to theaters, 5th ave, the park etc. Would not stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Di "sheraton" ha solo il prezzo (alle stelle)! Per il resto una delusione. Camere sporche con polvere dappertutto, lenzuola sporche... E mi fermo qui! Buona solo la posizione a due passi da time square. Ma essendo a new York basta poco per trovare qualcosa di meglio.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel estaba demasiado lleno y poca gente atendia. En el cuarto no habia calefaccion todo el tiempo, llegabamos de noche muertos de frio y el cuarto estaba frio! En dos ocasiones no nos dejaron toallas. Tiene muy buena ubicacion pero no esperes mucho del hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] HOTEL TRES BIEN SITUE SUR TIME SQUARE. HOTEL UN PEU VIELLOT MAIS BONNE LITERIE ET LIT PROPRE. JE RECOMMANDE POUR LE PRIX ET L'EMPLACEMENT. ON Y DORT MAIS ON Y PASSE PAS LA JOURNEE DONC TRES BON RAPPORT QUALITE/PRIX  [END]
[BEGIN] The people at the desk were very nice, helpful, and professional, but the room had a noisy AC, sheets looked like they hadn't been washed from last guest, but fortunately we only had to stay there ond night. Thanks heavens no bedbugs!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, close to everything. Beautiful hotel. But they have bedbugs, just saying.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotels sucks. The room was dated, breakfast service non-existent (bar attitude) and atmosphere stale. I will be avoiding this hotel. In dire need of a refurbishment. Only saving grace were gummy bears in the mini-bar..... some compensation for an expensive mistake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, nice entrance and old rooms. Shabby, wallpapers are opening, TV old and small. needs urgent re-modelling to match the price. I honestly can't find a justification for the price (300 US$). Many better option around the same area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wake up people - this is not for travelers. This is for after lunch "nap"... Hence, mirrors and jacuzzi in a room. One positive thing I can say is that location is great, and, if person is traveling alone and doesn't care much - it would do it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cleaning detail falls short and they really need to hire people who are service oriented and friendly at the front desk.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is not what it appears. The rooms are tiny and the bathrooms are even smaller with bad plumbing. The hallways smell of old people and cigarrettes. The only good thing was the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best thing about this hotel is its location: right in the Times Square! The hotel is little old, but the rooms are ok... It is the best price on Times Square, worthwhile.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently stayed here with my boyfriend and although the hotel was nice, I didn't feel it was worthy of a number 1 ranking on trip advisor. There are many hotels in NYC that are better than this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tres cher pour un niveau de prestations faible: chambres minuscules, deco triste (violet et marron), beaucoup de bruit (attention aux chambres donnant sur la soufflerie dans a cour), moyennement bien situe.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got caught by their website, but reality is very much different! Room on the first floor, window facing a wall with stair case, very dark, very noisy AC, decoration very old! TOOOO expensive! Hilton Times square nearby 100 times better..  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location. Small but nice rooms.Very noisy rooms due to paper thin walls. Very unhelpful hotel staff. We bought broadway tickets from the front desk agent and he blatently lied about ticket availability and charged us double face value  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the reasons I wanted to stay in this hotel was because it advertised a fridge in the room. Our refrigerator was broken. I asked FOUR times for it to be fixed and it never was. Wouldn't go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing to hate but nothing to like. Only two elevators and one out of service. The room was very small. Hotel clean but checked out after one night. Valet parking a rip off and no in and out priviledges.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big, old, in need of massive overhaul: Room smelt of cigarettes. Blinds/curtains wouldn't shut. Central heating making loud noises in the night - enough to wake you up. Walls thin so can hear the large student groups staying in the hotel all night. Clean enough and good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to choice but to stay here as everything was booked. Its noisy, outdated, the staff are not friendly. Its the worst business hotel ever more like 2 star hotel. would never return. U hardly get any decent toiletries, rooms are not nice, it needs a huge uphaul  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is old, and dirty. Location is ok and some staff were nice but that doesnt make up for the rats in the air ducts!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location but really in need of a good scrub down. It is depressing. Even if the money can't be spent, at least sheets, towels, etc. could be decent. And the minibar is rat. Some of the staff is very helpful and nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] As you'd expect, the Chicago Airport Hilton is completely lacking in charm or character. A convenient place to stay for an overnight connection, but not much else to recommend for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location and that s all. Smelly , Dirty, breakfast terrible, lot of noise and no cold in the rooms because of air con inefficient. Price not so low for such a bad value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed last time for $109. Not a bad deal. This time I was charged $249.00 Per night for less of a room. Probably the worst deal in town for $249. My advice is get a good deal or stay elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there for business. Lobby is on the 7th floor and the rooms are TINY and not very clean. For $369 plus tax they had the courtesy to charge $8 for a bottle of water. A rip off even for Manhattan standards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Avoid this hotel if you're a light sleeper (unless you get it for 100/night like we did on Priceline). Construction at the Ground Zero site is constant and noisy, although my husband kept saying "what noise, I don't hear anything."  [END]
[BEGIN] We had enjoyed our stay until items left in the room ended up "missing" - or as the hotel staff repeatedly referred to them as "misplaced" - I tried to get the hotel to locate the items taken out of my room without success.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got bedbugs from this hotel, beware.  [END]
[BEGIN] The front desk guy was quite nice and the look of the hotel is very groovy, but tiny room and no tub;-(  [END]
[BEGIN] This once famous hotel needs a major updating and improved customer service. The best thing it has going for it is it's location. Everything is outdated and overpriced. It's glory days are over.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got room on priceline-$80 ended up $100+.Room was very small, clean but the queen bed was smaller than a full-size bed-good location but we would pay a few more bucks for something nicer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably not a bad hotel, but avoid "C" floor at all costs. There is a very noisy ice machine in the hall. Also, this floor is below the ground floor.The bed was fine but the room was small. Mold in the shower.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was excellent, right in the center of Manhattan. Metro is 1 min away, Times Square 10 min walk. The room size and comfort is far below price. Furniture is very old and the bed is very small (standard 2 persons bed is 140 cm wide!).  [END]
[BEGIN] If you value sleep, I would suggest staying somewhere else. They need to do something about the insulation and noise... Location is good but so are many other hotels in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location. Small, old, noisy room whose heating couldn't be turned off - 80 degrees in room. Air conditioner wasn't working and no one available to fix it. Front desk staff was very dismissive and uncaring. Hallways very dark, drab and dreary.  [END]
[BEGIN] The motel got a new name now it's called the memorial. The carpets are so nasty you get black socks. No fridge. No oven. Bath tub is rusty in the sides and quarter size. Paint is peeling off. We are not staying here one night more.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is massive but dosnt care about it's customers. The staff are rude, lines are huge, rooms average. The whole place is dated. Everyone seems stressed, we stayed because it was well priced for the location but wouldn't recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap furnishings; dirty everything; noisy; hot. That was the bad The good was the front desk staff - friendly and helpful. But I will not be staying at this hotel again.  [END]
[BEGIN] the air conditioner groaned continually at a level that prevented sleep. We asked for a new room, but the alternative room offered smelled bad. It is obvious that remodeling is occurring, but it should include fundamental changes like replacing failed utilities.  [END]
[BEGIN] I made a booking and when I get there nobody had any idea about my reservation. And I tried to talk with the manager Mr. Kavral but he didn't want to talk, what a bad professional this hotel is hiring!! , I don't recommend this hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] My room was small and dark, charmed up no doubt, but a Hampton Inn provides more sizable rooms and comfort. Things in my room were broken, and after 3 promises over a 3 day period, I gave up. At these prices they need to get with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Maybe this was amazing in 1919 but sheesh...RENOVATE!!! After all...you ARE the WALDORF ASTORIA! I don't think it's changed since staring in Coming to America!  [END]
