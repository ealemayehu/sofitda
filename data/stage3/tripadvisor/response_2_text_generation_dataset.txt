[BEGIN]  [END]
[BEGIN] I just spent 4 nights here and this hotel is fine but a bit dated overall. Furthermore, the pillows were way too big and the location is Ok but not great. Overall, more of a Courtyard standard than Swissotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel was pretty good the location & amenities were very easy to get to and near by. Service was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small but comfortable rooms. Good location in a typical, lively New York setting. Starting to show its age.  [END]
[BEGIN] We recently stayed at this hotel and found it perfectly adequate. The room was tired and the decor faded, but it was clean and the maid service was first class. For the location and price, this is a bargain. We would certainly stay there again  [END]
[BEGIN] Price and location were great. I've stayed in alot worse for alot more. Over all great for someone on a budget.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was nice but small; your knees were under the bathroom sink when you sat on the toilet! Our traveling companions got a room on the other side of the hotel and said it was awful. Ours was small, but modern and clean. Also a good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel in una zona ideale.sulla Madison, a due passi dalla 5th, dall'empire,da time square.. La nostra camera era abbastanza piccolina ma accogliente. L'unica cosa non molto comoda era l'impianto di riscaldamento che impiegava abbastanza tempo per partire(era molto freddo fuori ,quindi il riscaldamento era fondamentale)per il resto ci tornerei.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor value, good location, strange atmosphere make for a slightly below average experience. Furniture is worn & lighting odd in room. Lobby is confusing & Tom & Jerry cartoons on TV in elevators=STRANGE!! Wouldn't recommend for the $400+ price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me and my wife were last week in this hotel for 4 nights. It's clean hotel with simple and small rooms. Room was equiped by aircondition, satTV, bathroom, fan. They cleaned room and changing towels every day. Personal on reception was unfriendly and boring. Hotel is equiped with free wifi.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed in Holiday Inn Nassau street in NY for a week - it was comfotable but cramped and then there is no free breakfast - service was good and staff very friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] Angie in reservations was so so so helpful. There was a mix-up with my online reservation for the U of Chicago grad weekend. Angie was sympathetic and really helpful over a series of weeks and made it happen that I got my 2 night reservation for this coming June.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, good service, small but comfortable rooms. Could do with a Tea/Coffee maker and safe in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was small, but OK by NYC standards. Service was friendly, and efficient. Location is OK for subway access. Fitness room was useable. Bottom line, at the price I paid, I was very satisfied. I would gladly stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is pretty far. All things considered. It is primarily located in the business district. It was very quiet and seemed to be where those truly conducting business in Houston stayed. So basically after 5pm the entire area surrounding the hotel becomes a ghost town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close enough to the Javits Center to walk. Room was small, but since I was there only at night to shower and sleep, this size of the room did not matter. It was quiet and clean. The staff were friendly and accommodating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room a little dated - could do with all-round renovation. Sleep not helped by aircon that was either hurricane or tornado strength and loudness. Staff friendly and efiicient and a pleasant bar. Feel a bit mean - but really no better than average for this type of hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] It whas a good hotel to sleep, and the rest of the time you are in the city  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great during the week. I had a room over ground zero with view of the Freedom Tower. The service was bad. The front desk staff was mediocre. The genleman working the bar was rude. And, the serviceman help hale taxis was TERRIBLE. Breakfast buffet was $40!  [END]
[BEGIN] Front desk reception service was a bit slow Room clean but w/ out fridge Fair breakfast Pool is in fact much smaller than it appears on the web Concierge guys very friendly and helpful FOC shuttle service within 1 mi radius to restaurants, shopping etc Final rating fair  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was nice and accomodating.. they have complimentary breakfast..  [END]
[BEGIN] Flashback to the 90's, smelling my parents smoked in living room.. Just make sure that you get a non smoking room otherwise nice service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. I loved visting the city and being in the meat packing district However, our stay was ruined by a very rude staff memeber named Ms. Sabino because of her I would not come back to this hotel.- Good hotel but rude staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel used to be really great. It is showing its age and except for some exceptions, the service is somewhat to be desired. This is the second Westin i have stayed in this year that did not meet my expectations Not sure I will select Westin in the future  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was crowded for two of the three days I was there, so I ended up going out for breakfast. Otherwise it was a pleasant stay. The rooms were reasonable and definitely quiet, the staff were friendly and it is in a good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Basic but great value hotel. we weren't going to New York to sit in a hotel room so it was great for us. only 1 block away from the subway and free wifi in the common area downstairs. Staff on reception were really helpful and had alot of local knowledge.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a hip hotel but has really small rooms. It is walking distance from central park and restaurants and a short cab ride to go shopping. Christine Baranda  [END]
[BEGIN] Small lobby. Ok service. Good location. Fair price. Good to stay for short time. Rooms are small but not bad when u are out all day and just need the room to go back and sleep at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the most part this was a decent hotel. I just stayed one night for a quick business hotel, and it satisfied my needs. However, the rooms seem to be poorly insulated, and it was very noisy. Also, the staff seemed somewhat arrogant, and weren't the most friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice hotel choice on the west side of town. The furniture is a little dated but overall the rooms had a nice lay out.  [END]
[BEGIN] New York met kerst, need I say more, hotel was oke, locatie super.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed in a standard room. too noisy for me. in the heart of times square  [END]
[BEGIN] For medical-related stays the location is unbeatable. But the hotel is "long in the tooth," the restaurant very average, the parking costs approaches gouging, and the rooms are very small. A good fitness center.  [END]
[BEGIN] ...perhaps this is what you get in the way of luxury for NYC, but I suggest spending your money elsewhere...  [END]
[BEGIN] This ancient art deco property retains some of the glamour of an earlier, grand era, but the rooms are shabby, worn, and rundown. Small bathrooms, ancient fixtures, inability to do much about temperature control. But the prices reflect this situation, so you get what you pay for,  [END]
[BEGIN] Although location of the hotel is good, the interior needs better touch ups. I expected better standard of rooms for such price. The telephone in the room was not working. The gypsum in the room was not good. However, I do need to mention their reception was very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] friendly hotel in Chinatown. Not far from metro or bus. Who wants a good sleeping place in a clean hotel for a good price in New York. Almost under the manhattan bridge so a little noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Park Savoy was clean, beds were comfortable, included freshly baked muffins & coffee in the morning, staff was very helpful, it was close to many places we like to go in midtown. It also had a very good map of NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] i showed up at this place to have a one night stand. i know, totally. but the room they gave for the price was horrifying. i complained and got a better room, but there were still roaches in the bathroom and the overall vibe is pretty disconcerting.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here on my second trip to NYC. The hotel is very nice, staff wonderful. The room was a little small as it was my mother and I staying in the room together. We had one queen bed, and the room was pretty small.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here because of the location, and will go back because Mohammed was so kind and helpful to me. Since this was my first business trip to NYC I had a lot to learn about navigating Manhattan. The room was nothing special, other staff were routine. Mild recommendation overall.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was always on my bucket list and felt I had to stay, but I was let down by the service, the size of the room and the darkness of the room, and the general appearance of the interiors. I'm glad I stayed, but wouldn't do it again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was nice, clean and quiet. But, for a room that you mostly just sleep in, the price was out of line. No special experience here. Meal at Quattro restaurant in the morning was also way over priced. Two eggs bacon and fried potatoes for $22. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This large hotel, or were the room only large?, was truly a magnificent Hotel in the good old days, but these days, I would have expected a more modern equipped room and amenities.  [END]
[BEGIN] i agree with what others have said. large clean rooms with small kitchen useful for us to have cereal and toast in the morning.about a five minute walk to grand central subway.quiet location.plenty of bars and cafes nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] one half block from tkts booth on times square, old rooms and hardware but sufficiently sized, everything works, housekeeping and front desk excellent, reasonably priced and good food at cafe on street level, clean and attractive  [END]
[BEGIN] Basic good quality middle-of-the-road hotel. Nothing offensive. Lobby is a bit of a convention center. Rooms not bad quality. Had a rate of $180- for that kind of rate, I'd definitely stay here again. Above $250 per night, don't bother.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband and I picked this hotel based on affordability and location. The lobby is gorgeous and our room was clean and comfortable. What surprised us the most was how quiet it was. If you are on a budget, I would definitely recommend!  [END]
[BEGIN] No Breakfast, I have stayed at alot of choice hotels....but no breakfast, just a little disppointed. As usual for NYC Hotel rooms small. As usual comfortable bed. Desk clerks very nice. Soho Nice area, Nice restautants around area. Breakfast places not close it seemed for a sunday  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed here solo for a business trip and all i can say is that this hotel is average, pretty good service and value. but sorry don't think i'm coming back again, unless there's promotions or something.  [END]
[BEGIN] L'albergo ha bisogno di ristrutturazione, la stanza era abbastanza grande, un po vecchia ma tutto sommato ok. In quanto alla posizione ottima. Appena si usciva dall'albergo eri a times square e da li potevi visitare comodamente a piedi Manathan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice central location, very friendly and accomodating staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were a bit disappointed with the Hilton ... not quite 4* in our opinion. It was functional, but nothing special. If you need a bed for the night it does the job, but be prepared to pay extra for any incidentals such as baggage check.  [END]
[BEGIN] posizione vantaggiosa per chi vuole stare a midtown. personale gentile il resto tutto senza infamia e senza lode prima colazione buona  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was in need of renovation. No coffee maker in the room and all nearby coffee places didn't open early. They said they had hot water but then they didn't. Just didn't feel it was worth the price. Was in a good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was our second visit to the Wellington Hotel. Although basic, it is clean and ideal for your stay in New York. It is less than 5 minutes away from both Central Park or Times square. The staff are very helpful and friendly. Would definately go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location were perfect close to shopping ang times square. But rooms were not very clean  [END]
[BEGIN] nice view and great location but the roof top and lounge bar was closed because of a private events! So we paid a really expansive price just for the room. We were really desapointed!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for a week on business. The room was fine, and the location of the hotel was great. Make sure your room doesn't face 51st street. The police station was across from my room, and the noise woke me repeatedly. Otherwise my stay would have been very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] The public areas with the bars etc are great, but the rooms are ridiculously small and do not even have a minibar, i.e. not chilled drinks in the room. Bathrooms are the smallest I have ever seen. Good design.  [END]
[BEGIN] We decided to choose this hotel because of the location but as all hotels are compact in NYC this is no different. We wouldn't stay here again on the basis that the value does not equate to the cost you pay.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you choose the renovated rooms you'll have clean and functional place to sleep at an affordable price. It is located near a convenient subway station and not far from 5th avenue.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ignore all the bad reviews about this hotel - had a great time there. Staff were friendly and it was right beside the L station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was OK except the A/C unit. It was old unit and loud. Front desk agents were not service oriented, typical NYC hotel standard? We did not like the surroundings of the hotel - dirty. We probably will not go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its kind of old, needs a bit of refurnishing. Old bathrooms, small and old towels. We spent one day there with no hot water, winter time! Reception, oh god!, rude, rude... Put a smile on their faces, please! Breakfast is a joke, right?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny rooms, tiny beds, tiny bathroom, tiny sink, tiny elevators. Clean, good value, not great for families, rude staff but we didn't have to deal with them too much  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Quaint small rooms. Nothing fancy. Clean linen, no bed bugs. Great little pizza joint right next door.  [END]
[BEGIN] we spent 3 nights in this hotel for december 31st! we were pretty satisfied about this hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] A great little hotel, the rooms were small but perfect for a stay in New York - close to everything, clean, modern, what more could you want! The bathroom was verrrry small but overall would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a basic hotel with great shower, bed, internet connection and tv. Nothing but that. if you are looking for a safe confortable and quite place, here is the place. Looking for something else, try to find somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed one night for the location, staff not over all friendly, no view. Room clean bed softer than I prefer. TV responder slow to remote. Would be great for families with small chlidren.  [END]
[BEGIN] We went to see Bruce Springsteen at MSG--was a great location--rooms reminded me of Europe--small but very functional--it was the elevators that drove me crazy--there were only 2 & it went to I think 26 floors--unbelieveably slow slow slow--so bad in fact that I would choose somewhere else next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Place to be when the City is your target. In the middle of the action with its pro and cons. Their restaurant is a bit of a hide away cellar experience, but service and food are OK. Staff very helpful, overal rather average.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location just off Broadway with an underground station one block away. Functional place but really tiny rooms, with even tinier bathrooms and a closet good for a couple of shirts. Expect no views of amenities, but it suffices as a place to sleep.  [END]
[BEGIN] abbiamo soggiornato per una settimana in questo hotel con nostra figlia. La camera era essenziale ma pulita. ottima la posizione a pochi passi da central park e dalla 5th Ave. Discutibile in una location del genere in zona centrale i collegamenti internet a pagamento.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here on a quick business trip. The room is clean, the bed pretty comfortable. The shower was dreadful and a bit leaky. Not a big deal. Bottom line: if you get a good rate, consider this property.  [END]
[BEGIN] DoubleTree lieg so wie man sich Ny vorstellt und ist ok. Ein Problem war dass wir 3 Personen bestellt hatten (2 Erwachsene und ein 17 Jahre Sohn) und dann mussten wir im kingbed zu dritt schlafen was nicht geplant war (Hotel war ausgebucht)  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was spacious and clean. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Beds were hard, but overall nice and updated room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Simple and clean hotel to a good price. There are Wifi availble. It is close to a Metro station (110th W). Don't go to the East into Central Park on the 107th and the streets above. No bathroom in the hotel room but the shared bathrooms are clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sehr Zentral. Kleine Betten. Sehr "verwohnt". Es was zu Staubig  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the fact that it was close to everything, but the room especially the bathroom could have been a little cleaner. When you step in to the shower you could smell that it was not very clean.I may stay there again,but will check the room  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is a great location and close to everything in Manhattan. The lobby was nice, and we expected our room to live up the standard. There were two flies welcoming us when we first entered our room. The towels were dusted.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've been upgraded to a Suite on the 26th floor with very nice view. My Bed was just so marvellous... Lobby disappointing as well as housekeeping. Very well located.  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel is not in the greatest location for chicago compared to others. Has the usuall W stuff. walls are thin. Got an early morning wake up call i didnt ask for. service was low. restaurant is very average tasting food. rooms are trendy as always with W  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful tower. Small lobby. Enough elevators. Expensive breakfast and minibar. Cozy beds. Nice bath. Not very secure. Yummy breakfast from expensive room service. Rooftop pool with view was awesome! Ordered extra pillows and blankets but never came.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, great location and staff.... but - the room was tiny, cheap towels in the bathroom, noisy HVAC unit in the room kept us up all night. I know rooms in NYC are expensive, but for $400 a night was expecting something a lot better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dans une brownstone Chambres petites - SDB et WC communes propres Peu de bruit Proche d'Union Square Bon service  [END]
[BEGIN] The Ohio House Motel is probably the cheapest place to stay in downtown Chicago. Expect little. Sleep OK. Not a place to work, relax and spend a full working week. A single night, in and out is OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have stayed here a couple of times in the past, only now decided to leave reviews. Stay has always been average, location is very convenient for business in Mid Town. Would recommend it although sometime its a bit over priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] A grand Dame ok but Air con needs replacing and staff need an attitude check , especially the ones on the roof top bar!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Helpful staff and convenient midtown location. Free breakfast, pleasant and clean rooms. The closets could be bigger though! Loads of Korean restaurants around.  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked a superior King room for 6 nights that was very small with no drawers, no storage space. Tiny bathroom. Okay king bed. Awful rubber pillows. Great view of Hudson River. We left after one night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to times square and billed as boutique but still small rooms, small lobby and passageways so not much room to enjoy any public areas. We booked on hot-wire and for one night was ok but for longer you need more room  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad. Location is excellent, hotel itself is nothing special. The lobby is nice, and the rooms are serviceable, staff was generally friendly and helpful. The hotel isn't extraordinary by any stretch, but it's a perfectly fine option if the price is right.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay in room # 302 with own bathroom, avoid the rooms facing the street, they aree too noisy! Overall, a clean place to get some rest, shower and get out to the city. Subways and Buses are 3 blocks away.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was family trip and we booked 2 rooms. Everything was great except front desk and stuff. Only one lady was nice the rest rude, mean and arrogant. Gizela  [END]
[BEGIN] watch your valuables! If you use the valet parking service better take everything with you when you leave your car: loose change, maps, kleenex, breath mints, and everything else. The car parking staff have magnetic fingers, which will attract anything that isn't bolted down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Un albergo tutto in stile marocchino, molto colorato e carino. Comodo soprattutto per la posizione. Punti deboli: no ascensore (la valigia la portano i ragazzi dell'hotel), tutta moquette e stanza con finestra che da su un muro... Punti forti: pulito e ottima posizione.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in this Hotel from 23rd August to the 26th August Rooms are small but thta is New York First Night the duvet was not ironed on one bed and looked awful the next day they had changed but there was a tear on the duvet cover not Sheraton Standard?  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is OK. Probably lack some personal touches, a cozyer lobby and better front desk clerks. Rooms are very nice, contrary to the lobby, which seems dull and boring. TV service in rooms is very limited.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a small problem w/ the window not locking but it was quickly fixed. Small, yet clean and no bugs. Excellent location and price!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is up to Hilton standards except in house restaurants are nothing special. Beware charges for parking ($43 per night) and wifi is not free ($39.50 for 5 days) which is over the top when most hotels now provide wifi free.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. I expected much more from this place, since I stayed before at this same chain in Times Square. Room is very small and the bed was not so confortamble as I expected. Breakast is not the same quality either.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was friendly and extremely helpful. I was a little disappointed because when we arrived, the ONE bell boy they had on staff was at lunch. We had to load, roll and carry all of our things up by ourselves.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel staff was accomodating and friendly. The rooms were clean and updated recently. Flat panel tv in room. Location is close to several bars and restaurants. Good for business meetings, etc...  [END]
[BEGIN] We visit the NYC and want to stay as close to the city as possible, Marriott @times square is very convenient, although the price is a bit steep, but considering its location and convenience, it might still be worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for a second time and it will be my last. The location is great and price very variable but it is very dated and needs a refresh all over. Not so clean either.There are better options in the same area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small room and bed (just a full bed). Do not ask for couples bed, ask for 2 twins. Pricy breakfast. Good service and price benefit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel lies in a quiet area of New York, but other wise central. It is close to Central Park and Times Square (you can walk). The hotel looks nice, but it is quite old. I would stay there again, but for the location, not for it's looks.  [END]
[BEGIN] ES UN HOTEL MUY BIEN UBICADO PERO MUY BASICO. PARA SER NEW YORK SE PUEDE CONSIDERAR COMO UN ALOJAMIENTO ACEPTABLE. ES RECOMENDABLE SI SOLO SE UTILIZA EL HOTEL PARA DORMIR A LAS NOCHES. RECOMENDABLE EL BAR DE AL LADO PARA DESAYUNAR.  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived late and were greated with a dirty lobby, people hanging in lobby, strange people exiting hotel. Room was ok - very worn and dirty - air quality stuffy and musty. I did not feel comfortable there and would not come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing grand and nothing terrible about the Soho. Room was adequate but furniture was worn. Could use better lighting. Staff friendly enough. Room service sandwich was fine. Room faced construction across the street. All in all, an OK hotel but nothing more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, btwn Macy's & Empire State building, 7 blks to times square. We arrived on train into Penn Station, 1 blk away. Hotel was clean, breakfast good, but was a hassle with wi-fi, had to log in every time we went out to smoke. We would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay like 2 times, and they always clean, the rooms are small but good, is for sleep only you go to see the city and come back late to sleep, i really like it!! And everything is like walking distance!!! AAA++++  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely situated, but somewhat pricey($450). Unable to get room until about 4pm, which was a huge inconvenience. The elevators are inadequate for the size of the accomodation. Nice resident cat!!  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel was ok, but poor lighting in bathroom, a bit worn out. staff was mixed bag of helpful and stereo-typical NYC impersonal. used points, but would have been unhappy if paying $. good location for shopping and shows, which was key reason to stay there. no bed bugs.  [END]
[BEGIN] simpel hotel. Personeel wisselend van erg onvriendelijk tot vriendelijk. Bed erg klein denk 1.20cm met piepklein lakentje en dekentje. Eigenlijk niet geschikt voor 2 pers.Verwarming maakt veel herrie.Ook wanneer hij uit is.  [END]
[BEGIN] A good, clean room at a reasonable price, but the complimentary breakfast was disappointing (and the area cramped), the parking was convenient but expensive, and the location was not convenient (unless you are going to Wrigley Field).  [END]
[BEGIN] I left my cell phone in my room while at dinner & a play. The next morning I realized my phone was missing. I spent an hour filing a report with a Security Officer. It has now been 8 months & I've heard nothing from the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, friendly staff. Parking at the hotel is a little pricey considering practically all your shopping is within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] For $139 in Chelsea in a weekend it's hard to complain but Starwood needs to put a little love back into this spot. Worn furniture, surfaces, hallways, lobby to name a few. Staff has always been just friendly enough but still NYC short. Location is amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in great location .Room was ok for the size for one person My only complaint was the front desk people was rude and not all there  [END]
[BEGIN] Issues with room service (wine orderered by the glass on room service menu was actually only available at the bar); air conditioning would not shut off (error message on AC control); room overall shabby (eg, peeling wall paper, etc).  [END]
[BEGIN] the location is great, just off the north michigan ave. But the room is old.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location of hotel is Great. Staff is very friendly. Rooms are the tiniest I have ever seen, plus the noise from the street is loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel for a good price but local restaurant kind of overpriced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was a box. My friend and I had a hard time moving around. The blue neon lights are very cheesy. Room was clean, but the toilet had some nasty debris floating in it. Great location. Friendly staff. Cool view of Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny, tiny standard rooms. I therefore looked at the next sizes up but the the tiny standard had more charm. Wonderful design, expensive breakfast and great if you like living in a hotel with a busy nightclub. The info on the tv is not updated btw.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here with my husband in Dec 2011. I liked the hotel for its location and cleanliness (room was small, but that's NYC). My husband wasn't as impressed as the elevators were too few and always busy. I'd stay again, but he wouldn't.  [END]
[BEGIN] All features and amenities 0f the hotel were quite satisfactory with the single exception of the shuttle service. We waited 75 minutes after contacting the hotel [twice] and both promised a pickup in several minutes. Unfortunately, it will lead to a review for future stays, particularly at this location.  [END]
[BEGIN] sehr zentrale Lage fuer Erkundung der Stadt zu Fuss. Unfreundlicher Empfang, die Mitarbeiter schauen nur auf Ihren PC und bedienen dabei ohne den Kunden anzuschauen. Sehr guter Zimmerservice, Zimmermeist nur an einem Lichtschacht, aber dadurch ruhig.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location and staff are the best parts of this place. Rooms are small, but their housekeeping is decent. Under $120 a night, I still think it's worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] very old. Everything seemed old. rooms are tiny. And did i say old. clean but old. no problems with service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here to catch an early flight. Upgraded to a suite which was nice. TINY bathroom and lots of activity in the hotel from a wedding or a conference of some type. Would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is quite old, the elevator is small and narrow, facilities are just so so, however, it really has a perfect location! Walking distance to Michigan Ave and Navy Pier. There Arevsome fancy restaurants very nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel even though it states that it is a Plush hotel left us disappointed. Nothing special about rooms. Our two bedroom suite had an awkward floor plan. For $800 a night you should at least get expeesso in your room. We got nothing. not worth the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] picture makes it seem special, but its pretty generic. one gripe: no curtains on the windows. had to rig up blankets on the windows in order to sleep in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice Neighborhood. Good Price, Good Location. Very Small rooms and not in good condition, Former Columbia University Dorm. If you just want a cheap place to stay this is it.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel esta bien, pero la comida y los desayunos, son caaaaaaros!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] When I stayed under-reconstruction. I think renewal will be much better!  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed here overnight on way to galveston from outside looks ok. once we got in room furniture dated and not clean enough. no bugs just stale. probably would not stay again for the money. liked the concept of the kitchen  [END]
[BEGIN] i stayed here twice in april with my husband and a friend of mine. it was clean and comfortable however they did not have any internet access however there was a whataburger across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not even a tea or coffee maker on the room. But then it's NYC - overpriced hotels in general  [END]
[BEGIN] Great breakfast and rooms were clean. Restaurant/bar next door loud during Happy Hour nights. Can walk to Times Square and Empire State Bldg.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were very clean and comfortable. Rates were OK once medical discount was applied. The breakfast in the attached restaraunt was less than desireable. The restaraunt manager and hostess were very outgoing and provided great service but the quality of the food was a disappointment.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's hard to beat the location of this hotel. It's right on MI ave. We got a great rate for the season and a cheap upgrade to a suite. However, the service was pretty crappy. I don't think anyone smiled at us once while we were there.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here for 4 nights in March as part of a bigger US holiday. Great location, but the rooms (or ours at least) are a big small. The place is clean though and within walking distance of everything you need in New York. Definitely recommended for budget travellers.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm an InTouch Member and ended up in a room right next to the elevator, super tiny, premium price, terrible view. The room was also very dark and did not feel very safe walking home at night. Next time, I'll stay elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel enorme ma semplice vecchio ma pulito in una posizione perfetta  [END]
[BEGIN] Room wasn't quite right and didn't get maid service, but they did make up for it. Very friendly staff and location which helped a lot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are big and clean. Good location. Toilets flushed really loud. Got to take two elevators to get to your room. Lobby bar was small and didn't even have white zinfandel. The gift shop was a joke. Room was hot and the air conditioner was loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value, great location right next to Times Square. The rooms are nothing spectacular, but are clean and get the job done. The bed was a bit too firm for my taste. If you don't need luxury, this hotel is a great value.  [END]
[BEGIN] First time in NYC and we picked a Name brand hotel HAMPTON INN service is great but the rooms and the halls need to be redone it still looks like a Howard Johnson The staff were some what friendly but the location is great Needs to improve on the rooms  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed on the 14th and it was recently renewed. No complains about it, it's not a great hotel for the price you pay, but I had a good stay in a great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoy the Warwick's location when in NYC. This time our room was a little worn and our view wasn't very nice. The prices seemed to have gone up however, the weekend senior rate was reasonable. Nice dining room.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in Holiday Inn Manhattan for 2 nights. It is a good hotel in the heart of NYC. But rooms were very small as compared to the price. Its more of a in-transit hotel :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was comfortable. Property is large and has a variety of additional features. Pool, workout room, bar/grill and breakfast area. Bar and grill is very spacious and has a large menu. Plenty of places to sit to watch sporting events or visit with your group.  [END]
[BEGIN] considerando il prezzo e la vicinanza a diversi siti turistici di Manhattan direi che e' un buon hotel. Le camere sono pulite e spaziose ... i bagni un po' meno ma hanno tutto quello che serve e sopratutto sono puliti.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice enough hotel but I walked into my bathroom and there was hair all over the floor. It made me question the cleanliness of the rest of the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here after the Ritz because we wanted to be closer to the hustle. we paid about $100/night. rather pay more for nicer hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location of Park 79 Hotel is great, and very convenient to several subways. Our Junior suite didn't quite live up to our expectations, as the 2 rooms were very small. 1st night we had to sleep in 2 double rooms, due to overbooking - and they were reasonable sized.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are spacious and calm (for New York !). But we spent two hours to clean it by ourselves, because it was very dirty. All the hotel deserves renovation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don't expect to be in your room much. The perfect hotel if you just want a place to sleep between exPloring New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] Family of four from Texas. We loved it! Great location. Friendly staff and clean room, dated but clean. We requested a newly renovated room before arrival and got it. No problems at all. Did request extra pillows, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in Superior Queen room and it was an awkward room and small. Taking the fact that it was not a standard room I was expecting much more. Disappointing...  [END]
[BEGIN] this is a nice hotel, and the stuff is very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] There was some construction going on outside which was super loud! Other than that, it's small as you can expect from a lot of hotels in the city, but not a bad stay outside of the noise. Room was decent and staff was very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the hotel was old and outdated, the bed was very comfortable. Hotel front desk staff were very nice and helpful. Close to Michigan Avenue and not a bad night's stay for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Habitaciones pequenas,cucarachas en las alfonbras,despues del monton.Lo salva la excelente ubicacion,no condice precio con calidad  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems more like a Courtyard than a Marriott. Very close to the American Girl store. Was on the 16th floor and I found it to be very noisy. No concierge lounge on weekends.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for one night. Room was basic BUT very clean. Bathroom was spotless. Is set up more like a boarding house. We stayed in a basic dbl. No complaints.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the location was fantastic, and park view beautiful, the rooms are tired looking. Peeling wallpaper, dingy carpeting, rusted heater in the bathroom and lack of coffee maker in room a disappointment. Employees very nice and helpful, but the hotel needs work cosmetically.  [END]
[BEGIN] its location is what makes it most ideal. service is good though. staff is very friendly and welcoming .the sushi restaurant below is a nice place to dine. It has good utilities like a laundry room on every floor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value for your money. Cleaning was the only thing we wasn't satisfied with. Nice upcoming area with alot of restaurants and bars.  [END]
[BEGIN] it was ok no view hard time paying cash, coincerge was pleasent room was overpriced  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are visiting Methodist Hospital the location can't be beat. Ok rooms, great service, weekday prices are outrageous though! The staff were very nice!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a decent Hotel offering great location & great value for money. It offers very fast wifi, which is great help for persons on business trip. The rooms are small & the food in the cafeteria is poor  [END]
[BEGIN] staff friendly but expect all of the inefficiencies of a large institution....calls for customer assistance on hold for 5 minutes each time; A/C broken in our suite, wait in line for concierge....stuff you might expect with a discount hotel. Probably won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice and clean motel. But for business travelers, your not up to current trends like something simple as Internet Access. Not even Dial-Up!! Please get with the times. I have to go to a cafe to do work on the internet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Un personnel aux petits soins, une architecture impressionnante, une chambre agreable, un cote impersonnel et un restaurant pas du tout a la hauteur. La reception date un peu des annees 80  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice remodeling. All business amenities provided. Small bathroom. Surprisingly quiet for its location with modern sound dampening windows. Friendly staff. Restaurant food is unimaginative and not especially good. Good access to Kennedy expressway and CTA blue line. Airport shuttle service provided.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, however the hotel rooms were very outdated. The bar and resturant on site were great. The bathrom vent ran all night. We closed the bathroom door, which helped.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel familiar, bien las habitaciones (Tower Suite) pero muy ruidosas por la calefaccion,cuando se ponia en funcionamiento. los colchones son muy incomodos y se clavaban los muelles sobre todo los del sofa cama y pedimos que nos lo cambiaran, limitandose a poner otro encima en iguales condiciones.6 dias  [END]
[BEGIN] Great views, very quiet rooms, adjoining as requested and the beds are great. Bathrooms poor as are the bedrooms, tired in a word and in need of some TLC. Good quiet location and feels very safe. Spend some money on the rooms and it would be great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Whitehall has been an icon in Chicago for decades. Although the hotel is showing its age, the location is fab, the bed amazing, and breakfast terrific, we still got a really cheap rate which included in and out valet parking and breakfast!  [END]
[BEGIN] basic room and service. Nothing special My keys kept deactivating?  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an older hotel but was in good shape. The rooms were clean, but exterior maintenance needed to be updated. Parking lot riddled with potholes. Cant beat the price and location. Good places to eat and shop nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me and my girlfriend lived here for 4 nights now in october/November 2008. No problems with anything. The shared bathroom was always clean and the room as well. Cant complaine about anything really!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fine as a base for exploring NY and not wanting to pay too much - although every hotel room in NY is very expensive! Rooms were clean and shared bathrooms no problem - always clean and usually empty. Reception staff very helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there on Oct. 4th: Pros: Very Nice Staff Location, location, location, location Nice Price Clean rooms Good continental breakfast Coffee 24 hours per day comfortable beds Cons: Postage stamp size rooms very slow elevator  [END]
[BEGIN] Went to newyorker hotel feb 2011 room dreadful small,cold ,clausterphobic got ripped off by taxi arranged bt hotel got 100 dollers back lost out on 220dollors does this make it okay? No courtesy car Would'nt stay here again only bonus diner was nice  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice hotel, nothing fancy, but clean & a good nights sleep. I love the location, with respect to the nearness of the Galleria Mall for shopping & its impressive ice rink.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quest'hotel e' abbastanza buono. Nonostante sia abbastanza caro, si trova perfettamente nel centro di Manhattan. A due passi dalla famigerata 5th avenue, da Times Square e dall'Hard Rock Cafe...che dire, e' posizionato molto bene, ed e' anche abbastanza lussuoso.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in posizione strategica a 50mt da Times Square. Camere ampie e bagno pulito, arredamento essenziale ma pratico. Stupidamente ho chiesto la camera sulla strada, piuttosto rumorosa.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buena ubicacion, amable atencion. He estado en muchos hoteles Hampton y me gustan mucho pero este fue el mas feo en el que estuve. De todos modos estuvo bien, limpio. Pero si vuelvo a New York no volveria al hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] very well made new interiors, perfect location but disappointed with the staff, very rigid and unwilling to accomodate clients..  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was easy to find, and in a good location - easy walk to midtown & main shopping strips, rooms were a bit dark, could do with some 'refreshing'. Will look elsewhere when we go again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel that feels a step up from other chains such as Marriot etc. However still has much of the impersonal feel of other chain hotels and its hard to see how the very high ratings are justified. Recommend if you get it at good discount  [END]
[BEGIN] Our second stay at this hotel in the past 18 months. Yes the rooms do need updating but the location is perfect as a base to explore NY city. All interaction I had with staff was really positive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, great location, polite staff, good breakfast. Good for Penn Station. I found all hotels expensive for what they were in Manhattan but this seems more realistic.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had two rooms the first week of December and found the hotel to be Vintage [old] but clean and confortable I have spent double the amount in NY and will admit got better but I would recomend it for budget or bussiness travelers A very good value  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel has an excellent location but very old rooms and not much cleaning. For its location and in comparison with other mid Manhattan hotels was a good bargain. We would recomend this hotel for travelers that do not want to spend much time in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very average. Parts of the hotel need attention. Staff was helpful. Great location for anything at Reliant.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a decent NYC hotel. The lobby is quaint and the rooms were modern and clean. The lounge furniture (leather chairs) were a bit worn. The carpet would not be my choice. The hotel is in a good location downtown within walking distance of the Seaport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel good price will recommend hotel And will stay here again. Close to are conference and all otherthings shopping restaurant  [END]
[BEGIN] Room is clean and small Bathroom door made me mad as it was always in my way great hotel for the few tourist who are or become a shopaholic in NYC Subway Station is just next to the hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Buen hotel, muy buena ubicacion, servicio y limpieza. Las habitaciones son bastante chicas y no esperes que sean como las areas sociales del hotel, realmente son basicas pero cumplen con su objetivo.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a one stay while in town to see a show and do some shopping. The lobby and the library bar were cool but the room was small and not that comfortable. The staff were great, which would be a reason to return if not for the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in this hotel few years ago, and I'm going to be there in April. I can see the hotel is under renovation. Are all the rooms already renovated ? How can I know if I'm going to be given an old or a renovated room? Thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] we stayed for 4 nights, New York was great night life was great hotel wasn't real good  [END]
[BEGIN] If you don't want to spend too much money for a hotel in NYC and don't care about a view, or room to move, and no amenities, here it is. The beds were comfortable,though  [END]
[BEGIN] This was one of the few places in mid town available for $200/night after a long day at the US Open. No frills, but as advertised; clean, compact room, desk, chair, small but clean newish bath. No surprises. Wholefoods market across street on 7th avenue.  [END]
[BEGIN] had a great time on our stay at the park central hotel. ricky alvarez checked us in and helped us out a great deal. we ordered yankee tickets on-line and had a problem receiving them and ricky saved the day! thanks again for making our stay there a great one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location to Madison Park and Eataly. Rooms small but outside street noise was at a minimum.  [END]
[BEGIN] older hotel, small, but not closet type rooms, some room updates.... Not the nicest area in town, but not far from time square and 9th street around the corner has a good selection of food.  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel is kinda bad because when we went the elevator didnt work and the hotel has some littel attention to his clients the only good of this is near everything  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was nice and the bed was very comfortable. However, the room was VERY musty. Smelled of mold when the A/C would come on. It was also very humid, like it had flooded at one time.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff were all very friendly and helpful and it's right off the highway. However, the rooms are run-down and the surrounding area does not seem safe. If nothing else is available this place is OK, but I would say look elsewhere if you can.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location (very close to metro, American Museum of Natural History and Central Park), very small but clean rooms. Bathroom ok (stayed in a room with a private bathroom).  [END]
[BEGIN] Very easy to walk to many main attractions within Chicago, close to shopping and nightlife. The hotel itself was older and the rooms ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, it is hard to beat the location of this hotel. The rooms are the smallest I have ever had in the city & I have stayed at many places. It is clean, it is quiet, and it is very convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed here twice, both times thought the rooms are just too small, its also right up on the columbus so quite a way uptown, food ok, service as always very good.but just cant recommend it  [END]
[BEGIN] The neighboorhood is not very nice, although the subway station is close. The room is really small and basic. The restaurant is very expensive. The staff was below average. Just a basic Holiday Inn Express type with a fancy restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Edison is in a great location right by Times Square. A little bit tired and basic. Also quite noisy due to passing traffic and drone of the air conditioning units on the office block opposite - not loud but a persistent hum. Take ear plugs.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were very pleased with our room, and we were happy with the hotel staff. The bathrooms were extremely clean. Our room was beautiful, but small. You really can't beat this deal; the location is terrific.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel and nice rooms but one drawback - room would not get cold (in January)! I set on the lowest setting and it was still hot. I couldn't even use the covers to sleep - had to sleep under the sheet only.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for while in town to attend a Conference. The hotel was clean & semi modern. The staff was professional and accommodating. The two bell caps were very helpful with receiving fed-ex packages i had sent out ahead of my stay. Overall, not bad for a quick b-trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked at the last minute & room rates were quite expensive. Expected more from a four star. Internet v expensive. On a positive note, location is excellent & evening wine reception is a nice touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room I booked was small and spare, nothing exciting. But I slept well, which is what counts most in the end, right?  [END]
[BEGIN] reicht dieses Hotel allemal. das zimmer war zweckmaessig eingerichtet, das bad jedoch etwas dreckig, aber die putzfrau hat zumindest jeden tag gesaugt und frische handtuecher gebracht. die lage ist super, alle sehenswuerdigkeiten sind schnell zu erreichen  [END]
[BEGIN] 99 bucks for a safe clean, comfortable room in NYC? Can't beat it. Sure you have to share a bathroom, but it's clean as hell, and the place was generally quiet. On a budget - you could do worse. Great safe location too,  [END]
[BEGIN] One to say you've been and done but there are better hotels in NY for the price. You can't fail to be impressed by the history but rooms are small, facilities dated and feeling a bit tired Great location but you know that before you book  [END]
[BEGIN] A viagem mais perfeita de Sempre !  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at this hotel in July 2006 for 4 days. It was ok, very nicely located, but the room we stayed in was a bit small. We were expected the room to be a bit bigger.  [END]
[BEGIN] An interesting introduction to manhattan, trought a little hotel in the middle of the city with a nice wiew on the nearest skyscrapers. Nice rooms (deluxe type) and an original breakfast area.  [END]
[BEGIN] I booked THe Whitehall after reading it is considered a "luxury" hotel. I found it to be adequate. The linens are not of a high quality, the bath is small and poorly lit. THe room was clean and large enough, but in no way would be considered a luxury property.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is great! All else leaves a lot to be desired: I was offered a room with bad smell, another room with terribly squeaking beds. Noisy air-conditioning etc. All in all: I'll look for another experience before checking into this hotel again  [END]
[BEGIN] clean, great location, train station resturant's close by just easy it's midtown. i recomend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] not really what i expected. location good, but rooms simply too small even for NY standards  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel was comfortable and was quiet. Nothing special about the decor nor the size of the room. But there weren't any 'surprises' to darken my stay. I'd stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay here often for business, not because I want to. The location is a bit far east for my taste. The rooms are in need of updating but ok. Staff is friendly but beware o the rooms near the elevators- they ate really loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room might be a 4 star room, but the bathroom is definitely only 3 stars. I can see pipe sticking out of the wall in the tub and the water control looks like it's about to fall apart. I'm disappointed--I was looking for a more obviously 4-star experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great! But the service was awful! The rooms were large for New York standards.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here one night. It is fine, but nothing special. The hallways are oddly narrow, and there is a slightly musty odor. I would note that my room was good size for NYC and surprisingly quiet.  [END]
[BEGIN] front desk was helpful. Good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately had to wait an hour for them to bring a cork scew. Unbelievable bad service. "service express"; what a joke.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small, cramped, overrun with students/backpacks. No lobby to speak of, understaffed at the desk. Room was decent. Will try hard not to stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is on the Katy Freeway and that is the USP. I would zip across to any place as the highway just next to the hotel and helped me avoid the traffic jams. The breakfast in the hotel was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have to stay in mid-town Manhattan, this is a reasonable choice. No extras, nothing special, but is a good place to stay. It was pouring while I was there and couldn't get a cab, which is a problem in general, but in this location in particular.  [END]
[BEGIN] An old hotel with small, dark rooms that need updating. Convenient to MSG and Penn Station, but there are so many nicer hotels to choose from.  [END]
[BEGIN] 15 min away from the loop, walking. Carpet in the room wasn't as clean as it could have been. Definitely not a destination for a romantic getaway. Otherwise it was alright to spend two nights in.  [END]
[BEGIN] really a very nice hotel, design and decor was great. The rooms are a bit small but very nice in forniture and the linen are FANTASTIC. Only a problem during the stay we wait 45 minutes for someone that pick up our luggages from the room...  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny "cabins", movable bed/ couch is creative and convenient use of space, fine for sleeping but wouldn't want to spend any waking hours in such a tiny space! Very clean, nice rain shower and heated towel bar. Food at the restaurant was not very good, but fast and convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] We popped into NYC for one night to see a show. We wanted to be in the Times Square/Theater District. This hotel was a great bargain for the price and centrally located to the other things we wanted to do. We would definitely stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny rooms, thin walls, very loud outside and hallway noise. Friendly staff, nice bar and restaurant downstairs, West Branch.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a national landmark and a flagship hotel but it is a real disappointment The lobby and entrance maybe grand but the rooms are very dated and don't feel clean. The location is good and the restaurants are reasonably priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at this hotel , the films were not available due to hotel changing supplier. So paid for WiFi Hotel would not waive the WiFi charge ; which I thought was pretty mean of them; apart from that room was fine Staff fine also  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a massive hotel without the luxury which is a shame. We booked here over marathon weekend and I would not recommend, hotel, rooms and service were all a bit shabby. Upsides are good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean room to stay. Though breakfast was rather poor and expensive  [END]
[BEGIN] Een redelijk hotel, met een moderne inrichting en uitstraling. Kamers zijn betrekkelijk klein, de Deluxe kamers zijn net wat ruimer. Er is altijd wel een goede prijs te onderhandelen. Locatie is goed, met een paar hotspots om de hoek, Times Square, maar vergeet ook Bryant Park niet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cozy and comfortable room. Convenient location close to lots of shopping and restaurants, but secluded and away from the congestion of the city. The pool area was nice, but lots of kids. I should have looked for the garden pool for peace and quiet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is ideally located for many of the major attractions, lovely hotel one or two minor issues on the whole what you expect for a very busy New York hotel. Would happily recommend this hotel and even more important would def. stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location in Midtown, walk to Rock plaza, times sq and many broadway shows. club level rooms a must, but grab a bite elsewhere... Increased hotel cost not even close to worth it! Look for prepaid rate options to receive discount.  [END]
[BEGIN] Un hotel que esta bastante bien , salvao las habitaciones que tienen demasiado ruido, por los paratos de aire acondicionado.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not comfortable recommending it. Good news- no bed bugs and staff always courteous and smiling.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel isn't the worst. I don't know why it gets such a bad rap! You get what you pay for..I didn't mind it at all. Although, I wouldn't stay longer then three nights. If your looking for a 'stop off' while sight seeing around it's perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just one block off of Time Square, this hotel is a bit overpriced for it's value and amenities. The hotel tries to come off as fashionable and hip, but when you take a closer look it's old and outdated. The guest services and staff were unsatisfactory as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] We found this hotel basic kind but with good location. It had basic breakfast. We booked this hotel as we wanted to stay very near to Time Square and Shopping Area. We can recommend this hotel to person having same choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was in a great location, only a 10-15 minute walk to Times Square! It was a pretty small room, but had everything you need. The air conditioner was fairly noisy though. A good hotel if you're on a budget but want to be close to Times Square!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here on business. My room had just been updated and the smells from the carpet and fabrics gave me the worst sinus headache. Everything in the room looked cheap. The hotel breakfast in The Grille was good. BIG SHOCK: $49 PER NIGHT TO PARK THE RENTAL CAR!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] So i'm spoilt with hotels in other areas on the globe, but was a bit upset that there was only paid tv when i had time to kill and not in the mood for going out! The rest was ok. The location made up for the rest  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, Underground across the street. Very good breakfast next to Hotel. Rooms are very poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable room, nice location and nothing to complain about. Considering Manhattan has such variety to pick from, this is a very good choice when you need a place to crash and not spending a ton of time in the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel bar roof top is not for the guests since it is leased out and there is no control over the patrons and the noise  [END]
[BEGIN] We got a non view (of the park) room for 200 a night so the value was good I just hated the smell of horse manure when you walk outside.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is nice. Good location and decent amenities. They charge $10 A DAY for wi-fi access which I think is preposterous. And, the on floor vending was sold out the entire length of my stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel was clean, staff was very helpful and curteous, close to subway and one block from Central Park. All in all, money well spent, I would return next time. Reviews stated that this hotel is noisy, so I had my earplugs in every night.  [END]
[BEGIN] esterno dell'hotel coperto di impalcature e ingresso bruttino ma stanze grandi e abbastanza belle. corridoi con moquet da sostituire e ascenzore difficile da usare ma in generale meglio di quello che mi aspettavo.  [END]
[BEGIN] There were problems with the plumbing and my room had no water for many hours. I've stayed there before and this is unusual. The place is fine for a few days but not comfortable for a long stay. Clean and excellent proces  [END]
[BEGIN] found the hotel too big. here for a conference and it was tough to find the meeting rooms. Decent rooms for an old hotel. staff was not helpful as to the general area.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an outdated place. Old rooms that need refurbishing, not really very clean and staff is helpfull but not friendly except Carl at bookings (musicals,theatre,restaurants,clubs,...) who's a gem. Location is good and price reasonable for NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was nice, large but extremely noisy. Great location  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice staff. OK location- but right on 5th Avenue means lots of traffic noise. Only one significant gripe: Small, small, small.... How small? Don't plan on wearing a bulky coat- you won't fit in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good staff except for housekeeping which was very hit and miss. Got a great deal. Doors very noisy closing in corridor but very little noise from street. Hated charge for toll free and local calls and pressure-sensitive mini bar. Decor not al that stylish especially copared with other Sofitels.  [END]
[BEGIN] An okay hotel, room clean, bed comfy,pricing was high. Lobby decor was strange, parking fencing indicated we were in a high crime area, Has a good subtle service to nearby for 5 miles, The name Crown Plaza implies more up scale quarters. Breakfast was so s.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed there for three nights in February. It was ok for the price and the location, but don't expect anything above and beyond the basics. Internet access is expensive, not free and breakfast prices outrageous. The room was good sized, clean and comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Es un hotel para ir a dormir. Correcto en limpieza, pero antiguo. Lo bueno que tiene es q sales por la puerta del hotel caminas 10 metros hacia la derecha y estas en Times Square. El personal es amable y el desayuno ( bajo carta ) esta muy bueno.  [END]
[BEGIN] Die Lage des Hotels ist ausgezeichnet, da direkt zentral in Midtown gelegen und zB Broadway als auch Fith Avenue od. MoMA gut zu erreichen sind. Nur der Putz fiel im Zimmer von der Decke und Schimmel im Badezimmer ist auch nicht sonderlich appetitlich.  [END]
[BEGIN] location good, not to far from attractions, times square, broadway,disappointed no tea/coffee facility in bedrooms,also had to pay for wi-fi Work was in progress on the 5th floor during our stay 13/10/2012 asked for a room change givn a porky room  [END]
[BEGIN] Newly renovated room. Room and bathroom were clean and beds were comfortable. A great value. Staff were very helpful and they had a businsess center. Breakfast was basic, cereal, muffins, bagles, bananas. Close to everything we wanted to do. Will be staying there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best area and rooms a bit basic but was okay for a couple of nights. Hotel is in Manhattan and the area was a bit run down. Staff very friendly and rooms basic, large and clean. Only stayed two nights before flying to Bermuda.  [END]
[BEGIN] First night was not what I had specified for my reservation. I was put in a smoking room and couldn't change until the next day. Once in the non-smoking room I was able to sleep better. The staff was friendly and the location was ideal for our visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed one night at this Fairfield Inn. The room was OK but the internet is only wired and it didn't work when I arrived. The breakfast was poor and the breakfast room was crowded. On the positive side the staff was very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unique hotel for sure! Neat - new modern conveniences - some work, some do not. Zero privacy in the bathroom - not. The "Cabin" is clean, cool and neat but TINY! I have stayed in cruise ship rooms that were bigger!  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed in room with 2 queen beds,rooms clean,good beds.Very good location for Times Square,easy walk.Parking was free which is a big plus in that area. We found the staff efficient,the girl @ the tour info desk was very helpful(sorry forget your name)  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms small but clean, bed very comfortable. Wish we could have had a small fridge. staff helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not up to Marriott corporate brand standards, ok but not great for $200/night! Tiny room. Restaurant menu very pedestrian and way overpriced, boarding pass machine not working, digital tv service went out (during Ryder Cup final round!!). In fairness to Marriott, other brands in area probably not much better!  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in a suite on ym recent visit. The fridge did not work correctly, the shower did not drain correctly and the air conditioner was loud and made sleeping impossible. This is normally a good hotel but this was the wrost stay i have ever had in a Laquinta.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes it is older and interesting. Some rooms need help. Ask for the good room and you should be fine. I've stayed twice and got a decent renovated room with an updated clean bathroom. Colors are wild but... whatever. People running it were nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location in Chelsea, a block away from a subway stop. Immediate area has shops and restaurants. Hotel itself is small, with limited amenities. The rooms are a bit small, newly refurbished with nice modern touches. Good value for New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was looking for something cheap & clean and this fit the bill. Not in the best neighborhood, but it was a clean room and a great price $40. I would stay there again if I was in Houston and just looking for a place to crash.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall, pretty good. The rooms were a bit noisy and a fire alarm went off one morning. Got great service each morning at breakfast and getting coffe after my workouts...thanks Domingo t. Martinez jr!! Made the morning very cheerful and friendly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Buona posizione. Metro a meno di 1 isolato. Buone dimensioni e pulizia della camera. Il giudizio si abbassa a causa di piccoli problemi di manutenzione della camera e dal non ottimo funzionamento dell'impianto di riscaldamento della nostra stanza. Alla partenza abbiamo lasciato i bagagli in posto custodito (a pagamento)  [END]
[BEGIN] The Waldorf Astoria has a beautiful lobby. The rooms were small and worn. The concierge was a total snob, and I paid 22.00 for a martini in the lobby bar! Guess everybody needs to stay at the Waldorf once in their lives, but once is definitely enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is really OK. Why do people expect the most when they choose for the cheapest option in town? It's a NYC bargain. The building is old but the location is perfect and safe, the staff is friendly, rooms are fine and the bathrooms are cleaned every day.  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent one night here before flying out of Midway. The room was new, clean and bright. The only negatives were that the pillows were very soft and uncomfortable. The room was small, but they made good use of the space.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Travel Inn is a really nice hotel at a good price. The room was comfortable and clean and the staff was friendly and helpful. It is fairly close to Times Square and Broadway. I would definitely recommend this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was very nice! Rooms are small, but comfortable! Would definitely stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] very nice rooms & suites. Almost no lobby. Food is mediocre and food staff seemed genuinely disinterested in their jobs -I haven't encountered that level of poor service in a hotel in years (not even in Paris). Very poor leadership.  [END]
[BEGIN] New York Inn Hotel is located strategically close to the major attractions in midtown Manhattan; the hotel staff are excellent in their customer service, and the room rates are very competitive.  [END]
[BEGIN] nearby the Houston's medical center & that's the only good thing about the location. rooms are very big. the hotel overall is old & not that clean  [END]
[BEGIN] A cinque minuti da Times Square, vicinissimo al Madison Square Garden e a qualche isolato dall'Empire, comodo per raggiungere qualsiasi posto di Manhattan. Stanza piccola (a malapena si riesce ad aprire una valigia) ma abbastanza pulita e personale molto disponibile e cortese. Consigliato a chi non ha eccessive pretese.  [END]
[BEGIN] 3 volwassenen in 1 kamer en slechts 2 paar handdoeken en 1 flesje shampoo. Geen koffieapparaat in de kamer. Badkamer niet zo zorgvuldig schoongemaakt, papiertjes bleven 2 dagen liggen. Globaal toch wel wat overprijsd.  [END]
[BEGIN] great location! a bit old, a little noisy heating and i think i felt it like a 3 star hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] C'est bien parce que c'est tout pret de Rockfeler, de l'avenue Broadway, des restaurants, c est pas cher du tout. Par contre la chambre est tres petite et c'est une rue tres bruyante.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice location, with restaurants and fast foods next to the hotel. The furniture and accomodantions could be more modern. Nice price and good staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] sehr zentral sehr sauber angenehmes flair  [END]
[BEGIN] Expected a much better room for the price. This hotel is overated. My room was on the third floor and the windows looked as if they had never been cleaned.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the hotel is old, the staff are great. They are very helpful. There is a living area, dining area with a fully equiped kitchenette allows th guest to cook instead of dining every meal in the restaurant. Great for family to stay together.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny room, hotel was quite dimly lit, although the staff were helpful. Location was fab very central.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for a long weekend-June 14-18, 2007. Pros: GREAT location (walking distance to everything), quiet, friendly, good shower, good housekeeping Cons: room shabby (carpet/paint), 13" TV, small elevators, no concierge(bellman do that job), blew fuses with hairdryer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful property, very well located. Terrifically bad service. Housekeeping "missed" our room one day. Attitude from hotel operator when approached with small requests. Unprofessional, rude service in downstairs cafe/piano area in evening. Would not recommend to anyone expecting 5* service for price. Beautiful, but shallow...  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice environment. Clean bathroom and rooms. Close to Central Park.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms. Very expensive but then its New York. Good location though. The bathroom was tiny.  [END]
[BEGIN] Currently staying at Grand Hyatt not so grand housekeeping lets the team down ..location great, marketplace in lobby wonderful always hot coffee. But certainly the amount of mould in our bathroom is disappointing to say the least. Rooms are very dark so make sure you set your alarm.  [END]
[BEGIN] No frills but great location, clean and quiet. Other reviewers have complained about the size of the rooms, but ours had room for a queen bed, desk, dresser, 2 end tables, and a comfortable chair. Hotels across the street cost twice as much.  [END]
[BEGIN] everything was exceptional! I absolutely loved it and will be back as soon as I can! Great hospitality  [END]
[BEGIN] bon emplacement. bonne table. j'ai sejourne la bas pour affaires y retournerai pour les vacances. aux pieds de time square, staff agreable.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel sin mantenimiento regular atencion,habitaciones comodas limpieza regular esta viejo es un tres estrellas.aire acondicionado algo ruidoso y pagamos caro por una suiteel lobby en reformas,internet te cobran  [END]
[BEGIN] What I look for in a hotel room is comfort but I didn't find that here. The Rafaello is quite small and old to me. The service received was great, very friendly staff, but it stops there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Aria condizionata rumorosissima, posizione spettacolare!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have a party more than two forget it, rooms in europe are larger... Not even enough room to set your luggage down, cab rides will eat up any value pay the extra money and stay in times square or broadway district  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent hotel, no major perks, good location. No major plusses or minuses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the location is good for getting downtown, and although there's a great seafood restaurant close by (Goode's) the minimal fitness center was a disappointment. As always the staff is terrific.  [END]
[BEGIN] rooms are cramped... i dont know how other reviewers can claim the rooms are large. the bed was the weakest point---the mattresses are cheap, springy, and motel quality. breakfast was surprisingly good. it is alacarte rather than a buffet. service throughout is excellent. very cheery and personable staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ideal para tres personas.Muy ruidoso. Comodisima la kitchenet  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at this hotel for a week last month, and depending on who was on duty, the level of service went from exemplary to mediocre at best. The limited menu, meant I looked for other dining options elsewhere!  [END]
[BEGIN] Literally the slowest internet I've experienced in years. I felt as if I was using dial up when I tried to use my laptop in my room. It wouldn't connect all day and when it finally did not a single page would open. Everything else was okay, but not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] You're paying for the location. The hotel is walking distance from many sights in midtown. The hotel itself is decent. The bed was comfortable but the bathroom was the size of a closet and I saw a dead cockroach on the floor!  [END]
[BEGIN] Lumpy old beds, thin walls, small bathroom, old decor... The location is great and this compensates for their shortcomings, but there are better hotels in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Confort tres moyen si vous etes habitues a sejourner chez Hilton et courtoisie de base a la reception.... Vicky, concierge, a ete remarquable, souriante et nous a permis de nous sentir bien dans cet hotel. Un grand merci a elle!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean for a moderate priced room. Great location. Very small rooms. It's only a place to to sleep and shower. Very Spartan but functional and convenient. If you must be in NYC and your not rich, this place will do the job nicely. Management and staff really try hard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location good room size but bathrooms are awful this hotel need a major refurb  [END]
[BEGIN] You pay extra for the convenience of the hotel being next to the airport, but the hotel needs a good overhaul. Nothing seemed to work in our room.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was very courteous & friendly. Rooms were very average & mostly clean. The selling point is the location. Very near lots of restaurants, shops, transportation. Nice bar/lounge in the lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overall, experience was fine, but...check in service was inattentive and unhelpful, and rooms had not been cleaned thoroughly. Not worth spg upgrade points, just go a couple thousand more points and stay at the st Regis. And finally, the westin pillows are TERRIBLE. Ridiculous how small and flat they are.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel room was great. Checking in with Sara, however, was certainly not. You would think that a place like this could afford to pay a more courteous staff! We will stay elsewhere next time we are in Chicago.  [END]
[BEGIN] Located not to far away from Grand Central, this is a nice location. The hotel is ok for business, but we paid 320 per night. Ok room. my collegues were not too happy with their rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly staff, unique lobby and bar area, block from Broadway and Time Square. But, oh my can the rooms in NYC possibly get smaller than these, I hope not, it was hard to turn around in the room. I had to walk in forward and back out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lobby great Staff helpful Rooms old and outdated  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent quality/price ratio. Small very basic room with basically no proper window, but clean. Big problem the air conditioning. It's just too noisy to keep it on during the night. Not a big issue until temperatures raise too much in july-august...  [END]
[BEGIN] abbiamo trovato quello che ci aspettavamo, camera grande e spaziosa, ottima vista sulla 49a al piano alto, gentili, disponibili. preciso il servizio di transert per il jfk dall'hotel. certo avrebbe bisogno di qualche aggiusto ma la vita era fuori non nell'albergo...quindi...buon viaggio  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are small but the location more then makes up for it. Tic Tok food was just okay, and staff of course rude.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed my 2day stay here until I saw they overcharged me after a Pre paid for my room. Be careful when checking in cuz they may pull one over your eyes. Other then that the rooms were cool and I liked how the windows open for fresh air.  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Hotal war sauber und ordentlich. Das Personal serh unfreunldlich. Aber wenn man in New York ist, braucht man das Zimmer nur zum schalfen :)  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was very small - average for Japan standards - but clean and neat. Interesting touch with the fill-it-yourself water bottles at the end of the hallway. Reasonable restaurant and common area. OK for business; lobby area has some quiet space for phone calls.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms dirty toilet not good smells.they don't clean it very well or the room it's dirty Only good thing is they put lovely sheets on the bed. Its a very noisy hotel as well we will never stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is clean and accomodating. I did not expect much for the price but was pleasantly surprised. I will stay here again if Im in the area. I reccomend this hotel if you are on a budget and are looking for a clean friendly place to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very nice but very modern. If you are looking for comfy, cozy this is not the place for you. The rooms are very nice and spacious and everything is very clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thanks Nathalie for your great service. Rooms are super tiny and a little hard to maneuver, especially for a business trip, but the service is above average for NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel, perfect location, fabulous beds and pillows!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was okay - location good - staff uncaring and inattentive  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms basic. Need updating. Old TV's. The sink in my room was in the bedroom. Heating/cooling system was noisy. Room service food was ok, not great. The garage very grungy. When I was checking in someone was complaining about filthy sheets and glasses in their room. Internet costs $12.95/day  [END]
[BEGIN] Montse (34), Barcelona Location is the best the hotel has, apart from that, rooms (we were staying in the 17th floor) were very dark and dull. I forgot my favourite pyjamas under the pillow, and has never been found!! That added a black note in my holidays.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buonissima la posizione a due passi dall'Empire State Building, ma le camere sono molto antiquate, come un po' tutto l'hotel...i fan-coil (aria condizionata) avranno avuto 200 anni ed erano rumorosissimi  [END]
[BEGIN] The Strand is a good hotel for a reasonable price. Rooms are nice although a bit small. The breakfast is average. Not a lot of choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] PLUSES - Excellent beds (saved my back and my stay) - Location (near Grand Central, 5th Avenue and Times Square) -Nice, new televisions -Charming, old lobby MINUSES - It's an old building with loose handles, unclosable windows/doors etc. -No coffee makers/kettle or minibar/fridge -Bar prices HIGH!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice place, clean. But our room was very small and tight. Would probably not stay here again unless there is a great rate. Elevators are small and slow too.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff seemed resentful of the fact they had guests to work with... The extra bed was terrible and we couldn't get any help to sort it. Two very dissapointed children just wanted to go home.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location on the N Michigan close to shops and restaurants. Older hotel that could use some renovation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel for the price. Rooms were small but clean and adequate. Nice, quiet residential neighborhood but still within blocks of restaurants and Central Park. Staff was friendly and helpful. Would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed here in march 2012. had a fantastic trip to chicago and this hotel was in a perfect location. the rooms are basic but for me its just somewhere to sleep and shower. id deffo stay here again if i return to chicago in the future.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is clean and enough for staying on tourist purpose!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is a great deal if you are looking for a well located and friendly place to stay. The rooms are not impressive, but they match the price charged and most of the staff is really Nice and thoghtfull. I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is pleasant, room was a good size but everything looked like it needed to be cleaned more or updated. The location is central and the staff was nice. Pay TV did not work - bummer for the kids!! We would go back to NY but not necesarily this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] We received room on 3rd floor and room was small compared to other average hotels i've stayed. However it is in a very good location and central to most NYC landmarks. Within 20 minute walk you can reach most if not all attractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was clean and affordable. The location was appopriate for my needs. The internet speed was OK but not outstanding  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is a typical Courtyard. The breakfast was great and the staff was great. The rooms and hotel itself are fine. Nothing more, nothing less. For business travel the rate and the accomodations are fair. Can't go wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location at Times Square. Room size good compared with most New York City hotels of this grade. Good service and friendly staff. Every place we wanted to visit in New York City was within walking distance!  [END]
[BEGIN] Timesquare is the best place to stay but the room in Crowne Plaza was a little stuffy, not very relaxing. The fact that it was centrally located was good but the experience of the stay was not very warm  [END]
[BEGIN] I frequent Marriott hotels whenever I can. Overall this hotel's lobby and location are its strong points. The rooms were a bit smaller than I expected but not too much different from other hotels in large cities. All the staff I can in contact with were pleasant and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] A lot of street noise (waste collectors on 32nd Street at around 3AM almost every night). Nice and friendly staff. Basic breakfast. Location great but would consider to be further away from mid town and close to subway next NY visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location was very good and beds were ok. The smell in the room was horrible and the floor was wet in front of the window.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best thing about this hotel is its excellent location in Midtown Manhattan (Lexington Ave). Rooms are clean and comfortable, but not outstanding.  [END]
[BEGIN] per il costo giornalierodelle stanze si potrebbe aumentate i servizi come la colazione inclusa,internet gratis. la posizione dell'hotel e ottima sia per affari che per piacere lo consiglio,ma include la colazione se si puo,rischio di pagare 24 dollari a testa per la colazione ed il servizio non e un granche'.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfekt avstand till alla faciliteter p[ Manhattan. Tyvarr en bedrovlig frukost som inte bor kallas det. Dar maste hotellet lara av andra vad en frukst betyder. Ett stort plus till personalen .Mycket servicevilliga.  [END]
[BEGIN] I used to stay here regularly about 7-8 years ago. I was back for the first time since then. Great location but in need of some nips and tucks. Older, feeling a bit stuffy and gloomy. Nice people - very friendly. Independent hotel - not part of any chains.  [END]
[BEGIN] HOTEL SALISBURY, CONVENIENTE PER POSIZIONE CENTRALE,STANZE CON SALOTTO CON GRANDE TV LCD E CAMERA DA LETTO CON TV LCD E LETTI MOLTO COMODI E BUON PREZZO. NOTE NEGATIVE HOTEL VECCHIOTTO CHE HA BISOGNO DI UNA RISTRUTTURAZIONE E COLAZIONE CONTINENTALE, NON ALL'AMERICANA. COMUNQUE IDEALE PER LE FAMIGLIE MENO PER LE COPPIE  [END]
[BEGIN] 45th St between Times Sq and 5th Avenue - convenient to walk lots of places, and friendly Deli next door for breakfast. Room a bit small and no teamaking facilities. Safe storage $5 for luggage after checking out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Godt hotel men gammelt. Rigtig god service og beliggenhed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was very nice and helpful. The location was great. The rooms are a bit small and could be a little cleaner but I have seen much worse.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good city location, and although the service was very good, the hotel was only so-so.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly staff. Very small (5x7) rooms. Unbelievably unique bar. I'd complain about the prices if it weren't for it's location. If your not ready for small, small spaces with big, big prices, then the West Village is not for you. Overall, The Jane was a good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lovely hotel, bedrooms had microwave, fridge and coffee machine. Recommended a fabulous restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel. Fantastic location! The hotel was fully booked. I checked in at 8:30 pm and was unfortunate that my room had been used by a day time guest before my arrival. The room had not been cleaned before my arrival. Other than that, great hotel!  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was very vast which was nice! I think the price could have included more amenities. Clean, decor was alright. The location is practical as it is close to GCT.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel bene ubicato centro di New York,Camere un po piccole non molto rifinite ,pulizia cosi cosi. Buon prezzo.  [END]
[BEGIN] An average hotel, old bathroom but clean. Noisy, but where in NYC will it be quiet? Watch it when you want to make use of the Wifi, they are charging you per day AND per device! This is a pure ripoff!  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel di design simpatico, puro stile starck, apprezzabile per ragazzi amanti del divertimento notturno, ma improponibile per coloro che amano vivere la camera, quanto meno quella standard dalle dimensioni improponibilmente piccole! comunque da vivire, assolutamente!  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was fine, the staff was very friendly, but the bed need to change the confortes some was old and have holds and the bed give me ichthy at night...  [END]
[BEGIN] My stay was OK. Quality of service was excellent. I had few specific request and there were properly managed. I had booked a top floor but was not higher than 6th floor. The street where the hotel is located is a litlle dodgy at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel itself is good but once you step out of it do not turn right because the scenery changes completely and you find yourself in an area not to be expected near a four star place .The internet service in the lobby is good.The restaurant is expensive  [END]
[BEGIN] The O'Hare Hilton is an older, tired looking hotel. It is average in almost every respect. However, if, as is often the case for me, you have a layover at O'Hare, it is a good place to grab a quick night's sleep, as the hotel is connected to the terminals.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location was excellent rest was horrible, rooms very old lobby very noisy and long que for checkin. But you can find everything in the neighborhood from dining to shopping , transport everything avlb nearby  [END]
[BEGIN] Altough we had a room in the (really really) old section of the hotel, we were lucky that we got a large suite. The rooms were dark, but as you're in New York we didn't mind to much. Daylight couldn't come in, but neither did any other light :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Location! Room was dated and very no-frills but cleaned daily. Nowdays i noticed they charge quite a bit less than they did in 2007 so for the money you're paying i would recommend this hotel. NYC hotels are so expensive and you'd rather spend your money shopping:)  [END]
[BEGIN] Greit hotel med sentral beliggenhet, gangavstand til det meste. Hotellet er litt slitt men helt ok. Gode senger , hyggelig betjening, ryddig og rent. Perfekt med bagels kiosk over veien og Starbucks coffe i lobbyen for oss som aldri rekker frokost.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very disappointed with my stay at this hotel. The only advantage is the great location! Other than that it's old, run down over-priced and disappointing. The room wasn't clean, the linen torn and the bathroom should be renovated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Closed to many restaurants, cafes and short distance from many tourist atracctions.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel sencillo, pero muy bien ubicado. Desayuno pobre, habitaciones sencillas pero limpias Los botenes demasiado amables a diferencia del personal de recepcion  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good: swimming pool, location, kindness of staff Could be better: breakfast, noise in the room, onion smell early in the morning  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a room... nothing great. Basic furnishing. Small bathroom. Comfy beds. Nice size flat screen. It served my purpose because it was close to the theater district but not right in theTimes Square craziness. There are some great restaurants nearby. We enjoyed Bobby Van's Steakhouse.  [END]
[BEGIN] La stanza era spaziosa, il bagno adeguato, le pulizie buone. Forse il rumore era un po' eccessivo, c'era una specie di rumore continuo, forse dei motori dei condizionatori, e sentivamo parlare i nostri vicini di stanza. Il personale era piuttosto freddo e sbrigativo, nella maggior parte dei casi.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel posizionato vicino all'Empire State Building, la posizione permette un facile accesso alle varie zone della citta, metropolitana a poca distanza. Costo medio, abbastanza tranquillo, buona pulizia, no internet free, non serve la prima colazione ma intorno ci sono diversi posti per la prima colazione. Personale disponibile e cordiale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location in Times Square, and an attractive, new hotel with nice suite rooms; but the walls are so thin that we could hear conversations in adjoining rooms. An unfortunate flaw in an otherwise very nice suite hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Park Savoy is pretty basic. The room is small but functional; the same is true for the bathroom. What it lacks in charm and character it makes up for in price and location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value for its location and very spacious room. Within walking distance to Chinatown. The room is very basic but free WiFi is a plus!  [END]
[BEGIN] Huge hotel, too much wait at the elevators, long hallways. Good breakfast though, ask for a room near the elevators.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was just fine. Nothing fancy, no complaints. Clean, staff was helpful, internet didn't work, but we used an unsecured link instead of the Best Western one and it worked. Ate at the attached restaurant for breakfast and everything was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] A very good location,close to Macy's and the Empire State,if you are not going to spend any time in your hotel room and you do not mind cramped conditions then this hotel is fine bit no room to put cases etc and very claustrophobic.  [END]
[BEGIN] unser zimmer war wohl eines der kleinsten ging aber hinten raus deshalb sehr ruhig nicht viel komfort aber sehr sauber gemeinschaftsbad wurde oft gereinigt super lage fuer den preis perfekt wuerden es wieder buchen wegen lage preis u.ruhe  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks OK and well located. A group of us were staying and the general feedback was the same - tired rooms in need of updating. Bathrooms particularly small. Staff good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good: Fantastic view from the room and a super location. Bad: Being forced to pay for Internet is very bad Paying for things in the Club Lounge is not part of good service  [END]
[BEGIN] must say the hotel was in a great spot. plenty of eating places in this area ( little italy chinatown )rooms are very small like most in NY. Our breakfast was allways cold .the staff were allways helpful. Brilliant area to stay in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prima locatie vlakbij metrostation. Ruime kamers. Wel lekkende douchekraan, stinkende gangen en minimaal anderhalf uur wachten als je aankomt om in te checken. Dat is toch allemaal wel wat minder. Uitchecken gaat wel lekker vlot.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a nice hotel, but it was too spendy for what you received. First complaint, wireless was not free. Seriously? Room was pretty small. Other than that, the room was nice and location with being right on Michigan Avenue was very convenient!  [END]
[BEGIN] We loved NYC, but felt the "Mike" was a bit ordinary for the price. The location is great, byt the staff was pretty ho-hum about everything from checking in, to AM hot coffee, to PM bar. Our first time stayting there.we wont be back  [END]
[BEGIN] It was an OK Hotel, Hard to find at first so write down the address! Nice lobby and bar but rooms are small. I had a large room and it was still small. Free Wi-fi in Lobby only. 3.5 / 5  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great, lobby is nice, the beds were comfortable. That's about it. The hotel was clean but the rooms and hallways need updating. We paid $400 for one night, ridiculous. Will NOT return here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our stay at the 91 Hotel was really good. Rooms were tidy, not too much noise from the nearby bridge, close to subway stations etc. Good value for your money!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel's location was awsome. Great private room with shower for low price. Excellent value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, but room and amenities are somewhat dated. In their defense they are remodeling through 2013. The staff was very nice. The location is within easy walking distance of Central Park, Times Square, or Rockerfeller plaza.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room smelled like stale cigarettes. But, we opened the windows and burned a candle when we were in the room which helped alot. Property is clean and staff is friendly. Mattress needs to be replaced... big dip in the middle of the bed. Location is very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Un po' scomodo in quanto lontano dalla metro ma ottimo rapporto qulita' prezzo! Le camere un po' piccole ma abbastanza pulite. La colazione abbastanza completa con dolce e salato, posto forse un po' piccolo. Va benissimo per chi ha intenzione di vivere new york e non l'Albergo!  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed in Park 79 Hotel for 6 nights. The room was small, but clean and overall satisfactory, the price in consideration. Busses and metro is close by, and plenty of good restaurants in the neighborhood.  [END]
[BEGIN] Price is very reasonable, service in the breakfast area was outstanding. Room is quite basic but good for the price of the room and clean enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] splendida posizione --personale professionale e gentile--bel patio per colazione e terrazzo per la cena--camere essenziali con arredamento di gusto e pulizia--fermata del metro linea 6 a 200 metri--da consigliare vivamente  [END]
[BEGIN] 2nd stay. Hotel is well located but dont expecte too much. room was musty but you re not in NYC for the hotel rooms!  [END]
[BEGIN] Was a very good place. Now just average except for great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, comfortable beds, relatively clean. Downsides - rooms too small, work out room too small w/ not enough equipment. No swimming pool or complimentary coffee in lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was in New York during Hurricane Sandy and at the Shoreham hotel they made our stay there an enjoyable one. Staff really helpful and kind. Herri was fantastic, always there to please. Will go there again. Location was excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great ( near Time Square) and you can get a nice price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location was the primary reason for selecting this hotel. Price reflected the convenience. Room was clean and comfortable. Exceptionally quiet for NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] We only stayed here for one night. It was the only "reasonable" place that would sleep 4 in one room. No bugs. clean room. no complaints. front desk was nice enought, not rude. God Bless America, Land of the Free and Home of the Brave!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is super trendy. You'll like it if that is what you are into. Our room was tiny - the double bed took up all of the floor space. It felt VERY crowded with two people. I wouldn't choose to stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Le personnel a la reception sont agreables et serviables et n'hesitent pas a parler francais aussi bien a l'hotel qu'au restaurant. Les chambres sont spacieuses et propres bon service de nettoyage efficace et discret. Deco un peu viellote, pas de chaine TV en francais.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location on Manhattan. A bit old fashioned and not recently redecorated but with a certain charm.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for a few nights, and the hotel is very good located. Very big hotel with a lot of rooms. It is a bit old but ok. The price was a bit expensive for the fact that it is a medium hotel. Staff was friendly and helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed for five days. would definately recommend to others as it is well located and cheap. I think my necklace was stolen from the room so put valuables in the safe provided. It is noisy too - but I can sleep through anything. I would go back here.  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked this hotel due to its centrally location. This is a nice hotel with happy smiling receptionist. We got our room facing Empire State Building. Room was small but was clean. Breakfast was basic but we liked it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was very nice. Very convienent to downtown shopping and Navy Pier. The only downfall was the rooms do not have air conditioning just heat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in the Paramount during a girly holiday to NYC. Excellent location so close to Time Square, but the room is very small and air conditioning noisy. Plus bar and restaurant quite expensive. Good value if all you want is a base but not very luxurious.  [END]
[BEGIN] The view was GREAT! The room lacked.... One of the tiles in tiles in the bathroom shower was broken and the room just looked old. I expected more for $600 a night, but I guess I paid for location and the view!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been staying in Edison before and the combination of price and location makes it my favourite in New York  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel is definitely for the hip crowd- very noisy- dark - all the staff dresses in black rooms are miniscule courtyard bar is lovely bu tloud as are all the bars  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok. It was cheap kinda dirty but for NYC at that price it is worth it. I have been told it has been refurbished since my visit not sure if it has made much of a difference. The location is AMAZING!  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small and old, ac does not work very well. Breakfast it is expensive for the offer! The location it is very good. No minibar and wifi it is paid. Cleanliness it is good. They have a Starbucks cafe in the lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not worth what we had to pay for this. Had to stay there for a convention/work function. Air Conditioning was HORRIBLE. Our room never got down past 72 degrees. The double bathrooms were nice!  [END]
[BEGIN] Location fantastic just off Time Square. Staff pleasant, room very clean with excellent maid service. Nice lobby. Paid extra for superior queen room and although nicely made out it was really small - just enough room to walk around bed and tiny half wardrobe - bit of a disappointment.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel ok, stanze un po' piccole e rumorose, arredamento claustrofobico e di cattivo gusto il frigo a pagamento come gli snack con tanto di bilancia elettronica.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want excellent customer service then I would recommend this hotel but unfortunately the room didn't meet the same standards. The smell in the room was fairly unpleasent. However, saying that the hotel is situated in a great location within all major tourist attractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit pricey (I assume this reflects the location), but comfortable. Greeted with a smile even at the early hours of the morning at which we arrived. The little diner/cafe downstairs fit the bill for breakfast the next day. All in all a positive experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] We got a really good price via priceline; nice view of new york city; Located in front of "world trade center" A block from Century 21; Subway station on the corner; Big rooms; Clean; No bed bugs; Good service; it's a (low) 4 stars hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was nice and historic, but the rooms need updating. The front desk staff was very nice and helpful. Restaurants closed earlier than I expected they would. Good location, within walking distance of Times Square, Grand Central Station, and Central Park.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, friendly staff. Unusual but quirky decor works ok and the lounge is very pleasant, serving drinks and snacks al day. The room was very small and the supposedly double bed would not fit anyone over four feet or fifty kilos - a shame as otherwise a good find  [END]
[BEGIN] I'll be reviewer # 1,000 to comment on the size of the room. Wow. My husband and I literally could not both stand up in the room at the same time. I would recommend coming to hang out in their fabulous restaurants and bars and staying somewhere else.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is a no frills one as a good cafe for breakfast ,rooms where very small even for two people not that clean either .but the location was spot on right across the road central park ten minutes walk and your slap bang in time square.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a nice location. The staff was pleasant, the room had a horrible odor of cigarette smoke that was all in the covers. Overall, the room was clean. Just glad it was only for one night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is in a very good location, nearby several subway lines. Hotel is clean, staff friendly. Mattress was worn out, wifi reception bad. Standing at the door wifi was good (closer to front desk?), in the room itself most of the times no reception.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was clean, but very small. If you just want a clean safe room to sleep in it is OK. Not a lot of things close by.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a nice place, almost front of MSG. Just this. Room was so small and bath should be refurbishe. I'm sure its possible to find another hotel, cheaper e better.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are interested in the Chicago Public Library, the Chicago Art Institute, the Field Museum and the Shedd Aquarium, this hotel is superbly located. Otherwise, you'd probably prefer a hotel further North. The staff is very helpful but the hotel needs a good renovation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel nuovo, ma non ben congeniato... Le camere sono molto piccole. Manca di bidet e di armadio!!! Incredibile a dirsi! Consiglio questo hotel solamente a chi sa bene accamparsi o per brevi soggiorni! Ah, portatevi qualche appendino per gli abiti da casa! ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] 199 a night so not too espensive. Bed comfortable. Restaurant boring with unimaginative food. However, business was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] My staying was almomst good but the water pressure of the shower was very week, it was like a drizzle. I've asked to front clerks twice during my stay but it's not been fixed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is very good. One block from Grand Central, 5 blocks from the Rockefeller center and 5 minutes walk from the Times Square. The price is reasonable for New York. THe staff is friendly and the hotel is clean, but has seen better days.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed in September and still lots of new hotel issues: No room service No mini bar Gym not yet open Also, check in at 4pm and the jacuzzi baths in the rooms are half the size of a normal bath and so are pointless  [END]
[BEGIN] staff were very helpful and friendly and the hotel was ideally situated for Time square,central park etc ,i would stay at this hotel again ,The only snag was the net curtains were filthy and the doors in the room were dirty ,  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location close to Broadway and uptown. Rooms were not as clean as could have wished - it seemed the bed linen had not been changed. Hotel was often visited by police to check for drugs. Suite contains kitchen which is really nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel - more than we needed -right in the center of Times Square - if you want action right place - a little too plastic - a little too much Love their properties this just happen to be one of our favorites  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was ok, although I spent twenty minutes trying to check out. Apparently the bell doesn't work. Bathroom had mold and mildew in the tub. Everything else was ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, right on Times Sqaure!! Small rooms but you don't spend much time there! Worth the money due to convenience of location!  [END]
[BEGIN] For the money, I think there are much nicer hotels in NYC. I was not impressed with the staff, and the rooms were small and drab. I prefer The Hudson or the W. Would not stay here again!  [END]
[BEGIN] cerca de todo, un poco inpersonal pero en general bien.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this hotel, is not a luxury one, but it is comfortable and the concierges were extremely helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] groot maar prima hotel. Beetje ouwe inrichting en sanitair maar vind ik niet erg. Geen wifi op de kamer en dat vind ik wel erg. 1 uur gewacht bij check in en dat vind ik ook erg. Verder prima. Lieve mensen in kamerbediening en ook bij receptie.  [END]
[BEGIN] Novotel Times Square New York is a super location to visit New York. The hotel is clean, staff indifferent, service OK. Bar and Lobby very nice to have a drink. Terrace superb. I think Wi-Fi should be free to paying guests - in this day and age.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me and my wife stayed in Hotel 373 for 5 nights. The hotel is good and rooms are ok. Small but cosy. Everything is clean inluding the bathrooms. We just had a problem: no hot water for the last two days....  [END]
[BEGIN] I think this W has been around for awhile - although they are trying to maintain the quality, it is obvious that this place needs a reno. Good location, right in the heart of times square. Staff very friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really appreciated the friendliness of Henry Strait and Aurelia Gaskin. They were working the front desk when we arrived late and tired. They were extremely efficient and attentive.  [END]
[BEGIN] this is a great location with updated rooms//they badly need ventilation revamps and bathroom updates//if you have allergies or breathing issues reconsider staying here//but it was cheap and clean, and the staff was friendly and efficient!  [END]
[BEGIN] This was the worst hotel we stayed in on our visit to the USA. Beds were too big for the room although comfortable,just not enough room for suitcase and to walk around. house maids very nice. Concierge not very helpful. I wouldn't stay here again or recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really not too bad (especially after reading other reviews), good price, good location, nice pool. The room was a good size and the front desk person helpful. There was a faint cigarette odor in our no smoking room. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottima la posizione.Stanza (standard) microscopica ..eravamo in 2 e nn potevamo nemmeno muoverci.Secondo me c'e' di meglio...buona fortuna!  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is ok, no thrills. Room was clean with all the basic amenities, clean towels every day. Breakfast was ok nothing special. Gym is a small room with 4 threadmills and a TV. Thin walls could hear the other guests TV's through the wall.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff. Clean room. Excellent bed. Very good value. Close to subway for direct trip to museum mile or to Soho. However, it is noisy. Air conditioner/heater unit is a window unit and the windows are single pane. Therefore, even 11 stories up the street noise is appreciable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is good, great location. They go for a European vibe, which is not your standard "American" hotel experience. The staff is great. I stayed there almost weekly for over a year and the bell men, especially Daniel on the morning shift, took good care of me.  [END]
[BEGIN] rooms are clean and tidy.great location.free internet with printer on 2nd floor.breakfest menu exellent.plenty to choose from.close to most sites.staff very friendly.nice area outside to sit and have a drink.would def go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great rates for this location. Staff very helpful. Spacious rooms, but the whole hotel needs a deep cleaning. Prices at lounge and restaurants are expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] No dresser drawer unit, garage sale quality chair (1), small bath room space and facilities. Soft bed. Courteous staff. Quiet. Clean. Overpriced. Select Drury instead/next time.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok location not too far to alk to circle line boat cruise, times square. room comfortable and good size. great breakfast in the coffee pot only 1 block away. not 5 star but adequate ina fantastic city. good bars and restaurants close by, staff helpfull.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked with hotwire over a month ago. When booked I emailed hotel about upgrade. Did the upgrade and requested for a nice view and high floor. Received neither. We are on the lowest floor and facing the back of the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice lobby, quick check-in, poor standard of the room, worst of all the bed bugs. I got a huge bite on my foot second night...really ugly and itchy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Um hotel simples mas eficiente,o check-in nada complicado. O rapaz da recepcao Jonathan,sempre eficiente e cortez. Os quartos limpos,numa boa localizacao,com certeza na minha proxima estada ficarei no mesmo hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here because it was close to a college my daughter was visiting. The hotel is very nice, up-scale, kinda artisy. However, not many families stay here. Unless you really like the location, you should look for another hotel if you are bring the family to the City.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel, good price but parking is expensive $32/day  [END]
[BEGIN] 3.5/5 +In the heart of NY! +Clean Rooms, comfortable beds -Very small rooms -Expensive -Expensive charges (wifi, roomservice etc)  [END]
[BEGIN] The W should stand for Why? why are you mopping tread mills at 6:45 AM and not drying them? Why Invite the guest to coffee and then charge for it? Why is the hotel so unhip? 80's are over, get back to serving your business cliental.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel Metro was in a good location, one block away from Macys. Great views of the Empire State Building at night from the roof terrace. Good selection of breakfast items, which are included in the price of the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got back today and found the hotel very comfortable with lovely comfy bed. Breakfast was basic but nice to start the day. The reception staff were not that friendly which spoilt it a bit. The best thing by far was the location, Superb.  [END]
[BEGIN] watch out for the internet charges! they ripped me off big time - charged me $20 for internet use that didn't work. Not impressed. Otherwise great location and next door to a pub! you can't ask for more than that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not up to other JW Marriotts I've stayed at. Public spaces seem to be in need of renovation. Restaurant closed, in favor of dining at lobby bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic location very close to Central Park + Subway station. Friendly staff at reception. Dirty bathroom at arrival and during our stay! Breakfast room small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was nice and clean. Rooms a bit small but no complaints as we did not spend much time in the room. Very close to metro. Friendly staff On the edge of Soho more in China town. Air conditioning worked great and was needed for August.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool trendy hotel, but very small rooms, and not very modern. The hotel has had a light refurbishment, but still has far to go  [END]
[BEGIN] Ligging v.h. hotel is prima, ontbijt ruim voldoende maar te weinig zitplaatsen zodat je soms moet wachten. 3 persoons kamer veel te klein en benauwd, geen daglicht. Schoonmaken kan beter. Service van het personeel is prima.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small hotel with small but renovated rooms. Free breakfast. Nice area with a lot of restaurants and walking distance to many tourist attractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was half the price of a similar midrange hotel. The rooms were big and comfortable and the location is great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was in town for work and needed to be on the upper west side. Location was great. Close to subway and nice block. The room was tiny (by NY standards), faucet was loose, radiator clanked but i booked online for $130. It was fine but nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Average Hotel nothing special rooms are adequate but small. Make sure to get a room with a view. The Hotels location is excellent thats it !  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel for the price. Good location. Rooms are very small and lifts are very slow. Only problem was with drainage in the bath/shower which was incredibly slow!  [END]
[BEGIN] The smaller rooms are not recommended. Oversized and ugly furniture, after a recent decoration program, leave you to wonder whose girlfriend was chosen to do this hotel. Kimpton usually delivers, this one doesn't. No harm in staying here as long as your expectations are low.  [END]
[BEGIN] We justed wanted a clean, inexpensive, comfortable place to stay and we got it. The conceirge was very helpful, even provided us with umbrellas.  [END]
[BEGIN] i recently stayed at the Hilton New York for a conference. The room was spacious, location convenient and the staff helpful. However, the decor was tired and bathroom fittings needed repairs. My colleague's room also needed repairs to the fittings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Noisy. Lack of services close to hotel. No gift shop or newstand in hotel. Food expensive in hotel with little choice. I was with a person with a cane and we couldn't walk 6 blocks to find food or services.  [END]
[BEGIN] camera piccola ma pulita, ideale per pochi giorni a new york e per chi sta tutto il giorno in giro. centralissimo a 2 passi da time square colazione a buffet a soli 9,90 dollari a buffet, molto conveniente  [END]
[BEGIN] I wholeheartedly second the previous reviewer's observations. Nice looking lobby but the rooms just doesn't add up to what you see from the outside. Could have paid half the price for exactly the same at a low end hotel chain -if I pay more I expect more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good rate at this simple business hotel. Like the easy wifi connection with came with the room. Staff was ok but not very friendly. Would stay again but didnt compare favorable with a much larger room at only 50 more a night with The Wit.  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel has a great location, bang opposite penn station. Also it is fantastic value for money for a family as they have apartment styled rooms which can sleep 4 people. These rooms have 2 bathrooms and a kitchenette.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is advisable for those who want to stay inside The Loop, although there isn't good support for feeding, mainly at late night. The rooms are very tight and a small refrigerator would be very useful.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place looks ugly. The hallways look terrible. If it wasn't because of spending these nights with my friends, I'd kill myself.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room $199 (discounted conference rate) Parking $52.00 per day! Internet wifi $40.00 per day! Spacious rooms, good bed, nice marble tile floor in bathroom, with a 12 inch diameter area of MOLD on the shower curtain. (Room 702) Confusing layout between two towers. Money can be better spent elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Receptionists were unfriendly and not helpful at all. Rooms were not very clean. Don't try to sleep late, the noise of cleaners or workers will wake you up. The upside is the location is good and the welcome chocolate chips cookie is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] An old hotel with plenty of charm that borderlines in dated. Close to the action but quiet. Staff is super nice and eager to solve any problem, but it's hard to get over the small, dark room, with old furniture. Excellent internet and very nice bath amenities.  [END]
[BEGIN] rooms clean but very small for the price we had to pay. booked online ended up paying much more than was quoted. even got charged $42 for 2 people for a small breakfast we wont be going back  [END]
[BEGIN] el hotel es antiguo pero tiene muy buena ubicacion, calidad de precio, y como casi no nos llevabamos en el hotel solo llegabamos ad escansar nos parecio muy accesible, frente a madison square garden. un hotel muy amplio, tiene varias entradas nos parecio muy bien.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had bad luck. We arrived at 3 am and the computer had failed. No booking was possible. The desk manager organized a room in another hotel. The costs have been reimbursed in full.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was decent. My major gripe is that the beds were rock hard. It was like sleeping on the ground. The rooms seemed clean but on my last night there was a mysterious wet spot on the carpet beside the bed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location hard to beat. Hotel within walking distance of great shopping and dining. Expectations were not met with room. Decor was really dated and budget quality but room was clean and bed comfortable. Stay was okay but too many other options downtown! Be prepared to spend $45/ day to park.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed one night for local event, clean basic hotel, with great staff.The view was an alley. The tv was great but obstructed with a wall.No spa , room service etc, but good basic hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] This has a great location, friendly staff, and clean room. The only thing I did not like was that the room was the smallest hotel room I have stayed at in New York. In spite of that, I would go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Albergo originale e curato in ottima posizione, stanze piccole ma confortevoli, personale cortese con un unico ENORME neo: di notte il riscaldamento centralizzato sembra percosso da scimmie impazzite con lunghe spranghe metalliche. Ora...se avete il sonno leggero lasciate stare altrimenti lo consiglio.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely located but atmosphere only just OK. Maybe because they were renovating their restaurant, just not all that impressed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, average rooms, can be noisy if on the lower rooms, NYC trash collectors are the noisest I've ever heard! And they start very early, so beware. Room OK, clean, very small bathroom!!  [END]
[BEGIN] - Need Coffee pots in room. -Mattress was very hard and uncomfortable. -No Restaurant or Room Service. -Air Conditioner was noisey and inadequate coverage. -Need microwaves in room or more in hotel. -Need refrigerators in room.  [END]
[BEGIN] I prefer Embassy Suites when I travel, both on business & pleasure. The 2 room suites plus free breakfast is great deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zeer gunstig gelegen hotel, tegenover Penn Station. Onderhoud en housekeeping zou wat beter kunnen, maar de ligging maakt veel, zo niet alles goed. Met de trein in een klein half uur van JFK naar hartje Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Apart from the amazing location, which this hotel charges a lot for, it is not a great experience. Everything, and I mean everything, costs extra. Checking out is not a peasant experience when you are hit with such a large bill  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a fantastic location and the rooms are nice. However as with most central hotels the rooms are pretty small and it is noisey but not very noisey. Good staff but the only real reason to stay here is the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank god i only had to stay here for 2 nights. Way too far and too sketchy of a neighborhood. Would pay more per night for a closer and nicer hotel any day of the week. Don't stay here if your claustrophobic rooms are about 400 square feet.  [END]
[BEGIN] staff cordiale e attento come al solito negli Stati Uniti, essendo abituati poi alla scarsa professionalita' del personale degli hotel italiani... La mia stanza non era eccezionale, al prezzo che ho pagato si trova di meglio. Niente di che anche la colazione.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could not have hoped for a better location, it was very close to the Empire State Building. Hotel was a bit overpriced, then. The hotel itself was average. Breakfast was mediocre, rooms just ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, but it is NYC. Except that, I had no problem spending a few nights at this place. Clean rooms, wireless internet, friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel location is perfect (beside Grand Central Station). Room was small but clean and comfortable. Breakfast is not buffet, hence somehow limited if you want to take something not on the menu. Price is high, but in the average for such quality hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfortable bed, clean room, nice bath and that's about it. Very small room and VERY noisy neighbors. Would we stay again? Probably not. There was nothing that inspired that 'we must come back here' feeling.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel esta muy bien ubicado,las habitaciones son comodas,del servicio no puedo opinar porque no solicitamos nada.Volveria sin dudar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn't stand out in any way really. Evrything with the hotel are at least good - rooms, lobby, elevators etc. Thus a good stay  [END]
[BEGIN] It's big, lots of rooms, long carpet corridors and a never ending people arriving and leaving at the same time, all the time. But still remaining clean, comfortable and reliable.  [END]
[BEGIN] - Great location (Times Square/Broadway) - Good welcome desk/non existent concierge (always gone or busy) - Rooms very decent and nice view (we had 2 rooms on different sides) - Food rather poor (go and eat elsewhere) - Gyms OK  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff were very pleasant. Especially the ladies who clean the rooms.The rooms were fine although were a little cold sometimes. This was my third time at the hotel and I will stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of those suite chains that has decided that a trendy lamp makes up for a bad bed, bad customer service and a poorly designed room. No room service, no vending, pay an enormous price in their mini-mart if you want a soda or anything else.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms and very expensive. Very nice front desk staff made the trip for me. Otherwise is was OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms (including the bathroom) are small but clean and comfortable and a good price for New York. The attached restaurant isn't too good but the hotel is near a number of good restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] For travelers that are looking for a good b&b hotel, this is the best choice. Clean, well located, free wifi available, metro station in the same block. Walking distance from Empire State Building and Macy's.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've seen small hotel rooms before but this was ridiculous. The hotel itself was great. The location was excellent. The staff of the hotel were super friendly and very professional. I'm just glad I got this room on priceline and didn't pay full price for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The price at X-mas season was high, but I think the price is generally high in NY at that time. The room was too small. I have had a room with bad view. However, very good location, near Times Quare and Central Park, directly located at the Metro station.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel staff was not being very professional during our check in. She was slouching and had one hand on her cheek while talking to us. On the whole, hotel was average, the interior looked a little old  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location. The deli next door was awesome. Big rooms for NY standards. Rooms looked aged and clean. No bedbugs although as we were leaving the hotel we did spy one small visitor (cockroach). Manager did say they would be getting the exterminator.  [END]
[BEGIN] Enigszins gedateerd centraal gelegen hotel. De suites zijn ideaal voor gezinnen. sleeper sofas zijn echter niet geschikt voor volwassenen of grotere kinderen. Het inbegrepen ontbijt bij tiktok is matig. Goede nabij gelegen metro verbindingen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, but rooms were really small. Near to the subway, close to Little Italy and Chinatown. Not too expensive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprisingly poor service from hotel staff. Attitude and not great service. I wanted to watch a movie. Called 3 times. Never fixed in three days. They also don't have any curtains to keep sun out. Could be a nice hotel, if they cared a little.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great for all things on Michigan Avenue but the rooms are a bit dated and blah. Service was good but don't expect a view from most rooms. Parking is obnoxiously expensive! Check out the public lots in the area for better deals.  [END]
[BEGIN] muy buen precio. ubicacion inmejorable en manhattan, a media cuadra de times square Limpieza de la habitacion:solo el primer dia. pedir toallas en recepcion. servicio de shuttle desde el hotel. definitivamente volveria.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean the bathrooms especially in the corners. Also the tub area needs a soap dish so mainly the bathroom area needs something. The TV was great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The facilities were acceptable, but the hotel staff was not up to par. They omitted some of the contracted A/V aids in our conference room and my personal room was not made up on one out of the three nights I stayed there. The banquet food was ordinary at best.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as big as pictures make it. Room was dark and small. Beds were comfortable and no bedbugs.It was a 3 star hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] De locatie van het hotel was gewoon goed, lekker dichtbij het Central Park en de metro. De ontbijtzaal was echter veel te klein voor dit hotel en het ontbijt was slecht. Te weinig keuze en dus iedere morgen in de rij staan en staand eten.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was fantastic but the common areas and the restaurant were below average. It would take almost an hour to get food at the restaurant and it was not even half full.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean and good location. Elevators are always full.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are fine, if a little boxy and nicely designed. TV reception is a bit terrible. However, the hotel is just a bunch of rooms. And nothing else. But try telling that to the hotel staff - they seem to expect a tip for trying to help you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Adored the location; staff adequate; rooms need a little sprucing up. Chipped tiles in the bathroom, but nice big towels. I would certainly love coffee in my room as so many hotels today have this. I would stay at the Park Lane again as I love being "on the park".  [END]
[BEGIN] The lobby was lovely. We stayed here during the Christmas. The room is small. It's kind of a 'party hotel', which was noisy. Location was not great but ok. Clean and welcoming hotel overall. But will not stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel was old but nice room very very small small bath tub also,the bed was very comfortable,the bar food was ok not worth the money do as expensive for what you are getting,i would not stay in this hotel again  [END]
[BEGIN] We had no problems with our stay at the Hampton INN. Yes, the rooms were small but the king size bed and was wonderful. We were within walking distance of the empire state building, time square and rockafeller center. I would recommend this hotel to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very conviently located close to Macy's, Madison Square Garden, and several subway lines. Furnishings are a little outdated and showing wear. New sleep number mattress is a great feature but not really explained at check-in.  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel advertises as completely renovated but is actually still under construction. the rooms are nice enough but aren't super awesome. kind of snooty area and not a lot going on at night. probably better for older people not really my scene but not all together a terrible place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful, charming and classic older hotel that needs to move into the 21st century. Service was excellent, hotel showing wear and restaurant prices outrageous. Fitness center and Internet access all required additional fees. There are better hotels at cheaper prices close by.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are clean. Maybe better blankets (thick-heavier) for fall and winter season. Great location downtown Chicago- just 4 blocks from Michigan Ave.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel has a trendy atmosphere, and the rooms were allright, although somewhat small. We stayed there in january, and the heater in the room was very noisy, but nothing that earplugs couldn't fix. Everything else was goog; friendly staff and OK in- room food.  [END]
[BEGIN] hadden penn5000 geboekt, kregen een vreselijk slechte kamer waarvan het bed kapot was. Na klagen kregen we een betere en grotere kamer. Netjes afgehandeld. Kregen hierdoor wel het idee dat ze gewoon probeerde ons in een gewone standaard kamer te zetten ipv de geboekte penn5000!  [END]
[BEGIN] We recently stayed here and were not unhappy with our stay. It was very clean..but thats about it. We booked a king room and got 2 dbls....the bathroom we had was VERY small...and the room was extremely hot with no temperature control.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently stayed at the Palmer House and will have to say I would have expected the internet to be free of charge. It seemed they charged for everything. The staff was friendly, the beds were nice. No breakfast or coffee pot, or refrigerator included for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hence the title, it's about the location. It's close to pretty much everyhting or easy within reach by cab. The hotel was fine. Who spends a lot of time in their hotel room when in NYC anyway?  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed in a one bedroom suite, which had plenty of room and two bathrooms but was dated in decor and slightly shabby. Service in the bars and restaurants was excellent. Location is good for most areas of New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very convenient location for Central Park and the nearby museums. The rooms are not as nice as the lobby suggests. The staff was nice and friendly. Good option if you can get a good rate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best localization for the price. The hotel is a little old and there is only two elevators for whole hotel. I usually wait too long to go downstairs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Il Jolly e'un albergo sobrio,confortevole,in posizione strategica.Buona il rapporto qualita' prezzo.E ' un ottimo compromesso per chi vuole soggiornare in zona midtown senza spendere un patrimonio.Unica pecca:molto essenziale,non aspettatevi lusso o l'eleganza esclusiva.  [END]
[BEGIN] Have stayed at the Larchmont half a dozen times over the past several yrs. Great location, friendly staff and clean rooms. Understand that you are staying at a palce with shared baths and you'll see that this an absolutely great deal--breakfast, location, cleanliness. Ed, Key West Fl  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very good hotel from the point of view if you are 4 people sharing, their family room which is one double with door + another room with two queen beds - hotel is very good for charges made and very convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] discreto hotel una camera matrimoniale con salotto divano letto, bel bagno e aria condizionata.solo dormire, non c'e' prima colazione ma di fronte si trova Starbuck.Vicinissimo alla 5 strada e a vari negozi.Attiguo c'e' il ristorante dove si mangia veramente bene.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not the best hotel I have stayed at, but that's ok for the price. Clean small rooms, a very noisy mattress that made my baby awake all night long, complementary breakfast, and I must say it: staff not very friendly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Een hotel waar ik zeker lekker geslapen heb. Kamers zijn niet groot maar wel modern en proper. 's Morgens is de wandeling naar het centrum/metro niet te ver, maar 's avonds lijkt die laatste mijl verder.  [END]
[BEGIN] Molto al di sotto della media degli altri sheraton sicuramente. La posizione a manhattan e' ottima praticamente dietro il rockfeller center e al MoMa. Non offre molto le stanze sono piccole e arredate al minimo. Si paga il marchio e la posizione.  [END]
[BEGIN] very close to times square, Small Rooms, i guess its value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] bad: - indifferent front desk staff; check in 1/2 hr late; key stopped working - no natural light, two airshafts - ugliest decor ever; whole place looked old and tired good: - great location, 31st & 5th Ave -great A/C - great showerhead much better: Pod, Roger Smith, Guest Quarters  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a fine stay. How bad could it be at a brand new space? My only complaint is the bed. Rock hard. A futon, I think, on a wood platform. The neighborhood is okay. Obviously undergoing a transformation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione veramente ottimale... esci e ...cadi nell'empire state building... le camere non sono molto grandi...ma d'altronde a new york non si va per stare in camera..... si paga subito... ma poi sono gentili...  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to all main atractions; friendly staff. Room was very comfortable, metro and bus stops very close.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this hotel/hostel and there is no negative that I can say, yes it was for us very expensive but New York is a very expensive city so this is what you should expect in New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] very average hotel... but if u want to stay downtown for cheap it is an option  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location if you are going to NYC for a show. AMEX FHR program provides a very competitive rate, nice in room breakfast and a $100 credit at Bluefin. Not an ideal hotel for business travelers. Noise from Times Square can be annoying. Rooms are in need of a refresh.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel looks better in pictures. It took me 45 min to check in. The rooms in the Hotel need an upgrade everything was old and smells, The bed was big but wasn't good enough. The hotel is in good area but needs changes ASAP.  [END]
[BEGIN] you feel like a rock star when you are at the lobby, and like an hobbit at the room  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was tiny but comfortable. Yes, there's some street noise, but hey, it's Manhattan. It was a bit of a challenge controlling the temperature in the room and elevators are sloooow, but overall, we were really happy with it. We'll stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buona la posizione, vicino alla stazione metropolitana. La stanza richiesta per 3 persone veramente molto piccola. scarso il servizio di colazione proposto all'interno dell'hotel,camerieri lenti e non efficienti, abbastanza costoso.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed overnight only at this hotel...has free wifi...comfortable bed...  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location for sightseeing, close to subway. Staff excellent, very helpful and friendly Very good breakfast, very nice roof terrace. Room was very very small, and noisy, we had to ask to be moved to another room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just fair customer service. The cleanliness of the room was questionnable: we found a hair on our pillowcase, the icebucket was soiled with grease and bring slippers because the carpet floor felt dirty. The best part: FREE PARKING!!!!!! Its located about 5-10 min walking distance to Time Square!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Run down, hot tub broken, pool freezing, overpriced. The neighborhood is a bit out of the way and across the street from project housing. We were a one night stay and quick to leave.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great hotel for the money. But the customer service over the phone is terrible. One hotel rep in particular cuts you off and won't let you explain your problem before she starts giving you her solution.  [END]
[BEGIN] basic budget hotel in a fantastic location for access to bars, cafes, shops, etc. large rooms and friendly staff and a bargain if you don't mind not having the lil extras like coffee makers, shampoo etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camere pulite e personale disponibile, unica cosa negativa per me il materasso del letto troppo morbido. Buona posizione a 500 metri da time S. e proprio sulla linea gialla della metro comodissima per muoversi  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is ok. Its in a great location and has free parking. There are 70 rooms and 40 parking spots. Get there early and leave your car there and walk or use cta to get around.  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent 2 nites in Off Soho Suites in June and it is reasonably good in terms of location but the room needs to have a paint and clean up job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came and stayed in this hotel because its in the city area but find out that it doesn't worth the price. You have to pay for everything even though the price was at US$350 + service charge! The air condition is also quite noisy in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed here periodically over the last five or so years. Location and staff are still great. My only issue with my most recent trip was the fact that the place is beginning to feel a bit run down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed just one night which was perfect as it was cheap. But the room was too small for a longer stay, and there's no breakfast (but good places next door). VERY clean. Super part of town as you can walk to Little Italy/Chinatown etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Am staying there at the moment,all in all not bad, Asked for a high floor room given 4th floor looking at the side of a building. A BIG birthday treat for my 50th turns out to be just a trip, as I said nothing special. Maybe it will improve!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stupenda location che rende ogni percorso una piacevole passeggiata, personale cordialissimo. Peccato la stanza davvero microscopica senza armadio o spazio per una sedia dove poggiarci perlomeno una busta. Aria condizionata rumorosissima con dei suoni intermittenti che rendono la nottata un po' pesante.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there with the family in the middle of July and the location was perfect for shopping, sightseeing Manhattan, price affordable, but the breakfast.... was so crowded and we and many others decided to bring their breakfast to their rooms. We found however many good restaurants nearby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Plus: - posizione strategica (fermata metro a 2 passi, stesso isolato dell' Empire, Macy's e Victoria Secret nei paraggi, Penn St vicina etc..); - personale hotel efficiente e cortese; - colazione compresa (anche se abbastanza triste); - pulizia discreta Minus: - necessita di una ristrutturazione; - attesa per ascensore -  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione ottima ed hotel meraviglioso l'unica cosa e' che ci hanno assegnato una camera troppo piccola per 2 persone... Spazio tra letto e parete veramente imbarazzanti..... Non tutte le camere sono cosi ma sfortunatamente questa e' la nostra esperienza e la wonderful room non e' stata proprio cosi!!Michela  [END]
[BEGIN] Die Lage des Hotels ist top! Fuer den gezahlten Preis kann man eigentlich nicht mehr erwarten. Das Hotel selbst ist sauber, aber die Zimmer sind ziemlich in die Jahre gekommen. Die Heizung war sehr laut und hat es kaum geschafft, dass Zimmer auf angenehmere Temperaturen zu erwaermen (Ende Maerz).  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price booking on-line, nothing fancy, no parking, great doorman and lobby staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottima la posizione, a pochi minuti da Times Square. Dispone di una splendida piscina. Malgrado i commenti degli altri, la mia camera era veramente piena di polvere, cosa che ha creato non pochi problemi. comunque silenzioso la notte, a pochi passi da uno starbucks (sempre in direzione times square).  [END]
[BEGIN] Lift is still out of order. Hotel won't run a/c in breakfast room like an oven. Be warn of gift shop if buying broadway tickets - got cheated on the price. Hv been told price for $80/- but was for $55/-.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed with friends. The rooms were small but clean and the bed was very comfortable. Parking is a problem and very expensive. The complimentary breakfast was good. Within walking distance from Magnificent mile and shops. The staff was very helpful.Pity we stayed only 2 days.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a great time at the Travelodge hotel thanks to the professionalism and kindness of the staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location, location, location! Too bad the rooms and service did not exceed my expectations...there was no "wow" factor here, other than the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has been nicely upgraded and the room is of average size. My room felt a little damp like the ventilation was not working properly, but that is really my only negative. Parking was adequate and the business center was top notch. Excellent rate via hotwire.com  [END]
[BEGIN] cool place but a little too high priced for what you got. would rather spend the same $ or a little more and stay at the Ritz or Satai.  [END]
[BEGIN] If that is what you are going for, then it is ok, but otherwise I highly recommend looking elsewhere. The service is good and the beds are comfortable (like all W's) but the ambiance just isn't that cool anymore.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good enough for what I needed. I didn't want anything fancy and overpriced. Stayed 7 nights with no problems. Not the greatest but it was fine, and I never saw any bugs. The people on the streets and car horns can get annoying though.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very funky but I thought with a suite we would have a decent sized room. Unfortunatley the room was very small and the bathroom like a cupboard! Beside this the hotel itself is really nice and I found the staff very help indeed!  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at the Belnord Nov 2004. Very clean. Helpful staff. One minute walk to subway. Small rooms but sufficient for the budget minded traveller. Close to many restaurants. Minutes from beautiful area of Central Park. Recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] As a frequet travellor at Starwood hotels I can not accept a $250 per nite hotel without: in room safe, adequate fitness facilities (small room, no free weights, no sauna or pool)  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked through Expedia and requested two beds. When we arrived, the hotel overbooked and gave us a room with one king bed. My friend with a 16 months old baby was put in a smoking room! The front desk agent didn't even bother to inform him.  [END]
[BEGIN] The noise from the street outside (including almost constantly honking horns) was deafening until after 2:00 in the morning. We stayed here on a Friday night and will never make that mistake again. Otherwise, it was a standard Courtyard Marriott.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worth saying that I stayed here on business, so Times square is a negative rather than a plus. Location would suit tourists well. Mostly families staying here, staff were functional but charmless, decor in the rooms felt like a great aunt's spare room. Spacious though.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are clean enough, big enough, almost quiet enough, but the location is fantastic. Everyone who worked there was helpful and friendly. We have stayed at the Wellington with college groups for 15 years with no problems.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel with friendly staff, but the rooms were VERY small. I think my bedroom was twice the size of the entire room, bathroom and closet included! For the price, go somewhere else. You can always see the lobby when passing by.  [END]
[BEGIN] OK it's in a good location,cheap and the rooms are clean,but two bathrooms per floor is just woefully inadequate particularly when not all of the showers work. Whole place is in need of upgrading, furniture battered, threadbare carpets Definitely one for the budget concious (young?) backpacker.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great location. The room was very average the carpet had major stains. The beds were comfy. However the air conditionner was awful might as well get rid of it!!!! Personel were friendly and helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] This Doubletree is centrally located in Midtown East. Overall the rooms were a little small and some of the bathrooms were really small. Very nice front desk staff. Good buffet breakfast each morning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice presentation but rooms are not the best, cleanliness, not so comfortable, over crowded. I asked for a double room and I got a double bunk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service is quick. View is great on high level but room is very small. Would stay in their corner room again.  [END]
[BEGIN] - Massenabfertigung - Tick-Tock Diner praktisch, aber Essen ist nicht besonders - Wir hatten eine Suite gebucht, mit richtigem Esstisch, aber so etwas gibt es dort offenbar nur auf Fotos. Wir hatten uns vorher telefonisch versichert, aber als wir ankamen wurde uns mitgeteilt solche Zimmer gibt es dort nicht.  [END]
[BEGIN] With all the busy New York City, this hotel is reachable to Empire State Building which is only one block to Empire State Building,5th Av,Broadway ,Time Square,Madisson Square Garden, Macy's, Penn Station, Cross to Ellis Island by t  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quiet location, very close to Central Park, Subway access & Carnegie Hall. Easy walk to Times Square and shopping on 5th avenue. Many food & facilities nearby. Room basic, I miss having a fridge to keep milk & water cold, but otherwise acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel esta viejo si, pero correcto. En pleno time square, las camas comodas, calidad precio perfecto, me volveria alojar en el sin pensarlo. Saludos  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was perfect. Rooms were average. Bit small and old. The bed was very small for 2 persons and much too soft. Breakfast was okay. So on the average, it was a good price for what we've got.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing fancy about the hotel & for the money given that it is NY, it is OK. + side: huge bed, adequate bathroom, good location (can walk to grand central) - side: slow lift, expensive internet, no views  [END]
[BEGIN] excelente ubicacion y por el precio no hay que quejarse  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellant location, too bad construction work woke us up very early on our holiday. Night desk clerk wasn't very friendly or observant. Didn't look up when we walked in late at night or greet us. Anyoen could walk in there, didn't think that was too safe. Room was clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is nice and clean and the location is great. However: 1. Internet in the room costs $10/day. For a $220 room charge one would expect free wireless. 2. No breakfast room - just an adjacent bagel store with bad coffee.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location; close to subway, Rock Plaza, Times Square, Central Park; friendly and courteous staff. Hotel lobby has been updated but rooms and linens could use some sprucing. No free wifi in room but available in lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] I posted a review that I was unhappy that the hotel would not issue a refund for an unused night. I received a very fast response from the general manager. To make a long story short, a refund has been authorized and I am now a satisfied customer. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] De ligging is prachtig, het gebouw ook. Maar de kamers zijn rampzalig. Zeer vuil, verf die van de muren schilfert, muffe geur in de gangen. Soms moet er lang aangeschoven worden aan de incheck balie. Het hotel word wel gerenoveerd beginnend met de bovenste verdieping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Une chambre pour dormir, prevoir des boules quies si votre sommeil est lege. 3 salles de bains par etage...une de plus ne serait pas du luxe. le Wifi ne fonctionne pas au 7eme etage. Correct sans plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione eccellente  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are very small, carpet is not the cleanest. Service was okay, however price was very high for what you receive. The location is in the middle of everything so I would say that counts for something.  [END]
[BEGIN] Destaco su muy buena ubicacion, habitaciones limpias y modernas. La atencion al viajero es pesima, los repcionistas no hablan otro idioma que no sea ingles......no esperen mucha ayuda.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is clean. However the rooms are small and the lifts are a joke in this day and age. However for new york not a bad deal. We enjoyed our stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in ottima posizione, complessivamente di buon livello ma con servizi in camera scadenti. Camera rifatta per tre giorni di seguito alle 18,30!! Abbiamo dovuto aspettare nella hall che rimettessero apposto la stanza! Assurdo. Cameriere scontrose.Colazione buona ed economica.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large hotel with small rooms, the restaurant was pricey as the bar but comparible to the rest of N York. we found the diner good for breakfast. Great position close to many attractions  [END]
[BEGIN] We arrived at 1:00 PM & had only 2 people in line, so checked in quickly. Great service & we checked out using the drop box. We had breakfast around the corner for 99 cents (a roll & eggs as a sandwich).  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was fair with caulking in bathroom needing touch up. Provided only a saucepan in kitchenette - a frying pan would have been nice. Meets the needs of extended stay customers. TV has many channels which is nice and free Wifi is always appreciated.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel rooms had an interesting design - some elements were not well thought out. Floor was a little dirty but all in all the rooms were good. The food was the worst.  [END]
[BEGIN] As a Hilton Diamond member I stay at alot of Hilton propoerties. this Hotel, while it's atrium is huge, is exactly what you would expect from this brand. employees were very nice and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] elevators are dreadful slow. the rooms are o.k. not dirty but rooms could use a make over. not everyone is friendly and not all that helpful. but if you can get a good room rate, the location is well worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed at many hotels with all star ratings and really have to say this is a 3*. Unfriendly service, dirty rooms, chipped paint, loose toilet, no bath robes or slippers, no moring newspaper (promised- not delivered) etc. Poor value for money. Good location  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good, not great hotel. Reminds me of many European hotels. Good Staff, reasonable price, decent sized rooms, close to where you want to me. Not a bad place to stay at all. Just not something unique. I will stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] A nice hotel, spacious rooms, friendly staff. Stayed there for four days in connection with some business meetings. Good value for the money, nothing to complain about.  [END]
[BEGIN] The front desk personnal were great and very helpful, however the room was just average. We also noticed some ants in and around the bathroom area. We reported to the front desk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location. Near many restaurants and only a mile from Michigan Avenue. Clean rooms, decent breakfast. Fitness center is lacking. Machines were broken, not many options and no locker rooms. Door was open and sauna turned off, making it unrealistic to wait forvitvto heat up. Pool is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a pretty decent hotel. The rooms are large for Manhattan, and were clean and comfortable. The location on West Street isn't great, but it's lower Manhattan so everything is close anyway. The elevators were brutally slow. I waited about 15 minutes in the morning waiting.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are clean and have a nice bed, however they are very small with practically no closet space and no drawers at all. The bathroom is also very very small  [END]
[BEGIN] They "scent-brand" their hotel. In other words, clouds of sickening, tacky perfume waft through every inch of the first floor and hang on your personal belongings long after you leave. Visually, this place tries to be hip, but fails. The location is good though. And the service adequate.  [END]
[BEGIN] too big, too unpersonal no charm  [END]
[BEGIN] we stayed in thr wellington for five days .was in the heart of new york and staff was very pleasent  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent 2 nights in this hotel. Perfect location, nice rooms, friendly employees, but, surprisely, for a Marriott 5 star hotel, we found "old linens" and the pillows were not comfortable. I woke up itching and with rash.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel razoavel, cujos funcionarios sao meio desajeitados. E limpo, com conforto minimo nos quartos, com localizacao proxima dos pontos turisticos mais procurados. De facil acesso. Tavez volte, se nao achar coisa melhor. Carina  [END]
[BEGIN] Lo unico que no esperaba de este hotel es su falta de atencion al cliente y servicio...puede ser por ser NYC nadie es muy amable familiar etc  [END]
[BEGIN] Location of this hotel is great. However, the room service is poor. The room service staff occupied the lift in the morning at busy hours, and some of the guests had to go by staircase in order to catch the breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] the smallest room i ever seen. smallest bathroom were i ever had a shower. the tv do not work, if u touch things - just if u touch it - you will pay for it!! nice location. at the same price you can find better places around  [END]
[BEGIN] Selected this hotel based on Trip Advisor reviews and the great AAA price. First impressions? Large room with two very comfortable queen size beds, strong air conditioning, good location, fast free WIFI. The surprise? There was a mouse in our room! Need I say more?  [END]
[BEGIN] heating that doesn't work, sinks missing pieces, ragged carpets and wallpaper--and worst of all, windows that face other wings of the hotel: no daylight on the plus side, the staff is great and helpful but i would never stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Elegant historical hotel, magnificent lobby and nice restaurants. Excellent location at the very beginning of the Michigan Av., conveniently Located for shopping. But rooms are really poor, they deserve an hard renovation, no drawers in the room to store shirts! Staff is professional and kind.  [END]
[BEGIN] Located in the cut flower wholesale district, half-block from subway. Good breakfast and clean rooms. Staff was cordial and responsive to requests.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location for shops, subway etc Travel lodge rooms are cleaner and brighter As for the front desk staff, they make you feel as you are intruding on their privacy all the time. http://the-new-yorker-hotel-experience.weebly.com/  [END]
[BEGIN] We have just returned from our annual visit to the Edison Hotel. Again had an absolutely fantastic time again. The hotel staff are so friendly and helpful, especially Catalina. The location is perfect and we look forward to our stay again next year.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was friendly and nice plus my room was very clean. The first room they put me in was facing 610 which was incredibly noisy. The hotel is in need of a renovation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location to get where we wanted to go, 3 days of non stop sight seeing and shopping. Next time would take a travel kettle though as no facilities in room.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is perfect if you are not leaving the airport--it is actually inside the airport. Otherwise, it is quite average. The rooms are ok, the restaurants are ok. The staff are helpful and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent stay. Room was nice, but small ( it is NYC) Staff was friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] In all honesty it was a bit avergae. Tiny rooms, but clean and quite funky. reception was always packed with people sat around. But good location and reasonable price......overall OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice location at one block of Times Square, the hotel was ok, good just a week end... nice room but no curtains so hard to sleep with the BIG sign of the hotel in front of my window...  [END]
[BEGIN] Was there for a conference. Although the conference facilities were good, the rooms are really getting quite tired, and the friendliness (or lack thereof) of front desk staff is surely not suited for such a historical hotel. Definitely one of the least favourite hotel I have stayed in the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] Frequent traveler who has stayed at this hotel twice for conventions. Choose to stay for a family trip to Chicago anf was very dissapointed with lack of service from staff and noise from construction/renovations in hotel. Will not stay again at this location when visiting Chicago.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad outside appearance. Better lobby. Quiet. Clean. Need rules for business center. People need to print boarding passes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bathrooms are dated and small. TV is old and room wireless in not available. Revolving restaurant food selection is poor. Bottom line is hotel needs update.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic: within walking distance to Time Sq and same block as the Metro;, clean and spacious room and friendly staff; kitchenette. Bad: noisy construction and street traffic; double beds that are too small/impossible to share. A tad expensive $300/nt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Netter Service, sauberes Zimmer, super Lage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Check in line was long but they added more staff. Rooms are small but nicely decorated. Bathrooms border on closet size. Customer service really non-existent except for valet staff who seemed to be the only people glad to see us.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, fabulous rooms. Welcoming and helpfull front desk staff. What a shame it was let down by the breakfast buffet staff ! They were unwelcoming and downright unbelievably rude with sloppy service , however food was reasonable. Best to stay at the hotel and obviously have breakfast elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect location to Times Square Nice guy at reception caleld Jason, he is very helpful and gave us alot of advices and help. Also Luggage Porters were very helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] LA PRESTATION DU PETIT DEJEUNER EST GENIALE. HOTEL A DIX STATIONS DE METRO DE TIME SQUARE MAIS TRES BIEN SITUE POUR DES PETITS RESTAURANTS SYMPAS LES CHAMBRES SONT PETITES MAIS LE PERSONNEL EST A L ECOUTE  [END]
[BEGIN] That's it really; it's "nice"! There's nothing particularly good about it and nothing particularly bad it's just "nice" and frankly I expect rather more from a 5 Star hotel than that; I expect some WOW somewhere and this hotel just doesn't do it.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel was comfortable, clean and located right across 7th from penn station/MSG. So if you want a decent place midtown it's fine. Not the most up to date inside. Needs a good paint job, re-carpeting, etc... Check in was ok - no issues.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed at numerous Hilton properties in nyc, this one was small. That is to be expected in the city, but the flow of traffic in front of elevators is way too crowded. Breakfast was just eh. The Hampton located in Times Square North was nicer and better location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute hotel, lovely hotel bar, pool was wonderful, but very noisy room. Doors in the hallway have no springs and literally slammed closed all night long. Changed rooms and the same thing, slamming doors all freaking night long. Five nights of zero sleep. I would never stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Busy W, but nice. Food and service was good, not awesome. There are definitely nicer W hotels. The lobby is spectacular. The breakfast at IPO was delightful. The rooms were decent but disappointing in comparison to newer W hotels.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had previously stayed in the other Hilton which is close to central park and is in a different league to this one. I got a small single room. Location is good for business meetings in midtown. Otherwise nothing great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed one night at this property. Check-in was easy. Cookies were delicious. The bed was comfortable. I thought the carpet and furniture were slightly worn.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was OK. The room was very small...But the bathroom was big and nice. The breakfast was not very saticfying. Actually we tried the breakfast only the first day, and the rest of the stay we went out for breakfast. The service was great and location good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed over a 4 day period in a superior room, which meant a double in one room and pull out couch in the other. All OK as it was only used to sleep in! Very convenient for Times Square etc  [END]
[BEGIN] location is the best thing here. The hotel is perfectly adequate for a few days and was quite busy with a varied crowd from business types to students. Clean enough place and would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms seemed very unfinished: sloppy craftsmanship, cheap finishes (motel 8 inspired), extremely poor lighting, cramped bathroom, faucet falling off. However: clean, accommodating staff, great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] A basically good hotel. It's biggest plus is location which couldn't be nearer to times square, though noise should be expected. Staff are not the friendliest & didn't get the welcome I had heard Americans were proud of. My party & I often felt we were an inconvenience.  [END]
[BEGIN] gute Lage in der Naehe des Broadway, Metro um die Ecke. Zimmer fuer deutsche Verhaeltnisse ueberschaubar, aber sauber. Standard und Preisleistungsverhaeltnis fuer New York vermutlich akzeptabel, allerdings nicht fuer deutsche Verhaeltnisse  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione strategica (vicinissimo alla metro della Grand Central Station e al "centro") ma in zona tranquilla. Camera (monolocale deluxe) spaziosa, pulita e confortevole con cucina senza fuochi ideale per colazione; letto spettacolare.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel needs some renovation, but the room is quite large. The bathroom is too small.  [END]
[BEGIN] The front desk not very helpful requested early check in and was denied.Nice room ,great location worth the price if you get a deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is a little dated but very spacious, clean and friendly... directly across the street from Carnegie Hall. I booked on Hotels.com to get a last minute rate - great value - especially for NYC - especially for 57th St, easy access to dining, shopping, entertainment and sites.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is clean and nicely appointed but if you are sensitive to noise DO NOT STAY HERE. I was on the 7th floor and my room shook every time the subway went by. They wouldn't put me in a higher room. What a terrible night sleep.  [END]
[BEGIN] Besides being given a room that backed up to the elevator bank so that we constantly heard the up & down of the cables, the room was small & bathroom was one of the smallest we've experienced in a hotel. We won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was fine, nothing to rave over but nothing to complain about unless you were really nitpicking! Good location for eateries and park. I was put off by reviews on this website but I shouldnt have been. Contrary to other reports, my carpet was new and quite clean!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing spectacular about this hotel. The location is a little far from mid-town so you may want to avoid if you prefer to be closer to Time Square. It is good value though if you get the right price as the rooms are decent and the hotel is clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Food was the worst ever, do not recommend the rest. for your dinner or room service. TV - no programminf, No Movies Didn't even have trash cans any where for use in common areas (?) why not! No Movie  [END]
[BEGIN] Zeer goede locatie in een fijne buurt, dichtbij de metro,restaurants, winkels en een erg goede bakker. Hotel is wat versleten, vooral de handdoeken, maar de kamer werd alle dagen gepoetst en de handdoeken vervangen. Personeel is niet allemaal even vriendelijk maar de zwarte manager maakt het goed.Prijs/kwaliteit een aanrader!  [END]
[BEGIN] A deux pas de la cinquieme avenue... Proche du metro Chambres un [peu petites mais parfait pour passer la nuit. Tres calme  [END]
[BEGIN] A cold front moved into Houston during our stay. The heat was not working and apparently could not be fixed so we had to move to another room where the heat did work. A staff member did help us.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is an OLD Hilton property that is in need of updating. The rooms were comfortable and clean but nothing special. The staff was very friendly and helpful. The airport shuttle is prompt and runs every 15 minutes.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smells really bad. Like an Indian restaurant. The rooms are big and bed are confortable. Good location and easy to get. Just for an emergency night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Certainly does not have the WOW factor which it affords itself in it's own descriptions. I was completely underwhelmed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our staying was "good" in general.....I must say for the rate paid you expect at least a room large enough so two persons can move inside the room without any trouble.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very average hotel,hence the price per night.Very conveniently located central in Manhattan,and across the road from Penn Station and Madison Square Garden.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely small rooms, no space for luggage, noisy air condition. Rooms look better on website than in reality. But ok to stay for a few nights. Interior is functional and trendy. Roof top garden is shabby, but offers great views. A bar would be great on top.  [END]
[BEGIN] Service was scarce.. terrible in another word. Upon check-in, check-out and everything else in between, it was nonexistent and severely lacking. I will not be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was tiny and stuffy. The hotel was well located but the windows were quite old, so we could hear the CTA train. It was average. I would not stay there more than a couple of nights.  [END]
[BEGIN] Visited this hotel in March 2004. What a great location.Had two double rooms, no view but very comfortable.Only complaint was that the reception staff were not very friendly.Very convenient for the subway & great coffee shop next door. We will definitely be staying there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] My room (on 21st floor) had just one, very small, window. The room itself was very small and could barely accomodate the extra bed that I asked for when I made my reservation. The hotel, however, is nice and clean and extremely well located in terms of public transport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bookedthis then read\ reviews and was worried but not as bad as most ppl reckon Sure could have done with a lick of paint but the room was cleaned everyday and was tidy and comfortable We stayed there October 2003 Location was great price was better  [END]
[BEGIN] Check in was great. Room was recently renovated ( with exception of tv's) and clean. Plenty of places to eat with in a few miles, however if you do not have a car you are land locked here as there are no services within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price and good stay!! Would love to go back and spend the time again...  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are very small. If you are looking for more room space, this is not good selection. Other than that it is very clean. Recepsionists very friendly and helpful in case you need something....Very close to times square, lot of attractions, restaurants....  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient location walking distance to Times Square + Central Park. Rooms and bathrooms are very small. Loud construction next door on the weekedays.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heb hier in de zomer van 2011 'n week gelogeerd. Veel enge foto's gezien van te voren, echter is het mij bijzonder mee gevallen allemaal. De lat niet zo hoog leggen, als je niet de hoofdprijs betalen wil.  [END]
[BEGIN] A/C Barely functions in seventh floor rooms. We stayed for two nights. Hotel was at capacity and no other accommodation offered.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were clean and the location convenient. Service was fine, nothing to write home about, though. The hotel is expensive for the price, even by NYC standards.  [END]
[BEGIN] Since you don't go to NYC to spend too much time in your hotel, this is an OK place to stay. Free breakfast, friendly staff. Cabs convenient. Felt safe. Hotel seemed near capacity, so it must fit the needs of many.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location can NOT be beat. Accomodation are nice, clean, comfortable. No extras. I was disappointed I wasn't able to check-in early.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not too many hotels in the Tribeca/ financial district. Good location for business and prices are fair. Service was ok as was food. I would come back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Old and tired with small rooms. Free wifi downstairs but not in rooms. The location is excellent, just minutes away from the subway, supermarkets and laundrette. Microwaves are available, and there is a fridge in the room. The price is the big drawcard. You will not find cheaper in Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] For location and value, can't beat it. Basic, clean and safe accommodation. Easy walking distance of the great sights, round the corner from Times Square. Not for you if you want luxury, but if you're here to sightsee and want a decent place to stay, it's perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel au chambre il est vrai tres petite mais d'une excellente tenue et proprete excellente!le gros avantage est la situation geographique, a deux pas de times square et le petit dejeuner gratuit absolument delicieux!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms in the Allerton are very small and outdated. The breakfast is not so good, some staff is friendly, but most are not. There are nicer hotels in Chicago...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great place to stay if you are out all day exploring. We stayed here due to a sale on Expedia and picked up a studio room for $50 per night. The rooms are not great, but if you are simply looking for a place to sleep, the place is fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] Als je voor dit hotel kiest en je wil op de meest perfecte locatie zitten, moet je niet gaan klagen over de inrichting. Kies dan voor een ander hotel, kost je veel meer. En eigenlijk slaap je er alleen maar. Of je bent een enorme snob die voor weinig veel.........  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location, best site in town. Good and service, poor room cleanliness, but still good value for your money  [END]
[BEGIN] I think the location was skecthy and there seemed to be a lot of riffraff outside. The bed was a bit lumpy. Good size room. Nice helpful staff. Cheap rates and no real charm. You get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel con ubicazione ottima. Il servizio lascia molto a desiderare, camere piccolissime ed invivibili. Abbiamo prenotato per 4 persone e ci hanno dato una stanza microba valida solo per 2 persone. Bagno fatiscente e sporco. Assolutamente da non ripetere.  [END]
[BEGIN] very convient to the medical park. The bathrooms are small and the beds are not as comfortable as usual. The staff was extremely nice and helpful. Free shuttle service within two miles is a big help  [END]
[BEGIN] Bastante bien,poco turista en el hotel y mucho ejecutivo .no tuvimos ninguna pega en el sentido de limpieza y atencion, quedamos muy agradecidos,  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are very small. I had a double room to myself so it was ok. The room was clean and the a/c worked. Bathroom was tiny. Staff were all friendly but on my next visit I'd look for somewhere else to stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] My husband & I stayed here on Dec 3rd. Everything about the room and bathroom seemed very old although the room was larger than most NYC hotel rooms. It was an okay stay but for $300+ I think we could have done a little bit better.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed the stay at this hip property. Overall worked out fine, with a caveat for room size - my bedroom closet is indeed bigger :)  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nothing buy avarage staff was unfriendly our aircon was broken, room wasnt ready at check in time booked it for the hostorical feel however for a few dollars more you can do allot better overall not whats advertised the location dis make up for the rest  [END]
[BEGIN] Thought this place was outdated. Rooms were small but all hotels are like that in NY. Although the bathrooms were smaller than usual. I could touch from wall to wall while standing up. On a brighter note it is centrally located.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel with a simple but okay breakfast. Bed is a bit too hard and the room is very small, but with a vacation you are only in the room to sleep. Bathroom perfect. Nice people working there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, fair rooms. Nothing special, but nothing terrible either.  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess the good location made up with anything that 's lacking from the hotel..reasonably clean and good free wi-fi connection..  [END]
[BEGIN] Age is getting to the JW Marriott. The location is great the hotel was clean but it sure could use some upgrading. My overall experience was good but I would look for another hotel on my next trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here on a busy Chicago weekend and it wasnt worth the price. We payed for location and that was it. The room was below average and the front desk seemed overwhelmed. Would not stay here again for $150+.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could not be in a better location, staff very helpful, room clean not particually big, hotel would possibly benefit from brighting up with a refit but generally ok  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in the Pod hotel for a week in March. The hotel itself was good, great location and good price. What would stop me from staying there again is the ensuite "shower room". I would not stay in this hotel with anyone who I did not know extremely well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, expensive breakfast, ok size rooms for NYC, needs a renovation.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recently visited Manhatten and stayed in Holiday Inn Express New York City-Wall Street. This hotel is centrally located close to Wall street subway station. Room was very small as can be expected but are clean. Bathroom very basic with shower only.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel muito grande, com muitos apartamentos, no centro de NYC  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for a business trip and enjoyed the professional and personable service upon arrival and departure. Will definitely be back! The rooms were great too!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location but our room was VERY small and our basin did not work and even after reporting it was never fixed or acknowledged. No view from our hotel but not a major thing. Would be good to have tea/coffee facilities in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a prime location in the middle of time square. The rooms are nice, and the staff friendly. It was very quiet and convenient. Very expensive, but understandable for the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] I've stayed here numerous times on business travel. Generally, the rooms are larger (by NYC standards) and clean. The location is good. I wish they had more staff to help with luggage and check-in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Old rooms - no fridge ( only on request). smal beds. I's more like a *** star.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nice looking hotel. Service at front desk and door were great. The hotel needs to offer coffee in rooms, free wifi or something to offset the distance from most of the major attractions. You'll have to walk 1 mile to nearest subway or take plenty of cabs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very clean Motel.....friendly staff...great location ...but all these men with their ladies???(If you can call them ladies)  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is in a good location, by the House of Blues. Interior Decor a little "dark" and maze like but banquet food service is very good. Meeting rooms are spacious for multi-day meetings. The guest rooms have a reptile and "dark" theme.  [END]
[BEGIN] ist time in new york and was pleased with hotel .excellant location great coffee shop and nice bar with jazz a regular feature rooms a bit on old fashioned side but clean and plenty of hot water and clean towels .would stay here again jct  [END]
[BEGIN] Buona posizione, vicino a shopping area, attrazioni turistiche e stazione della metropolitana. Hall e reception molto accoglienti. Camere abbastanza accoglienti. Infrastrutture tecnologiche limitate: business center di dimensioni ridotte, collegamento internet solo a pagamento e senza wireless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Facilities were good, but the hotel was old and tired. Old smell when you walked the corridors. Still the charge was over 300 usd a night! The best thing about the hotel was the fitness centre. Good facilities, and water and fruits offered for visitors.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was comfortable and sheet look and smell clean. The only thing I did not like was the floor of the bathtub was stained, it look dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] This old hotel has a prime location and impressive lobby, however my room and bathroom were in desperate need of updating.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a little dated in the bathroom and communal corridors once you get upstairs but everything is clean and functional. Some great views down 52nd Street if you get a corner room.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was so helpful and attentive. The only real issue we have is that the mirror is placed too high up in the bathroom and there isn't much room for toiletries. The room is very comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel. Great view. Somewhat clean. Found hairs on my pillow cases and towels. Also found a big black bed bug crawling next to the tv on day 2 of my stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 3 days. Room is good. Breakfast is not so bad. There is one restaurant nearby (at another adjacent hotel). Overall, recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are ok with the idea of sharing a bathroom, this hotel is great. It's bare bones, no ammenities to speak of. But it is clean and affordable. It is also in a great area, very convenient to the subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] You could tell that the room has recently been refurbished, but the location of my room was terrible!!!It was right beside a very HEAVY door that slammed everytime anyone went in and out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Through the hotel is small in size, all the staff seemed to be friendly and helpful. We had a TOSHI suite in the front of hotel and you could here the street noise as well as every passing subway train.  [END]
[BEGIN] They don't clean the bedroom. They don't put toilet paper and don't change the towels. You have to ask for them. But the price and the location are fantastic. I will repeat. It's a old hotel at heart of Times Square which it's being renovated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fair enough. The room was clean the staff friendly. Maybe a bit far up north for our purposes but a subway station just around the corner solved most of our problems. Special price on breakfast at a near by breakfast place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Up to standard but pretty average. The hotel fit the budget but was some way from the meeting I was attending at the Hyatt Regency. Cabs were scarce first thing in the morning. Helpful front desk staff. Good breakfast in the restaurant.  [END]
[BEGIN] buona posizione, vicino a tutto e con la fermata della metropolitana ad un passo! camere spaziose e comode unica pecca l'attesa agli "elevators"..... infinta soprattutto per quelli che alloggiano ai piani alti  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, hotel room a bit on the small side and a bit stuffy (the air con didn't seem to be working) but clean and tidy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for a conference and regretted it, solely due to the location. It is far away from central/downtown Chicago and I missed not being in the activity of the the City. Closest comparision would be an airport hotel. Very disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location of this particular Drury Inn was not very convenient. It was a long drive to any place of interest. The rooms are basic and small, but clean. The hotel food is avoidable.  [END]
[BEGIN] good location, but not a great value for the money. Small room, but clean and comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] the wellington was great for my holiday as i was there to see all the sights and spent most of my time out and about, this was the perfect base! it was comfy and easy going with everything you need including lovely staff deffinatly use again!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] really for the money this hotel offers no values. Took over 25 minutes to check-in , no curbside luggage handling. rude staff, no amenities. I think New york has lots of other hotel opportunities besides this one. Bathrooms are tiny and i was in a suite!  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are abit long in the tooth but the location is absolutely perfect!! I would definitely stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in a great location. The hotel is a little dated and the rooms are smaller. But the price is great and the staff is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you're looking for luxury, then this isn't for you. If you want somewhere to sleep every night that is adequate, conveniently located and economic, then it's ideal. We found the staff very helpful, rooms big enough and comfortable  [END]
[BEGIN] als je tevreden bent met een bed en badkamer dan is dit hotel qua ligging super. Het hotel is aan het renoveren, het is een beetje vergane glorie maar daar was de prijs ook naar. We zaten 50 m van Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] Friendly staff, but despite a recent re-do, sheets were "pilly" and many towels threadbare. Have loved the place for years but wish there were a bit more attention to detail.  [END]
[BEGIN] Chaotic environment as this hotel is very much under renovation right now. Nice, helpful staff. Small, clean rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think I expected some kind of kitchy boutique hotel. No. Just an old hotel. I think a lot of people will like this property. But it wasn't for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a word of warning, you must pay for use of their pool ($13.95) per family. Considering we payed approximately $156 for one night, I expected we would have free use of the pool. Otherwise, the hotel was just "okay" for us.  [END]
[BEGIN] In Chicago for a conference. Stayed at the Hilton for its location which was great. Good facilities, good health suite/indoor pool. Food and service very good. Rooms clean, well maintained although rather small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, nice hotel, small room, confortable bed, staff very nice, I would recommended it, but not for a special occasion.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel is as typical as they come...King bed, 1 chair, a desk, & a normal bathroom. No frills. Hall ways were old. Location was fine for midtown & the cool spot next door is the W for fun.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room is clean, but rooms are very very small, no luxury. Breakfast is ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] You have to adjust your expectations accordingly in NYC. Don't be expecting a room at the Ritz even at the prices you'll be paying. Pros: Free wifi, free amenities, clean bathrooms, AMAZING location in the middle of Chelsea, huge HDTV. Cons: Outdated furniture, musty closet, no view.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too expensive for this kind of small room it is impossible to stay there more than 2 days we stayed 6 and were very disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] pague por 5 camas y me dieron 4!!!!!!! Habitacion con tremendo ruido por maquinas de aire acondicionado,no permitian dormir. Presente mi reclamo al encargado jefe y no dio ninguna solucion. Jamas volvere a ocupar este hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in May 2006 - it was called the Shelbourne Murray Hill back then. Overall experience was good. The staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were comfortable and the location was also good.  [END]
[BEGIN] This property needs a refresh. Nothing was extraordinary at all. Service average. Food average. Part of a conference where the food was supposed to be labeled as gluten free but was not. Service in lobby bar was poor. Just okay overall. I expect more from Fairmont.  [END]
[BEGIN] If your planning on staying only 1-2 nights its fine, comfy bed, TV, geat channels, but for week long vacations find something nicer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nos momentos de entrada e saida nao havia recepcionista com dominio do idioma espanhol,portanto sendo brasileiro,tive dficuldades e nenhuma disposicao das recepcionistas para ajudar. Ausencia de frigorbar  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was adequate although a bit on the small side. Room was partially updated. Biggest drawback was the musty aroma that permeated the hotel. My allergies kicked in immediately. Anyone that is sensitive to mold smell should stay away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het hotel en de kamer is schoon. Kwaliteit van het hotel de kamer is aan de kleine kant. Het is een oud gebouw. Het hotel ligt in de buurt van Soho. Soho is een grote buurt met veel winkels. Het hotel is dichtbij het metrostation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are a little tired looking but all is forgiven because of the location. Very busy hotel. Beds comfortable and noise low. Beautiful Art Deco lounge  [END]
[BEGIN] All attitude and design above all. Unfortunately this precludes almost anything one would actually require from a real hotel or a genuinely trained staff. Neither of which this over-designed trying too hard place is, in the hands of true amateurs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Park Savoy for 3 days in March 2012. The room was small but clean and the hotel was in a perfect location for walking to Central Park and Times Square. Overall, can't complain for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] sehr nettes, familiaeres Hotel fast direkt am Times Square. Zimmer nicht uebermaessig gross, aber sauber und stilvoll eingerichtet. Bus / U-Bahnnaehe und viele Delis in unmittelbarer Umgebung. Wuerden direkt wieder buchen. Sehr empfehlenswert. Unbedingt ansehen Besuch eines Broadway-Musicals new york is a crazy city, ejnoy it!  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed most of my stay here.It was conviently located to Times Square and pubic transportation.Plus my room was clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] small rooms but very nice, clean and modern look, bad service, its ok when you are alone and you need a good place to sleep only.  [END]
[BEGIN] The good: (1) Location is great - planty restaurants and shopping places nearby, (2) price. The bad: (1) the rooms are clean but gloomy and outdated (2) A/C in the room was so loud - woke me up several times during the night.  [END]
[BEGIN] not off to a promising start. Stuck in the lobby for two hours waiting for our room to be ready.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are looking for a cheap stay you can book it, but don't expect much. It was not very clean but we survived it, it wasn't THAT bad. Don't expect much from the breakfast, euh... breakfast?  [END]
[BEGIN] Just checked into the James. Room is tiny and smells of cigarette smoke and that includes the bathrobe I'm currently wearing. Complained but they are fully booked and can't move me. To be fair they offered to refund $150 for the inconvenience. Still...  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a simple hotel, but a very good location. Next to the metro and Starbucks.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was very small, small bathroom, we fought over outlets to charge phones, our air conditioner broke day one and they never fixed. ok for the price and we were only there when sleeping anyway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel situato a Manhattan di fronte al Madison Square Garden, palazzo vecchio non troppo costoso per essere nel centro  [END]
[BEGIN] A clean, modern hotel with most of the amenities you would expect at this level. Its best feature is definitely its fantastic central location. However, the friendly, helpful staff mentioned in previous reviews must have had the weekend off; one of the receptionists was positively surly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stay here at least once a month on business. I've been very impressed with the bar staff at Fairways. They're always very professional and knowledgeable. Fernando Vasquez is a great bar tender who is at the top of his game no matter how busy the bar gets.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is not the best hotel in NY but ita fair. Tks to Elizabeth that helped me to get my check in early. She is excelent!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a nice hotel but I can't stand the fact that they charge for access to the internet. It just made me feel like they were cheap and trying to pick my pocket. In this day and age I think it is ridiculous to have to pay for access.  [END]
[BEGIN] Goed Hotel grote comfortable kamers in het centrum van Manhattan. 1 min punt van een ontbijt kun je niet spreken Het ontbijt bestaat uit koffie en de keuze tussen een bagel met jam een koffie koek of 1 muffin verder een prima hotel voor een goede prijs  [END]
[BEGIN] we were also stuck here due to airline hassles. staff very nice - even cooked breakfast after cut-off time. rooms and hotel are old - slight musty smell still. bedding clean and no bugs noted. think they may have improved after recent bad reviews. I'd recommend as inexpensive lay-over option.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good medium standard business hotel. Staff friendly and helpful. Rooms and public areas slightly dated. Very limited choice of in-house food/drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] La ubicacion del hotel es excelente, el hotel muy viejo, muy descuidado en cuanto al mantenimiento, la atenciion en la recepcion da mucho que desear y no se diga del personal del aseo, muy poco amables.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our Hotel room was like a show box. There were three of us in one room with 2 so called double beds. You couldn't swing a cat. Location was good, street rather noisy at night. Breakfast average. Staff ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is ok given the price in NYC. If you expect a nicer place to stay, go for the more expensive ones.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed there in June for 4 days and liked it. Friendly staff, the room was ok, but the lobby was noisy, extremly noisy. we would probably stay there again  [END]
[BEGIN] ci siamo trovati bene....hotel ben servito ed in ottima posizione per visitare Manhattan  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is old and a little worn but within walking distance to so many attractions. Madison Square Garden is across the street as is Penn Station. Who wants to stay in their hotel room with so much to do in the city.  [END]
[BEGIN] o Hotel, nao e la dos melhores em termo de conforto.Mas, em localizacao ele e otimo. E lembrando que o preco tambem foi bom. Fica na esuina com a Brodway. No emio do barulho. Vc esta perto de tudo. Valeu a pena  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel staff was friendly and the room was clean but we were in a room near the lifts and all night we could hear the lifts creaking and groaning.. Would stop there again if we were guaranteed a room away from the lifts  [END]
[BEGIN] Dated hotel with rather old and distressed furniture. Needs an upgrade badly. Elevators were old and SLOW.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel works if you want a fairly priced no nonsense hotel. It provides the basics and is centrally located which is a huge plus. Dont expect any frills. Thought the Captain's Cafe was very poor. Food and service was not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic location, a block from Central Park. Clean, funky rooms as this is a Boutique hotel. Room and bed were on the small-side but staff were very helpful - particularly the Concierge. Refrigerator, TV and safe. Probably suited to younger people/couples.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel NEAR times square...actually across from Port Authority and next to Corrections Office. Super quiet considering. Room was clean and perfect for what it was - a nice inexpensive place to sleep in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] the location of this hotel is the best part of it the rooms are very small,dated and very very poor even we stayed there for 5 nights they gave us a noisy room (because of the aircondition outside units) the breakfast restaurant menu is worthless the price  [END]
[BEGIN] No major complaints. Clean room but very small. In good location. Overall good value for NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location great..Rooms tiny & to be honest hotel well over rated!!  [END]
[BEGIN] In a raw with 3 more hotels chains, this hotel offer good hospitality in te heart of the world. Very nice staff for a good value. Dont miss the airport bus only one block from the hotel. Just in front bus port authorithy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Practical area for visiting downtown NYC. Walking distance WTC memorial, TriBeCa, Soho. Felt like a business hotel. Rooms comfortable but nothing extraordinary. 1/2 block to subway station chambers. The view was breathtaking. Nice exercise room and pool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient and clean but nothing special. No chair (other than desk chair) in room, no in room coffee or mini-bar. Larger than average room. Fairly quiet.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was just okay. The hotel needs to be remodeled. For what I paid, I could have easily stayed at a nicer hotel in the same area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quiet, clean place to stay in NYC. The studio we stayed in is larger than most hotel rooms in NYC. Valet parking is relatively cheap for hotels in Manhattan. I would stay here again. Not the most modern furnishings but it is solid.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean quiet and comfortable, all at a level reflected in the cost. Shared bathrooms were a minor problem. Room was bigger than expected.I would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is a little tired....but it meets expectations. Staff are New Yorkers....so don't expect any politness unless your giving them money. Meals and drinks are expensive....but it's new York. I would recommend on the basis of a great location. We'll be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel con camere piccole e discrete, bagni rifatti. estremamente pulito. personale cordiale  [END]
[BEGIN] Small room. A lot of noise from the street. Great location if you want to live near Central Park. Helpful and friendly staff. But I have later found better hotels then this for the same money. A bit pricy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could'nt make it home one night, so we ended up staying here. Its right downtown so we were able to still go out and eat dinner. Freidnly staff and would come stay again if we had to.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel has an excellent location near Central Park and the subway, with shopping and restaurants just around the corner. If you like walking, Times Square is only around 30-45 minutes walk from the hotel. The whole area feels very secure at any hour of the day.  [END]
[BEGIN] had a free nights stay after complaining about our noisy, dirty,small room during our stay in jan 06. not much better considering our complaint from before, apart from a bigger room with a not so nice view! very dissapointing as this was our 4 stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Correct place to stay if you are looking for something near downtown. Clean and efficient. Just this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Booked the "special Winter rate" for $159 for standard suite and was shocked to find out that only the deluxe suites were non-smoking! Have to pay $179 + lots of tax for that. That's no deal!  [END]
[BEGIN] small rooms. old plumbing. stayed in 3 different hotels on the same trip given jammed occupancy on the trip. this was the worst of the 3 hotels.  [END]
[BEGIN] Red carpet at front of hotel was dirty and stained and not of standard of a 5 star hotel. The hot water took 5-10 minutes to heat up in the bathroom each time I used the shower. The television was broken and not working  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to take two elevators to get to my room, and they were so slow! Also, my room had a strong cigar smell and poor lighting. It's was dark even with all the lamps on. It was also a little too far from the subway and the Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] On Exec floor, but room not one of the new renovated ones. Hotel very busy and Exec lounge was always overcrowded. Have stopped in better Hiltons  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are very small. The beds are very good. The shower has good water pressure. The room was clean. Location was OK if you know NYC. It is very close to Littel Italy, and China Town. Subways are close. Service is OK  [END]
[BEGIN] Central location. Room was comfortable, but nothing spectacular. Breakfast was ok. $359 per night including breakfast during Fashion week, so mid range value for money, rather than a nice hotel experience. Gym and swimming pool were good and smoking rooms available.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for four nights. Very expensive considering the very small rooms but the location is of course great. Trying to get an extra dollar out of whatever you ask for, and this really reduced our impression!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and clean. The main floor lobby is the place to be after work hours. Nice evening crowd having drinks and great jazz music. The staff is top notch. The room was small but comfortable - we only slept there anyway. We stayed out in city all the time.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is right next to the Central Park, It's right between two subway stops and the area around it has much to offer. The rooms are quite small and outdated,but the hotel repays you by it's location. There is wifi access in the lobby only.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wonder who is responsible for the vast amount of decibels the airco units in my room produced. That guy should be punished. Thanks to this poor performance I havent slept for four nights. It's amazing that such a classy hotel does not pay attention to this.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has the following attributes - Decent, fair price, decent located hotel; the basic needs such as gas, fast food places and access to the major roads.  [END]
[BEGIN] Front desk was helpful specifically Mr Huang. Room was decent, can be improved better. Free wifi, fridge and microwave oven at room are in good condition Shuttle service was superb Daily free breakfast was total letdown.  [END]
[BEGIN] rooms clean and functional, staff ok and location convenient for business, not a bad price for the location  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad at all. Good location. Concierge very helpful and knowledgable. Not as expensive as many downtown hotels and the rooms are fine with all most people would need presuming you aren't coming to Chicago just to stay in your hotel room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Woke up Saturday morning with no hot water. All of the 2nd and 3rd floors were without hot water for over an hour. Location and free parking was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] So wish they were able to ans questions and knew a bit more of the area around... the experience was not bad but at the same time not warm also..  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was very good, older, but well maintained. Close to Central Park and the museum mile. Got it for a decent price through hotwire.com. 4 star hotel, but more like 3. Probably would stay there again, I like the area and we didn't get bedbugs!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean and priced right. This hotel is a standard average for a Hampton inn. Noisy if you sleep on airport side where plane sound like they are landing in your room. Very conveninetly located thou if fly in or out of here  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, good customer service. Houskeeping works hard, so leave tips. Price was good for NYC but still overpriced. Hotel was busy because of location and lower price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Five stars location, quiet rooms. Did not have breakfast at the hotel, but many places nearby that served breakfast. Location in the heart of Manhattan, and very close to Central Park and other attractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] We enjoyed our stay but hotel in desperate need of upgrade. The rooms were dark and depressing and a poor finish to carpets curtains and bathroom. The reception staff were absolutely fabulous. Very efficient friendly and helpful.Good selection for breakfast although the dining area was too small  [END]
[BEGIN] Dont visit The topfloor lounge. Too expensive and no information about extra fee for view. The view is bad compared to other places NYC  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel lobby overall looks nice. But the room is kind of old and not too clean. I found roaches and baby roaches in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only benefit is location as it is on Michigan Ave. Valet people were good. Nice staff. Old, disgusting rooms. Vile bathrooms. Terrible place to stay. Not worth the money. Needs a complete makeover. Shames Essex name. Spend the money to go to somewhere nicer. Gross. Would never recommend to anyone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wonderful view and well appointed rooms. The restaurant for breakfast and drinks is wonderful but WAY to small if the hotel is busy.  [END]
[BEGIN] the rooms were abit shabby especially the bathroom but it was clean and the staff were very friendly. can't fault the location it was perfect and for somewhere to lay ur head at night it was great would use this hotel again  [END]
[BEGIN] smallest room I have ever encountered when staying in the US,ditto the bed,UK double equivalent no facilities for making a drink in the room staff helpful and friendly Lifts -patience is needed!!!! Park Cafe greta food quality and quantity location good  [END]
[BEGIN] rooms are very small, but the common areas throughout the hotel are very cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel di livello internazionale, senza particolari meriti o pecche. Lo consiglio vivamente per la suaposizione: a 5 minuti a piedi da Central Park, 5th Avenue e Times Square. Stazione metro a 100 metri. Un buon affare senza troppe pretese.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, if you want to be in the mix of Times Square! But I've stayed at other Kimpton hotels (even in NYC) that were nicer, and seemed less worn out, with a staff that was more helpful and friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed staying at the carter hotel. Not the fanciest, but it was very nice. I got the deal through the Kayak, which sent me to easyclicktravel website, and the price was good so I got it. Stayed for 23 nights. I reccomend.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had high expectations due to the recent remodelations. The only advantage was the location. The service is average, rooms super small, no amenities and the bathroom not super clean and very old. It is not worth 200 a night.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted to like it more: CONS not a lot of amenities nearby (except G cabaret, check cashing, empty lots and a Dennys), NEUTRALs clean room, decor a bit dated PROs super convenient to the airport, economical, family run  [END]
[BEGIN] How can a 300 dollars hotel charge extra for a wifi? I get a free wifi for a cup of coffee anywhere else...  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here towards the end of June. The staff were helpful. The hotel is in a good location near Times Square. The room was very small, but apparently average for New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] The only good thing in this hotel is the location, accessible to all places, other than that nothing is special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our room was a little small compared to many upper end hotels I've stayed in, but that's probably typical of this area. There's also no cheap place to park! The best rate I found was $33 in an offsite garage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Vier heerlijke dagen NYC! The Edison is een prima uitvalsbasis voor een kort verblijf in deze fantastische stad. De kamer is klein, het bed ook, tamelijk oubollig, maar schoon en alles wat je nodig hebt is er. Vriendelijk en behulpzaam personeel. Bijzondere lobby. Zeker voor herhaling vatbaar.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dollar for dollar, the location overshadows what is otherwise lacking. If you plan to spend most of your time exploring the city, this place will do. If you are looking for a more luxurious stay, skip this hotel. Not spotless, but clean. Comfortable bed. Excellent concierge.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room amentities were good, although internet television slow and painful. Common area a little tired. Overall a good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are tired, in fact, the whole hotel is tired. Most surprising is that they have no wireless Internet in the rooms. Quite frustrating if you are a business traveler. As noted elsewhere, location is central.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beautiful historic building in great location in front of Grant Park. Bed not very comfortable. Service at the Athletic Club not very good. My husband had a massage in a cold meeting room! If you go to the Marathon, perfect location.  [END]
[BEGIN] They gave me a noisy and dirty room. Lock of the door was broken. Air con like a war engine! Breakfast is poor with none quality food! Staff is noisy and not friendly! Not worth for expensive price!  [END]
[BEGIN] I loved my stay in New York, the hotel is very well located, very beautiful. But it is too expensive, the room is small, it does not have breakfast, and we have to pay for the internet!! If this hotel was not that expensive i would come back there certainly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at Club Quarters January 2nd. Was fine - the location is a little TOO quiet there by wall street for us vacationers - next time we'll stay closer to downtown Manhattan. I liked the free internet available in the club room. Room was very small, but not unpleasant.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zeer vriendelijk personeel maar erg kleine kamer en lawaaiig omdat de motor van de airco in de kamer staat en ik ook nog eens een kamer op de bovenste verdieping had met op het dak een grote machine voor het hele pand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really good location as in soho and close go subway in safe area. Rooms are clean but small. Using elevators in morning impossible as only 2 and the housekeepers hog them. Go for north facing rooms. Drum practice popular nearby on south facing side. Clean  [END]
[BEGIN] The bathrooms are small and not updated. Food not very good. Air units in the rooms hard to regulate.  [END]
[BEGIN] ottima posizione. grande gentilezza alla reception. camera spaziosa,confortevole. cucina attrezzata di tutto. pulizia ottima (cambio giornaliero di biancheria letto e bagno. ci tornerei e lo consiglio!  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is what is great about this hotel. A nice feature was that the double/double room also had a pullout couch in the room for an extra guest. There is really nothing else special about the accomodations.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very functional hotel. Very clean if a bit cramped but considering the location this is to be expected at the price. Just five or ten minutes stroll to Empire State Building, Macey's and Times Square. Free coffee all day and a decent complimentary breakfast. Good budget hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good value for money because of its location, Times Square! Typical of a city hotel. The staff were very helpful, kind and cheerful. Rooms rather tired and breakfast very expensive. Would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cet hotel est tres bien place et permet de visiter New-York a pied ou en metro sans difficultes. L'acces internent n'est pas inclus dans le prix des chambres et le parking attenant a l'hotel est tres cher. Les chambres meriteraient d'etre renovees.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small rooms, typical of the old building type. Great location. Uncomfortable bed & desk.  [END]
[BEGIN] Centrally located to subways and all midtown attractions. It served our purpose as a place to stay for a late night concert because we would not have caught a train back to NJ so late. If you get the quad room there is ample space.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of nice view (35th floor), very VERY small room (we use the chiepest one, but price was about 200). Location is also quite ok for the tourists. But as for me I'd stay upper north next time  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are very small, but clean. Housekeeping staff was very accommodating. The whole experience was fine even though the hotel is under construction.  [END]
[BEGIN] Our stay in NY delighted us and we appreciated the excellent location of the PC. We appreciated the services of Mrs Gilma Donado who took care of our room and we liked the very helpful attitude of Mr. Saleem at the reception desk. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite big rooms for NY standards and clean. The breakfast was not something great or even average. The location was quite central and the free wifi was very good connection too! I just found the toiletries inadequate since they do not smell nice at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bathrooms are very small with hardly no storage and room has a tiny dresser with three small drawers. Internet kept shutting down which was frustrating. They did let us check out late on our last day which was great and we got a night free for staying three  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was ok, but a little noisy. Rooms were nice, and beds comfortable. I did not have the included breakfast, as there was some deal where you got a ticket and went somewhere else to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel was clean and good at the price they charge but the old man who met me was not friendly. they ask refundable deposit and when he was asking it was like an order.  [END]
[BEGIN] Echt een toeristenhotel. Qua ligging prima, maar voor ons te touristish. Kamer klein en vieze muren. Douche goed en schoon, beddengoed ook fris. Persoonlijk zou ik er niet meer naar toe gaan, maar raadt het ook niet echt af.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a good location for the reason I was in town. The elevators were not always functioning. The room was not the best value for the cost based on the age and repair need of the building.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel in posizione centrale. Arredamento minimo (manca l'armadio), cambio asciugami giornaliero: nel complesso pulito e buono per chi deve solo dormire.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good size room, serviceable as a place to stay, but not a particularly comfortable or inviting room environment. Very hard bed, chairs for working at table were in terrible shape, and TV was old and had pretty poor reception.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very hip, cool decor, great shower, quality furnishings, cool lobby, very friendly front desk staff, close to River North action. Only the room size was an issue, but the rooms are actually very efficiently laid out.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in a good location for my second visit to New York. the room was over all very clean and got cleaned every day like it should be. I found the staff very helpful for the most part  [END]
[BEGIN] Toilets don't flush properly, annoying loud speaker and LCD screen in th lift will drive you crazy.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good serviceable city hotel. The rooms are decent size for NYC and surprisingly sound proof. But really, nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean, comfortable hotel, helpful staff. My first visit to NY, hotel in great location. My only complaint was the $14.95/day charge for wifi in your room when it is free in the lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice cheap hotel..you do get some very nice friendly travellers at this hotel...1 friendly staff.(Algerian one)...rooms are too small..my size 10 shoe box is bigger....room 304... creaky heater..window open..nice friendly environment..i liked the hostel..if your on budgets & ting..go for it....safe ALK wrote this  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, clean, funky decor, friendly staff.....But rooms are so small. Not just small (even by my european standards) but claustrophobically so. Really just a place to bed down for the night. Was fine for the 1 night stay we had, but wouldn't be keen to spend a week there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were clean and well kept; because our room faced away from street, also quiet, very nice. Only complaint was the 2-bed room was MINISCULE and difficult for two people to move around in.  [END]
[BEGIN] siamo stati a new york a giugno prima tappa del nostro viaggio di nozze,l albergo e in una posizione centralissima adiacente a time square ,e il classico hotel di citta con camere nella norma niente di speciale  [END]
[BEGIN] travel inn comodo x dislocazione,pulizia,nn ha la colazione ed internet costa 2 dollari x 10 minuti, ed con il wifi 6 dollari x 24 ore, ma ha la piscina ( se interessa) ed in camera nn ha il microonde  [END]
[BEGIN] The Houston Hyatt was listening when someone said location, location, location. Too bad they were not listening to the lesson about updated and clean bathrooms. Nasy bathroom.. really? Hyatt is suppose to be a quality hotel chain. This property is not meeting that standard. Marriott has nothing to worry about.  [END]
[BEGIN] great location, basic rooms, can get cold in room, a bit loud at night (but hey - it's in Manhattan! ;-) and the staff is mostly friendly with a few exceptions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione comoda, albergo nella media, personale abbastanza cordiale. Le camere sono pulite, spaziose e luminose, ma assolutamente spoglie. Prezzo decisamente sotto la media, cosa che lo rende un'ottima scelta ! Colazione continentale molto ricca  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was exceptional but the room was small and we had to call for a privacy curtain for the bathroom. The location is ideal. Parking is $65 per day which should be expected in NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, good, clean hotel, nice lobby and bar, would recommend for a good rate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well located hotel on 5th ave, the room was clean but very small. Amenities were adequate and again location was great. Would recommend this hotel as a good base from which to explore midtown etc. Staff were welcoming and efficient. Was here during hurricane Sandy and they handled matters professionally.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a good choice. Go elsewhere. Anywhere. Noise. Bad lobby inadequate elevators. Bad expensive parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] sympatique hotel vraiment pas cher , en plus c'est au centre ville super cool  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed Because my flight was delayed.They have free shuttle to the airport which is awesome! they have a bar which is dead the hotel inside is so scarry. Rooms are dark carpet are old no roaches or anything good place to just sleep nothing to do in the area  [END]
[BEGIN] Good standard of comfort and cleanliness in the rooms, great location near Times Square, great views of the Big Apple from the room, great quality food (especially breakfasts). However, very busy place, service is only average and probably more suited to business trips than to romantic escapades.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in this hotel for 5 nights when i visited new york, it is a good hotel, rooms are small but nicely decorated and clean with every thing you need, location is fabulous, couldnt get better, literally 1 minute walk to time square. good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel con rapporto qualita' prezzo veramente valido. A due passi da Time Square, dalla fermata della metropolitana e dalla Grand Central Station.Chiaramente non e' un 5 stelle ma e' pulito e abbastanza silenzioso.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel buono ma caro per quello che offre, stanze davvero troppo piccole! Ottima la posizione, a Soho, quartiere tranquillo vicino a Chinatown. Staff cordiale e gentile.  [END]
[BEGIN] Even though this hotel is a little tired, it is very handy to Times Square, which is good, especially if your time is limited in New York. Rooms a good size for New York. Would stay here again, only for its location  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice atmosphere in this trendy hotel,with very reasonable rates for its location.If you are going to NYC and don't want to spend a lot with accomodation you should consider the Jane Hotel,across from Hudson river path. The restaurant is a must,nice atmosphere and good food!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] L'albergo era abbastanza pulito,ma per noi che l'abbiamo utilizzato solo per dormire era perfetto.Stazione della metropolitana e taxi davanti all'albergo.Praticamente in 5 minuti si arriva a Time Square.Quartiere quasi tranquillo  [END]
[BEGIN] Small room, old furniture, loud conditioning, average cleanliness, wifi didn't work, yet THE LOCATION IS PERFECT. Woth the money we paid.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms and bathrooms definitely need updating. The rooms and nice and big, the hotel is in a great location and the staff is nice. If the rooms were updated this would definitely be a 5 star hotel. I'll cross this one off my list for now.  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent four nights at this really well situated hotel.The room was rather small clean but well worn.Staff were courteous and helpful.We would stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het hotel ligt gunstig, ongeveer 10 minuten lopen van Times Square en buiten de drukte, recht tegenover Madison Square Garden en het Penn station. Vriendelijk personeel, goede voorzieningen, alleen onze kamer was erg klein, dus bij reserveren vragen om een ruime kamer.  [END]
[BEGIN] No working wifi in the room nor was service available to fix it. Room was OK, but not great. Down comforters in Houston are a little excessive and bad for allergies. Feather free rooms would be a good option to offer, but no deal here. Won't be back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Signed up for king bed. Got 2 queens asked for change. They could'nt do. Did'nt offer change other 2 nights. No chair other than office chair at desk! Good location but other than that don't do it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I usually stay there for business trips that range from 1 to 2 weeks. Rooms are tiny unless you want to upgrade but the location is great for mid town tourism  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were average. I'd give it a strong 2 star rating, maybe a low 3 star. It was a little run down, but nothing terrible. The hotel is in an ok location, a short walk to times square. It is reasonably priced and you get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in a great location and very central to Times Square, shopping and restaurants. You can also get to the Park and Columbus Circle, where you can rent bikes. Cleanliness = just okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Downtown !! Great to walk around, views, etc., but pain to get to and everything is costly, breakfast, parking, etc., Good service seemed spotty (depends on who you get)  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for a week. Overall nice hotel , a little bit old fashioned. Good for middle aged or old people. Pros: Great location, clean,spacious rooms Cons: Small bathrooms, tiny elevators, no coffee makers in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotellet har en fin beliggenhet. rommet var rent, men veldig lite, dobbeltsengen var smal. Rommet trenger sterkt til oppgradering, men alt fungerte. Vil anbefale hotellet pga beliggenheten. Hyggelig frokostrestaurant i tilslutning til hotellet.  [END]
[BEGIN] In this case, location is priceless. Accomodations are on average and it is an old hotel. But to be nearby John's Pizza, Times Square, Port Authority and more is realy priceless.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Waldorf Astoria survives on a reputation. I was unimpressed with the room and the hotel facilities are unappealing to a normal tourist. It really is nothing special and it is easy to find a cheaper, better hotel in an even better location.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel service was excellent. the rooms were clean. the location is in the middle of the city. it is an older hotel but updated.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is no great shakes, but it's a decent clean room with average service for a very good price.  [END]
[BEGIN] overall good service. Front desk was great. Held my bags for free until i could check in. Rooms are simply old. If you're looking for a quick stay in NYC with basic amenities and old school hotel rooms but for a decent price, stay here.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pictures are alot better than actual hotel Lobby and library were nice. But room was small and uncomfortable. Carpets were coming up ,shower fell apart,and woke up with backache. The only thing I liked was location.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ballrooms are great but the room are old ang ugly, the rooms do not have a minibar, the people in general are ok , but you shuold get more for your money  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel lobby is fabulous, great location, but our room was dated. Not enough outlets to plug in iron, phone chargers, TV outdated, hairdryer broken. It was more than adequate, but room doesn't match the ambiance of the lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comfort nice hotel in the heart of nyc. Little beat crowded. Noisy aircondition system.  [END]
[BEGIN] The property is fine for the price and the location. If you are not too choosy and just want an inexpensive location to sleep at night with a decent, free breakfast in the morning, this property is fine. The property also has a Brazilian coffee shop attached to the lobby.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel did not have our room ready until 5:00pm and check in time was 3:00. There was no one at the diamond reservation desk. The room was above average but a little on the small side. Most of the staff were friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was very convenient and in the heart of the theatre district. Linens and bathroom were very clean but the carpeting and general hotel appointments are showing their age and could do with a renovation. Rooms are small. Breakfast was included in the price and was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] A small city center hotel near to the Empire State Building, half way between downtown and uptown and with the underground station just nearby. A very good breakfast included in the room price is waiting for you. ..................................................................................................................................................  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel clean rooms good staff and great location.close to everything and metro right outside the door  [END]
[BEGIN] Though the location is as good as it gets and the rooms and hotel are clean and appealing, rooms are very small, elevator service is very inconvenient and road noise is loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] Standard is a hip hotel. walking distance to loads of restaurants/bars in the meatpacking district. Subway is a 15 minute walk. We were in a standard king room. TINY rooms. Would only recommend this hotel if you wanted to stay in the area  [END]
[BEGIN] Ideaal gelegen hotel 47 th. str. tussen Broadway en 8e Avenue Meeste bezienswaardigheden kan U te voet doen... in nabijheid van enkele belangrijke metrostations, restaurants, shopping, enz... 17 jaar reisleider bij BCD travel voorde marathon van New York, waaronder 15 x in Edison hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] it was alot better than we expected! after reading poor reviews of it we were happy with pretty much the whole hotel. the location is excellent and the rooms were fine. worth a visit  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel but a little bit dated now, superb location, though, just off Times Square. Staff are very freindly and polite. The only slight reservations we had, were that it's showing it's age a little, especially for the top dollar charged, excuse the pun.  [END]
[BEGIN] a typical super 8: Fair basic hotel. reasonably location between airport (bush) and downtown. Rooms are quite clean though not recently renovated, breakfast is very basic (2 types of cheap cereals, bagel and cheese). Free wifi. For its moderate price, it's ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] service was good and the location is great. rooms can use a little more furnishing. you can see the wires and poles by the ceiling and wall. otherwise room is spacious.  [END]
[BEGIN] basic small rooms with private bathroom. Not much amenities except hairdryer and fridge & microwave. At least my room was clean and we were all able to get nice quiet sleep. For the price and being 4 blocks away from Times Square, I think it's worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The minute i stepped into the hotel it smelled really mushy and humid. the room was no better it smelled really bad also. The restroom in our room had MOLD in the shower. I also saw mold on the lion in the breakfast area.  [END]
[BEGIN] An average hotel with small rooms and tatty decor. Good service but you need to keep on top of the cleaners who fail to fill up the basic hygiene and bottled water supplies. Great location close to the subway and good restaurants, reasonable value overall.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for 6 nights in the 2 room suite. Comfortable rooms, bathroom is very small, loved the Greek restaurant across the street and the market around the corner. Safe neighborhood close to Central Park. Would stay again, reasonable for a family of four.  [END]
[BEGIN] We have stayed here 4 or 5 times. The rooms are gorgeous but the service could be better. That said, the last trip was better than the ones before and we felt they are making more effort on the service side of the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Convenient location directly at the airport, Stayed 2 nights in March 08, room was comfy and well furnished but very small and cramped, particularly the bathroom which just became annoying. Noise levels are high, expensive internet but great views of the airport runways.  [END]
[BEGIN] Paying for location; stay here annually for a celebration/fundraising weekend... rooms small for price but had a great view, food good, costly parking for valet parking W/E. banquet wait staff rude, rushed meal, loud & incosiderate of the functions going on.  [END]
[BEGIN] then this is a good hotel. In other areas you would expect more from the money you pay for this hotel, like a tv where the screen is not blurry, correct information by the hotel staff and exercise equipment which actually works.  [END]
[BEGIN] My impression when we arrived in the Hotel was that the front desk personel was unfriendly and not very helpful. The room was very dark and the price was too high for this  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a late flight into Houston Hobby Airport. This location is fairly close to the airport. Rooms are average and quite dark. Bed was fairly uncomfortable, but I did not complain since I was tired. I think there are better options in the area for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bedding was clean. The rooms were badly lit and the bathroom was in need of attention and a deep clean. We are currently trying to find out why $14 was added onto our card after check out!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel location is very good - one block from Times Square, but the rooms are too small even for Manhattan. You can't even hang you clothes as there is no wardrobe. The rooms are showing some wear and tear buy they are relatively clean. No issues with the service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great rooms for a family -placed central to Times Square but they all have to learn some service  [END]
[BEGIN] Not beautiful, not even cheap. Good location, but tiny and dated  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is clean and very trendy. The rooms are extremely small (maybe its the NY standard) and the upgrade to stay on a higher floor is not worth it. The location is excellent. The crew members are polite and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Shared bathroom was clean, room was small and basic, but had a TV and vanity. Cheap enough for a New York hotel if you just need somewhere to sleep. Top location only a short walk to Times Square.  [END]
[BEGIN] hoewel de entree modern is, isde rest van het hotel zwaar verouderd; het belangrijkste argument het hotel te kiezen is de locatie, midden in het centrum. Verwacht van de kamers weinig luxe en comfort.  [END]
[BEGIN] + location + rooms neatly refurbished with good quality materials + free wifi - unprofessional front desk (service and smiles please!) - loud AC (old) - double bed too small for two people Verdict: ok but far from great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was wonderful, staff helpful, the pool was great for relaxing and having a few cocktails. One bad point, there is a strange smell in the lobby of the hotel. Valet was quick and attentive, hotel bar is excellent and food is wonderful!  [END]
[BEGIN] Reasonable service, reasonable and tidy room, reasonable price for Manhattan. Do not expect too much. Complains, I was charged extra 35% for leaving the room 3 hour late although it was not booked. Facundo. Buenos Aires, Argentina.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you have to be in the medical center area for a reason, this is the perfect location. Service was great, only reason it got 3 stars was our ceiling looked like it had gotten wet at some point, and the texture was peeling off  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there for my anniversary. Room was nice and staff helpful. The front desk gave someone the wrong room and they walked in on my wife & I. Think they got an eyefull.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is far away from the center of Manhattan but the subway is very close. The staff is very helpful. The room was nice but the airconditioning needs updating. They have old window airconditioners which sound like a lawnmower.  [END]
[BEGIN] The locations is great if ur visiting downtown. Subways (E and R lines) are just underneath. The furnishings are a bit old and air-cond and/or heater are super noisy at room 5001.  [END]
[BEGIN] the only selling point for this place is probably its price and location, we got 30% off for 5+ nights.. the nights are rather loud from other toilets and street-noise and the rooms are everything but fancy..but it's still okey for a small budget and the location rocks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location if you are off to the theatre Scruffy area if not. Hotel not really luxury- dressed up to look that way but a little tired round the edges. Not a $330 experience  [END]
[BEGIN] 24.00 parking a bit much... breakfast eggs were horrible. I would stay again though. Price of hotel was good but they get you on the parking. Overall a nice hotel for the price. Good location. I would stay here again. Breakfast eggs could use some improving...  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Lovely lobby. Fine rooms. DEEPLY unfriendly staff -- adversarial towards customers without an ounce of friendliness. Beware: internet is "free" but only with a cable -- for which they charge $10! In general, not a gracious place...  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok location near time square although next door is a parole office so felt a bit unsafe. Wifi is only in lobby which is a pain. Rooftop bar is cool but ask for lower level room as top floors can hear music and bass in room until 4am!  [END]
[BEGIN] Older high rise hotel. Much updating, but not extensive enough; much still feels really tired. Example, elevators have some cosmetic upgrades, but are still old and clunky with worm carpets and smoke smell. But certainly clean enough, desk staff friendly, okay location for business in the energy corridor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Por lo tanto, no esperaras que ademas sea limpio y nuevo, no? Si buscas ubicacion y economia, ve aqui. Si lo que buscas es limpieza y habitaciones bien cuidadas, sigue buscando otros hoteles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Third stay there. A block from Times Sq. Lots of carry outs near by. Rooms very small. Bathroom small too, but well done. Breakfast basic with ceral and rolls. Coffee all day. Will stay there again because it's a good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there only one night in Nov - thank goodness, the room was so small, I wont rush back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good location, 2 mins walk from Times Square. Room was much bigger than I expected, we managed to get a room with a view of Times Square. Very good value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's a little dingy with a "Shining" feel to it, but pretty good for the price and location. It's a few blocks from Times Square. Nice hotel bar. Reminds me of a local dive bar. Above all, LOCATION LOCATION LOCATION. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] great value and fab location, no frills but at the end of the day you will be out most of the time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice size room. The bathroom was small and the water pressure was low. The hotel's parking was pricey ($40). Great location. Overall, I enjoyed my stay there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent the night, before an early flight. Limited meal selection, but the waiter was super nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] stayed for few nights on honeymoon, got a tiny room on 16th floor, hotel and room pretty average, price was ok, location was really good though  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect location of the hotel at Times Square and nice staff at least at the reception in comparison to very small and inconvenient room. - (room without a table, so we couldn't use the laptop properly). The bathroom clean but small and orderly equipped.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room size is nice. Bathroom a little rough and needs upgrade. Wireless Internet has been unavailable all day. Called to get an item in the room replaced or fixed and that request has been ignored.  [END]
[BEGIN] As an airline crew member I stay here very often. Great location and amazing breakfast! Three days out of the week they have great dinners. Unfortunately the staff is less than friendly and rarely go out of the way to make their customers happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overstated by lots of Irish reviewers. Rooms small. Quite basic. Good location, next to Grand Central station.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, clean hotel, nothing special. Price too high and service is not worthy the name 'Hilton'.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean hotel, located in Financial District. Good service, we had a check-in at 11:00AM instead of 3:00PM; Green Hotel (environmental) Very good price for Manhattan hotel (112$ US +tx) Construction noise due to the 9/11 memorial site No Bedbugs  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel great price great location believe me I'm a working class lad took my girlfriend and daughters it was spot on far too many complain about this hotel I will be back so don't be put off )  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, clean, courteous however small. Reasonable rate for a Friday night stay. Nice location if you like real busy area, not big on Times Square myself. Comfy bed, tidy room, recently redone from what I could determine. Id return if the rate were inticing enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] - the air conditioning was way too loud. it was really hard to sleep with all that noise. we stayed for 3 days and we didn't sleep well. The location was excellent and there were no bed bugs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean hotel room and very courteous staff. Nice cafe next door to get breakfast. Takes about 10 minutes to walk to Times Square. Would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't fault the location..right in the middle of Manhattan..great for exploring, Times Square, Empire State Building on the doorstep etc. Reception was very grand too. Good value for money.. well, for NYC!  [END]
[BEGIN] SI: posizione dell'hotel eccellente stanza confortevole bagno comodo, ben accessoriato, pulito personale alla reception molto gentile NO: manca la cassaforte in stanza troppi cuscini sul letto (non si sa dove metterli)  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here last summer for five nights. Rooms were basic but very clean, no breakfast, although there are plenty of diners serving breakfast nearby. Good location, close to subway. Staff were extremely helpful and very friendly. Ideal if you are looking for somewhere to rest your head at night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although well situated the hotel needs a facelift. The rooms are large and the staff helpfull but the maintenance i failing and some serious renovation is required. Stay 2 nights and no longer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel for a quick trip. Rooms were very small, but it was a great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here for 5 nights on a business trip. The hotel is right in centre of Manhattan and is well appointed. The rooms are small in size but you can expect anything other than this in Manhattan. The staff are very courteous and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here for 4 nights and we weren't really impressed with the hotel. The entrance and lobby is nice but our room was old, dirty and dark. Breakfast was inc but it was simple. The location of this hotel is the only positive. I would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked everything about the hotel, minus the customer service! On both check in and check out I felt like I was a bother to the staff at front desk! I normally stay with SPG and never have a problem with unfriendly workers!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a fancy hotel but has a great location, half a block from Times Square and the Brodaway theaters, price pretty affordable and also many places around to eat. Make sure to request a room located from floor 5th through 8th as they have been renovated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and friendly professional staff.....BUT no coffee maker (complimentary coffee ten floors below), only ONE chair in two bed room (others sat on bed or luggage racks), and no make up mirror.  [END]
[BEGIN] Comprato su booking circa un mese prima, servizio di prenotazione impeccabile, nessun imprevisto. Camere molto grandi e spaziose, cucina attrezzatissima. Molto pulito, personale molto gentile e disponibile, ci hanno anche aiutati a rintracciare un bagaglio smarrito nel tragitto dall'hotel all'areoporto. Ho pagato 1200 dollari per 5 notti a coppia.  [END]
[BEGIN] My friend and I stayed there for nine nights. It's not as bad as people say it is. Room was ok, cleaned every day, towels and sheats changed daily and the staff was very polite and friendly. It's really not that bad. I'd stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yeah, it's not the Hyatt, but it's cheap, convenient and there always seems to be rooms here.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Hotel is a good choice because it's in the heart of the island, close to lots of interesting places, but the staff are NOT friendly. Their slogan could be "Do not disturb us"  [END]
[BEGIN] High coolness factor and cute cabins, but bath was not clean, floor dirty and coffee machine (a good idea) was not working. Price, at almost $400 for a night, was well-beyond appropriate for what received.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tres petite chambre pour une personne, mais tres claire et tres propre, tres calme si sur cour Les cloisons sont un peu fines. Un peu cher pour la surface, mais personnel tres acceuillant.plutot pas mal pour NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mejoren el presio de las habitaciones peq Sean mas felxible el hiko del dueno es muy arrogante  [END]
[BEGIN] Although this hotel is located perfectly on the magnificient mile it is not a 4.5 star hotel. The furniture in the room was torn, no HD tv, and pieces were missing from out bathroom sink. For the money try a 3 star hotel in the same area.  [END]
[BEGIN] My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights and as the title states, there was nothing extraordinary about our stay. Great location along the Magnificent Mile, friendly staff. One downside was the in-suite internet was not included.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are clean but very small but considering the price to value and location who's comiaming. The front desk is on the second floor and the folks are very helpful. The heat worked great and the WiFi was of average speed. I'll come here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good location, close to subway, bus station. Times Square just a few minutes walk. Staff very friendly. Would be even better if they had coffee bar/drinks near reception.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zimmer war extrem winzig, geteiltes Bad ok, Sauberkeit auch in Ordnung, sehr zuvorkommender Rezeptionsservice, Lage top, Naehe U-Bahn, Klimaanlage funktionierte nicht: im September Temperaturen von 27 Grad Celsius im Zimmer.  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent location, quiet and within easy walk to most shops and attractions. Friendly and helpful reception staff, good breakfast - enough to fill you up until dinner time.  [END]
[BEGIN] We, a family of 6 with kids from 9-17, spent a week in NYC. Spacious accommodation at reasonable prices are not easy to find in NYC. Combined with central location and great service, BW Hospitality House ensured a great vacation for the whole family.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms weren't ready until 4:30 which was ok but they have no shower doors...water goes everywhere and makes a complete mess....you have to pay to print anything and you are paying 200-350 a night...over priced and barely mediocre at best...would not chose to stay here willingly again  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel has some of the smallest rooms I've ever stayed in. Two double beds barely fit in the room. The breakfast is subpar for a hotel free breakfast which makes it pretty bad. The location is convenient to Penn Station and Koreatown, but that is it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is in a convenient location close to theatre district. Rooms are nicely decorated lovely bathroom but test of hotel is currently being renovated. Building work over the road noisy in the morning. Good value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect location, but thats all... Breakfast is not continental, just some slices og white bread. No cheese, ham, bacon, peppers, cucumber or tomato...  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything a you'd want in a NYC hotel: good sized and clean room, excellent location, no bedbugs, quiet floor, free Sunday brunch, fast check-in and check-out. But the dirty toilet seat was unacceptable, not to mention a health hazard.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dated to shabby furnishings and interiors. Clean bathrooms. Rooms overheated, takes a long time to cool down. Convenient location. Ok for one night but needs some TLC.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had to cancel our reservation due to sudden illness less than 48 hours in advance of check-in and were charged a full nights rate plus taxes - no exceptions, no rain check unless the future booking is made at the time of cancellation. Book with care!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean rooms, good staff, good location, lots of parking space, average rooms, good sleep. Might stay there again when visiting Houston.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tremont is an older hotel that has character along with a friendly staff! The room was clean but a bit small. The location was great!!! Mike Ditka's restaurant is attached and offers a wonderful menu!!! It also provided the eating area for the continental breakfast !!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We had last year a superior room which we found satisfactory. Near by is Times Square, the music-house Birdland, restaurant Row, and the hotel has a breakfast restaurant with reasonable menue. We have stayed there many times, and have found it price-worth with everything just close by  [END]
[BEGIN] You pay for location. It is an old hotel very well located. So if you don't find a new hotel in the same area for about $230, this is a good option.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in a good location Macy;s, Penn station, Madison Squire garden, Empire state building etc are nearby. The hotel rooms are good but the service is below average. The hotel has changed from one chain to another chain; but the service remains the same.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location. Fabulous breakfast waffles, quite room with comfy bed. Bathroom recently refurbished. Negatives, dinning room very very small. Needs news carpets in bedroom (mud brown ). Over all a few small improvements would make this a gem of a place. For now iy scores avrrsge to good.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel in posizione centrale (a un centinaio di metri circa dalla Grand central station)  [END]
[BEGIN] A good value IF you get a room on the side that is not adjacent to the elevated train tracks; trains rumble through every five minutes until midnight or longer. Clean, pleasant staff, on edge of Chinatown and near Little Italy and not far from SoHo.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was the cheapest we could find in Chicago around the area we wanted to stay. It is fairly old, but our room was quite large and the location was good. We got a good, cheap, American style breakfast from the restaurant in the mornings.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service at the hotel was very good. But there were bedbugs. When I reported them to the front desk, they seemed dismissive like 'it couldn't happen here!" I thought that the ambiance was excellent along with the accommodations and proximity to lots of sights.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are not horrible but not very clean either. Staffs are not very friendly and hotel is not really in a great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] This location is horrible. It's noisy and I didn't get any sleep at all. I heard the freeway noise, the barking dog in the next room, the crying baby, the dump truck picking up trash. Although the bed was comfortable the location sucks.  [END]
[BEGIN] People do a very good job, everyone in the staff is very friendly and helpful. Rooms are new and clean. Building needs maintenance outside, corridors are dark, I think it needs lighter colours. I would recommend this hotel to a friend. Good value for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Mancanza di connessione WI FI ad internet.Bagni scomodissimi.Prezzi eccessivi negli extra.Carenza di accessori in camera ( pantofole, spazzola etc. )Camere senza doppi vetri e molto rumorose. Hall grande ma poco ricettiva. Prima colazione inclusa cara ma buona e abbastanza ricca. Personale gentile ed efficiente.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottimo hotel per la sua centralissima posizione , ideale per visitare la magnifica new york, stanze nella media nulla di particolare ma con tutti i confort, fantastica come dicevo la posizione , personale cordiale disponibile , lingua italiana, buona la pulizia , un po fastidiosi i condizionatori nelle stanze interne  [END]
[BEGIN] Highly recommend this hotel for its charm and professional and courteous staff. Location is terrific! We will definately be back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Central location, but a lot of this hotel is a little tired. Some of the rooms are being updated (Finally). Have stayed here multiple times, as it fits my needs for location. With the room upgrades, i am hoping the rest of the hotel gets the same treatment.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is lovely....stylish, really great customer service and lots of nice touches. The one MAJOR drawback for us was that the soundproofing is terrible and we could hear the couple next door "enjoying" themselves....eeek!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Safe, Chinese dominated area with range of OK oriental dominated restaurants. Close to good subway link into Manhattan, and La Guardia Airport.  [END]
[BEGIN] La posizione dell hotel era fantastica, a 20 metri dalla metropolitana e a neanche un chilometro da central park ma l'aria condizionata era rumorosissima e non si poteva usare di notte, inoltre cera solo un ascensore per un palazzo di nove piani, il che mi sembra un po pochino...  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean and large rooms, but thin walls, so we could hear our neighbours arguing. Breakfast not impressing, but ok concidering the price for the hotel  [END]
[BEGIN] Great front desk crew- super friendly & accommodating. Hotel is located walking distance to financial district, even Canal street/Chinatown is you're a hoofer like me. Rooms small but clean & adequate- who comes to sleep in NYC? 5 stars to the desk crew- they are what made it so nice-  [END]
[BEGIN] Currently staying at this hotel and this is my first night. The pillow has stains. Ac doesn't get really cold. Great location right by magnificent mile. No 24 hour convenience stores nearby. Connected to Illinois center with some good places to eat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lobby but standrard room is extremely small, cools style but not comfortable. Not suited for business traveler; no easy outlet for laptop, "desk" is tiny, no comforable chair, metal desk chair is the only chair in the room  [END]
[BEGIN] There are better values in Chicago and the rooms are slipping out of date quickly. The awesome location doesn't quite cover for a hotel thats no longer near the top of the pile. Used points to stay, otherwise I'd begrudge the price. You could do much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Sohotel is nice and clean. The rooms are clean and really small, we could just go around the bed, thats all. The personal were ok friendly. The location was central, that was convenient, for us getting around.  [END]
[BEGIN] bien situe proche du metro; petit dejeune inclus;; mais nettoyage de la chambre le minimum syndical;;  [END]
[BEGIN] Very conveniently located in mid-town Manhattan West. Room was good, service was also good. Noise of subway at lower floors (we had stayed at 3rd floor) may be a slight problem. Complimentary breakfast needs to improve.  [END]
[BEGIN] Proprio piccoline le camere, ma la posizione, il bagno in camera, la pulizia e il prezzo lo rendono un buon compromesso per NY. A due passi da Central Park, dal Lincon Center, dalla Columbus con bar ristoranti.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very convenient to IAH. Basic motel, but clean and comfortable. Bed was a little below par, but still fair sleep quality. Location was a plus for me this trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were clean but the hotel itself was just old.....not a "classic" old either....just old.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, but renovation is urgent which should be done early 2013 if I understood correctly. No free wifi which is a shame. No basic stuff such as boiler pot, the/coffee... Nothing really expressing French hospitality Need a lot of improvement since the rooms are not cheap  [END]
[BEGIN] We love Chicago. Priceline, 4 Stars and we got Hotel Felix this time. It should be 3 stars. Nice place, VERY small rooms!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is fine..but not great. The rooms are dark and the ceilings are concrete, which might appeal to some, but just feels cold to me. Service is prompt. No restaurant on site, but there is a bar with average food/drink.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing is impossible at the Waldorf, or so they say. I'm sure it is great if you are a head of state. If you are not ; get up on your feet. Minibar service has been discontinued and you have to buy water in street.  [END]
[BEGIN] This W is chic, great music, lobby, drinks etc.Front desk is satisfactory, the rooms are a bit small however the problem I had was with the whenever/wherever service and the shower temperature..this property is a hit or miss, you either luv it or you hate it. Good luck!  [END]
[BEGIN] The halls are scary looking (dirty and poorly maintained), the elevator feels like a tiny deathtrap, and the place appeared to be severely understaffed. But the room itself was fine, albeit small. But for the money (about 30% less than just about anything else) it was acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel is in a great location, with Penn Station across the street and Herald Square just around the corner. The garment district with Macy's and lots of retail is in walking distance. The staff is friendly and helpful. The rooms are clean and comfy, but small and very noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean basic room and good view. Staff very friendly and helpful! Beds comfortable. However, I think it is overpriced considering $55/night for parking and $10/night for internet access. Location convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were clean and beds were comfy. Bathrooms were nice as well. Not an overly fancy hotel but if you are looking for a great location and a clean place this is great. Elevators are slow on lower level floors.  [END]
[BEGIN] location is amazing in the heart of Union Square, but the room is not as good as location. if you will not waste your time in the room, this hotel worths!at least there is no bed bugs :)  [END]
[BEGIN] The room is good, tv is good, but there is no coffee brewer in the room so we have to ask the staff at the lobby. That's disappointing. After all, i also satisfied by the staff especially mourad, because he help my family a lot, about transportation and stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel just should be cheaper overpriced Wish the price was cheaper and Hotel was not an inch form apartment overpriced expected better from the four seasons  [END]
[BEGIN] our room was quite dark, only one window and it was the view of the back of the hotel... small bedroom  [END]
[BEGIN] High price with complimentary breakfast limited to muffins and coffee, very small room, and not overly helpful staff. It may be convenient to Times Square but there are more nicer, much more afforable places accessible via the Subway.  [END]
[BEGIN] Adequate clean no frills, but I would stay again. Make sure to check out well before 12 as they will bill another night if a minute over. 4 dollar charge to hold luggage on arrival before 3pm and that's per bag. Great location just great. Staff were nice I thought.  [END]
[BEGIN] Daniel provided us with wonderful check in service which was a great way to introduce and welcome us to NYC. However, the concierge desk was a very unplesant experience. Wrong directions, addresses, and a general lack of knowledge the city. Their main focus is selling bus tours.  [END]
[BEGIN] We booked this hotel online and the only good thing about it is the location. The service was terrible (room service) for breakfast...took over an hour. The room is old and dreary and the bathroom is pathetic. Hard to believe it was NY!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was relief to know the hotel was working properly after one of the worst hurricanes in new york, I was glad to have water, electricity and food. But it was far away of the top hotel I expected to find.  [END]
[BEGIN] Albergo mediocre, non comodissimo, la notte faceva freddo!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Caution as we also discovered after booking vacation that the standard room is only one double bed!!! We had to pay extra to have this changed to another hotel after discovering on our confirmation statement ! Not acceptable!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was a typically small NYC hotel room, but had a spectacular view of the river. Very clean. However, I have never seen such small towels in the bathroom & the toilet looked like one you would see in a preschool daycare. We laughed about that for days.  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to grand central makes very convenient to walk around Manhattan. Rooms were clean - bath tubs all seemed to have slow drains - bathrooms a bit dated - suggestions - include breakfast in the price. Layout rooms slightly better - especially for corporate bookings and families  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed 4 nights for business trip...the bed which they are very proud of is incredibly soft and this isn't a good thing...also it is huge and takes up most of the room. If you have any kind of back trouble don't risk this...  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel ligt centraal, vlakbij Time square en Central Park. Metro zit om de hoek. Er zit een goede broodjeszaak iets verderop die niet echt duur is. Hotel is standaard, nette kamers en schoon. Een mooi hotel om New York te verkennen.  [END]
[BEGIN] nothing to brag about.. was nice but nothing what we expected. the cityscape bar was nice and friendly with a great view..  [END]
[BEGIN] The location was perfect, the personnel friendly and the price reasonable, but the room was small and very noisy, due to an A/C unit, that could not be shut of. Next time same location but another hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only issue was I arrived wanting to eat from room service quickly and get to bed and found quickest time they could promise for pasta was 40mins which I find unacceptable. I could not convince them to deliver quicker and they seemed very happy to accept my "don't bother then"  [END]
[BEGIN] The title sums it up. I don't have another hotel to compare it to, but it met my needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good location; staff was ok; breakfast was ok; price is high; room very small,but clean Altogether we'd recommend it  [END]
[BEGIN] bien situe tarif a peu pres avantageux(c'est new york)tres propre mais sanitaire en commun et chambre tres petite.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel esta muy ien ubicado,es comodo,ero no son tan amables como esperaba,no dan mucha info al turista pero el lugar es de privilegiolo recomiendo  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is always crowded and noisy. The location is good but the block is the most crowded of Manhathan! The prices are reasonable in comparison with the other options in the same neighborhood. The positive point is the private bathroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] C'est vraiment l'emplacement qui fait l'interet de cet hotel, idealement situe pour randonner dans le centre de Manhattan et au-dela. Sinon chambres moyennes, un peu "shabby" comme ils disent la-bas, et proprete "so-so". Pas de charme particulier, mais pratique, quoi!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to stay near Times Square and the theaters that's the best choice regarding prices. The staff was very, very kind and atencious with us, although the hotel itself is a little old and the room is too small.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hits: - Had a room when most of the other hotels were full - Clean - Typical Hampton Inn amenities Misses: - Pricey - Typical tight NYC room for mid-low priced property - Slow replenishment of breakfast items Note: - Appears to have mostly leisure guests  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice big fridge very rare in the USA. small bathroom and room, thin walls next door complained of noise from the tv. Good views from upper floors. Didn't feel five star.  [END]
[BEGIN] Muy bien situado, cerca de todo. La habitacion estremadamente pequena, con muy poco lugar para las valijas, solamente se puede guardar una, la otra quedo sobre la comoda y a penas nos podiamos mover. La gente en recepcion poco colaboradora y de espanol nada. Nosotros nos decepcionamos, esperabamos otra cosa.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was an ok hotel. For us the location to visit New York was ok, and at the end it was just for sleeping :-)  [END]
[BEGIN] The main reason I picked this hotel was because it is in the Starwoods network. Also, the location is great and I was able to get it at a good price. I would say, overall, the hotel met my expectations. Expensive Valet parking ($50).  [END]
[BEGIN] I checked in and the front staff is serviceable. I had to have housekeeping come which they did and they agreed that it was a bad situation. Were they gracious? Not really.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still can't get over the prices for New York City mid-town hotel rooms. I must research harder my next trip. $230+ for a tiny hovel, with faded and dated decor, weak AC and terrible plumbing (the water kept vacilating from scalding to freezing).  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very well located. this is a very big plus. but the room is not big enough. our bathroom was dirty & smelling. breakfast was very poor. no healthy food & giving plastic cups, folks, knives & carton plats is ridiculous.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has a nice view to the south Manhattan and quite nice rooms. Sauna and pool and gym are complimentary... good! Down side: they carge you 13 USD for the internet connection No breakfast  [END]
[BEGIN] perfect location to reach out to nearly all nyc spots via walking or metro. rooftop bar is nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recomendo. Fica-se fora das ruas mais movimentadas. A vista vale !  [END]
[BEGIN] They checked us in early which was nice. The front desk seemed pretty knowledgeable about the area and transportation. The room had ok furniture but the walls had scuff marks on them. The bathroom had stains on the floor but it was alright for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too expensive for a very very small room. The location is good. But the concierge is very helpfull.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is an average hotel in a great location.. The rooms are quite large for New York standard, but other than that I dont think it has much going for it... Very basic and average hotel... I think the 3.5 star rating of this hotel is very generous.  [END]
[BEGIN] Views are excellent and location nice. Building is nothing special - rather mediocre. Hotel dated.Roomservice and foodquality poor. Surprided they go under Ritz Carltion...maybe Mariott should have been better. There are better places to stay in NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel has a nice look, but don't look further. Our room was not clean. Also we had bedbugs. Most of the staff is friendly. The room was very noisy. But it is in a splendid surrounding.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent hotel for the price although very odd location  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel in a nice area within walking distance to good restaurants and shopping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was fairly big - however, all a bit sterile. The bath tub was small and the room poorly lit and starting to look a bit tired. Would prefer to stay somewhere else for the next visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would benefit from a visit from the 60 minute makeover team. Very run down. Very noisey with doors banging all night & people shouting up & down the hallway at all hours. Curtains all holes. Never again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is not elegant or plush, the staff are not friendly or very helpful but the location is amazing and the rooms although very dated are clean and surprisingly roomy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have been there two times, first time it was an amazing room in one tower, second time, it was very average room in another tower. So very different quality and the same price. Location is very good, Gilt restaurant and bar in teh hotel is very good aswell  [END]
[BEGIN] only enough room to waik around the bed on 2 sides. the cases used up the space at the bottom of the bed.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a room with a bed and a bathroom, which was all we needed. It was clean enough to sleep in, and we didn't have any problems or major complaints, especially considering the price and location.  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a great 2 double bed room, comfy beds, & large bathroom. The room had wear and tear with stains on the rug, there were food crumbs which made me think it was not vacuumed. There was a stale, musty odor in the room. The location was very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] A busy hotel with a very convenient location, and good front office services. The rooms are quite dated and in need of refurbishment, although the beds are consistent with Marriott's high standards.  [END]
[BEGIN] SITUATION IDEALE. DES LA SORTIE DE L' HOTEL ,C'EST LE GRAND PLONGEON DANS TIME SQUARE. GENIAL. L'HOTEL EN LUI MEME EST UN CORRECT 2 * , BIEN ENTRETENU. A 10 m , DE QUOI SE RESTAURER CORRECTEMENT MAIS QUAND MEME AU TARIF NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is located in walking distance to the Galleria and restaurants. This is a typical Hilton Garden Inn. The staff was extremely friendly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location in the centre of the theatre district of NYC. Hotel staff were very friendly and helpful. The rooms were very clean and although small were comfortable. However the road noise was a drawback.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value this close to downtown. Room was adequate. Travelled uptown by metro every night no problem. No facilities so eat out and bring your drinks in. Some good places to eat close by in China town or Little Italy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location in the middle of Times Square. Walking distance from almost everything. Price is high and the bedroom is very very little.  [END]
[BEGIN] Me and my partner was looking for a central hotel for an OK price. Bentley proved to be a good choice in terms of both location and price.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you want to be in Times Square for under $140 then go for it but if you want a nice or decent place this is NOT it. No smoke alarms or AC in any unit  [END]
[BEGIN] If you like things that are tiny and have really low expectations, you might not be disappointed. If you have less than $200, and it's this or the bus station, this is preferable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was very large and comfortable and clean. Price was fair. Had to wait for front staff to check in and ask questions. No area information available in lobby or from staff. Location is a ways away from Houston proper but, had plenty of stores and eateries around it.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed 8 nights at this hotel. It was great. Location was within walking distance to everything. Room was good. Would recommend it to anyone, family, couples.  [END]
[BEGIN] I recommend it to tourists unfussy. Good for those who just want to have a bed for a few hours of sleep at night. A good breakfast. Otherwise, unfriendly staff, mediocre comfort.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Good... The View, The Bed, The location, The neighborhood, The price The Bad... Nothing too bad The Ugly.... Everything past the front door. It is in dire need of a renovation. This could be a very good hotel, if they would spend some money on fixing it up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Een simpel hotel, met als pre dat je behalve een slaapkamer en een badkamer, ook een aparte woonkamer annex keuken hebt. Niet superdelux, maar gewoon goed voor een goede prijs. De wijk is leuk en gemoedelijk, met veel restaurants in de buurt.  [END]
[BEGIN] Large room, good location. Decor is bland. Checked in late and bedding was dirty and stained so had to sleep on it until the next day. Front desk could not change a $50 bill.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little stay here. Room size was generous. Furnishings are dated but just fine. The lobby was impressive. Best thing about our great deal was the staff. They could not have been more pleasant, accomodating and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super Amazing location. Very reasonable price. Smaller than average Manahttan rooms. Hard to control room temps. Uncomfortable beds. Did the trick for a quick in and out trip to the city  [END]
[BEGIN] Really disappointed in the room size, even for New York. Crowded elevator was tiny too. Staff was friendly and attentive and price was good, even considering the view was into a very dark and small alley.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was sober maar zeer netjes, ook de gedeelde badkamers. Geen enkel problemen gehad. Personeel sloom maar zeker vriendelijk! Het hotel ligt vlak bij de rode lijn (metro) 2 minutjes lopen en je bent daardoor zomaar in het midden van Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel adatto ad una clientela giovane ed informale,non adatto a famiglie con bambini.Camere molto piccole,la pulizia delle stesse lascia un po' a desiderare.Il personale del ricevimento non e' amichevole.Ottima l'ubicazione ad un isolato dallEmpire state building ed il costo contenuto.  [END]
[BEGIN] albergo ben fatto, molto yuppy, molto di tendenza, ma stanze davvero invivibili; piccole al limite estremo, servizi costosi (bar, etc.). Mancano pure i cassetti in camera: sara' di tendenza, ma avere solo scaffali e' scomodo  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms need updating (time for flat screen TVs) but can't beat the location. Doormen are very nice. Understaffed front desk so forget calling down. Lots of great attractions, restaurants, etc. off the Mag Mile. Excellent rate one of the booking services.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: good location. Bed is comfortable. Cons: Nothing special. Room boring. Downstairs restaurant terrible (I had sushi and wings). Towels are too tough. Front desk ok. Will I stay here again ? Prob not.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is great. Rooms are big (had a corner delux). The only negative but for me important point is the bathroom. It's is old and the bathtub was dirty as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed for 9 nights, a great location close to center of Manhattan. Bad internet and only in the lobby, if you want to get internet in the room is too expensive, 18 dollars per day. The hotel is ok, the employees are very kind and helpful. A good experience.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice older hotel. the side of the hotel by the busy street is noisy in the evening and early morning. I was disappointed to not have a refrigerator in the room, usually I have had them n newer Marriott's. Overall it was pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just rally like the place. It's home for me and just a fe blocks away from where i live. If you want to live in a hotel but never stay in one then this is for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Un poco caro para lo que es... Esperaba mas. Muy buena habitacion, hermosa vista, muy bien hubicado.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bag not great. You get to listen to the guy hacking in the Room next to you all night. Bathroom way too small need to close the door to move around  [END]
[BEGIN] Beside the beautiful lobby and a good location this place doesn't offer much. The rooms are clean and reasonable sized but pretty much worn out. The bathrooms need a refurbishment they have standard of the 70's.  [END]
[BEGIN] Priceline is more accurate in their ranking. Location is nice. Staff is friendly. Heating system is a slightly loud when it is activated sporadically.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a place to crash, nothing more. It isn't even very confortable, or very clean (I mean old carpets and shower curtains, dark narrow halls...). But it's in the heart of Time Square, steps away from everything. You get what you pay for, right?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good customer service, great location on the Upper West Side. Room I had was kind of dark, but overall cheerful.  [END]
[BEGIN] First trip to the Big Apple for us to see a broadway play. This hotel was huge! Service was pretty fast and effecient. Room was what we expected. I'm sure the price was good for the location but it seemed expensive to us!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location, great lobby very out dated guest rooms. I was given two separate rooms and both rooms bed linen was soiled, stained. Carpet was messy, looked nasty....  [END]
[BEGIN] I would say avarege hotel, small Room but huge price (above $200). The only plus - its in the middle of Manhattan so you can walk to Central park or WTC (takes around 40-60 min)  [END]
[BEGIN] L'hotel non e' dei piu' moderni (cmq stavano per cominciare lavori di ristrutturazione) ma e' pulito, abbastanza silenzioso e la posizione e' il suo punto di forza!!! Si trova a due passi dalla subway e cmq nel centro di Manahattan. Lo consiglio  [END]
[BEGIN] Imagine Joan Collins today without any makeup or helpful trips to "spas". Peeling hunter green and light pink wallpaper but the location is so super that you almost come to terms with the high price you paid. Staff were helpful and did I mention the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Allerton is in a great location. Parking is super expensive. Great Restaurants nearby although not in the hotel. If you fancy old style European hotels--ie somewhat dated tiny rooms with minute bathrooms and tiny elevators, then you will love the Allerton. If you don't you won't. Simple as that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good price for the room. But it's not four star. Three at a push. But makes up for it because it's cheap. Bad point: music too loud in lobby. Good point: great king size bed  [END]
[BEGIN] AC in room makes annoying noise even if turned off. Front desk does not care about customer's taxi request. I had to wait 30 minutes. Room was relatively clean. Bit noisy from the highway outside. Free wifi never worked well inside the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was just ok... a bit of a musty smell but the rooms were nice. The bar staff and especially the Manager of the bar were the rudest inconsiderate people I have ever come across and they definitely should not be working in the public eye !  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are large, ok, but the hotel is directly next to a highway and the windows do not shut completely as well as there was a vending and ice machine right in front of my door, so I could not really sleep very well... Breakfast is really minimum...  [END]
[BEGIN] Zeer goede ligging, ideaal beloopbaar naar o.a. Times Square etc.............. Zeker aan te raden, zou nooit in de drukte van Times Square willen slapen, dit hotel is ideaal gelegen. Metro goed beloopbaar, Columbus Circle.  [END]
[BEGIN] Reviews talk about the renovation. They must have missed my room. A/C is still extremely loud. Akea would be a huge upgrade. Wifi is snails pace. Great location. Near all of the high class hotels. Not what I expected given the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] HOTEL TRES CORRECT - CHAMBRE POUR 4 DE BONNE TAILLE - ACCUEIL AGREABLE - LE SEUL INCONVENIENT SONT LES ENVIRONS - QUARTIER CHINATOWN , QUI NECESSITE DE FAIRE ABSTRACTION DES ODEURS - ET LE PONT TRES BRUYANT A PROXIMITE !  [END]
[BEGIN] Go the room through Priceline. Staff was pleasant. The room was small. Space for only one person to walk between bed and tv.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is good hotel if you want to party all night, because it's too noisy to get much sleep.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, but clean. Prices are reasonable and it is near the subway. Elevator is small and slow. A reasonable choice for the budget minded.  [END]
[BEGIN] ottima posizione, fermata metropolitana a due passi.camera esseziale,confortevole e pulita,purtroppo condizionatore vecchio e rumoroso.Personale alla reception non molto loquace,ma gentile e disponibile,pur non parlando in italiano e noi un inglese non eccezionale,ci e' sempre stato di aiuto.sala colazione un po' piccola rispetto al numero degli ospiti,colazione non male.  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess from New York standards and prices it was okay. The Continental Breakfast was not too bad, but the front desk staff was not too helpful at times. Good location, but I wouldn't stay there again if I could help it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pluspunten: goeie bedden, mooie moderne kamers, goeie ligging, goede verbinding openbaar vervoer, behulpzaam aan de receptie, gratis koffie/thee 's morgens Negatief: slechte douche, heel weinig plaats in de kamer en badkamer (zowel om te bewegen als om bagage te zetten), wifi verbinding was niet sterk genoeg  [END]
[BEGIN] carino abbastanza nuovo pulito eravamo al 4 piano e si sente abbastanza la caldaia in mezzo al palazzo-ma una volta addormentati si dorme bene-dopo tutto quello che si cammina-magari e meglio dormire su un piano piu alto- pero siam stati molto bene comunque  [END]
[BEGIN] Seriously, the concierges at the Sheraton New York are lazy. Only if they ascertain that they stand to make money in providing assistance to you will they pay attention to your needs. Otherwise, they send you packing to the New York City Information Center which is located across the street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, but the elevator was painfully slow - and crowded. No concierge on duty on a Sunday.  [END]
[BEGIN] Suite was fine, but the room was noisy and cold/drafty (our stay was in late October) the location is good, but if you're planning on spending lots of time in your room, and resting peacefully for a good night's sleep, think about other options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing location (across from 30 Rock) at a cheap price. But don't expect a room larger than your bed. Nice staff, zero amenities.  [END]
[BEGIN] There are nicer, cheaper rooms available at different hotels in the neighboring area. For the rates that they charged per night, I would have expected much nicer rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] My room was falling apart with defective outlets and ancient furniture. Flat screen but no high def. Website pics are very deceptive. The pool is not that nice...  [END]
[BEGIN] very old building, nice people. far away from everything, rooms are quiet. but needs some paint all the building. the pool didnt have water. the restaurant es far from the main building. most of the people speak spanish and English.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is small but it is really all you need. We visited NYC for 2 nights and if you are spending a lot of time in your room, you are not enjoying New York!  [END]
[BEGIN] Maids carts are spread all over the hallways. Not worth the expensive price you pay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Park Central hat eine sehr gute Lage. Das Hotel ist ein reines Touristenhotel, leider wirkt es dadurch auch abgewohnt, da nicht viel in die Renovierung der Zimmer gesteckt wird. Aber wenn man nicht zuviel erwartet ist es der ideale Ausgangspunkt um NY zu entdecken.  [END]
[BEGIN] LOTS of restaurants close by, easy to walk to. Room cleanup service was crummy...coffee maker left dirty. A bit close to highway so noisy in the morning. Breakfast was good, check in was good. I would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This deluxe 2 bedroom suite gives no privacy. There are 2 beds with no doors. When entering the room the bathroom is right in front of you. My husband and I were in the same room with our teenaged girls and no privacy for intimacy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is perfect - you cant ask for better location but the rooms are very ordinary. and the bathrooms very very small with a very small sinc. if the rooms are not imortant for you, you will enjoy the lobby and friendly staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel room was extremely basic but comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly and the location was fantastic.  [END]
[BEGIN] adequate but not worth the money, in my opinion. burger joint looked good, didn't try it  [END]
[BEGIN] This Chicago landmark always meets expectations. Yes, the property is old and even a little tired, but it's always clean and very comfortable. The very accomodating staff make you feel welcome and at home.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hip hotel and bar is good but it's like walking into a nightclub every time you come back to hotel. Not suitable for older travellers. Bathroom wall is see through so nit suitable for those timid, families or sharing. Check in staff friendly but concierge. Ok but overall disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good location, cheap. Rooms are old and should be refreshed. In Europe it would have like 1,5 - 2 stars. Price/location/standard - very good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: Great Location. Right on Michigan Avenue and walkable to a ton of great sites, shopping, and restaurants. Staff was nice. Cons: Just a little room and an average price. $15 to use your computer. Look around -- there has got to be a better deal downtown.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible Service, small rooms, alot of noise, not clean.Hotel appears tired and dated. The staff were very unhelpful and not very friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed on a room only basis. Was our first time in NYC and were not sure about where to stay. The reputation of the hotel is a lot grander than the hotel it's self. Staff very helpful, good location, but would choose a different hotel on a return trip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Besonderes hervorzuheben ist die ideale Lage in der Naehe des TimesSquare. Wir hatten eine Suite gebucht, was unwesentlich teurer wie ein normales Zimmer war. Dadurch hatten wir jedoch ein grosszuegiges Platzangebot. Reception unfreundlich, Zimmerservice ok. Zimmer waren am 15:00 nocht nicht bezugsfertig, konnten dafuer aber erst um 14:00 auschecken  [END]
[BEGIN] Location... Good Rooms... (Shower Fixtures need up-date):Room Temp. control (poor) Complimentary Breakfast... good variety There are BETTER... for LESS Expense P.S. "Let your fingers do the walking"... Shop around!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not for a honeymoon but a great place to stay with friends for a weekend getaway such as an international marathon. Spending the weekend in town with 53000 other runner is a pure joy. So one can imagine that the hotel isn't the top priority.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is nice, it is a great hotel to stay at for being at the park and listening to music in the summer. It is dated, and a little worn, but definitely a classic Chicago hotel. We loved it, and had great service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel Azure is recent vernieuwd. Het ziet er prima uit. De enige aanmerking is dat de kamer nogal aan de kleine kant is. De ligging van het hotel is ideaal, namelijk aan de rand van Soho, Little Italy, Chinatown en Tribeca.  [END]
[BEGIN] A standard queen is tiny - barely enough room to get around the bed. The rooms were too small to be comfortable - though the staff was really friendly and the location was excellent. Wouldn't go back because of the room size.  [END]
[BEGIN] The people were wonderful but the hotel is badly in need of a facelift and room renewal. The furniture is starting to look tacky and there really isn't a main lobby to sit and have coffee. One of the best concierges I've ever worked with. The location is perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] The first person you see and the last person you see is Mohammed the doorman. He is indicative of the service--very friendly and helpful, especially to the tired traveler.  [END]
[BEGIN] Provides what you'd expect of such a hotel, not more Decoration a little bit aged No free wifi access from rooms Noisy rooms  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent location, but i did find this hotel to be expensive. i've no major problem as such with the hotel however, the room was tiny and you couldn't turn on the a/c at night because even on the low setting is was ridiculously loud.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have stayed in much nicer hotels that were much cheaper than 400 to 500 / night!!!! I'm not your occasional traveler. Just like the heading states great location, but way overpriced. Very small rooms. Conceirge staff was very helpful!  [END]
[BEGIN] undeniable perfect location hence price tag but we book the room because it advertises for the newly renovated room. Well we did not get one! come early to ensure parking.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice location, close to Mag Mile shops and resturants. The room was clean and quiet. The beds were terrible. They have adjustable mattress setting from firm to soft. The theory is great but it did not work. It could possibly be the worse mattress I ever slept on.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has a very good location and the room is OK, but the bathroom and the shower are awful!! the sound of the pipes is deafening!! and it sounds the all night!!! Really, really bad.....................  [END]
[BEGIN] Pulito, centrale ed economico. Personale non molto simpatico ma disponibile.  [END]
[BEGIN] This HoJo is in a great location for Chicago business. It does not have all amenities, but is clean, convenient, and fairly priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff were all very pleasant and went out of ther way to help. The room was small but adequate There was no breakfast which was a negative  [END]
[BEGIN] Very small rooms, with not too many amenities. No coffee maker, nor any hair dryer and plastic cups for drinking water! Very clean rooms and within walking distance from nice restaurants and Walgreens but no views to the rooms. Staff is very friendly, and free internet access.  [END]
[BEGIN] esta cerquita del metro , los 24 h xa desayunar, starbucks, dunkin, y limpio q te cambian sabanas y toallas tds ls dias  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location but small rooms and noisely air con.  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT LOCATION! Tacky lobby, crappy rooms, digusting bathrooms........ far too expensive. Out of date.......... however.....GREAT LOCATION! The Hyatt should have a total makeover to come up to todays standard.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Hotel Edison very nice rooms clean but on the small size, hallways very warm if hot out side, no ventilation. Restraunt attached to hotel very good food and not expensive at all, very good location. 8/05  [END]
[BEGIN] The facility is aged and not that well maintained - doors that don't close, exterior paint deteriorated, dated fixtures and furniture. It is very convenient to the University of Chicago, where I was doing business.  [END]
[BEGIN] La posizione dell hotel era fantastica, a 20 metri dalla metropolitana e a neanche un chilometro da central park ma l'aria condizionata era rumorosissima e non si poteva usare di notte, inoltre cera solo un ascensore per un palazzo di nove piani, il che mi sembra un po pochino...  [END]
[BEGIN] The Breakfast only went untill 9 A.M. that is a little early to end breakfast even on the weekends.But over all the price was good and the location was good for us. If in the area again I would be ok with staying here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel but we were spoiled from our visit to the Country Inn in San Antonio. Needs some extra attention to the cleanliness of the room. Breakfast was OK  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here end of october, staff very friendly and helpful. Cafe breakfast lovely, hotel worth the money for sheer location, very clean and tidy. Value for money it's not the Hilton but we didn't pay for that!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a fantastic location, right of Broadway in Midtown Manhattan just steps from a subway station. The hotel is old and cramped but clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Posizione ottima, proprio a due passi da Times Square...e nonostante tutto camere silenziose! Camera di dimensioni davvero ristrette! Anche letto ed armadio molto piccoli! Bagno sempre pulito con doccia enorme!  [END]
[BEGIN] I had low expectations, honestly. But this was a decent hotel in a great location. The hotel shows some wear, but it was very clean and adequate for a great shopping trip to the city. Great value this time of year too ( ny in December is very pricey).  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is perfect (Midtown) and the newly renovated room was very nice. However, the staff were surly and not very friendly or helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad, noisy and expensive to park, small room, restaurant was also expensive. Friendly staff  [END]
[BEGIN] I would give it a 2, but the people working there were very nice. Very unimpressive and nothing like the pictures online. They made a mistake by updating the lobby (but not the rooms). The location is nice - but the rooms are very old  [END]
[BEGIN] Room 226-- Not horrible- had a hair dryer and ironing board and iron. Not a big deal to some people but it is to me! Unit was clean and tolerable for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Older hotel - adjoining door - I could hear a child talking all the time. Not in a great area of town. Better hotels & better part of town about 8 miles away. Service good, staff very nice. Needs a lot of updating. Free breakfast was good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Price was better than most of Manhattan, there was free wifi and attached parking. Otherwise it was not much. Claustrophobic corridors, no curtains, lousy view, not much in the way of amenities. But it was what we needed spending most of our time sightseeing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small cramped room, Dust bunnies on the floor. Television was not HD, You have to pay for internet. I would have expected much more for them price we paid. You are totally paying for the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice businesshotel, well situated and very good staff specially at the bar. Lounge also serviced nicely, although breakfast buffet at the lounge could be better - definitely too few choices. Support from concierge a bit slow and room was made after 16:00 the first day, which is very late  [END]
[BEGIN] nice clean hotel. currently finishing renovations. Rooms are small but renovated. no amenities in hotel. quick service. VERY close to times square (45th between Broadway and 6th av.) good for 115 bucks US per night.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family and I stayed here for 5 days and it was acceptable based on the price. The room was clean and the staff was helpful. We spent most of our time enjoying New York and only slept in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel situated on downtown Chicago. Very close to millennium park and all main attractions. Free wifi connection in the hall of the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Typical hotel, just at the center of Theater District, 100 m away from Times Sq. and Broadway. Some subway stations of diff. lines are also on 2-3 minutes by step. Rooms are tiny, just a narrow pass around the bed. Free Internet access via 2 computers at the ground floor.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was your standard run of the mill rooms, nothing extraordinary. Location was very convenient to Penn Station and the Javitz Center, although the street was rather dark at night. No real complaints other than the fact that I thought it was rather pricey at roughly $450/night (including taxes).  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent only two nights there. The hotel is alright. But service was so poor... They will have to work very hard on this matter.  [END]
[BEGIN] nothing special here, but purchased well in advance, the price was right. Hotel alleges to have been renovated but it is not apparent. It is well worn, elevators come to a hard stop, it is a tired but adequate place  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is clean an staff is fine. Location is not the most convenient in Chicago. You are better off staying in River North for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here with my family of 5 in July 2012, the hotel suited our needs and was the best value for money in Manhattan. However don't expect a 5 star experience, it's a basic and clean hotel in a good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were clean, very small, could hear everything going on around you (no privacy and hard for kids to sleep), pretty bare bones. But completely fine. Would stay again for the price. Kids loved swimming pool!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean room and generally good service. Noisy rooms though, plings from the lift is well heard through the night as well as test-beeps from the fire detectors. Breakfast was ok but it's a lottery getting hold of a place to sit if you're not earlier than average tourist.  [END]
[BEGIN] small room without frize,clean. expensive.the hotel is in a excelent location  [END]
[BEGIN] Not exactly the nicest place I've ever stayed. Tiny rooms. Location is great. If you're not gonna be spending much time in the room, it's worth the stay for the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing special, but pretty clean and cheap. To me, it's the best place for young travellers because of its good position inside Manhattan and its very good rates. Nothing special about the staff but, once again, at this price you can't ask much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Would stay again but would advise missing breakfast as staff to a man did not appear to understand the language of English speakers.Much better to obtain breakfast elsewhere or in the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Christmas atmosphere, beautiful Christmas trees, festive music. Very Cody lobby when been out in the bitter cold! starbucks access from hotel!! Staff helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is walking distance to the subway, penn station, times square. The only friendly person was the concierge. Very nice and had some good suggestions for dining. Moderately priced for New York.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is a 3 star but the location is 5 star mid way on central park south. View of Park is excellent on the upper floors (I stayed on 21). Hotel is next to Plaza Hotel and 5th Avenue. Need more info on hotel would like to stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very pleasantly surprised by the interior of the hotel lobby and the room. Very well maintained and beautifaul. It was a shame that the service was poor and the food was no better than ordinary. I would have expected better and was slightly disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] paid too much for what we got. For about $400/night you would think they would include wireless! Not impressed and won't stay there again!  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is perfect, staff were friendly. Was disappointed with room, needed updoing. Website makes rooms look alot nicer then they are. Nice whirlpool bath but didn't work and was broken in areas, not good. Bed was very comfy though, great for after long walks all day.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at the New York Marriott East Side for two nights while attending a business conference. My room was small but clean and comfortable. I did eat a late night dinner at the hotel the night I arrived and it was nothing special.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is convenient to the airport, and that's the reason I stayed. The room was OK. You have to get key to the mini-bar from the bell captain, which is a pain in the butt if you use their automatic check in, and you don't know (I didn't).  [END]
[BEGIN] We were a party of 3, stayed here for 5 nights, it was all good. Location was great, staff was friendly, housekeepers cleaned everyday. The place is like a european hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Prachtig hotel van buiten, maar het interieur van de kamers was gedateerd. Men was aan het renoveren, maar daardoor werkte de elektronische kluis en ijskast niet. Kamer is niet te groot. Vond kamer te duur voor hetgeen aangeboden werd.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pennsylvania is een prima hotel op een top locatie. Vlakbij Time Square, Empire State Building, Penn Station, Bushaltes, Metro etc. Het hotel is wel wat verouderd, maar wij hadden elke dag schone handdoeken en een opgemaakt bed. En een goede warme douche!  [END]
[BEGIN] Paid 110.00$ for 2 days parking,Gas tank was emptied in the parking lot by thieves, just enough gas left to arrive to next gas station.Hotel subcontract parking,charged big bucks and not responsible. Shame!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here for 3 nights. The location is great and the service was good. The rooms on the other hand, were tiny. The amenities were nice and the beds were comfortable, but the space was very, very small. The overall value was good though.  [END]
[BEGIN] After reading some reviews I was worried about staying at this hotel. While it does require updating, it was clean and cosy with a great central location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel in nice location. Bit room smelled of terrible body odor which ruined the stay.  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed at this hotel for one night while attending a conference. The staff was extremely friendly and the hotel was clean. The rooms were spacious and quiet which allowed me to sleep in. Overall this is a good hotel when in the Chicago area  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is very dated but the price was right and the location perfect, right across from Penn Station with easy access to trains to Newark Airport (and JFK). Just a few blocks from Time Square and one block to Macy's.  [END]
[BEGIN] My family stayed at the Clarion in August 2004. The room was clean and comfortable and the staff at the hotel were very accommodating. Excellent location and safe walking any time day or evening. Restaurant on premises was also very good with a good variety on menu.  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel en si estaba bastante bien, lo mejor la ubicacion, podias ir andando a todas partes, el precio comparado con lo demas estaba muy bien. Muy contentos. En invierno nunca mas, un frio que te mueres.  [END]
[BEGIN] Older hotel in need of some work but comfortable and best of all within walking distance of Times Square, Central Park etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was clean, location is OK. Stayed 2 nights and will definitely return on my next visit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can't beat it for price and location, right across the street from Grant Park. It is an old hotel, the walls are thin and the furniture worn in. Nothing awful about it, a good place to sleep during a busy weekend or for just an overnight.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros - As other reviewers have mentioned the hotel is situated at the heart of downtown chicago .Few minutes from most of the popular attractions.There is a taxi stand just outside the hotel,which adds to the benefit. The rooms are mediocre. Cons - Expensive Food , Rude Staff.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed there a few years ago and I thought it was ok. There is no pool, rooms are very small and the bathrooms are small. There was an excellent restaurant, overpriced though. I would only recommend this hotel if you are staying for 2-4 nights.  [END]
[BEGIN] v trendy and v dark! met lots of fellow brits groping their way round the walls. particularly amused to be in the library - too dark to read! good location near the columbus circle so from that point of view it works but wouldn't rush back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very dingy place, corridors reminded me of something out of a horror movie! Very basic but had big rooms, and beds were comfy. Brilliant location, staff were nice and friendly. Has it's very own Central Perk cafe! Nothing fancy, would stay here for price and location and nothing much else!  [END]
[BEGIN] CQ Downtown is good only for business. The Financial District is empty after 7 PM and difficult to find food on Sunday evening. Rooms were tiny and need some refurbishing. Breakfast too expensive. You have in the ... bathroom a`coffee maker.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty hip, hot and happening place with stunning public areas and extremely tiny rooms. Great location just off Central Park. Arrogant staff mediocre service for price level.  [END]
[BEGIN] oud hotel met slecht sanitair. echte service is er niet. kamers aan de voorkant hebben een mooi uitzicht over de Hudson. een hotel dat je alleen kiest voor de prijs. Ik ben er 5 maal geweest en heb het overleeft.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het hotel vond ik wel oke (qua prijs). De kamer was ook prima (fijn bed). Alleen het ontbijt stelt erg weinig voor: een, in plastic verpakte, muffin of scone. Verwacht daar dus niet veel van. Je kunt beter elders ontbijten.  [END]
[BEGIN] the best part of this hotel is its location. its close to the park, all midtown attractions, and the subway stop is a stone's throw away. otherwise, there is nothing extraordinary about this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] double room was to small even for one person, very small bathroom, all lamps have white uncosy light. But the bed was very comfortable. Really. So for me there is a 3+ star hotel. Stuff very nice and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good property that is close to my office in NYC. Nothing fancy, but clean and nice with good service. The rooms are small. Not much else to say on this property -- it is all about the easy location to the financial district. Enough said.  [END]
[BEGIN] I booked through hotwire. The location was excellent, however the room I got was the smallest room available. It was no bigger than a cruise ship inside cabin. Housekeeping forgot to leave soap and towels one day. Overall its an ok hotel for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wrong end of manhattan, pretty soulless and stark especially the bar. Maight be good if you're ddoing business in the area. No sense of luxury here  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent location and easy to get to. Staff helpful and polite. Hotel decor in need of tiding. We had no extract fan in the ensuite so the room was a little stale smelling.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel feels expensive for the value it gives. Additionally, there is a restaurant in the first floor, that is used as a sort of bar-discoteque in the night, and the noise is heard in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very nice hotel for a family trip to New York City. Room was comfortable, with a refrigerator and microwave. Nice breakfast buffet is included. Close to Times Square, which makes sightseeing in Manhattan very convenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Location. We had to pay for parking and could walk to Galleria. Staff very helpful. I left my shoes and they found them for me. Beds not so great. No WiFi in rooms!  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought the price was very high for a very average hotel room. The room was clean but looked a little worn. The location was convenient and the staff very friendly. I was very surprised and disappointed they did not have room service for breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms were a good size plenty of space. Poor service in resturant and a very poor choice for breakfast not worth the $15 we paid each. Location of hotel was ok. Reception staff and bell boy were miserable and unhelpful. The Hotel could do with upgrading as its alittle tired.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a 25 million dollar renovation I expected more. Rooms were good size. Dont stay in room 245 you will be awakened but the thrusting of the gargage. Get a high floor. Make sue ac works we switched rooms due to it. Small lobby area. Location ok  [END]
[BEGIN] First the negatives- Overpriced. The rooms were fairly small and the hallways were just depressing design-wise. And the positives....Location great, service good. Clean....Comfy beds  [END]
[BEGIN] Nos parecio una buena eleccion. Huele un poco a cigarro en las areas comunes, como el hall de espera del elevador en los pisos de las habitaciones, quiza usar un poco de aromatizante para neutralizar los aromas.  [END]
[BEGIN] Big W fan here but this hotel could use some help...rooms are the smallest I have ever seen, smaller than rooms in europe! Clean YES but what a price for such a tiny space!  [END]
[BEGIN] Found another bedbug free hotel in NYC. Price was cheap for NY, great location near Penn station and Chelsea. Nothing to rave about other than no bedbugs! Rooms really small, staff ok, rooms felt ok'd but clean and reasonably priced, especially for the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice room for a family of 3. Excellent and helpful service. Rooms very clean and beds great. Some notice from street but not more than one could expect. Subway stations within walking distance. Not a five star but value for money. Jan  [END]
[BEGIN] El hotel Carter tiene una excelente ubicacion para estar en NY. esta en el Time Square. cerca de todo, es lo mejor que tiene este hotel. Por que despues la atencion es bastante mala. Pero por el precio que se paga ..es realmente muy barato para tan excelente ubicacion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Location, Good Service, Rooms Need Updating However, but nothing could have put a damper on our Trip. 2nd Row Seats to Janet Jackson and the amazing part...meeting her after for a photo op!  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at Hotel Derek at the beginning of June. The stay was pleasant and the staff was nice. Very busy area, but not bad for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wow, maybe they didn't like me here. The best thing about the room was the bathroom. The bed was tiny, the first room we got had a loud and squeaky bed. The room was tiny, the view was not that great. I wouldn't stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Das Hotel befindet sich mitten in Chinatown, direkt neben der Manhattan Bridge. Bei offenen Fenster versteht man kein Wort im Zimmer, bei geschlossenem Fenster ist alles gut (gut isolierte Fenster) und es gibt eine Klimaanlage. Zum Schlafen reicht es allemal.  [END]
[BEGIN] The breakfast in particular was very disappointing. The full english breakfast was very much on the small side, better off crossing the road to an irish pub.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff here is super but the room was so anticlimactic... You sure can't beat the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Come tutti gli hotel della zona Times Square spennano per bene i turisti che arrivano per ilcapodanno nella famosa piazza (che sconsiglio) comunque la posizione e' ottima per vivere la vita newyorkese a piedi  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel was small, but nice - and the floor i was staying on was home to visiting german gay pornstars, which made it LOADS of fun for me - the front desk assistant had fun too  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed in this hotel in jan 2011for my 50 th birthday,hotel was great,staff very friendly,concierge very knowledgeable.Bertrand the bartender was friendly and pleasant.would only like to say a coffee maker in the room would be good other than that hotel first class.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel. Was there for a conference and the hotel was good. But the gym and the pool was extra and not included in the price. But good location and nice bar/sitting area. Would go back to this hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] i never found staff so acid in my hotels experience. The cleaner get into my room while i was naked after a shower. The bathroom wasn't clean at all.. an hundred bucks in the trash.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel, very good location, especially if you travel to Newark (direct train to Penn Station). Paid a higher rate for a higher quality room but the room was not too much of a higher quality. In general, good hotel and decent price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel, a little overpriced. I do have to agree with a previous write-up, in saying that the front desk help are not very nice. You would think they would be a bit more courteous. Just remember there are plenty to choose from.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tres petite chambre pour une personne, mais tres claire et tres propre, tres calme si sur cour Les cloisons sont un peu fines. Un peu cher pour la surface, mais personnel tres acceuillant.plutot pas mal pour NY.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice hotel, but overpriced...they'll nail you for each and every extra they can. Room was a little shabby (peeling wallpaper, noisy air circulation system.) Also a bit of a hike to the Miracle Mile...it wasn't a terrible experience, but given the $$$ involved, you can do better for less!  [END]
[BEGIN] We found that staff at this hotel to be extremely friendly and respectful, even tho I got an unbelievably low rate on hotwire. Beds are wonderful. Staff cheerfully cashed travellers check for us. Hot tub was lukewarm. Great airport location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottima la posizione, sistemazione buona anche se probabilmente non all'altezza di un Hotel definito a 4 stelle Tutto sommato soggiorno positivo. Punto di forza decisamente la posizione, vicinissimo alla Grand Central station, a Times square, alla 5th Avenue. Tutti gli altri luoghi di interesse facilmente raggiungibili via Metro o taxi.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, bathrooms are very outdated. Maid was still cleaning the room when I was checkin. Only stay if you get a good rate.  [END]
[BEGIN] this was one of the only mid-range priced hotels available in the 1st week of December. Great location. Room was ok, as was the service.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well placed only 10 mins walk yo times square Good base no frills tv 2 doubles iron and board fridge and safe but no kettle Hotel is fine for what you need for 4 days  [END]
[BEGIN] I have read the other reports and must admit that we did not find this Holiday Inn that bad. For a big city hotel it does its best nand the staff are very friendly and helpful. It is well located for most attractions especially Central Park.  [END]
[BEGIN] la chambre est minuscule et super bruyante. il y a le lit et peu d espace autour. vraiment tout petit le service est irreprochable, et tres serviable. restaurant on peut y aller mais c est un peu cher. tres bon emplacement. tout pres de central park  [END]
[BEGIN] I travel for business and stay in hotels regularly. I'm used to snotty or aloof customer service. I arrived at the hotel befire check in. Denise treated me respectfully, explained several options and found a great solution. Her honest and kind approach was refreshing. Nicely done!  [END]
[BEGIN] nicely located near Central Park, very helpful staff sadly this hotel is in need of a good refurbishment  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for two nights at the beginning of November. Nothing special about this hotel, just average. Would rather have stayed at a trendier hotel near 5th Ave. However, if you love Starbucks they all basically surround the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] Estive neste hotel de 31/12/2010 a 06/01/2011 - Hotel simples, tranquilo, muito limpo, otimamente localizado, proxima a estacao do metro. Para quem nao procura luxo. Praticamente so usamos para dormir.  [END]
[BEGIN] I'm a regular to the city; sometimes I have to book last minute as I did on this trip. It's what you'd expect from an HI in Manhattan. Expensive last minute fall back. OK place but nothing special. Small but comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean rooms, one block from the subway, in one of the best neighborhoods in New York for only US $120.00 (one twin bed and a bathroom). What else could you ask for? Maybe an elevator and credit cards accepted? But then it wouldn't cost so little (for New York standards).  [END]
[BEGIN] Renovations understandable, poor service unacceptable. Our room was serviced, if you could call it that, sheets were not changed, no clean towels were left, no tissues just an empty box and nothing for coffee, if the Marriott"s philosophy is "Spirit To Serve" they need to go back to school...  [END]
[BEGIN] Simpel en eenvoudig hotel, netjes, veelal chinees, vriendelijk personeel, ontbijtbuffet is eenvoudig maar goed, ligt aan het einde van de straat, met bouwactiviteiten,garagebedrijven, paardestallen en een brandweerkazerne, dus altijd leven  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for young people. Nice design. Almost daily in-house parties at the pool. Breakfast was standard at $12,95/person, but breakfast room was damp because of the nearby pool. Starbucks across the street which is quite handy.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was quiet and clean, but small even by NYC standards - not much larger than a "pod" type hotel - for $329 expected something bigger. The bathroom was nice, the bed was comfortable.  [END]
[BEGIN] small dark rooms, poor heating, dark bathroom, not enough electrical sockets (one to use), and very tiny workout room. paid just under $200 for room. they charge a $100 incidentals to your credit card... beware. i will not be staying here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for business a nice hotel not the most modern but service ok. Great view from the window. All in all an ok hotel for business.  [END]
[BEGIN] The service, look and feel, ammenities, etc. are what is to be expected from a decent chain hotel. Breakfast however is not great, coffee not refilled, bagel burnt, etc. Wifi does not work in the room, only in the hall way. Well located for Times Square, 5th avenue, etc.  [END]
[BEGIN] We just found out that until the outside temperature reaches 50 degrees that the boilers will not "kick" in. We have no control over the temperature in the room. Yikes! The front desk did offer us extra blankets.  [END]
[BEGIN] Although the rooms were lacking some important features such as a minibar, the location of the hotel and the overall experience was worth the stay. Elizabeth, one of the associates at the front desk, was extremely helpful in making our stay a comfortable one.  [END]
[BEGIN] this hotel was nice it was nothing fancy, it was very clean the staff was very friendly , alot of great restaurants and bars nice and close  [END]
[BEGIN] buon hotel, comodo a luoghi e servizi. Lo consiglio!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice hotel, limited menu, but enough places to eat close by. The sports bar on site is well staffed and very friendly place to have a drink after work. Rooms are older, but still nice and this hotel still has a smoking floor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room is comfortable but small. Parking is expensive, $45 per night for valet parking. Typical American breakfast buffet, no much variety.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic location almost next to Times Square. Rooms clean and basic. No breakfast (but I gather that it is common to eat out for breakfast in New York?). Hot water unfortunately stopped in the morning so shower was a bit quick! Good automatic storage locker system.  [END]
[BEGIN] it's a nice hotel. a little old with some updates ... just don't look at the details. The ony thing that drove me nuts were the pillows. they were square?! didn't like that at all!  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is very good. The rooms are spacious and clean. Old building. Terrible service. No mini-bar. Management is not helpful. You can do better. No air conditioning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the Waldorf that is even close to what it once was.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well, it is in midtown, what does not translate into the most touristic neighbourhood. But the service is nice, there is a metro station around, and if you are o business, it may right around your next meeting. All in all, you can do a lot worse.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, close to Times Square. Rooms were spacious with large flat panel TV, iPhone docking radio, bathroom tiled and nice but not flashy in any way. But cleaner left a rubber glove on the floor, didn't replace used glasses and the price was almost $370/night with taxes.  [END]
[BEGIN] bien pour un voyage d affaire  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location in mid town. Boutique hotel with trendy decor. Very clean. Relatively friendly staff. Nice shower. However our room was noisy at night due to thin windows and noisy a/c. And room lights insufficient. Good value for money  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very well kept property. It is surely a crown jewel of Hilton business class hotels. The bed was worn out, but everything else was very well kept. The bathrooms are quite small. The place seems to have been upgraded in the 90's and is in great condition.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were unhappy, at first, with our room and were changed to a larger and more comfortable area. Deficiencies in the room were corrected by a polite, supportive and knowledgeable engineering staff. Manager and parking staff were also pleasant and efficient.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel is just off the Magnificant Mile and offers OK value for that area. Helpful and friendly staff but the whole place would benefit from a good bit of decoration. Parts of the building are looking distinctly down at heel, but nothing that a good makeover would not fix.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed at the Beekman at then end of March for 5 nights. The room we stayed in was spacious and comfortable. The location was ok, attractions are within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stay was acceptable. Your staff was great , helpful and pleasant. Building needs updating once you get past the lobby I went back in time. Sorry but being honest.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel posizionato in zona perfetta per arrivare a piedi in vari posti da visitare. Camere veramente troppo piccole con armadi praticamente inesistenti, pulizia non molto curata, ma senza "ospiti inattesi" tipo " bed bugs"  [END]
[BEGIN] our stay was amazing.rooms are clean , the staff was mazing especially adem vale.He was helpfull to all guests.Higher floors have a good view.Times square is very close to hotel.Just 3 minutes by walk.  [END]
[BEGIN] First off I must say that the location is awesome!!! And that was the only reason I booked there. As for the hotel, it was very clean, quiet and SMALL! But for it's location it was well worth it. However I would advise going for the 'DOUBLE' room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location - Fantastic Room was very dirty. Sheets, bathroom. Staff were very friendly. Bad need of remodeling Will charge you card 75 a nightt for incidentals and will not tell you. $37 a day to park your car.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was wonderful, but the room had a strange chemical smell to it, almost like it used to be a smoking room but they were trying to cover it up. Other then that it is not all that bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was not bad but a little bit of a let down. Rooms were good but service and breakfast were poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Heard a lot about place but overall disappointing, Small and a little dingy with a pokey bar, certainly not somewere impressive. Not in centre of Manhattan,no real buzz around hotel,would not recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] We stayed here last July. It was a nice hotel but definitely not worth the price. The room was cramped. The front desk was a little snotty..  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a young person's hotel. If you are european or a young person, you will like it here. The rooms are sparse and very Ikea.  [END]
[BEGIN] The decor that must have been cool and trendy in the early 90's now seems dated. The W is showing its age. But the bar is still hopping!  [END]
[BEGIN] Place was fine - room was pretty standard for NYC (ie, small), but clean and had all the basics. Location was convenient for transportation, which was our main priority this time around. Recently renovated, so that was a plus.  [END]
[BEGIN] u should call to confirm ur reservation cuz they canselled our reservation!! but the staff were very friendly good location , big room size , old rooms needs renovation  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, clean hotel at a reasonable rate for NYC. Manger was very knd and attentive to our needs. Rooms were adequate size with a large flat screen TV. The vending machines were not working properly. We would stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Park Central is a nice place to stay. I just returned from a girls weekend trip.The location is great, the staff was very friendly,we had no problems.The rooms were a little small but from what I hear this is normal in NYC.Location is walking distance to all major attractions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Il suo prezzo e la sua posizione sono davvero eccezionali..A due passi da times square e dalla 5th avenue..E' l'hotel ideale per chi non ha tante pretese, vuole spendere poco e soggiornare nel cuore di Manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like many rooms in Manhattan - you don't get a lot of space for your money. Aside from that the room was fine and clean. The air conditioning wasn't the best. The location is great - the hotel is just off Times Square, near to the Hershey store.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very impressive entrance & modern space -reminded me of being in an art museum. Busy place - room was noisy - and sheets were not fresh. We complained & they upgraded us to another room. Much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] First stay at a Westin. Not really impressed for the money. Room and bathroom were ok. I was really disappointed at the room decor. I was expecting more luxary. Hey our room overlooked Hotel Carter!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The Marriott Westchase is a completely adequate hotel. The facilities downstairs (lobby, restaurant, bar) are nice. The rooms are a bit dark and built for the tastes of a few decades ago, completely adequate though. The location is very nice, close to a lot of eating options.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is not luxurious, but it certainly fits the bill if you are looking for an affordable, clean and safe place to stay in NYC. Convenient to subways and other midtown attractions. Great price! Only drawback: a little noisy. Outside sounds come into the room, but that is NYC!  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is OK. The bed is very comfortable and the furnishing are OK. Good breakfast. Not sure it is worth the cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a very nice hotel, staff were really friendly, room was very clean and had a great view of the city the restaurant right beside the hotel is great from breakfast, I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in central in NYC  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was nice and location was great. The downside was the room was so hot, and I couldn't take a hot shower. It was freezing! Thank goodness we were only there for one night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great hotel, wonderful and big room, great location. Booked by ratestogo.com and got a great price. Highly reccommend it!!  [END]
[BEGIN] great location but help is a premium when trying to contact the front desk,concierge,directions,etc and the new elevator system is not user friendly at least for us  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location and nice staff make the VERY small rooms doable definitely better for singles or couples. Loved the great location, close to the subways and walking distance to Times Square, Hell's Kitchen for great restaurants and shopping!  [END]
[BEGIN] Average room... but great location .. next to Chicago's Hilton and opposite Millenium Park  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel Eddison we would stay at this hotel again prime location Time Square is on the doorstep Hotel a bit dated but it is clean our beds were made eveyday and white clean towels everyday so for what we paid for the trip we were very happy  [END]
[BEGIN] Room-small rooms, but updated decoration. Room was clean and functional. Wish it had a fridge. Location- excellent location. Easy access to public transportation. Parking lot next door. Trader joes across the street was very convenient. Good deal for the price, booked this for the price, location, and breakfast included.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location, a block from Union Square. Small hotel, small lobbey but everything is clean and convenient. Hallways are tight and rooms are small but most NYC rooms are the same size. Room looked like it was recently updated.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is literally at the end of the runway? So close you will want a room facing the back!  [END]
[BEGIN] Situation de l'hotel super. a 2 pas de times square ! un peu bruyant, chambre pas super propres mais passable. personnel gentil et relativement disponible. pas cher du tout pour times square.  [END]
[BEGIN] clean, convenient, good value. rather no frills, but who goes to NY to spend time in a hotel room? very close to soho shops and restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] ShockIngly small room. Kind of like sleeping in a closet. However, super close to the Gershwin theater is you are going to see Wicked. Clean enough. Very loud- like the window is open due to window air conditioner. Rooftop has potential when it's done.  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel confortable et chambre assez spacieuse mais parties communes et chambres tres vieillots, meriterait un bon rafraichissement, sinon bonne situation et piscine appreciable apres des heures de ballade dans manhattan  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is located a 5 minute walk from Times Square. There's a pool and a small fitness room. There's no a/c and the windows in our room couldn't open, so it can be very hot! Our room was ok but worn down.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was nice and room was very tiny and clean. No amenities like coffee or leg room etc.... Great for one person, two people is a crowd in queen size bed room size. We just made the best of it in the big apple.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are dated and tired. No charm. $14.10 per day for wifi. Good location, but I probably won't return. At these prices, this hotel offers poor value. Try one of the many newer properties in the area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a small noisey room with a view of a roof covered with garbage Hotel could have been cleaner Short changed on towels as well  [END]
[BEGIN] It was decent for the price..Took awhile for the shower to heat up. But it was an alright place to stay. We stayed 2 nights and Im thinking about staying there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I enjoyed my stay there, found the decor to be charming and elegant and my bed was comfortable. The bathroom was nice and roomy too. Further, I was well taken care of there and thought the shuttle service was very helpful and accommodating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Abbiamo soggiornato presso questo hotel nel primi di dicembre vi comunico che la biancheria del bagno tante volte mancava bisogna richiederla e tante volte non la portano manca comunque accappatoio e ciabatte e la tv trasmette solo programmi americani nessun canale italiano. Io non alloggero' piu presso questo hotel!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Little red beetles in the bed and big red welts on my body. In a suite now but very nervous.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is in a decent location. Tiny rooms. Worst elevator service I have ever seen. As previously mentioned, the hotel staff has to use the same elevators as everyone else. 32 floors and 2 elevators. I timed it and it took me 12 minutes to go downstairs!  [END]
[BEGIN] Close to Hobby if that is your aim. Large rooms with great beds. Bathroom is so small that you have to close the door to use toilet. Strange since the rest of the room is spacious. Large desk and nice TV.  [END]
[BEGIN] we stayed here during fashion week the hotel is clean in a good location and the rooms r ok would i stay here again i doubt it  [END]
[BEGIN] Good part: Excellent service and good location. Very clean rooms and nice bubble Bad part: very small rooms and much too noisy during the night (from outside) Our room was located on the front of the hotel.  [END]
[BEGIN] son apartamentos equipados, nosotros teniamos la suite por lo que era una habitacion enoorme, sencilla pero con todo lo necesario tiene su encanto....recomendable en una ciudad muuy cara! muuy buena ubicacion  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is very clean and the staff is very nice but nothing very special to point out of the hotel. However, it is in the heart of times square and broadway, so all that is to do is within walking distance.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel staff was very helpful at all times, great location. Rooms was cleaned every day with fresh towels.. Would recommend and stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for five days and nights. Great mid town location close to Grand Central. Rooms were ok, hotel overall quite small and business like Staff were not over friendly and very straight to the point. Served its purpose but would stay elsewhere if we were to visit New York again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is nicely located not far away from Soho and the Meatpacking district. The rooms were small but ok, the airconditioning is very loud and you an't do anything about it, even though the breakfast is included, I would have it somewhere else....  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a nice looking Hotel and Bar on the outside buy the parking is pandemonium!  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved my stay at Hotel 17. I spent 5 nights there and will def be going back. Gr8 price,spotless,friendly staff, safe location and within walking distance from all the city has to offer.  [END]
[BEGIN] We also had read horrid reviews about this place and couldn't cancel as Spring break meant all the room in NY were booked. But all in all, clean, friendly staff, and good value for money. For the price, I would stay there again, espeically once the rennovations are complete.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here Saturday night. It's a small & cramped hotel to move around with a toddler's stroller for sure. Their lifts must be THE slowest in NYC....period! Decent Hilton property, but not worth the $240 tag. Good location on Stone Street.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed they chose to charge us nearly $2.00t o make free calls using a USA phone card, no other hotel we stayed in in the USA did this.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Lexington recently and was satisfied with the room. A modest sized room, with not much of a view. Room was clean but bathtub was a little dusty. Room was without water boiler which was quite a downer. Overall friendly staff and great location!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best hotel I have stayed in when visiting NYC. Everything in the rooms and in the corridors looked very old and tired. Some of the fittings in the room were broken and light cables loose. Location is close to Times Square so well placed to see the sights.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel was in a good location by Grand Central Station. The staff were helpful and courteous. It is not luxury and has no frills. It is good quality basic accommodation. Could do better with cleaning and upgrading bathrooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location for any event at Madison Square Garden. Hotel was clean but lobby is very small. Nice rooms complete with microwaves and refrigerators.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place would be great if you were a back packer, however as an non backpacker the rooms were a little small and sharing a bathroom (4 small cubicles for the entire floor), although didnt cause too many problems, did get very old, very quickly  [END]
[BEGIN] Los departamentos son muy comodos. Estan muy bien ubicados y buen servicio. muy recomendable.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is great for a business trip or short stay. The staff is excellent, room comfortable and clean, and breakfast delicious. However, the bathroom sink is set too far away (close to the mirror) and it was not easy to lean so far forward to use the sink.  [END]
[BEGIN] Noone answers room service phone line. Furniture is old and beat up. Bedspreads are dirty. Ironing board fell off the closet wall because it was screwed in without anchors. Really?!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not an high end hotel by any means but not dirty either. Was a very good stay for the money. Hey you can not beat free parking in NYC!. It is a few blocks form Times Sq and not far from subway access.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was really well located and very clean but if sharing with a friend for more than a night or two it is too small. It can be very claustrophobic and noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I should have remember the first time, no air conditioning! You would think in October you wouldn't need it, but at 80 degrees in the room, you do. Staff very friendly, bedding very old and dingy. Breakfast is very limited, but excellent location.  [END]
[BEGIN] My first stay here (in July 2011) was so crazy awful that they gave me a free night (that I used August 2011). I thought that was a great way to rectify the situation. My second stay was MUCH better than the first. Plus, the gave me a nice suite.  [END]
[BEGIN] on the pictures this hotel looks much more better it was my last time there  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location near 6th on 35th. That's the good part. Small room, OK breakfast, tiny bar, almost no lobby - all for over $400 a night. Won't book it again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Got a decent rate. Room small but absolutely fine and comfortable. Totally no frills but as a bed and nothing else for a couple of night it was perfectly acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] no me parece tan malo como dicen, pero el personal que atiende en la recepcion le falta mucha cultura de atencion al cliente, pareciera que uno les estuviera pidiendo algo regalado. Las demas personas que atienden en el hotel, son colaboradores.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of those large US city centre hotels. No charm or pleasant surprises, but no nasty ones either. Great location on the Magnificent Mile, within walking distance of the main shopping district and many local attractions. Rooms are cramped, though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent location, friendly staff under difficult circumstances (Sandy). Internet connection OK but you continually have to relog on. The only downside is the size of the rooms. Not even space for the usual coffee machine! and certainly not enough room to swing a cat!  [END]
[BEGIN] Near Soldier Field, Grant Park, museums and attractions. Great value for location. Rooms are just average. Skip the hotel breakfast and go to Yolk, just around the corner on S. Michigan ave. Don't miss it  [END]
[BEGIN] Affordable hotel in a great location. clean, but small rooms, ac and internet included, not so great staff but the location + price makes it worthwhile for 1-3 nights at manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] booked through hotwire, got a great rate and thought a great hotel as a better name brand. Room was furthest away, and shabby. No electrical outlets to charge anything without unplugging. Room was in rough condition, big old TV, dated furniture. Good restaurant though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not anything great but definitely a good hotel. Very comfortable beds, nice showers, but the only light in the rooms come from lamps.  [END]
[BEGIN] This place is right on top of a freeway and the highway noise is bad. Unless you have earplugs or sleeping pills or both do not stay here. Bar appears fine and lobby was okay. Rooms are big but just not quiet  [END]
[BEGIN] We had a room on the 15th floor extremely small and bathroom ridiculous. People at the Front Office and Concierge unfriendly, no customer care at all. I think you can find a better solution for 250 $ per night without breakfast.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just around the corner to Times Square.The hotel is in an ideal location.The cafe next door serves good reasonably priced meals.The hotel itself has seen better days but it suited our purpose.We were there to see the city,not the hotel room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Die Lage, gerade wenn man vom Flughafen kommt und die Leistungen des Hotels sind insgesamt zufriedenstellend  [END]
[BEGIN] I stayed here in Dec 07 and it was as you would expect of a Holiday Inn. It was clean and in a great location not far from times square. I would def recommend it for anyone looking for a good clean hotel as a base to explore NYC.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed at the Gansvoort for 3 nights during a business meeting. Rooms and service was OK. Business center was good, but lacked some routines for dealing with larger business meetings. Nice roof top bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel location and quality of services is great but I had very little sleep due to the noisy in the corridors, adjacent rooms and the traffic. The room was sold as an upgrade but I would have rather had a smaller room with some peace and quiet  [END]
[BEGIN] Room was small but clean, they need to fix the smell on the floors.... the carpets smell like urine. Bed was comfortable and ok....... Checking out shouldn't be that long though, felt like i was at the desk for half an hour. GREAT LOCATION THOUGH!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] hotel is fine. we were not impressed with the buffet offering in the revolving restaurant on the 48th floor, A pasta bar at $35/person is crazy,beer at $10,is expensive,  [END]
[BEGIN] overall is a good choice, rooms are small specially if u r shopping a lot :) walking distance from line 1 and steps from broadway. would go again....  [END]
[BEGIN] The service was very good. Complementary breakfast was nice. Rooms were very small, could hardly move around in the bathroom. Did have a coffee maker in the room which was very nice. The whole hotel was in need of renovation. Hotel is in a great location, right near central park.  [END]
[BEGIN] We spent 4 nights there, and final price was $ 860...not so cheap, considering the small surface of our room. Toilet behind the glass is very fashionable, but really not practicle. Location is grat, and people at the front desk are very kind.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location in Lower East Side, near the museum. Nice walking area, and near the Williamsburg Bridge for a nice stroll to Brooklyn. Good $$ value. Not luxurious by any stretch.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good hotel with easy access to I10. It is clean and quiet. The rooms are of a good size. The services available are reliable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel was a bit run down but clean. Walking distance to Navy Pier, magnificent mile shops, restaurants and two subway stations. Well priced, free parking. We would stay there again.  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent emplacement juste a cote de Times Square. prix correct sans plus. les prestations repas sont cheres. Proprete a ameliorer dans les chambres. Vue exceptionnelle. Stationnement voiture pratique (via Icon) et bon marche compte tenu de l'endroit.  [END]
[BEGIN] not impressed at all. an old hotel that had previously been a hot spot. not very many rooms were rented. room was ok for the price in the Houston area. bed was comfy and room was really quiet.hluhliugkuyf,kj/;ljtyeyrtdufkukjkp';5rd6ujkpptrsdfuuythj9p'p;dtrgklil'45scjukilk/d45yrdtjyho;ldfyjjhlolo{'fvkukjkp;o[p[;][jhfhtrdcuvtykjm,'p;'6trfvyukj,'['5fkikilk'['[']tdy54rdf5uyuj;opo[ plp5truyloiu;989880i[0i9uo8yt7tilrlo9ro9ro8ro7lupo{\]-r53suyijplp'[p234567tyuiop[]2qsdftyugihojkpl[qwertyuiop[  [END]
[BEGIN] Location strategica, nel cuore di Manhattan. Molto accogliente, molto atmosfera night club ovvero molto buio, giorno e notte. Musica Ok, colazione non merita, Staff molto gentile e professionale. Stanze piccole, anche per Manhattan. Tutti i servizi possibili immaginabili in zona, a due passi. Convenzione con fitness centre di ottimo livello.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed there on the weekend in november. Service was very average. Nothing special. Room was old and it need some TLC. Front desk staff were nice. Could use customer service training as a refresh. I guess the place needs renovation to compete with other luxury hotels.  [END]
[BEGIN] would like to have been better informed about check in process. called several times and was never informed about a 75 dollar deposit. the pool was dirty and so cold it was imposible to swim in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Het is een leuk hotel die heel centraal ligt bij veel bezienswaardigheden.Vlak bij opstap plaats van toeriste bus.goede tip is door veel te lopen naar de bezienswaardigheden zodat je veel ziet.Metro is snel en makkelijk, ziet dan minder. Leuke stad  [END]
[BEGIN] Clearly you are paying for location- it is really really good. The hotel is too pricey for mini-box sized rooms. Make sure to get a room away from the elevators and make reservations for drinks. Multiple elevator changes makes it a long time to get to the room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean small business hotel with only double bed next to windows with view of downtown nyc. Inexpensive, friendly staff and ok bed. Plus self service laundry makes this little gem in nyc a rare find. Noisy as its literally next to rebuilding of the world trade center.  [END]
[BEGIN] puedes meterte un moton en una habitacion y esta en el centro de manhattan y esta limpio, y seguro  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is in decent conditions but the location - while close to the subway - is quite odd. Surrounded by nothing other than Chinatown. Rooms are absolutely tiny.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service...Really good service. The front desk were very accomodating to our needs. At night we had a friend who has fallen ill. Called them and they immediately brought us water. Really really helpful throughout! Thanks!  [END]
[BEGIN] We were very happy with the accommodations. It was my friend's first visit to NYC and she will definitely stay there again. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. Several rooms were being renovated during our visit on the 5th floor.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would't call Morgans a hotel as there's no bar or restaurant. Location is great and rooms really cool (though interior -quiet - ones are dark). Only hotel (out of 8) in US which charged me for WiFi in room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 4 nights on first visit to New York. Recommended for location. Easy to walk to Times Square and subway. Area poorly lit at night. Rooms small but clean. Bed although comfortable soft in the middle. Front desk staff friendly and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean safe and reasonably comfortable. The room size is small but that's the compromise to save $50-100. For a single traveler it seems well worth it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel must be surviving on the name. While the lobby is very pretty in an "old world" kind of way, the rooms are outdated and the one we had was very small. We won't be staying here again...too many other fantastic hotels in Chicago.  [END]
[BEGIN] This business travelers' "member" chain opens to the public on weekends and slow days. Clean, friendly. Great deal for downtown Chicago. Tiny, non-descript rooms. If value tops comfort. check this out. Nice three block walk to Art Institute. Self-parking discount around the corner; the bellman will direct you.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice, clean, free breakfast, nice people, reasonable price, nice neighborhood, three blocks to subway  [END]
[BEGIN] stopped overnight and used reward points. Dirty carpet, after walking on the carpet my shoes left marks on the bathroom floor. Desk clerk complained about how tired she was, (that's Chicago). Free shuttle from the Airport. Close to a few restaurants.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ottimo hotel, anche se un piccolino a confronto i bestioni nei paraggi... Un Po troppo kitch per i miei gusti, ma tutto sommato buon hotel!! Unico neo la pulizia nn e impeccabile per il resto ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Romms should have coffee makers...even the cheapest hotels (this one was not cheap) have coffee makers and complimentary coffe in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] Check in was simple and efficient. Room was basic and functional. Location was OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] The room was tiny but big enough for one person. Bed was huge, tv could have been better, and bathroom was small. Maids were very attentive to make sure to clean the room and change the sheets.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is located in a great area for sightseeing in Manhatten. Hotel itself was very nice with nice decor. Lounge was excellent. restaruant far too expensive even for breakfast. Rooms were small and cramped and a bit old/run down for the price paid.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the public areas of this hotel are beautiful, the hotel room seemed tired, faded, and past its prime. I would not stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed for 1-2 days. There were dirty plates in hallway for 1 day. The room need more outlets and lighting. Bathroom need an exhaust fan, lighting in closest before you enter restroom. good place to rest you head after a night out on the town.  [END]
[BEGIN] Recently stayed at the Millenium, as a diamond HH member,was given a breakfast coupon. I charged $8 for a scoop of eggs, told that coupons for diamond HH members include coffee and buns only. Not a way to treat loyal customers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing more really to add from the other reviews. The hotel is Excellent location for sight seeing. It is nothing flash but perfect for a New York base. The room was very basic but clean friendly staff and a decent price for a central New York location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good value for a family. Only real complaint was the bed linens were not 100% cotton. They were a 60/40 poly blend which drives me bonkers as did the polyester blanket/cover. All that static - ugh.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location but the room we had was shabby. Expected better from a 4* hotel, the public areas are great you just get a bit let down when you get to your room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes, the room was clean and the bathroom was OK. The room was very small. I think i'ts a good price, we paid 99 USD/night for a twin bed room. But the staff was very unhelpful and no service minded at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] The location is fine, in the heart iof midtown. I consider the hotel to be fair in terms of prices and service. There might be many better options in NYC in terms of price depending on the time of the year. Would recommend only if rates are below USD 200.  [END]
[BEGIN] 4 stars, hotel run by trainee staff, but very helpful. No problem , cause you only sleep in you're Hotel when visiting NY !  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is nice, rooms are small but clean. you have to wait a lot for the elevators - especially at breakfast time. breakfast was OK but there is not much room to seat. Very close to Times Square but at the east side and this not a nice area.  [END]
[BEGIN] Receptionists are very rude, and the hotel takes advance money from your credit card and then takes the money for hotel bill as well.Rooms were too hot and you couldnt open windows  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here for 5 nights.very impressive lobby and public areas are all very nice. Food in restaurant superb. Room so disappointing. Very tired and in need of refreshing and also very noisy. Had a good time but wouldn't stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel was expensive, room ugly and small but clean. Perfect location but terrible service! I would not recommend it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I certainly expected at larger, nicer room for the $287/night I paid. The bathroom was so small, I had to back up to the sink to close the door. (I weight 110 lbs) There was nothing special about room.  [END]
[BEGIN] All was fine. Nothing special. The fitness center is nice but small for a hotel this size and the equipment needs a tune up (really three of the five machines were not working properly). Evening managers reception served tortilla chips and salsa (not at all worthwhile).  [END]
[BEGIN] Just returned during NY Marathon...stayed at Belvedere...Room was great with fridge, microwave etc....however, the bed was hard as a ROCK....So if you are used to a good bed please beware....Location was Ok...However, I would prefer staying on the east side near Lex, and the 50's... DW, Toronto.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is good stop over hotel, clean efficient with no frills ideal for business in the heart of the oil and gas district. Pay as you go for all meals. My second stay and would stay there again  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms were okay and the bathroom is too small. Beds were comfortable and the room was clean. I expected more for what we paid but after staying at another hotel I'm assuming most hotels in NYC are like this.  [END]
[BEGIN] The hotel is fine bit overpriced. Small rooms trying to look chic Bathroom was very small. Nice front office but slow valet service for the car. We found at a later time that there were plenty of places that would be better values.  [END]
[BEGIN] location excellent,room poor,old ,not good,staff was ok internet wifi free only in looby,the breakfast expensive and not good.all hotels in times square are very expensive,.but this hotel could be a little more cheaper.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was staying here whilst working and while everything is clean, smart & occasionally stylish, it just isn't worth the price tag. There are many better alternatives in new York in that range.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very friendly staff and a nice location. Great shops and dining all around. Only complaint is the rooms were a bit small. Small for NYC standards. A good hotel but for the cost there are better options.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stayed here during a convention in NYC for three nights. Basic hotel but staff very friendly and helpful. Rooms are basic but if you are nOt spending much time in them it's fine. Mine was very noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good choice for a no frills, low budget hotel in Manhattan. Rooms are good, although the rest of the hotel feels dated. Great location. If you are not too fussed about the wow factor (lack of), this is not a bad choice.  [END]
[BEGIN] the hotel is very pretty, modern design, very close to main attractions, very clean, it'd be perfect if rooms were not so tiny.. there was not space for 2 luggages, and to move thru the room you had to give priority to each other.  [END]
[BEGIN] ottima posizione, stanza piccola e senza finestra, illuminazione bassa, personale cordiale, cambio biancheria della stanza giornaliero, pulito.  [END]
[BEGIN] I picked this hotel for its recent renovations and it really looks nice. Unfortunatelly renos stopped short of replacing windows, which do not have any sound insulating capability. Hotel is right beside a highway and noise is overwhelming.  [END]
[BEGIN] room too small, no parking and no standing for load luggage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok. Free wifi and regular cleaning, but no breakfast. Good location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location for folks who can navigate the subway system. Surrounded by restaurants and shops. For the price it is a good deal. I found the staff to be friendly and helpful. Will stay again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are very small and in top of that they haven put a plasma or HD TV. The bed move because the legs are not very strong. The rooms are not ugly but it will be nice to put a plasma TV.  [END]
[BEGIN] Desk staff very poor, barely acknowledged us being there. I guess we disrupted her cell phone conversation with a friend. Security door to hotel totaly inop, lock portion was destroyed. Getting into and out of parking lot is a nightmare! Breakfast was great, room was clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are coming for a vacation this hotel is perfect - amazing views, great location. It is not that good for business - business center lacks a lot of functionality, slow elevators, etc  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicer on the outside. Room smelled like smoke in a non-smoking room. Noisy air con.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good hotel in Tribecca area,close to wallstreet,ground zero,battery park. Stayed here 4 yrs ago Subway was in front of the hotel There was lil deli Staff were very nice and helpfull Rooms were too small for me but thay were clean  [END]
[BEGIN] Hotel Antigo, servico mediano(nada alem do normal), nao possui frigobar. O ponto positivo eh a localizacao, proximo dos principais pontos da cidade, principalmente 5a avenida, times square e central park. Se o objetivo da viagem eh aproveitar a cidade e apenas dormir no hotel, esta eh uma boa opcao.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would not recommend this hotel to anyone staying longer than one night. Rooms too small, and aircon too noisy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing fancy. Good value. We stayed here to be in town early for the Thanksgiving day parade.  [END]
[BEGIN] The rooms are not that good and old. Showes ok but need to refurbish No breakfast No coffee machine in the room No Wi Fi free in the rooms.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's blue, it's neon, it's trendy - just pricey! Room was small but that's New York...  [END]
[BEGIN] Having just returned from a 5 day visit to New York, staying at the Grand Hyatt, I found this to be an average hotel (given the price tag) and pretty noisy overnight. On the plus side, the location is excellent and the rooms are clean.  [END]
[BEGIN] Location is why I titeled it great. We also had a big, clean bathroom. Got extremely low rates, and would therefore not have any reason complain, even if we weren't satisfied. But overall very pleased with the accommodation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a great view from my room, but when you are a Marriott hotel I would not expect there to have the wall paper pealing from the walls. Lobby is wonderful and the staff is very nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect location hotel with good price for a room with private bathroom. Service non-existant at reception desk. Rooms so small that only bed fits. Decoration is dreadful. but it fits the prupose: cheap hotel in Manhattan  [END]
[BEGIN] God og central beliggenhed. Venlig service og rene men slidte rum. Fantastisk udsigt fra vores vaerelse til Manhattan skyline og Ikke mindst til poolen paa taget paa sidebygningen som ogsaa er en del af hotellet Taet paa laes gaaafstand Central Park Fifth ave Times Sq etc  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of a boutique hotel, not too big and very well located. However, the service and atmosphere are just "average", nothing special. Rooms quite small and a bit basic but anyway a good solution for whom doesn't spend too much time in the room. Again, great location  [END]
[BEGIN] Rommene var litt slitt, men rene og med et ok bad. Sengene var gode. Beliggenheten var super!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] das hotel ist etwas herunter gekommen, als wenn in den letzten 30 Jahren nichts mehr daran getan worden waere, aber zum uebernachten reichte es, da es im ganzen doch sehr sauber war und extrem zentral gelegen ist.  [END]
[BEGIN] Room wasn't ready when we arrived (1 1/2 hours early) and they were very slow in getting it ready finally giving us a different room, The room was spacious and a corner unit on the 31st floor w/ a great view.Unfortunately the bed was a disaster  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff are great, very friendly & helpful, but the room is pretty basic & had an unpleasant smell. The bathroom is very small, nowhere to put anything & not even a complimentary shower cap. The location is not the greatest either. Wouldn't stay here again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff was helpful and accommodating. Room was adequate for our needs and larger than we expected. Everything was clean. Location is great, very good value for NYC. Our only complaint was a few mosquito bites but folks left the bathroom window open....not the hotel's fault. A good stay overall.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rooms are small, great location but beds were uncomfortable. Would not stay here again  [END]
[BEGIN] Very basic hotel and rooms but a fantastic location. If you plan to spend much time in your room dont stay here but you shouldnt stay in your room in NY. Good value for the location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Per quanto riguarda voli,trasferimenti ,organizzazione perfetta. L Hotel,seppure posizionato in zona centralissima ha ,a mio modesto parere alcune cose che non vanno. Camera e bagno molto piccoli. in particolare il bagno,non proprio rinnovato...... servizi hotel ottimi e personale professionale e cordiale.  [END]
[BEGIN] Access to Grand Central Terminal is about the only thing great about this hotel. There are so many better, unique hotels in NYC for about the same price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks good outside, but rooms are small and our bed was really small. Bit overpriced, but I suppose that's how it is in New York. Anyway, the room was clean and stuff was friendly and location is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Clean and convenient but front desk is understaffed, only one elevator works, and if you wake before 6:30 and would like coffee, better go down and over a block to Starbucks because there is no coffeemaker in room and staff is slow about getting the coffee in the lobby out.  [END]
[BEGIN] Beds extremely comfortable and excellent location. Rooms a little small for our tastes. Friendly staff. Enjoyed our stay!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good location (beside time square) for tourism; thought not the most charming neighbourhood of NY. Rooms were clean and nicely decorated; but quite small and ours had no window (well there was one but with a wall at 50cm); so day light doesn't enter. Overall good value for money.  [END]
[BEGIN] per viaggiatori senza pretese,ma assolutamente pulito x essere 1 hotel/ostello.bagno nuovissimo cn doccia e sempre pulito.personale alla reception disponibile.posizione ottimale x la vicinanza a metro,ristoranti,pub,market,ecc.economico x essere a manhattan.  [END]
[BEGIN] Will work out some kinks, definitely for younger crowd.  [END]
[BEGIN] This hotel is very convenient for an overnight Hobby airport traveler. I wouldn't reccomend it for any tourist activity-center-ground for Houston or for the Texas beaches. Service is fine, nothing exceptional.  [END]
[BEGIN] It's the cheapest you can find in downtown, so don't expect too much. Coming from the south, I hated paying so much for a room that wasn't too great. Bathroom was redone and nice. Rooms felt somewhat dark and dingy. Great location.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had the pleasure of spending four days here during a work conference. The rooms were small, the food was pretty bad, and service was unreliable (forgot my room service order one morning). Unless it's a steal, I just don't know why you'd stay there.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great location , easy access by foot to top restaurants and areas. Room from the 80`is. Nice bar and breakfast place in the ground foor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Spent four days in New York hardly spent any time in the hotel so hard to find faults you don't go to NYC to do this, clean, cheap enough did the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] abbastanza pulito ma le camere erano micorscopiche..nn in linea con i precedenti soggiorni usa...la posizione non e'male ma tuttavia lontano dalle principali attrazioni....piu'adatto ad una clientela giovane e alternativa. La vera nota dolente erano i bagni decisamente insufficienti mentre era splendida la lounge col biliardo p.s.non ci sono i frigobar  [END]
[BEGIN] This Hampton is clean and close to the airport for easy travel in or out. The surrounding area is a little scary at night but the hotel is secure. The room was clean and the staff was quick and helpful.  [END]
[BEGIN] The staff at the hotel is very friendly and helpful. They are knowledgeable about the local area and quick to respond to any questions. The facilities themselves are a bit dated and a refresh is needed. Rooms are clean and well provisioned.  [END]
[BEGIN] Staff was great, fitness center is basic but okay. The rooms are very small but that's to be expected in NYC. Rooms are clean. I had connectivity issues with WIFI. They have two internet services, one free the other is $7.99. I was not a fan of this option.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only upside here is the ticktock diner for breakfast, and the location. The rooms are small, the hotel seems old. And a fee for everything such as luggage. Good enough experience, but too expensive for what you get.  [END]
