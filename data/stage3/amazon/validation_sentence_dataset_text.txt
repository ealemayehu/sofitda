15356 fits cannon rebel well 
15357 great transaction. Product as described 
15358 was excatly as described. 
15359 The remote battery seems to be dead. It does not work. 
15360 Worked fine 
15361 Having trouble getting adequate focus for my eyes 
15362 works great! 
15363 Did not fit my Canon 5D Mk III with the stock 24-70mm. No battery grip. Decent build quality, but could not use. 
15364 very good on batteries, recommended 
15365 Benjamin Ward Excellent product and technical support. Would recommend. 
15366 Works great 
15367 Exactly what I wanted, and it works well. Convenient also that it can be reversed on the lens for storage in my camera bag. The on-board surface helps in reducing eliminating glare inside and outside the hood. 
15368 Perfect camera. 
15369 It works fine...good cost compared to others out there. Not a big fan of the BLUE strap but it works and easily replaced if need be. 
15370 It s doing what it s supposed to at a great price! 
15371 A great lens that I use on my Nikon d750. If you like a heavy, large lens this is the one for you. Photos are outstanding. Most pleased, by clearly if you want something light and small you may want to look elsewhere. 
15372 easy to install and add to sell phone nice you can look inside your home from your sell phone 
15373 it s a re-purchase 
15374 Good quality regardless of zoom setting 
15375 I really like the camera, but can t get the pictures off of it onto my laptop. And I don t know how to use the items that came with it...cause no manual came with it. 
15376 This projector is really good for the price and is easy to travel around with however i didnt recieve and hdmi cord to connect the projector to my computer and i dont like that,now i dont know which cord to buy 
15377 for this Price i was waiting almost a toy.. But are a Really GOOD product. i can compare this set with set of 35 us. 
15378 Didn t come with instruction booklet, but that was easy enough to find online. Doesn t hold charge, and randomly shuts of my phone. Don t waste your money. 
15379 Worked very well. Definitely needed the charger and extra batteries. 
15380 So far this along with VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SECURITY SIGNS Sign burglar- robber- thief video warning... has kept intruders from attempting to break into the back door of our garage. 
15381 Excellent camera but the speaker has some static. 
15382 It is not fitting to my d5300. 
15383 Great price and great item 
15384 They charge fast and work great. 
15385 I bought this camera ages ago - not sure why I wasn t asked to post a review then... :) Anyways, it s a good piece and I ve only had to invest towards getting the SD card compartment. 
15386 By reading the instructions before anything else, my first film worked great. I haven t finished my first film pack yet but so far it s worked just how it should. I m actually going to buy again after finishing this pack. 
15387 Excelente! 
15388 Only received 50 shots. Two of the 20-pack and one of the 10-pack. The clear packaging even says &#34;50 shots&#34; but they placed their own sticker over the top which says &#34;60 shots&#34;. Not cool. 
15389 It works. 
15390 So many fun facts noted in this book. 
15391 I am very happy with this battery :) 
15392 Good cable. Just as expected. 
15393 My wife really loved this camera! 
15394 Read the instructions upon arrival, you are directed to an icloud account to change camera settings, whereas the competition includes the software to monitor and change settings without the cloud account. I am sure it performs well, 115 degrees vs 126 by the competition. 
15395 The tripod is perfect for my needs. Compact and pretty sturdy considering its size. 
15396 Just as described 
15397 Very good product. 
15398 Does nice job. 
15399 This was plug-n-play with my NVR. Good picture on the test. I will update if that changes in actual operations. 
15400 Great! 
15401 these work too 
15402 REALLY GOOD, INCREDIBLY EASY TO FLY 
15403 Arrived on time and as described 
15404 Not like I had read but seller was great and a full return 
15405 good product 
15406 Fast service, simple! 
15407 battery does not last long enough 
15408 This is a definite must if you walk much with a heavy camera. This sling allows you to grab and shoot, never having to remove the sling. I use it at flying events and its perfect. 
15409 Works great. No problems. 
15410 Works as it should. 
15411 Excellent 
15412 Bought this with an extra 50mm lens. Love it so far. The extras that came with this bundle was like icing on the cake. Really happy with my purchase. 
15413 Flash is great but wireless adapter doesn t transmit TTL so it s useless. I couldn t even get my camera to trigger with it. 
15414 Love the cameras (3) of them. The picture is amazing. Vincent was amazing at his job and vary patient and professional. Thasnk you for your product. 
15415 Great product! 
15416 Really great for the price.. 
15417 Confirmed, bought this from Frys.com and had the exact same experience. It s unforgivable since I needed this for a special occasion and now I m hosed. 
15418 Very useful for my situation: OMD EM5 body plus ep3 body with 40-150 and a few primes: 75/45/25/14. The top compartment carries my headphone wallet and stuffs. Stylish outlook. 
15419 it iss exactly what i expected 
15420 Perfect for the C11. 
15421 very good 
15422 With Foscam support set up was fast. This is my 4th Foscam and I like the picture Quality of all of them except for the outdoor 
15423 Infrared is hard to clearly see anything. 
15424 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks!!! 
15425 Horible I didnt get all the sheets. 
15426 great deal 
15427 works fine on pentax. would buy again 
15428 Very complete kit and everything I needed to get started 
15429 I love this lens. Amazing sharpness, great quality build. My new favorite lens. I ll buy another. 
15430 So far so good. They charged properly and work just fine in my D3200, 
15431 Great value, love it. 
15432 Great product. Works fine with different branded flashes I own and my Sony A7ii as receivers 
15433 Seem to work just as good as the Go Pro batteries but are MUCH CHEAPER 
15434 Absof****kinglutey awesome. the batteries stay for many many hours of research. i personally talked with the manufacturer and he was more than happy to help with my questions about integrating the array into my system already! 
15435 Perfect fit 
15436 Awesome 
15437 Fast service. Great price. Great product. Could not find anywhere in our town. Thank you 
15438 I really like the look and feel of this case. It isn t a perfect fit, there is a bit of room in the case, but with the screw at the bottom it holds nice and tight. 
15439 It is a good tripod. It s not as sturdy as it should be, a little too light weight. But overall, a decent purchase. 
15440 great product 
15441 I love this camera! I have a bigger digital camera but this is much easier to use. Digital zoom and can work with one hand. Bought this for a cruise where we can only use fixed lens. 
15442 Stand was great and very easy to put up and break down. Would definitely purchase for future backdrops again! 
15443 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
15444 Actually it gets no stars! Am returning it shortly. Can load no photos from any source! 
15445 Good bundle and lots of extras included. Camera is great. Phots could be larger. 
15446 easy to install and do the job... 
15447 Good cameras and I did drawback does not have a particular site cameras for surveillance of mobile 
15448 Easy to install. Very good product! It works Very well! No regrets!! 
15449 Exceeded my expectations. Literally plug-and-play and very easy to set up. No frustration at all. I was up and running before my wife finished cooking dinner. 
15450 The animal frames are actually longer than pictured, and the circle frames are too big for the film, so the polaroids would actually fall out... The frames look equally sized in this picture, but they re not in real life. Cute frames, but not super high quality. 
15451 Nice unit. Was easy to program the Radio and Access. Keep in mind this doesn t support rolling codes. 
15452 Very high quality and compares perfectly to the Canon version. Adds noticeable weight to the camera, but not in a bad way. 
15453 This is a little snug for our camera but it does work. 
15454 Its awsome 
15455 Works perfect, you don t have to worry about your phone drowning! 
15456 good 
15457 really love it 
15458 These disks work miracles when shooting outdoors, it really helps get softer light when you don t have helping hands! 
15459 Well made piece 
15460 what power 
15461 Not for phantom 3 as described 
15462 Wonderful purchase...speedy delivery! 
15463 Great Kit 
15464 Fit in my camera nicely. Would recommend to a friend. 
15465 Lens is great. Cover arrived damaged, one of the latches was broken. 
15466 Very good product Works perfectly. I use it almost everywhere I go. Stunning video quality And just a fraction of the price of a GoPro. Can t beat it!! 
15467 Going back! Could not get the unit to recognize the transformer after numerous battery changes and 4 adults trying to program it. 
15468 The remote works fine. It s cheap built but works. The only problem was the manual that came with it belongs to a different unit. 
15469 Fits perfect 
15470 Incredible lens for the price! 
15471 Great price for 2 basic reflector umbrellas 
15472 great product fast delivery 
15473 This filter does not fit my camera, a Canon PowerShot SX530 HS. My mistake? 
15474 Believe item does not show sufficient authenticity. Would flashing light indicator help? Present location of camera is not in well lit area. This probably a deficiency. 
15475 These work great! 
15476 It really is 50 inches long, It is very light weight and will hold a phone perfectly. Won t tip over it can adjust it to loom up but not down. This is a great tripod for a amazing price! Definitely buy this tripod! 
15477 This has the quality you would expect from a Canon lens. Built solid and works great! 
15478 fits everything and the extras too ! 
15479 This tripod is very sturdy. I was caught up in a windstorm and the tripod and camera blew down. No damage to the tripod. Very easy to adjust and seconds to unpack and set up. 
15480 Good and portable 
15481 This is the second one I ve bought. They are great to take on location, easily packed with other film gear, very compact and it does the job of holding various size flexfills. 
15482 Great price love it feels very professional 
15483 As described. 
15484 junk! had bought a pair similar to this at BB years ago and they worked great (lost them)......these are just junk....never worked at all 
15485 Is perfect 
15486 This item allowed me to use 12 old filters from another camera, at a great price. 
15487 For the price you can t beat these binoculars. Not a big fan of the eye piece, still trying to find a set of shade out cups for a better fit and less glare. The clarity is good, adjustment is easy. For the price they are awesome. 
15488 As described but not the best 
15489 Works fine with GoPro. Feels cheaper and lower quality than real GoPro batteries. 
15490 Exactly what I wanted at a great price! 
15491 Easy to install and the position of holes to align the adjusting screws are accurate. 
15492 Works as advertised. Not sure what I can say about it. 
15493 As advertised. 
15494 I bought this as a gift to compliment the GoPro Black which I bought for a friend. He loves it and will use it on his trip. 
15495 Great person, I hope you live forever 
15496 Works as expected with the Nikon D750! 
15497 Awesome! 
15498 Cute design but it ripped in half already after me just opening it for the first time... :( 
15499 Great flash for the price 
15500 ok 
15501 This is a great system for doing close up photography. Very versatile and I ve been getting fantastic results, Highly recommended! 
15502 Good quality camera that is plug and play on the Swann 7200 series recorders. Night vision is very good, with a reasonable infrared LED array. Day vision is outstanding with good color and good balance between light and dark (shadows). 
15503 Nice little tool for the GoPro, very handy. 
15504 Backpack is holding up well. I put a dji phantom 3 drone inside with accessories along with go pro and point and shoot. Everything fits well and is protected. Good quality pack, very comfortable to wear. 
15505 Great deal. All of these are great quality, and worked perfectly. Packaged really nice as well, the case is an added bonus. 
15506 Love it! Ita a bit weird looking when not zoomed especially with a visible frame shot. Macro part works great. Cool carry bag. 
15507 It s perfect and really liked it. 
15508 Recommend this product 
15509 For the price the camera can t be beat. Performed as expected and the accessories which Listed as 90 minutes get about 60 min out of it.came with it work seamless. 
15510 its ok 
15511 Very good no problem for me 
15512 Garbage, does not do anything it is supposed to do, especially take video. 
15513 Love got it for my step daughters bday it was a hit does everything she needs it to do! Got here late and I paid extra for two day was my only knock 
15514 These are great. They let me use less expensive 3rd party batteries.. 
15515 good product for the price 
15516 Essential. I much prefer the two handled model. 
15517 Works great! It has almost 3-5 seconds delay on the relay mode and it is black and white at night. 
15518 I find this cam suitable for my purposes. I found the connection from wall outlet to camera, and to camera to USB to transfer recordings tedious,but other than that,good for the price. 
15519 Quicks ship, great service, both items work great. 
15520 This item s color is NOT what is pictured. It s really really orange, not brown at all. 
15521 Fit my Nikon 52MM AF and AFS lenses perfectly. it is always a good Idea to keep a few of these on hand and at the price you would be foolish not to 
15522 Nice product! 
15523 The bag is very spacious, camera isn t very stable, but everything else is secure. I would purchase this item again if I had to. 
15524 Perfect replacement for the lens caps that I seem to set down and forget everywhere I go! 
15525 Works better than my old higher priced item. I like that it uses simple AA batteries also. 
15526 There are some scratches. But It is a good price. 
15527 Works well with my older analog PTZ cameras. 
15528 This battery is a lemon. I bought it for photographing my trip to Europe and it simply did not work. When I charge it .. The indicator shows it s fully charged in a few minutes , however when I put it in the camera it s dead. Serious letdown. 
15529 This have worked out great. I ve had them for about six months now and they re in great condition. Definitely a great price for such and excellent product 
15530 Too noisey 
15531 Great for astrophotography. 
15532 Great product 
15533 Prompt delivery. Superb product. 
15534 Love this lens! This and my 55mm f/1.8G are my favorite and most used! 
15535 Does not work. 
15536 This worked great at first, but the mask was uncomfortable after the second or third use. I developed a knot and a bruise between my eyes and couldn t use it half the time on my diving trip.Not worth the $50 in my opinion. 
15537 Gift 
15538 Great bundle. I ve used most of the mounts from this and have had zero issues. 
15539 Twice the life of the standard battery of my hf400. 
15540 great 
15541 Love it and a lot less that Canon 
15542 fast shipping and just as described. Fit perfectly thanks 
15543 Won t Auto-focus with the Tamron 70-200 2.8 on D5200 works with 55-300 albeit very poorly. 
15544 It broke right away and we cannot return it... ITs junk.. 
15545 Fantanstic 
15546 LoveIt. I can video a whole wedding none stop! 
15547 Very nice, high quality and crystal clear. They work great. You can buy these with confidence in the Vivitar name. 
15548 Batteries just don t hold charge very long. 
15549 good 
15550 I was unable to get this due to coupon code issues wish this program recognized that 
15551 Gets the job done. Perfect for a amateur like me. 
15552 Works great at a better price than GoPro... 
15553 They work well. 
15554 2 additional years for less than the already low $19.99 they charge? Sign me up. It s a no brainer that if you get a Pentax you get the extended coverage. No complaints. 
15555 My camera fits perfectly. Haven t had it under water though. Tough and durable. 
15556 I like it as I longed for this one, but it is tad tight when put it on. I had to be extra careful when putting it on and taking it off. 
15557 It holds up well to the Nikon brand. I have been very pleased. 
15558 Very nice camera, very easy to set up, clear picture, I recommend if you purchase to spend the time to familiarize yourself with the settings. Also you install a 64gb micro SD card instead of a 32gb card. The phone app works really good for this camera. 
15559 Tripod is actually very stable and well built. Holds my Canon EOS 70D with minimal effort, I can, for example, shoot time lapses and have no issues. Overall it s a good product and it comes for a decent price. 
15560 performs as expected, good quality 
15561 One of the engines broke 
15562 Nice camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
15563 Works well 
15564 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
15565 Worth my money!!! 😊😊 
15566 Works great but mostly displays in black & white in low light conditions indoors. 
15567 weak that all 
15568 hands free video recording 
15569 Eats batteries 
15570 like it 
15571 Great lens and arrived quickly too. Fit my Olympus perfectly! 
15572 It works as advertised. I don t like that the battery only lasts about 45 minutes. Oh well, it was made cheaply and in China. Nevertheless, it serves my needs. 
15573 IT DOES NOT FIT IN THE CF SLOT OF THE NIKON D4 BUT IT WORKS IN NIKON D3 
15574 Awesome! We use them as baby monitors in addition to an Angel Care monitor and love them!!! 
15575 Excellent quality and perfect fit, really helpful in my last beach vacations! 
15576 cute borders! and they aren t flimsy. happy with my purchase 
15577 Does what a polarizer is supposed to do 
15578 One of the accessory the go pro need 
15579 Works 
15580 I haven t used it long enough to really know it s reliability but, it was at a great price, it shipped quickly and with no hassle. 
15581 Worked good. Inexpensive. 
15582 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
15583 Works great. Very affordable. 
15584 This case is very sturdy and the pockets are ideal not only for GoPro accessories but for other cameras as well. The net zipper pocket can hold a lot of stuff as well! I highly recommend this case! 
15585 I like it and good for the price too 
15586 Perfectly adequate CPL. No detectable loss of sharpness. but some graduated loss of brightness. I recommend multiple exposures at different rotations to see the results. 
15587 sturdy, good quality and a decent camera bag, can fit flashes and well organize 
15588 This is one of the best filters on the market. The threading is cut beautifully so I do not get that grinding feeling when taking it on and off like I do with other brands. Coating is flawless. No splotches or inconsistencies like some other MultiCoat UV filters. 
15589 Terrible customer support. Extremely difficult to setup. 
15590 Works great. 
15591 Works well and it has a car charger, which my original one did not have. 
15592 The P900 has far exceeded my expectations!i use it literally everyday. I have taken over 3000 pictures since getting this camera and can t believe the quality and capability of this camera! I take pictures of the moon everyday as well as the sunrise/sunset. Couldn t be happier! 
15593 Okay fit and finish, but the scale starts from the wrong end! Only really useful if the scale starts from the center of the camera, so that numbers are transferable to other setups. 
15594 4 hours recording and am out of 64Gig memory and still have just under half the battery remaining. Baddest batteries on the planet!! 
15595 Good camera, as I expected! 
15596 Just as described. Works great on my Canon 5Dmkiii. 
15597 This is a well packaged collection of must have tools to keep all aspects of your camera clean. Love the carrying case since it allows me to get everything together and it does not take up much space in my camera bag. 
15598 Nice case but save yourself some money and go to Harbor Freight. Exact same case is $25 or less there. 
15599 Not bad... Attachments were all too loose to hold gopro in on position but if you leave the bolts in the attachments very tight, it should bend the fittings very so slightly and make it work. And nothing is stainless so think twice about getting anything wet 
15600 I had the tough job of organizing my parent s photos. This book was perfect. I ended up buying several because they had so many photos. But for the price, these are very nice photo albums. 
15601 seems to attach correcto to nikon g lenses the manual aperture ring it is not so good as in a nikon manual lens good as comparison of other cheaper brands, not excelent 
15602 I am OBSESSED!!!!! 
15603 A little bit big for the Speedlight SB-500, you have to push it hard to fit well so does not falls 
15604 Love this product. Now I have three batteries for my GoPro and never run out on a trip. 
15605 Awesome and works great!!! Super fast shipping! 
15606 Filter works good, Gets the job done and protects my lenses.,also the vendor was great. 
15607 Very good 
15608 Nikon P610 Charges with this cable which is what I really needed it for, but does not work for data transfer. Would be nice if it worked to download pictures but at least it got my camera functional again for cheap. 
15609 As promised, works fine. 
15610 Speed! This lets you fire one after another on your speedlites/flashes. No more changing out the batteries every 10 minutes on your speedlites. Doesn t fit 430 EX II 
15611 I have no problems with the Syma X8W. I am just a horrible pilot. It is fun to play with. 
15612 I love this camera. I ve owned a lot of Nikon cameras in my life and this beats them hands down. Great camera! 
15613 Images are skewed or cut off, will not shuffle photos properly 
15614 Fits my 6d perfectly. Looks even better on it than the original piece. Great purchase. 
15615 Very Nice product but does not work in low light if thats what your looking for. Simple to use! 
15616 It did not work when it came in. 
15617 Works very well. Very pleased. 
15618 I lost my previous set of filters I had purchased at a camera shop. These are the same make and quality at a much better price, and easier than hassling the drive and parking. 
15619 Awesome security system! no problems at all. good for the price as well. I have recommended to several family members as they wanted one for them home. 
15620 Amazing lens - I was using the kit lens prior on my FS100 and holy cow this made a huge difference. If you are debating on wether this is the lens to get for a true 35mm on your E mount camera - go for it. 
15621 Item is as described. Reasonably priced. Well packaged. Completely satisfied and works as advertised. 
15622 Not very useful, it covers the wheel button to where it is very difficult to use it. It doesn t really provide that much protection either. 
15623 Very nicely made & easy to adjust & use. Olympus tough cameras are heavier than gopros but I tried it walking and with the stability system in the camera it seems to be just fine. Working up the courage to take it surfing..... 
15624 Printer won t connect to my android phone what can I do. It won t let me enter the default password. I ve even reset/restarted the printer and my phone but still doesn t work. Can t rate right now if product isn t working. Need some help 
15625 lenes works as well I thought it would 
15626 Very good picture and works well. Reliability is an issue. One out of five I purchased was DOA. Another one died after a little more than a year. 
15627 I was very upset when I left my extra camera battery and charger behind on vacation. I thought getting replacements would be expensive. I found this on Amazon for a great price. It works just fine and you can t beat this price! 
15628 Fast delivery very happy 
15629 I purchased this item for a friend who is extremely happy with this quality product. 
15630 Nice camera. Fairly easy to navigate, decent imaging, raw photos. I took photos of the moon and with breathtaking results. Zoom works great. 
15631 Exactly as described. Was surprised this was actually the go pro brand when I got it. Woked great when I jumped off the rock in Hawaii. 
15632 Small, perfect for a GoPro. Even fits in my padded GoPro case. It s a small Tripod so read the dimensions before ordering. 
15633 Great!!! 
15634 have two nice & smooth 
15635 holds well with pentax k5 & sigma 150&500mm lens& grip 
15636 great 
15637 A very light weight option for when you are not fighting the elements. Works great on a selfie stick. 
15638 Does just what I wanted it to do, protect the camera. 
15639 Portable, easy to use, does the job perfectly - no complaints. 
15640 I love these. I have ordered them twice. I especially like the size as so many of the cloths are tiny. 
15641 Housing looks great compared to the original clear housing. I have a all black motorcycle helmet so this was really needed. 
15642 Easy to operate. Getting good quality video. Very pleased. 
15643 Works fine. In order to prevent &#34;memory error&#34;, format it as FAT 32 and make the SD card as Primary Disk. 32 GB SD memory works fine on this. 
15644 This is my fourth Breakthough Photography Filter. You won t beat the Quality for Twice the Price. 
15645 Fast shipping and correct product! 
15646 Great buy 
15647 the kit seems to be what i ordered and i have clean lens now 
15648 Very sturdy, quick and easy set up 
15649 I got a lot of electronic devises in this bag for my trip. The bag is made of very nice material and looks nice. 
15650 What s not to love. This lens is aweswome 
15651 I guess this product is ok. It barely holds my I phone 6 without it popping off. 
15652 Have had no issues. Looks exactly as pictured.Pictures are the quality you would expect from a polaroid. 
15653 Just what I wanted... :) 
15654 Um… I never bought this… Yet it showed up in my Review your purchases … Mystery! Nothing charged in my name or on my account. I m sure it s a quality product, though! :D 
15655 Excellent product! Just what I needed for my lenses for an overseas trip. Fast delivery (sooner than promised!) and great price. Definitely highly recommend. 
15656 Works as described. I use it for cleaning my computer screen. 
15657 Used for snorkeling with the Go Pro and worked like a charm 
15658 Great product. Very clean and professional packaging. I used 3rd party software to configure my monitor instead of the included one, but works amazing. Would recommend to others. 
15659 This is a total scam!!! The adapter wasn t working at all!!! No specified 8V 3A output! It is a cheap crappy product, don t buy it! 
15660 Nice 
15661 Great security system, easy to install and pics on camera of surveillance is amazingly clear! I m impressed! 
15662 A little thin but over all its perfect for what I am looking for. 
15663 great 
15664 This kit works very well with my Coolpix camera. It has all you need. 
15665 So far so good. No issues in water. Product seems very rugged. Battery life is iffy. Buy some extras and keep them on hand. 
15666 Works great and comes with a ton of mounting options 
15667 Not bad for the price. NOT DGI. Product says DJI Phantom Prop Guards. DJI Is oddly similar to DGI. Coincidence? Product was OK. Fits Phantom 2 fine. Seems sturdy enough. Fulfilled by Amazon so no waiting for them to come from China. Not bad for $7.50 including shipping. 
15668 Great for carrying filters and it also carries my wireless remote for the camera. A lot easier that using the camera bag. Everything is right there when I need it. 
15669 The kit es very good, the antenna need s upgrade beacouse the range is poor. 
15670 great lens 
15671 Great Product 
15672 Ok. Its a bit complicated to use 
15673 Excellent for use with Lazes Levels.Very light weight. 
15674 These shorts are so comfortable, I don t want to take them off lol. Perfect size, not too big/not too small! Will definitely be ordering from here again! 
15675 Did not work when it arrived. Junk. 
15676 Great build quality of this charger. It fully charges my gopro in about an hour. 
15677 Awesome ....you can never go wrong with GoPro.... 
15678 works great, even in low light 
15679 An excellent pair of binoculars well suited for all outdoor activities. 
15680 Good high quality case. Very compact if that is your main focus it s the right case for you. If you want storage for more accessories you ll want something larger. Very pleased! 
15681 it s hard to get the top mount level/flat to take pics. it s very light which is good for transport, but kind of cheap feeling 
15682 DO NOT BUY!!! Charge lasts for 2 minutes.. waste of money. 
15683 I finally got to open this package.I love it. It was fun to put together. However my package was missing the equipment tray. A bit disappointing. Now i have to call them and go through the process. who has the time for that 
15684 ok 
15685 its ok for beginners 
15686 I actually use this for Nintendo 2DS! Works great. 
15687 This product is so much better than previous frames we have tried. Delighted with it! 
15688 Huge backdrop! Easy to use. Has a rod pocket for easy and fast installation. Machine wash & dry. 
15689 nice packaging and product 
15690 Small tight fit 
15691 Cute and works as described. 
15692 It is great! My daughter uses it for her photo shoots, and loves it! 
15693 These lights are wonderful for my youtube videos!! And the price I paid was even better. 
15694 Very nice. Compact. 
15695 Contrast leaves a little to be desired during use in full sun light but otherwise a very nice product. 
15696 Bien 
15697 Really like it and works well 
15698 this camera was for my daughter who is doing a lot of photography. .She is really satisfied with the quality. 
15699 It s small printer which is great to print small photos. It s great product 
15700 Love it. 
15701 Didn t work for very long. Worked exactly 2 months....now they won t take it back...very disappointed. Would not buy this product again. 
15702 It s ok. 
15703 It is excellent, is beatiful camera. 
15704 works like a charm!! 
15705 Two batteries, and a charger with car and European adapters, what s not to like? 
15706 Beautiful camera in appearance and function. Bought this as a gift for my wife to use for her other hobby of oil painting. She loves it, I m a hero and she uses it every day. Everything a person needs comes in the package. 
15707 I like this lens, I just wish that it would come with an adapter. Instead of having to purchase one separately 
15708 I like it very much. The only problem I have is that the monipod unwise very easy and it starts lowering. They need to put instructions with it. It took me a while to figure how to make the monitor the correct height. 
15709 AMazing, Bright WHITE, theres no hint of yellow at all in this bulb. Worth the upgrade in bulbs :D 
15710 Great deal. quite bright and easy to use. Not yet on a shooting with it. Is quite light, still feels sturdy, barn doors sturdy as well, The light stand attachment is plastic as well, but feels strong with a large knob. All in all, I m happy with it. 
15711 Pictures were average 
15712 Great protection, cleverly designed 
15713 Great product and the fact that you can change the settings via the remote is absolutely essential. Only complaint is the battery doesnt last that long when using extensively. 
15714 Excellent 
15715 Great Camera! Everything was included as described. Order came on time 
15716 Works fine 
15717 prompt delivery, a very good value 
15718 It s been working for a long while now but is still a bit confusing when you want to upload pictures to it. 
15719 This is definitely my new favorite lens (I have a Canon 50mm 1.4 and a Canon 85mm 1.8) Here are some of the pictures I took with it in my last trip (with a 6D) https://www.facebook.com/sebas.cantillo/media_set?set=a.10152917884986568.1073741912.561506567&type=3&pnref=story 
15720 Too hard to get batteries back out had to use pliers 
15721 The strap inside doesn t actually fit the camera. 
15722 So many pieces...the camera is super. Haven t tried the wifi connections yet. But the camera is wonderful. Checked out prices, wouldn t of gotten such a good deal anywhere else. Glad I purchased it. 
15723 Everything arrived as promised. The attachment line works well to keep me from losing the lens cover. 
15724 A great camera. Very pleased with all features and the sharp resolutions of the pictures. 
15725 Great Fit, just what I needed! 
15726 Great 
15727 Factory parts, same as the one that came in the Phantom 2 V. box 
15728 I am just an amateur but it works great for my purposes. 
15729 I was afraid it would not fit well and may leak. This thing is awesome cant wait to go snorkeling. Mask is very soft and comfortable gopro fits on it like a charm. 
15730 Actually, it s a nice set but I can t compare to anything...still haven t used them. 
15731 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
15732 Too big for left side mount. Only fits right side. I decided to purchased Morros brand fits and both left and right. 
15733 excellent product. 
15734 Loved this! Took it to Cancun for all my activities and went to the highest pyramid of Cancun to some of the deepest sinkholes! Through saltwater and all. Definitely recommend it. Although it did break on a skateboarding accident I would buy again and recommend to anyone! 
15735 Good 
15736 very good 
15737 great little camera. 
15738 I only bought it because of the length. It s the only good thing. No TTL no matter what I do. I have another shorter TTL cable that works like a charm, so I know it s not my speedlights. Don t waste your money. 
15739 This charger worked perfectly as it charged up the new battery we ordered. I am very pleased with the performance with this charger. 
15740 Worked as expected. 
15741 Full charged batteries, put them in my GoPro, immediately after my GoPro showed 1/4 battery life. I returned and purchase the GoPro official battery charger and battery. 
15742 Great back with just the right amount of compartments for my gear. 
15743 Point and shoot 
15744 This is great so far. It s sturdy gets to a very good height. 
15745 Fabulous for the money! Secure, easy to adjust with very nice strong replacement hardware for the gopro. 
15746 Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret? 
15747 I love my go pro, well made, durable. i use it all the time car,walk,bike, any where any time. if you are really active this is the camera for you 
15748 Not worth buying didn t do the job 
15749 Really helped us monitor our front door and our dog. Really came in handy when we got our puppy, saved a lot of anxiety. Still was pretty expensive for what it is, wifi drops often, and you need to buy the service really. 
15750 Solid. Has been reliable for a number of shoots. I would buy this again 
15751 Standard camera L-bracket works well 
15752 This is perfect if you are a blogger. It works perfect for food blogging and product reviews. I wished I had bought this sooner. The price is amazing, and it does so much for better lighting. 
15753 Not worth the money. Very flimsy and bends easily. 
15754 High quality extension poll. Haven t used it yet, but it looks to be very sturdy. Pole extends very smoothly! 
15755 Item came quickly. It works very well. It is easier to travel with since one does not need a cord with it. 
15756 Great deal! Just make sure that you hold the top of your camera when taking off the lens because some people have ripped peaces of the camera off! 
15757 Perfect item to add to your kit bag. I will use for wild life shots primarily and selfie family photos as well. 
15758 Good stuff 
15759 nice 
15760 Nice to have protection from dirt & dust. I lost original shortly after getting the camera. Will try to be more careful with this one. 
15761 This thing never dies. I never had to replace anything. 
15762 worked great 
15763 Very easy to put together due to the clear cut instructions on the enclosed video. This is not a flimsy product, it is well made. Will be using the MyStudio MS20 for my photography needs! 
15764 I always need extra batteries for weddings and this was a great price for a back up battery. It also lasts a long time! 
15765 Doesn t fit around the display very well. Especially by the flash button. 
15766 A must have for new flyers. Will save you from a crash. 
15767 Great product. Very good quality. I only wished it come with a rope or some kind of handle to easily carry it. For the rest, it has enough space and certainly will keep the GoPro save. 
15768 Great for party favors. Kids loved them! 
15769 yes I feel this is a excellent / for the money is great and I love it and I would recommend it to other people 
15770 Beware--These are not &#34;Sony Cyber-shot Digital Camera&#34; batteries! These are AA batteries and will work, but are not as advertised. Look closely and you will see they are made by &#34;Synergy&#34; in China! Misleading description and nothing special about them! 
15771 Fits perfectly using the 39mm filter threads on the lens, or on a threaded filter. Color matches very well to the standard Lecia lenses. A good deal, and MUCH less expensive than the lens maker brands. 
15772 instructions say frame the pic but there isnt even an opening (view finder) to see where it s aiming. further, the battery lasts not even a week. not holds a charge for a week, fails within a week. 
15773 Perfect for CANON EOS M3 
15774 The picture quality is very good both on the computer and the mobile app. night vision is also ok, this camera wont disappoint any budding geek like myself 
15775 I bought this pack with low expectation. I just want to try out ND filters. I m sure if I like them and start using them a lot I will upgrade to a set of nice quality, glass ones. But these are perfect to learn on for now. 
15776 very good I love it. 
15777 A must for serious lighting in the field for control and creativity. 
15778 I got it and charged it over night then it only worked for an hour then stop charging 
15779 Great tripod. works just at good as my $400 tripod. Wish I bought this first. 
15780 excellent item, solved my problem 
15781 nice 
15782 This battery performs as specified, and is good for 2000-plus photos with my Canon 70D. 
15783 easy setup to the wink system 
15784 The product was received as displayed and in a timely manner. 
15785 Compact yet roomy enough for all the essentials. We travel a lot and this is just what I was looking for to keep my gear safe yet easy to access. 
15786 It arrived a little later than expected. For the price it s definitely worth it although it falls off sometimes by itself. This is a great product although the original for my canon camera was much better 
15787 I love it! 
15788 Best cam in market for action sports, and it has so many accessories which make it the best! the only concern that it s so expensive I guess and you might need more than one GoPro to make a good videos.! 
15789 excellent 
15790 great seller - delivered as promised! 
15791 Perfect for a Canon digital & just what is needed. Nice case! 
15792 I would recommend any product made by this company. Their products are fantastic and the prices can t be beat. High quality merchandise and prompt service. When ever I want to purchase something for my Nikon I go to them first... 
15793 Excelent product 
15794 Good deal for the price ,will recommend it to anyone looking at buying a camera for a decent price. 
15795 The lens filter arrived in perfect condition. 
15796 Camera works real good, had a technical issue, but Walter worked it out fro me. 
15797 Works right out of the box when you add a photo source Looks great Nice Product with lots of extra features like music and video!! 
15798 Works as its description. Crystal clean video, fast setting, strong WiFi signal.! Great companion with Synology Surveillance Station! 
15799 This stand works fantastic on my desk. It does everything I hoped for at a great price. Easy to figure out without instructions. Very sturdy and light weight. Very versatile and allows you to more easily accommodate your creativity too. 
15800 Not very loud at all :( disappointing!!!! 
15801 Great product cleans glasses,computers,tv. I had a question and they answered in hours. Cloths are placed everywhere i need them. 
15802 Just one word........awesome! 
15803 wife bought this for me last xmas. works fine for it s purpose. had some problems with the &#34;water proof&#34; case. took it into the ocean and had some leaking. camera stopped working for about 24hrs. used camera with chest harness on a 5k fun run and worked within standards. 
15804 Good deal 
15805 cant go wrong for the price. 
15806 Love this Drone. Kind of wish I had paid a few more bucks and got the pro version, but this one still takes great video. I would suggest getting an extra battery though. 
15807 This is an update to my original review...Ritz did send the items that were missing (lens filters and another freebie instead of the remote). All replacements were Polarid brand. I was very satisfied. 
15808 Nice product and fast shipping 
15809 Recommended! 
15810 just what I was looking more. Exceeded my expectations. 
15811 Fast shipping, order 100% accurate, Thanks! 
15812 A great product. I bought it for a relative and he loved it. He uses it all the time and it still works great. You can see things clearly. 
15813 Great product to use with my GoPro. We needed something to use while on our ATVs. 
15814 Great bundle and great device. No issues at all. 
15815 The product was NINB but the buttons on the remote had scratches. Other than that everything works fine. 
15816 Broke/Fell apart within literally 30 seconds. The build quality was horrible. 
15817 Love this camera. It was recommended to me from a photographer friend as a good lower price range camera to start taking professional looking pictures with. It takes great sports shots and beautiful up close pics too. The bundle it came with had lots of great extra s too. 
15818 Light weight and durable! Works great with a GoPro! 
15819 ❤️ Them so cute 
15820 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
15821 GOOD PRICE AND PRODUCT 
15822 Great price. 
15823 The battery seems to be working correctly. The battery casing was coming apart when we opened the package but I super glued it and it seems to be holding so far. 
15824 The ball joint swivel does not lock very well, and the legs don t bend out evenly, some legs bend more and cause it to be uneven. 
15825 C6721625 - AROO4273 - Thank you Henry for your help - very knowledgeable about the camera I purchased. 
15826 Just right! 
15827 not perfectly fit but does its job. 
15828 These lenses have allowed me to take great photos with minimal effort using a cell phone! Highly recommended. 
15829 Great bag for the video camera 
15830 very useful stick. great for GoPro and phone and camera. I ll bring it to europe with me 
15831 photos developed great, really nice product 
15832 good tool works for me 
15833 Batteries.stay charged battery charger is light weight and can fit in your pocket. If you need an extra or lost yours Great set for the price 
15834 Had a bad experience. I will stay with the 70-200 2.8 is VERSION 1 
15835 does not charge other gopro batteries. 
15836 Worked perfect with my Phantom 2. 
15837 very easy to install and it looks nice having a new eyecup on my Nikon D90. 
15838 looks good 
15839 This camera is great and reasonable price for many components and camera. Also, it is proper to beginners who don t have deep knowledge about camera. 
15840 Awesome camera for an awesome price!!! The quality is unbelievable! I love the fact that the cam has a speakerphone, so I can talk to my dog when I m not home. Super quick five minute set up, and you re ready to go. Awesome awesome awesome!!!! 
15841 Good product. Everything as promised. 
15842 Best speed lite I have ever had! Was very user friendly! 
15843 Okay 
15844 it works well 
15845 Works as needed for extra power at a reasonable cost. A good buy. 
15846 Surprisingly good quality for the price. 
15847 Love it it s isn t really big but it is great so you can have all your pics in one place 
15848 It was easy to figure out, Now I can enjoy video chatting with my mom much better that putting it on top of the computer. 
15849 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works with camera as described. 
15850 You get what you pay for, sure there s better selections. But this works for me during a dive or snorkeling. 
15851 ok, but very small. 
15852 Pretty good for the price. I usually take filters off when photographing but put them back on for protection. Polarizer is okay 
15853 This arm supports my 7&#34; ikan monitor very well. If your rig s rails are already crowded, you can detach the arm from rail support and connect to any 1/4&#34; thread. For me, I connect it straight to the BMPCC Smallrig cage and hang off to the side. 
15854 none 
15855 Great product for doing video recording. 
15856 Great item!!! Helped me during E3 2015 
15857 great size of case to fit into a backpack!!! 
15858 Fast shipment. Easy to install..... As advertised 
15859 Fast and perfect.. Thanks 
15860 Set up was so easy. The image quality is great. And the remote use via iPhone is very good. We re very happy with the Nest Cam. 
15861 THis has allowed us to scan in pictures that could have been lost forever from times of our childhood. 
15862 A little pricey, but works as designed. 
15863 Perfectly fits the DJI Phantom 3 PQ Drone. Its the safest way to transport our Drone. 
15864 Pouches are excellent. Just buy em, you won t be disappointed. 
15865 Does not work well at all. 
15866 Much more power than battery that came with camera. 
15867 I have an FD 50mm 1.4 lens whose aperature will not open all the way with this adapter. There is an adjustment on the lens that will allow me to fully open the lens manually but then the adapter won t fit. Frustrated... 
15868 Excelente 
15869 Great case,the postage was outrageous 
15870 Cool! 
15871 Cool 
15872 Small enough to keep in my truck, so I can use when I really need it. I filled mine with rice, and it provides a good, stable rest for my DSLR and telephoto. 
15873 Nikon lens have a good performance, i love take pictures to distance that allow show a close up with wide background scenery. the delivery was on the provided time 
15874 Stronger then most. Can hold larger cams. 
15875 A great camera! The accessories included are pretty cheap except for the digital cards, but I have no complaints. Thanks Amazon and The Imaging World. j 
15876 This camera is amazing, I made wonderful pics under water , I recommend for everyone, and enyoy you memories en your pics 
15877 Great quadcopter, I was practicing using it in my house, and it was very easy to control. Took it outside, you can t tell which way is forward when it s high up in the sky. It flew away, out of range and I never saw it again! 
15878 It rocks 
15879 The video quality is poor. It looks like I am looking at a Sonogram. I am opting to rent a video line from Home Depot 
15880 I like it 
15881 The battery works perfect. I didn t have any fitment issues like some of the reviews I ve read. Definitely recommend the product for the price 
15882 The shipping was fast and the dedication from Amcrest to provide help and satisfy your needs is extremely nice. As for the product itself, the camera quality is really good, the image is nice and clear. The installation and setting it up and getting everything functioning was also insanely easy. 
15883 Very nice camera. It works well for what I use it for, it does some nice close ups but you got to be patient and wait for it to focus to get great photos, glad I bought it. 
15884 This is a great little quad. It s easy to set up and fly. For a beginner, I would recommend buying a crash set, with the prop guards, to go with the quad. 
15885 This is a good replacement part, not quite as solid as the Nikon hood but it does the job. 
15886 Excellent. 
15887 This is the perfect little light for the job. I needed some indoor pictures of a two-week-old baby. It is just the right light for the job. 
15888 Awesome little compact for my Camera. I didn t really use the solution or tri pod though at all needed the charger and spare battery which work great. 
15889 they work 
15890 Great and affordable bundle for the GoPro! Completely worth the money. However, it didn t come with instructions but if you just check out the GoPro website it is easy to figure out how to assemble everything. 
15891 I haven`t yet tried the audio, so...nothing to say there,others all ok 
15892 This little beauty adds more ways to enjoy my Go Pro camera. I clip it onto my backpack strap and I can instantly record anything I want. It s also very inexpensive and easy to use. 
15893 great 
15894 Not exactly what I was looking for but works well 
15895 Can be a little finicky and takes a long time to boot up, also does not find my wifi internet source on first try, but once it is up an going... This thing is a real gem. Better than any other streaming device I have used. 
15896 very good 
15897 If I was home I could connect but not 10 miles away sorry I had to return product. 
15898 On time, very good 
15899 Great deal! 
15900 I like the look of film 
15901 Good selection of mounts at a great price. 
15902 Great piece of hardware especially for the price. Using two of these to support an SB900 and a SB700 
15903 Still the best of the best 
15904 great camera 
15905 If you have a nex-5 you need this view finder. It takes your camera and your pictures to a whole new level 
15906 Works great, just what I needed for my camera. The batteries stay charged for a long while and I take my camera on the road so it s very important. 
15907 Amazing, just love it 
15908 Works as advertised. 
15909 Give it to my grandparents, they like it. 
15910 Works great looks great 
15911 good 
15912 ok 
15913 Great 
15914 it s ok 
15915 It s what I expected. 
15916 Amazing Lamp & Price! Light is bright and is a great investment for my job! Lighting is important for my studio and this just did the trick! 
15917 GOOD. 
15918 My students are really interested in the solar system and in reviews, this product, albeit a tad expensive, looked the best. We were not disappointed! Large, easy to assemble, looks amazing. 
15919 Had it for less than a month and already the wifi won t work and the car won t charge (the light doesn t turn on when charger is connected). I need to check if there is a warranty on this thing. 
15920 exactly what i was looking for. Helps organize everything and more. GoPro Hero 3 black edition. 
15921 Great fit! 
15922 Good protection and lightweight. The cover doesn t come with hardware to connect to strap when removed so you either have to hold it or place it down while taking pictures. There is a material loop which I was able to connect to strap with a binder ring. 
15923 I Love this little camera. It meets or exceeds all expectations 
15924 Got this for my gopro hero 4 and it works perfect. Awesome little case and we ll built and great quality 
15925 Great product from a great seller 
15926 just what my camera needed,, 
15927 Light works great. Came with easy to read instructions. Took a couple tries to get it to work, but once I got it. it was easy. 
15928 A great lense!! I have only used it a couple of times but definitely one lense I will take with me everywhere! 
15929 Awesome case. Highly recommended!!! 
15930 works perfectly 
15931 Great glass for the money. Can t beat Vortex for quality versus price point. 
15932 This is a great little camera! I like going to the Pacific Northwest rainforests so it is nice to have this along and not need to work about it getting wet. Takes awesome pictures too. 
15933 This is the worst product I ever bought Colors are not coming out after cleanning them twice it starts printing and after half a page it goes back to give horrible results 
15934 I purchased this as a gift to my husband for his birthday. He loves the camera. It also has a great video function, and records nice, clear videos. I would buy this product again for myself. 
15935 It s ok at best 
15936 Works great. 
15937 Good product. 
15938 Super fast delivery, product is awesome and works great. 
15939 Easy to install. Works as promised. 
15940 Awesome ! 
15941 Can t wait to get mine. The reviews sound great. Best part, I was concerned of it fitting my Sony A100, as it is not listed. But, one review was of the A100. It s on my wish list, can t wait. 
15942 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
15943 Fit perfectly, are easy to use, great price, and there are three of them! Can t beat that! 
15944 Worked as advertised. 
15945 Battery runs down too quickly. Does not record very much 
15946 worked great right out of the box 
15947 exactly match my tripod, official product! 
15948 We really love the images this camera records. Works perfectly now that it is setup. We mounted in the kids room and the image quality is fantastic during daytime or night time. It is nice to be able to control it remotely. Now we can get images anywhere we go. 
15949 Super handy 
15950 This is just the cord that I needed. My original is packed away in a POD and I wasn t able to charge my camera. Am now back in business. Thanks for the prompt service and perfect product. 
15951 Very pleased with quality and ease of use 
15952 Good! 
15953 I ve only been using it for a couple weeks, but it seems to work as advertised. Very happy at this point. I like the feature where it will recorder over the oldest videos if the disc is full. 
15954 Love this battery! They will run a lot longer than the OEM batteries which is important when you re right in the middle of taking pictures. 
15955 Just eh......I don t like how the plastic insert that holds the camera stuff keeps coming out. It is just over priced. The top section won t stay closed. I mean it works......but I wish I got something else. 
15956 It has a very bad resolution and it is very difficult to add or delete pictures. It is definitely not worth the money 
15957 I m reasonably happy with these batteries. I knew they would not match the OEM battery in usage time. 
15958 Returned after I got it. The picture quality was bad. 
15959 I have used these a few times. Like them a lot. Great for getting close up pictures without having to buy macro lens. 
15960 I m a professional videographer who routinely gets through an entire day of shooting on just one charge with this battery. I keep the OEM battery in reserve. 
15961 Have only used in the pool but works well. Wish the lanyard had its own mount hole but not a deal breaker. A low cost insurance policy when filming in and around water. 
15962 Great product. Use it for cleaning eyeglasses. They are larger than typical cloth used for glasses which makes it easier to use. 
15963 perfect! 
15964 Great Product 
15965 Works great 
15966 Great camera and the pictures come out awesome. 
15967 easy to fly,but battery does not last 5 min 
15968 Fits tight and keeps debris off the lens. It does not touch the lens surface when installed. I wish it had a lip so it would restrict how far it could be inserted. 
15969 Worked Great!!!! No fog like other cases. I went under about 13 feet without any problems. Clear pictures and all look amazing! Also, it float, so you can just put put the strap around your arm when swimming. 
15970 Excellent !! 
15971 Still learning how to use this. My brother loves his just like it. 
15972 Quick shipping, just as described. 
15973 Great lens. I use this lens for just about everything. The focus ring could be a little smoother as it tends to jump out sick when using the manual setting. Buy yourself a lens band, or a broccoli rubber band because it s weight causes constant lens extension... 
15974 VERY GOOD. 
15975 They made it right... a mishap corrected Thank you ! 
15976 Works really well...I just wish it came in better packaging so I could store it more easily. 
15977 fun and stylish 
15978 Makes noise while setting the focus, even in manual mode. Unfortunately, makes it impossible to record sound on the camera. 
15979 Internal charger in Kodak PlaySport bit the dust so found this as the replacement. Brought my PlaySport back to life in short order. 
15980 A fantastic flash at a fraction of the cost of the top brands. A solid buy for any photographer. 
15981 Awesome more fun than I deserve!! 
15982 perfect 
15983 Fits and works well. Panasonic should include this adapter as part of the camera rather than selling this as an accessory (since I believe that this was a faulty design at the beginning) 
15984 Can t beat the price 
15985 This bundle was actually cheaper than the just the price of the camera alone on another website; got a lot of extra stuff for a lower price. 
15986 Great 
15987 Finally got to try it, due to broken arm. Not what I expected. Don t know about t lens & was looking for more of a close up view. 
15988 great price/original nikon battery 
15989 not connected with wifi 
15990 I tried it with a37 and a65. Fits well, works fine, no problems, so far. Price was good, free shipment, and came fast. 
15991 This cord did not work and I was not able to return it 
15992 Good quality product. I recommend. 
15993 GPS is hard to use. Needs more match markings for barrel. 
15994 Ty 
15995 Love this! Seems to be very high quality, and for the price, it can t be beat compared to GoPro branded accessories! It has a VERY strong clamp, and the neck is very bendable. I m not sure why anyone would spend the extra money on GoPro brand stuff! 
15996 I am in love with this camera and my kid finds it very fun too. 
15997 Just fine 
15998 Works as advertized and certainly beats the high price of true Panasonic batteries. 
15999 purchased in 2010 for a Lumix and its a perfect fit and rigid 
16000 These provide good protection for the front lens element. I use Xume magnetic adapters, so I can have them on and off in less than a second. 
16001 Great cameras, work real good and clear. 
16002 Good case, protects your camera, and it looks chic and stylish 
16003 The best! 
16004 It s a great cam!! 
16005 So vintage and unique. The snaps on the back (the cover flap) come off too easily though. I am keeping it because it has such a warm caramel color to it! 
16006 Works as needed and is well made, what else is there to say? 
16007 Worked great in Romania! 
16008 best deal for the money 
16009 Very effective lens cleaning cloths. 6&#34;x7&#34; size is good and they are a good value as well. 
16010 Strong, solid, well made. I use them in my kit to hold my flashpoint streak lights, even at 90 degrees on a boom arm they are solid. 
16011 Good! 
16012 Good quality 
16013 This was a cheap replacement for an existing system. Q-See is fine for the home grade quality surveillance systems. Easy to set up and has a mobile app. Will work with most bnc cameras. 
16014 just received it ,but so for I like it 
16015 Absolutely outstanding. 
16016 This is a great product and works great with my GoPro, would definitely recommend this product and have had nothing, but a good experience when using it on my vacation. Seller was great and package arrived on time, as described. 
16017 Works like a charm 
16018 Great 
16019 Saved the day when the rain came!! Really easy to put on and coud keep taking pictures. Make sure you can the Pro version as it is the one with the velcro closure at the bottom. 
16020 great product for charging three GoPro batteries at one time. 
16021 Good product n easy to set up even if you are not an expert 
16022 Solid product. I was surprised at the size. This is a large case. I ll attach it to the outside of my camera bag. However it s designed to protect really expensive filters and protection matters. I have to get use to the size 
16023 Went windsurfing with it, and i didnt worry at all about my phone! It is an iphone 5c and I let it float with no problem. 
16024 Quite inexpensive and it delivers. I am surprised at how good the images are it produces. I would not hesitate to use if for professional applications. And the macro feature is very good too. I would recommend this lens to anyone. Russ 
16025 Great Tripod keeps my camera in place especially when I do portrait shots. Nice and lightweight easy to handle. 
16026 Henry at Foscam did an excellent job in assisting me with setting up my new cameras. He was very patient, methodical and explain what he was doing. I have had foscam cameras for 3 years now and have never had a problem with them. 
16027 Works great in camera, batteries charge up and camera works fine, again. 
16028 Received as described and promptly! Good quality and price. 
16029 It fits and all but it would be so much better if it was reversible for storage. 
16030 For the price you cant go wrong. This gives you the details you re looking for. 
16031 Yes it was used and had all the stuff, but it failed to operate. The code it was throwing was researchable on Google, but the fix listed didn t last. Sent it back for a refund. 
16032 No issues with the product or delivery 
16033 Perfect fit for my newest Canon Camera 
16034 Flys really good. Just wish it had more flight time 
16035 I m very pleased in how fast I received my order, I ordered the camera on Sunday and had it Tuesday morning, as we were leaving for vacation in Cancun and I wanted to use the camera under water. I ve played with the camera and so far so good. 
16036 Very good 
16037 Good quality camera for the price I wasn t expecting such a good picture I would buy again 
16038 Great bang for the buck. Works great. 
16039 Absolutely LOVE this thing. It s so cute and compact and easy to use. I ve already gone through most of the film I ve bought. I m going to use this for a guest book at my wedding, so people can include a picture in there &#34;words of advice&#34;. 
16040 So Far so good. Cloths are big, and I have enough for all my glasses and sunglasses to last for a couple of years! 
16041 Handy little wrist strap. I use it for my Canon G12. 
16042 So far it has worked well and the price was definitely a bonus for something of this quality. 
16043 Kind of big but its a great flash. I was very nervous to purchase, but glad I did. I use the front led light for nightlife photos. Helps a great deal! 
16044 The color,contrast and sharpness are great, I love how closeup it will focus. Feels solid, I have it attached to my OMD EM5 II - it seemed a little heavy and stressing my right-hand, so I purchased the optional grip and now it feels much better. 
16045 camera has great color and clarity 
16046 Works great, just the accessory needed 
16047 Works well for my small business. I even have one outside for back door security. 
16048 The result is awesome. Plain and simple. Is it crazy harsh light? Yes. It s continuous lighting so of course looking at the sun will result in some temporary blindness. Am I slightly exaggerating? Yes. See the picture :) 
16049 Love this frame, it is easy to use and easy to set up and has wonderful clarity. I wouldn t buy any other brand. 
16050 Love it! :) 
16051 More of a colorful child s toy than a useful instrument. NO focus after a literal few feet. They are ALL like this. WASTE NOT your monsy. Worthless as well in warm weather. 
16052 I have barely began to use the lens. So far excellent. 
16053 Item fits on my two lenses, works well. 
16054 just what I need fo macro photos 
16055 Smelly when I first got them, but I put them on my porch for a week or so and smell is gone. 
16056 Its fun, you get exactly what you expected, a different way to use your DSLR, also you get 3 macro, so you dont need to buy another product to play with. You also need to use it in lighten places, and on manual. Thats all you need to know. 
16057 Don t buy this. I am not able to close my screen completely after applying this. It s not fit for the d5300. Now this company wants me to explain the way I installed a screen guard. It s really pathetic. 
16058 This cage DOES NOT fit the a7rii. The battery door does not line up and the top dial is severely blocked. Good build quality however, just wish it fit like it claimed to. 
16059 Light work awesomely!! Have to take pics for my business website and boy do they light up!! Received them as expected, great packaging too! 
16060 Camera takes very nice pics. This is a very reasonable bundle. 
16061 great item,you can charge a battery. instead of using you camera. fast charging good battery too.great addition to your cam setup. 
16062 Honestly, spend the money and buy a quality UV filter. This one left my images all very fuzzy and streaky. I ended up taking it off my lens and the images were 10 times sharper. 
16063 did not come with a power supply. other customers said the same thing AFTER i purchased. o well. it is going back! 
16064 nice product 
16065 was exactly what I wanted. Worked perfectly on the device 
16066 Fast shipping great value everything you need to get started 
16067 Awesome camera works perfect and its easy to use 
16068 Great for viewing sun spots. Was hoping to see more than just sun spots, but maybe I m not using it correctly. Not sure if it s possible to see sun flares or other exciting events. 
16069 Bought the rotary slide tray,as I had a Sawyer slide projector given to me,but had no slide trays. The slide tray was given,along with the projector,to my relatives. And yes the slide tray was in perfect condition. 
16070 Basically no useable directions, and not user friendly at all. I can t even tell if this thing is broken or if I m not using it right. Definitely don t waste your money. 
16071 Battery works fine. Doesn t seem to last as long as stock battery. Still a good a cheap alternative. 
16072 NEED TO SEND BACK A $200 BATTERY THAT DOESNT WORK 64 GB MEMORY CARD DOESNT WORK EVERY THING ELSE WORKS 
16073 Clearer at night than day. Night vision is outstanding. Camera is bigfer that what was expected but very happy with it. 
16074 Gift for my mom and it works great. 
16075 poor quality. top button doesn t go all the way in. hinge is very poor quality. comes off so easy. 
16076 never worked. in trash it goes 
16077 best value I have been able to find. 
16078 It s an attractive bag but it s not constructed as well as I had anticipated. 
16079 incredible offer! 
16080 I was very happy with my purchase. Had a trip coming up when I ordered it, and I came in very handy, having extra charger and batteries. 
16081 Really Good !!!! 
16082 the best deal in cameras ever ! i own two and want more. 
16083 easy to hook up well made 
16084 These rear lens caps fit the lenses snugly and are the same quality as the Sony covers received with other lenses. I m purchased these go to on the Sony 28mm f2 lens which did not come with a cap. 
16085 Like it a lot, but wish I had spent the additional $$$ to get the 55-300mm instead. Probably would have been worth the money in the long run. 
16086 I believe in good metal screw-in lens caps. They stay on and are more difficult to lose. I ve used these since the late 1960s. 
16087 does what I wanted 
16088 Extremely pleased with the product. Arrived just in time for my trip to Southern California where there is just too much light. The filter did an amazing job in places like Palm Springs, Joshua Tree National Park and the Salton Sea. 
16089 This id the perfect screen protector for the Nikon D5300. Buy iy and you will like the protection it gives the display. Good price also. 
16090 Thank you, splendid item! 
16091 Very Nice will enjoy 
16092 it is goood!! 
16093 Camera came highly rated and did not disappoint. The only drawback was no manual but I knew that beforehand 
16094 Super sharp, not too heavy. Only thing missing is IS and anyone who buys this goes in with eyes open, so there s really not much to complain about. 
16095 I purchased the 2.5 amp version at the same time I purchased my 8&#34; Schmidt-Cassegrain and realized that the power was not sufficient. I purchased this supply subsequently. I like the addition of the screw connector on this model. 
16096 Canera excellent some of the accessories are of questionable quality but time will tell. 
16097 Pretty neat device with remote controlled pan and tilt. I used it while I was on vacation to look around the house and it worked pretty well in day and night. 
16098 I was unable to get the motion detection to work properly, despite moving the cameras to many different locations, and trying front-on and sideways motions in front of it. I returned the package to Amazon. 
16099 Does a good job of keeping on my shoulder. Not sure if much more comfortable than the wide canvas strap bag already has, though. 
16100 Love the boarders... 
16101 LUUUUUUUUVED IT!!!!!!! 
16102 Very well made product. Good value. 
16103 Great deal! 
16104 No problem at all. Meets all expectations. 
16105 Very Good Product 
16106 Met my expectation.and it s works good on my camera. Described as I received the right product. 
16107 Got camera without Instruction Manual in English. Please send me an Manual in English language. Regards, B. Jezdic 
16108 I was tired of the pantry light with a pull chain and this wireless wall switch was the perfect solution. It was easy to install and works perfectly. I love it and would definitely recommend this item to anyone with a need for it. 
16109 Nice camera and very easy set up. Works as well as expected. I will purchase more of these. 
16110 does not tighten properly. falls off camera every now and then. one shoe that does not have a stop fitted,has a tendency to have the product mounted to it,come off. 
16111 Thicker than your average Compact flash beware if your device has strict dimensions as mine did. 
16112 took a moment to understand the new lens attaches directly to the old lens not directly to the camera. Works well and does improve the zoom. 
16113 Great binoculars. This is the second pair I ordered. Very easy to adjust and the magnificatiuon is great. 
16114 Best Camera I have EVER had! Superb. Small, fit in small crossbody purse I had at Disney...and the photos are great. Easy to use and better Zoom than my previous &#34;Big&#34; camera. Will never buy anything but Samsung again! 
16115 Excellente item, excellent quality! 
16116 Excellent. No trouble staying on my D750 like the original failed to do, and seemingly the same style and material. 
16117 Works perfectly 
16118 pics arnt Fantastic, but there good 
16119 Love it! Great lens 
16120 Works well 
16121 Very good filter. 
16122 Does the job, love that camera! 
16123 Thanks 
16124 It works perfect. 
16125 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
16126 I bought this as a gift for my fianc&eacute;. Last summer I purchased the mini neo instax camera for his birthdays. I thought this would be a nice accompaniment. He absolutely loves it, and it works remarkably well. 
16127 Hard to find item. Glad to get it at a good price! 
16128 it s like a camera pillow for your eye hole. 
16129 Fit well on my gopro hero 4 silver. Everything I expected and will try them diving soon. 
16130 rec d as promised and as advertised 
16131 It is hard to rate this item since the battery that came with the camera was defective ( would not hold a charge ) and I could not replace the camera. 
16132 LENS produces excellent IQ. Priced very reasonable. Iwould buy it again. 
16133 awesome you just have to be gentle with it or it will possibly break 
16134 Great product! Gave as a gift , used onstantly! 
16135 Just what was needed for trips. 
16136 This item works fine as a screw-in lens hood, except that it only adds about 7/8&#34; out from the threads, not really much shading. Mine actually looks skinny relative to the one pictured. 
16137 Very nice camera. I really love it. Now if I can learn to use it a little better. 
16138 Worked very well! 
16139 Ok, fits well, looks nice. The unit I got had a mark down the middle. Looked like it had been scored by a box or box cutter when shipped. Arrived in time for our trip and looked good while protecting the camera. 
16140 The umbrellas that come with this are decent but the rest of the kit just screamed super cheap. 
16141 Quick response and a gfood product.Favorably priced. 
16142 Very Cheap And Defective. 
16143 too small for my canon 100-400 lens and camera shame, it was nicely made 
16144 Very good quality and versatile. 
16145 Great accessory especially for longer shoots. Slight learning curve but worth it! Keeps weight balanced and distributed to both arms! Definitely helps with arm fatigue!!! Been using it with my canon 6d. Its Small, lightweight and well constructed! 
16146 Awesome pair of binoculars for the price. Super clear, easy to hold and focus. Great buy. 
16147 Very satisfied with results of this product as of today. Received an excellent support from vendor with a couple of issues with installation. I would buy it again. 
16148 The battery charger arrived in no time at all! It works great and better than the original charger. Just in time for my vacation pictures. Thanks so much for the timely delivery! 
16149 good quality, exactly what i expected 
16150 This case carries all of my GoPro equipment. I love the color and material. Very handy when going on trips. 
16151 great camera and easy purchase 
16152 It is working like a charm on slides from the 60 s & 70 s! 
16153 I love this, it has everything I need until I can find the bag with all my accessories. 
16154 love this camera 
16155 Different from what is described and from the product pictures; mind did not have the white rubber grip stripes. Judging by other reviews, its seems that there are many version of this product. 
16156 Works great! 
16157 Very nice camera, all I wanted and more. 
16158 This thing is AWESOME! 
16159 good product for my go pro a real must at times. Thanks!! 
16160 Total JUNK!! Do Not Buy!! It would not connect to wireless router plus when you finally have the camera hooked up through wire but then screen shows up black no pictures!! 
16161 good 
16162 nice toy, impractical. Better get rx100 and connect it to phone 
16163 Love this little set up, I ve had it since 2011, I use it often and take it out on location too! 
16164 Fits my neewer vk750ii speedlight, a little loose but it will work. 
16165 Everything it said, everything works great 
16166 I bought this camera to peek in on my cats when away. It worked just fine. I didn t get the model that zoomed but if I were to purchase another I would get that feature. Good picture, easy to install and view. 
16167 This doesn t fit the Neewer flash at all. It s too small. The description says it will, but it s too small, even after trying to bend/shape it a bit 
16168 Poor quality and did not work effectively. 
16169 love it perfect 
16170 Perfect 
16171 Worked like a charm 
16172 I use these cloths to clean all types of things-cell phone screen, computer screen, eyeglasses, etc. A rainbow of colors and handy to have all over the house. This is a great value. 
16173 Great backpack! flew with it as a carry on no problem light and nice 
16174 I m enjoying this as a reliable camera with auto settings -- good pictures and easy to use. 
16175 Works great on Nikon DX AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED. Took about 30 minutes to remove the old part and install the new one. 
16176 I bought this battery for my Nikon D3300, It did not work with my camera. Its not made for working in a Nikon camera. 
16177 Good sized bag. Fits camera body and two small lenses. Great for using when I m out on my bike. 
16178 Fast delivery. High quality. A lot of fun. Just buy and enjoy. 
16179 Great Kit for reverse lens macros! 
16180 perfect! 
16181 Perfect!!! 
16182 Thank you for the replacement of the remote control it work on my Canon 70 D thank you very much I appreciate for your kindness 
16183 great bag just wish it was a tad bigger 
16184 Vincent was very patient and helped solve my problem. Thank you 
16185 Very nice camera for non-professional! Easy to use and good results. 
16186 Love the camera! The quality is really nice, me and my bestfriend do vlogs and its the perfect mini dslr! Great buy! 
16187 Cowboy Studio does it once again. This backdrop is perfect for on-white photos. One side is almost luster, while the other is glossy. Its easily cleanable and stores nicely. 
16188 Works great! Just what I needed for my canon rebel camera. 
16189 good fit 
16190 Clear picture quality for price. Highly recommended. 
16191 Happy with it simple installation good picture quality i could see my house from anywhere anytime 
16192 A great addition to my collection. I highly recommend it. 
16193 Great, works fine. 
16194 Amazing quality for the price :) I was pleasantly surprised and WOW the shipping was lightening fast! 
16195 ok 
16196 I have one and need a second one, so I purchased again. Works well with the batteries for my Canon EOS M. 
16197 it brings life to my flash light!! love it! a must-have. 
16198 I got this for my camera so that I could use for my phone. It does fine!! 
16199 I ve had this for less than a month and it has already broken. What a waste. 
16200 great belt 
16201 quality product 
16202 I am just getting back into photography and love these little helpers. As I get better I will put them inside my camera bag but for right now I keep them very close at hand 
16203 great product 
16204 Very good remote control. Works well with my Canon camera. 
16205 Flawless. 
16206 Works well. 
16207 absolutely love it!! so nice to have two batteries charged at once and the graphics to let you know status. 
16208 For fun is ok but You ll get what you pay. Can t compare to GoPro lol 
16209 I bought this tripod to support my iPad. The mount I bought attached no problem but this tripod is not strong enough to support the weight of the iPad. Even when it s all tightened it droops down. Very disappointed! 
16210 Nice case. My Pentax K-30 fits pretty well, even with my longer zooms. It could be a bit too small for an SLR with very long lenses. 
16211 Great little tripod 
16212 I absolutely love this film and the price is unbeatable compared to others. 
16213 I am huge guy but still stripe is too large. I have it tide up to max but there is still a lot of space and possibility to slip from my wrist. 
16214 This is a great lighting kit. So easy to use.Well made. 
16215 Exactly what I was looking for! I immediately discarded the clamp that seemed weak compared to GoPro s version. I attached it directly to my kayak and now I get some great shots. Affordable too. 
16216 The quality of the monitor is good; it does come with a F970 battery plate and works perfectly; the overall design is compact and nice, good workmanship. 
16217 I guess it s a great product, never really used it. 
16218 Great pad 
16219 I received my frame one week ago. It was very easy to load and has worked perfectly since turning it on. The picture quality is very good. I would definitely buy it again! 
16220 Works really well so far. Good features. 
16221 I absolutely love this lens! It s perfect for macro shots of flowers, portraits and it s even great as a medium range zoom lens! I d definitely recommend it! 
16222 Fits PVS-14. I understand the right thread is 30.25, but the 30 is loose and this is tight. I like this better. 
16223 Very nice, great lens! 
16224 Awesome camera and lens package. 
16225 Item is scratch on the screen it look heavy used (not used only twice) as advertise missing Lens cap, dusty in side the Len but it is functions, next time better buy new don t trust the advertise. 
16226 will order more when I need it 
16227 Great price for a really decent tripod. 
16228 The floats worked great. i checked them in my pool and they kept all my cameras from sinking. i liked the fact you could use the quick disconect to go from float to regular strap 
16229 A cheaper plastic not sure how it will work under pressure or in water 
16230 Didn t pay attention to the fact that the camera is rechargeable. I don t always have the power supply to power up again on the road. Otherwise, it is a small, functional, and easy to use camera. 
16231 As expected 
16232 I suppose 3.5 stars would have been more accurate. Only one of the batteries worked. The other we only found out was a dud until after the 3-day return period had ended. 
16233 Just as advertised. My only wish would be for it to be little beefier so that it can hold a reflector at any position set. 
16234 Very good package. I recommend. 
16235 It does NOT have night vision and it DOESNT connect to my iPhone waste of money and time 
16236 Got these for fathers day and really think they are a great pair of glasses. Very sharp images and easy to focus. 
16237 Works very well. 
16238 Why waste $ on Go Pro? 
16239 great buy, batts last long, lightweight and portable. 
16240 love using it have gotten great results 
16241 Love it 
16242 We wasted our money on this one. It did not work in our camera. The camera did not recognize it. 
16243 Takes a steady hand but with careful installation and clean area the shield works fantastic! Fits perfect and is invisible on the camera. 
16244 Great product, easy to use, super clear and simple to focus. Can t believe they are discontinuing this product 
16245 Perfect as usual. You can trust Tiffen and save money too. 
16246 The filter often come off when changing the hood. Should have bought more. Can see hood in some zoom in shots. 
16247 Easy to use! 
16248 So far so good, great storage for my Phantom 2. Fits snug in the bag with H3-3D Zenmuse attached, quality is decent. plenty of room for accessories like batteries and tools i need like small hex screw and phillip. 
16249 No it s not working I needed return it? 
16250 Super easy to install and my test shots show a nice improvement over direct flash without the shadows caused by bouncing it off the ceiling. Definitely a nice option to have in my arsenal. 
16251 I was a bit leery when I realized exactly how lightweight this tripod was, but was reassured once I tried it out. Admittedly, my photography is mostly indoors; I don t know if this thing could stand up in a stiff breeze, but for my purposes it s perfect. 
16252 Great design and easy to use 
16253 Superb...A plus 
16254 Henry at Foscam tech service helped me set up remote access to the camera and everything is working as expected. The quality and price are great and it serves my purposes very well. The tech support person was very knowledgeable and addressed all my questions. 
16255 Very happy. 
16256 I am still leaning to use these but I highly reccomend them 
16257 Big, bulky 
16258 good 
16259 Wow, I should have gone to 2 inch viewing long ago. 
16260 works well but if you have the extender arm unclamped a small pin can fall out and make it unusable. Just remeber to keep the clamp locked at all times 
16261 Super cute camera! Doesn t include any film though. 
16262 Great product! 
16263 fast shipping and the replacement was great 
16264 A good product. 
16265 The camera was more than I expected. Great buy for the price. Also, the support and service was way above expectations. I would highly recommend Digideals4less. 
16266 This tripod is better than expected! It is light weight, but very sturdy and easy to use. Great company to work with, great product and great price. Thank You!!! 
16267 so it s good I like it but it don t pause so use WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER to merge vids 
16268 Great camera works as expected. 
16269 Arrived when promised, charged it up, put into my camera and it worked superbly. Thank you STK. 
16270 Does not fit my battery. I have to &#34;tape&#34; it down just a certain way, in order for it to work. 
16271 Very Good 
16272 I can now recharge my battery (or spare battery) inside or in the car. Good set. 
16273 Great deal, works great. 
16274 This thing is awesome, very straight forward. A bright LED attached to a heatsink. The ONLY problem with it is that the fan is too loud for audio recording... but what I m doing is buying a good case fan ($15 max) online and swapping it for a quiet one. 
16275 Exactly what was needed. works perfectly 
16276 It s a good buy for the price ..only thing tripod is the cheap model 
16277 Outstanding image quality 
16278 Went dead before I could even use them. They need to be uses as soon as they arrive. 
16279 I love this lens. Such a great deal for the price and the images are so sharp. Produces a wonderful bokah! 
16280 They get the job done for fair price. 
16281 VERY CHARING AND PROMPT... 
16282 Poor quality - juddery. Nylon slider guides seem to have too much friction to be useful for video work. 
16283 Works fine 
16284 Great product. Easy to use and very efficient. 
16285 These things are worth their weight in gold! 
16286 AAA+++ 
16287 Excellent product. Works perfectly at a big discount on the Nikon product. 
16288 Cool bag! Lots of compliments. Outside is almost too nice to accidentally scuff. Inside is very firm foam. Zippers...holy cow. Weather resistant and you can feel it when you use the zippers. Very resistant when used. Inside of lid uses entire lid and zips closed to use full space! 
16289 This is a great camera for saving memories. I highly recommend it. 
16290 An excellent, easy to use and sturdy table-top tripod--- works well with the FugeTek selfie-stick I also purchased. 
16291 [[VIDEOID:76a1a54ded862b79ccdd6f8e1362a7c8]] The product arrived on time, but one of the bulb was damaged. Tried resolving with seller, but could not. 
16292 great for my strobes and speedlights for the price 
16293 Its a good starter telescope,it does not have an adjust handle and you can only look at the moon 
16294 Great extension for outdoors surveillance camera. 
16295 It was nice 
16296 Almost perfect. Needs a closure for the inside (battery) pocket. as is, the battery falls out when removing camera. I will need to sew-in a Velcro strip to secure it. 
16297 Great hidden camera. 
16298 I borrowed one before I bought this, I liked it and it works well for a cheaper option, I haven t noticed that double circle you get with some of the other cheap ones. Good for the money 
16299 A bit heavier than I had thought but not too bad. Easy to use and takes excellent pictures. I was looking for a lens for shooting wildlife without having to pay for a pro level lens and this one is perfect. I highly recommend it. 
16300 Nice package for a good price. Although not evident from the photo, the charger and batteries are produced by Vivitar, a name I have come to trust over the years. Seems fully compatible with the Olympus camera, charger, and battery. 
16301 Love this camera. Takes great photos with a faster shutter. With an add bonus of using AA batteries. 
16302 I m really excited to take up this new or almost new hobby to be more than a hobby I dont know. I might not be like a Grandma Moses but I think the enjoyment wiil out way any bad things that might happen I expect lot s of fun 
16303 A good looking case, just fits my Nikon 3200 with zoom lens, but it fits and it works. Well constructed. 
16304 I bought this ring to use my 58mm filters on my 52mm Canon 24mm pancake lens. It works exactly as described, and the quality is top notch. The included cloth is a nice touch as well. 
16305 excellent 
16306 This grip is a lifesaver. Makes holding the camera so much easier. 
16307 These are simply wonderful!! The feel of the microfiber is really great &amp; they work nicely on my items. These are so nice I used the first one and placed it back in the plastic holder it was in...I ve never done that before with any other cleaners. 
16308 After getting hosed by a hobby shop in Detroit, I did what I should have done in the first place. Fast shipping, exactly as described. Thanks guys! 
16309 Good except the portion that holds the camera is flimsy. I just use it for my iPhone and it can barely hold that. 
16310 Works great! 
16311 Used at my shop door I installed facing down and do far -great! 
16312 This has made a large difference in my ability to manually focus my camera. Well worth the extra cost. Only gripe is that is sticks out a little more, but in a short while, you wont notice. 
16313 keeps it dry... 
16314 Nice for the price. 
16315 This is awesome camera... 
16316 Excellent camera, the LCD screen makes it easy to use in situations where the camera isn t on a mount. 
16317 Wonderful product!! So easy to use! 
16318 quality product 
16319 I LOVE IT! 
16320 LOVE IT 
16321 Great little charger for home or auto. I have not charged the batteries, but look forward to taking this on our road tr vacation 
16322 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support was very helpful in getting me connected remotely to the camera. 
16323 Just what I was looking for. Works as it should. 
16324 Does what you would expect, protects you lens 
16325 So handy and a better option (imo) than buying the instax camera. 
16326 Keeps the light out of the view screen, fit my D70s perfectly. 
16327 Excellent 
16328 Love this film! So stinkin cute and a really good deal! I use it with my Instax mini 8! 
16329 Great camera to keep an eye on things in your home when you travel! We bought it so that we could see our dog while we were gone! 
16330 That is a nikon lens. It should say it all. Perfect quality, Pictures come out perfect !!! Great lens for the price. 
16331 This product is handy, great purchase! 
16332 Does everything as advertised, an amazing machine. 
16333 Just as described, delivered quickly. 
16334 I ve not used any of them yet. Ordered them for a party. They are cute though. 
16335 Awesome lens love it on my camera 
16336 Henry fi9826p great help very good 
16337 Did not realize this shipped from china directly, so shipping took a little longer then expected. Overall a good product though 
16338 Great product so far 
16339 thank you 
16340 It s great having spare batteries for my camera! They work just as well as the original and the charger will charge the original battery. 
16341 I was very pleased with the camera and most of the equipment included in the package except the slave flash. The slave flash is extremely poor quality, the battery cover will not even come off so that i can try it out. 
16342 A bit expensive but ok 
16343 A very sharp lens. The camera is filled with features that move it past the usual point and shoot. 
16344 Very nice 
16345 Purchased this for my son for our Florida vacation! Was skeptical buying this unit. This little GeekPro is amazing. The quality of the video is awesome. It is worth every penny. Great product! Highly recommend! 
16346 Its a spare battery. Seems to do the job 
16347 Does the job, and the package came with a cute pink stylus and something else I m not exactly sure what it is. I think it s some kind of mini stand for a phone? 
16348 Great buy, especially for those that need the power. Pack has been going strong since purchased in 2007. I would highly recommend. 
16349 Awesome product 
16350 It doesn t work. 
16351 worthless. cameras stop working on first day. no warenty. 
16352 Excellent product 
16353 Great product. 
16354 Not good, cheap quality, come without instructions in an envelope. 
16355 Works fine! 
16356 Better than I thought 
16357 It s what I expected 
16358 Works extremely well and a great alternative to OEM batteries 
16359 Came on time. Works perfectly. No problems at all. 
16360 Exactly what we hoped it would be. Large viewing screen and clear picture. Love it. 
16361 This lens took ok pictures, but the build quality left me wanting more. The body was loose and rattled and the aperture ring did not adjust consistently. Because of this I returned the lens and will be buying a rokinon. Hopefully the quality is better. 
16362 Love it! 
16363 It s an OK bag. It s really nicely built, but it s not as big as I expected. I was looking for a larger bag than what my Canon EOS 7D came with. I will use it in place of the Canon bag. 
16364 Excellent pictures. Easy setup. 
16365 Cheap and works as it should! 
16366 Very good case, perfect for my camera. 
16367 These batteries work perfectly I my D3200, and the charges last a bit longer than the OEM battery that came with my camera. The car charger works great and will recharge a battery quite quickly, as does the wall charger. The chargers also will recharge the OEM battery. 
16368 Great camera for the price point. But if you plan to use AUTO mode instead of MANUAL, you will NOT be able to record to 2 SD cards simultaneously. If you like dual slot recording, so you ll always have a backup, it only works in Manual mode. 
16369 good product 
16370 as described. Thanks! 
16371 All perfect 
16372 Nice quality product. Delivered on time. 
16373 My pen came in and the camera was sunk down inside the barrel of the pen... I was able to align it.. For what it is, it works pretty good 
16374 Packing spares! 
16375 Exacly what i needed 
16376 Eliminates the sun problems you have with the gopro. 
16377 This thing is solid! Make sure to push the mount firmly against your surface then engage the lever to suck in the cup. Really good mount. I feel no worries putting my gopro on it. 
16378 Nice product for the price. Pictures look clear, sharp image. Easy to use. 
16379 i love this camera, excelent product 
16380 I use it for snowboarding. no problem. 
16381 Perfect for the job 
16382 not bad for the price 
16383 Great product. Fit perfectly with slik 6600. Received when expected. 
16384 Is a excelent len for a good price. 
16385 It s a good deal! The price is very reasonable. Both the battery and charger work great. I used the battery for over 5 hours in my Sony camcorder. The charger is so convenient for traveling which included a European adapter plug and a car charger. 
16386 software is weak camera better 
16387 Hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain. - John Mayer 
16388 Great item, burt I haven t used it since I struggled with how to get it going and no instructions came with it. Still I am happy I purchased it, just need some digital assistance. 
16389 Great value! 
16390 The ad said it fits Canon Cameras, I wanted it for my X, does not fit, wasted my money 
16391 Perfect piece feels very well made 
16392 Works as needed 
16393 Good quality product. A little heavy but offers a lot of protection. 
16394 Goog size. And seems robust. 
16395 Did not consistently work. Tried using the expensive Energizer batteries that would last longer, and the camera wouldn t turn on. Goes through normal batteries exceptionally fast. Pictures were acceptable, but with it not working much of the time, my son (to whom we gifted this item) was constantly disappointed/frustrated. 
16396 I love the camera. Easy to use, Arrived very fast. Faster than expected. The camera itself is a very pretty red. I love all the items that came with it as well. 
16397 perfect for the camera I have! well worth the price. 
16398 Very happy, Use in Hot Tub, & At night lights up water really well. 
16399 The remote worked well. It came on time. 
16400 Excellent 
16401 pictures are not very sharp 
16402 Cute DSLR for entry level users. Small and light enough to carry with you for traveling and sight-seeing purpose. 
16403 Very nice camera especially for the money I paid. Took about 5 minutes to set up. Easy to use with the app on my phone. Color, tilt, pan all work very well. Can check house when away, see if kids are home etc 
16404 but wow i got it like 2 years ago and iam still using it untill now !! 
16405 works nicely 
16406 They are great. 
16407 The cable I received was not RG59. The video wire was as thin as the power wire. There were no writing on the cable as illustrated. It would not have handed the elements. I Returned it and amazon gave me a refund. 
16408 Hard to use underwater but sit gave a better idea of what was really in your lens view verse guessing! Can t give info on battery life over yet but maybe down the road. Glad I have it as I do not like using my cellphone as a screen. 
16409 Great bang for buck 
16410 i got a deal on it to give my honest opinion. very cute one!! fo my daughter s BD gift! her dream camera! 
16411 Was absolutely wonderful for our trip to Europe. I wish the back pack itself was waterproof and didn t need a cover. That would have a earned the back pack five stars. 
16412 Very nice. Just what I needed. 
16413 Box was opened and look used. was missing the instruction manual. A 356 page book on how to use this very complicated piece of technology. Not happy.. not sure of the authenticity of the product. Zero stars If that was available. 
16414 Great spares for my Geek Pro. Hold a charge just fine. Perfect to have for vacations and long trips. Love it 
16415 This camera is awesome! The close-up picture are crisp and clear. An excellent purchase in my book! 
16416 functions well 
16417 Excellent value for the price. Easy to set up and use with iPad. The most helpful reviews were correct. 
16418 good product 
16419 great speedlight! 
16420 The album is exactly what I was looking for but the rings don t line up properly. 
16421 Thin and quick charger for Fuji batteries! 
16422 This kit has been just what I needed to make my Nikon work better than imagined. 
16423 Initially very impressed with how sturdy bracket is. After two months of use, the bracket remains unchanged and is still very sturdy. However, the mounting screw snapped off. I wished it was made with a more robust material. 
16424 I was extremely please with these lens bags. Thick neoprene fabric yet flexible enough to give when I put them in my camera backpack. Best inexpensive investment for my lens. The assorted sizes are perfect!!! 
16425 Great camera! Pictures turn out great! 
16426 The small tripod will not hold my Nikon D7100 upright. The other tripods are fine. Just the small one is bad. 
16427 works perfectly 
16428 The thing broke on the first day. Piece of trash. You get what you pay for. 
16429 Nice addition to a blackrapid camera strap to hold memory cards, batteries, etc. 
16430 Excellent 
16431 it works great , nice and clear transfer 
16432 I was actually surprised how easy the Nikon D3200 was to use. I was always worried that I wouldn t be able to take good pictures without a lot of studying the manual and a lot of time playing with the camera. 
16433 love it just what I need 
16434 Thank You for the fast service. The bag fits the camera and the price was great! 
16435 Great ball head! A wonderful addition to my gear. 
16436 The worst DVR and camera system I ever used, and I have installed hundreds. 
16437 Real nice 
16438 Great camara. 
16439 Everything you need all in one happy little box!! 
16440 Works great. I can use my old manual focus Nikon lenses on my Sony A7 now. I did add some shims to get infinity focus exactly right, but then I m picky about that sort of thing. Most photographers wouldn t even notice that. 
16441 So irritated! I bought this flash and had it shipped quickly to use for a wedding for my second shooter and it did not work. The battery would not charge and decided to swell up. Not worth $100. 
16442 very good charger ! 
16443 works good 
16444 Great kit you will get almost everything you will need. Great price 
16445 This set of camera is valuable, I love it :) 
16446 Just cheap. Brand new item but buttons almost broken. Not worth the price. I should ve gotten a Kidde or First Alert at a similar price. My mistake. 
16447 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
16448 They are great!! 
16449 never could get it to work properly. could be due to weak wifi signal 
16450 Bought as an additional battery. Thumbs up. 
16451 Very compact and nice 
16452 Didn t work 
16453 Perfect 
16454 This type of shoe mount is OK. I like the Frio better. 
16455 love this lense , its alittle heavy but does a great job 
16456 One of first Smatree accessories I purchased and have been impressed since day one. Everything is super solid, no play or slack. Feels great, easy to extend and retract. 
16457 This IS NOT the Hoya HMC haze UV(0) filter even though the title says so and so does the picture. The description clearly says it s the newer and not as good UV(C) version. Beware since Amazon seems unwilling to change the title or the image. 
16458 Handy to have for those &#34;necessary&#34; pictures a vacation needs. 
16459 Great inexpensive product. I used them to bypass my alarm window sensors and they worked perfectly. 
16460 So far so good! My son is a fan. This camera was easy to use right out of the box! Great price great video and great pictures! 
16461 Great product and so much fun for our grandson riding on his bike taking videos... he loves it! 
16462 Excellent screen protector, fits perfectly, easy to install, seems almost impossible to scratch. 
16463 I have to say.... for the money ... you can t beat this. I can take pictures sharp as a tack with great effect. Don t be afraid of a manual lens. Lots of fun! 
16464 Quick shipping and works as expected. One down side, gets dirty quickly and may leave smears. 
16465 The item does not fit the flash head of Metz 52 AF-1 Digital flash as it is supposed to. It is certainly not a snug fit. Maybe I should have gone for a Stofen unit (which incidentally was unavailable on Amazon). 
16466 Held about 1.5-2 hr on non stop recording at 4K 
16467 Everything I expected Thank you 👍 
16468 great product 
16469 Arrived quickly. The fish eye has some vignetting, but the close up and wide are great. 
16470 This battery has given me no problems at all! It is my backup for my nikon d5300! 
16471 Could be better...... Some of the pictures are blurry..... but overall great camera for regular pcitures 
16472 Really solid, easy to adjust, stands on its own - greatly reduces tripod need, speeds up a shoot for sure 
16473 Incredible service and great product. This is well built and the service was excellent. I will be purchasing more items in the future from Digital Goja for sure. Using the product on my Nikon right now and love it. 
16474 This is great for taking pictures of my food products. Easy to set up, take down, and takes up very little space in storage. 
16475 It came on time & my daughter loves it :) 
16476 Just what I needed. Great quality, fits perfectly on screen. 
16477 Everyone that see it wants to know where I bought it. I love it 
16478 The charger is inexpensive, well built, easy to use and is very convenient for charging the Olympus battery. Highly recommended. Also, Kastar customer service is excellent. 
16479 I lost my lens cap. This one works. There isn t much to say. 
16480 Haven t had a chance to use but better than paying for batteries. Uninterrupted power supply. 
16481 Nice product! 
16482 Awesome camera just what I expected. Everything in the kit is high quality well except for the tripod. Great extra batterie also. 
16483 Great video quality! More bang for your buck!! 
16484 Great drone for the price. I got it in a week. 
16485 Disappointed that the battery does not fit the charger very well unless you manuever it in such a way that contact is made. It should a snug fit. 
16486 I couldn´t use the selfie stick. It is not compatible with gopro cameras. 
16487 Product exactly as advertised and works as it should. 
16488 Extremely effective, these clean much faster than others that I ve used. Love the little reusable pouches and the screen buddy is a nice touch. 
16489 My Sony wouldn t screw on tight, it was loose. Other than that it was a great mini tripod to use to capture pictures of the whole family on a timer. I also tried to screw on an attachment to hold a cell phone but that fit loose as well. 
16490 NICE PRODUCT 
16491 Story evolves learning more about the character of each in every episode. 
16492 As advertised 
16493 Easy to setup, easy to use, highly recommend this product 
16494 For a pocket size camera, I am simply amazed. I can t get enough of it on my days off. Definitely wish I had gotten it earlier. 
16495 Used it this weekend in Paris. Amazing photo and video quality. I highly recommend this camera for traveling with friends. 
16496 I LIKE THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY 
16497 love my new receiver 
16498 Great camera, worth the money 
16499 as advertised 
16500 is a must if you have a celestron telescope, well worth it 
16501 Vincent did a great job taking care of our problem! 
16502 Product arrived without extendable pole which was one of the main items. Plastic is also very weak. Was very disappointed as I had no time to return product before using it on vacation 
16503 They are just what we needed 
16504 Its easy to use and it lasts a long time. 
16505 Henry was very helpful in assisting me in setting up the R2 camera on my PC and my iPhone. The R2 camera is very clear when viewing and it is physically smaller than what I had expected. The small size will be easier to conceal for surveillance. 
16506 nice lens - funny bokeh, sharp center ... definietly not sharp sides ;) ideal for having fun :) 
16507 Already shot 2 weddings and am very happy. Huge improvement over the SB-800. 
16508 Item arrived open inside shipping box and power supply did not work. I returned product. 
16509 Don t have proper lens to utilize it think first before buying one 
16510 The savings of buying in bulk really helps the pocketbook. 
16511 I m glad I bought this tripod/ mono pod. It is so handy, very light and easy to use. I always bring it with me whenever I bring my camera. 
16512 Great! 
16513 Good buy 
16514 I have not had the occasion to use it. But it appeared to be a good investment. 
16515 Very pleased 
16516 Amazing value! 
16517 A great alternative to Home Secretary 
16518 Great purchase! 
16519 Product delivered...but only lasts 20 min. really cheap product 
16520 Everything came as expected, but, head strap is missing bolt to screw GoPro into, therefore, I was unable to use it snorkeling over the weekend... Chest cam worked great, and selfie stick was nice. Other than the flaw in the head strap, I like what I got. 
16521 It fits great on camera. Rubber grip is similar to the camera, very good materials 
16522 Didn t fit my Olympus camerea 
16523 Very Good 
16524 I really like the product, but when it detects motion it says so where the clocks suppose to be, so if the person the camera detects sees the motion detected (clock) they ll know their being recorded 
16525 Camera takes good pictures but has a slow response. This is the only downside to this camera. 
16526 I LOVE IT! 
16527 Works great on my Nikon D7200 just as the review stated. All functions work and both batteries are displayed on the menu 
16528 Just took it on a European vacation. The straps up front don t close easily it besides this it s solid, inconspicuous camera bag and it looks great 
16529 [[ASIN:B00004WCGF Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG]] A little bit smaller than I had hoped but I managed to get everything snugged in. All in all a quality case and definitely up to the task of protecting my camera. 
16530 I really like this spotting scope for its compact size and clarity. I m having a custom soft case made for it. Pentax would enhance its sales if they were to produce and distribute it with a soft case. 
16531 This unit was purchased to replace a Canon ZR80 that burnt out. Suprisingly the ZR80 had slightly better picture quality than this one. Where this camera excels is it s easy to use features and menus. 
16532 Just as described. Works great. With screen was touch screen. Other than that, it works as good as my old one. 
16533 I can t really say that this modifier made a pointedly noticeable change but every little bit helps and My flash DOES seem a tad more controlled when on camera. 
16534 the battery does not work, it goes out in a minute of use. where I can buy a new battery. 
16535 Had all the bells and whistles plus more. 
16536 Fits as the original. Buy several as they come off easily. 
16537 Double zipper tabs would be nice, but overall it s hard to beat the price/value. Beefy strap and good weather resistance too. 
16538 Camera is working great Customer service agent Walter - was very helpful to get it set-up 
16539 Good 
16540 Fantastic product at a very reasonable price, i simply love it 
16541 Great camera at a good price. The variable zoom is perfect for pointing down my drive way. The camera arrived quickly with everything intact and working. 
16542 Works Good. 
16543 good charger 
16544 Love it 
16545 Thanks! 
16546 This thing works and is ideal. 
16547 leaked and cost me my go-pro, yes should have done a dry run, seamed durable and I was just snorkeling so figured this was my test before an actual dive. like the more durable clasp compared to the original housing. complete crap DO NOT BUY! 
16548 Battery fits well and works fine 
16549 This was the best a Big Bang for my buck!! I use everything here!! Can t wait to order more!! 
16550 I don t use mine very often and am disappointed that one of the straps had torn off already. Disappointing 
16551 We bought these at a reasonable price. They don t last as long as the name brand but are a great bargain anyway. 
16552 Good quality lens cloths. 
16553 Camera is excellent, software is terrible and very cumbersome. 
16554 Good Deal! 
16555 Bought this for my 15 year old son. It has a ton of gadgets in it. He loves it! 
16556 This was a Christmas present. 
16557 I used this camera on a trip out West to Yellowstone NP and most of the pictures taken were excellent. 
16558 This mount holds very tightly and I am glad that I bought it. I have this mount as well as the GoPro one and the BRLS is a lot sturdier than the GoPro suction mount. 
16559 its cumbersome to take the camera out. I replaced this item with an other product. 
16560 Good zoom 
16561 This is the best.... I just the pictures!!! I don t leave home with out it. 
16562 Granddaughter is thrilled, camera works great! 
16563 Works perfectly as a replacement for the OEM battery at 1/3 the cost. 
16564 Works beautifully and I got it for a good price! 
16565 Works well. Cannot find charger. 
16566 They are good batteries, work great. 
16567 Ordered this for our office to take passport pictures for students. This is easy to use. And will be an asset to the office. 
16568 Item as described and works well. Arrived on time. 
16569 Didn t fit my speed rings. 
16570 bought too many! wanna buy one from me? 
16571 Essential for your grab bag 
16572 Fits my 70D perfectly and worked awesome. The color is not far off from my 70d so it really looks like the more expensive models 
16573 Great backpack. Only gave it three starts because its not as handy as a messenger bag style when it comes to switching lenses on the move. 
16574 Excellent!! 
16575 Arrived just as expected! Looking forward to integrating these into our September wedding as an interactive medium for guests. Thank you for the prompt shipping! 
16576 Batteries fit perfectly into charger and camera. They don t hold a charge for as long as the original batteries, but they are great as back ups. 
16577 Very good. 
16578 Such an amazing combo for a great price. Not one regret about this purchase! 
16579 great 
16580 Works GREAT! 
16581 thank you.. 
16582 perfect 
16583 Fast shipping, pleased with purchase. 
16584 Easy installment.. could use a touch of threadlocker. 
16585 Meets my needs and very sterdy 
16586 This battery is just as good as the original Canon types. Three years an still no issues. If you need this battery, stop now and just buy it all ready. 
16587 Very disappointing interior material s quality. 
16588 Doesn t come close to doing what it s supposed to plus there s no directions. Very shotty 
16589 Works great for the price, effortless setup. The mobile app is nice and it provides just what you need. My only regret is that I did not get the 8 channel DVR. 
16590 Go pro?! WHY?!!!! This does the same thing, and is AWESOME! I use it on my drone, and it can take a BEATING so far! The waterproof case makes this a GREAT purchase! GET IT! 
16591 Hood doesn t screw on well. 
16592 Had to return the first unit due to not functioning second unit received a working perfectly fine 
16593 Works great--is exactly what i wanted. 
16594 Nice bag 
16595 Calvin did a great job hooking up my camera to the cloud Foscam lets me keep an eye on my property 
16596 Very good quality for the price, don t forget to buy a micro SD card to go with it, though! 
16597 This thing is really impressive, built like a tank. Holds over 200 lbs - i can believe it. I got it to hold a video slider super low and it will do that all day. Over bulty but light and packable. Great niche product 
16598 Just Great! 
16599 Great product, very nice quality and works as it should 
16600 Who does not love extra batteries! 
16601 This battery is marked as 1300mAh, not 1600mAh as described. 
16602 fits everything perfectly 
16603 As advertised 
16604 The kids had a blast playing with this waterproof camera on our recent vacations. It s definitely critical that you buy a &#34;floater&#34; so you don t lose it to the depths of the pool or ocean. 
16605 Is a great price for this camera 
16606 When playing &#34;random&#34; photos and with the motion detection &#34;on&#34; the screen freezes black after some time... But when the unit plays photos sequentially there is no problem with the motion detection. Not very happy and not likely to suggest this product to anyone else. 
16607 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
16608 perfect 
16609 Product was as described, and arrived on time. 
16610 Workscas advertised. My issue though is the thing to tighten the flash could be sturdier. 
16611 And turns everything blue. I live in LA and wouldn t purchase again 
16612 Very good 
16613 Is not a great camera. I have had issues with my pics being blurry. I wish I had sprung for a better camera now Im stuck with this one for awhile. 
16614 Product is excellent and fast shipping!!! Thanks 
16615 Not the most stable tri pod 
16616 This looks and operates like a GoPro3 for a lot less money. nice accessories. Be sure and purchase no more than a 32GB micro memory card. The documentation is a bit weak, but there are a lot of videos online to walk you through the operation of this 1080P camera. 
16617 Very good. 
16618 i am ashamed to say i love this product. you might have trouble getting it to take pictures if you have an older phone, but you can download an app. 
16619 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
16620 Great Seller Super! 
16621 Perfect 
16622 product is as described, well machined, works perfectly. either by hand or a coin. 
16623 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
16624 I found that the optical quality was poor. See attached sample. I bought this for moving water photos so maybe it won t matter in &#34;real world&#34; imaging, but I m disappointed. 
16625 Loved it 
16626 Smaller than expected but I guess good for the price 
16627 Takes awhile to get used to taking photos without a viewfinder or screen. Picture quality is quite good, I was particularly impressed with underwater shots. 
16628 i love this camera i ts one of the best. you can basically do anything that you can do on an Android cell phone including making and receiving calls with your google account, facebook messenger, oovoo, skype. i just wish it had a sim card slot 
16629 It s really light and fits so much gear! Genius design! 
16630 Got it 
16631 Awesome product very pleased 
16632 Extra to my needs at this time. 
16633 love the zoom. Have not been able to get the wifi to work yet, so hopefully it will. overall, takes great photos. 
16634 This thing is very well made and highly recommended 
16635 Great value. Well delivered. Thank you 
16636 Easy to use and mount.. But this is not what i expected... 
16637 great light,can carry it around in your pocket! great product. 
16638 Great little camera. 
16639 They don t fit Sony RX-10, contrary to what you read! I should have paid attention to some of the other reviewers who commented on inaccurate sizing. Both batteries I purchased stick and I had to use needle-nose pliers to remove them! Bummer! 
16640 Very nice protection for the lenses. Very usefull. 
16641 very good product, peace of mind for your much more expensive lens. (drop test: my daughter played around with the filter and accidentally unscrewed it from the lens and it dropped 1 m down to the hard concrete floor, and it did not break, nor scratch. Maybe I was lucky). 
16642 takes nice pictures and i easy to use 
16643 Fits my 430 EX perfectly! 
16644 Youtube channel: http://youtube.com/teainthetreesbp I get constant messages about the quality of my videos. EVERYTHING is filmed on that channel with this camera. I will probably buy the next one when it comes out. Best hd camera I ve owned. 
16645 Nice protection. 
16646 I got this one to replace an older one that was going on five years old and finally quit. It s capable of zoned operation in its sensing area to fine tune the field it monitors, and can be adjusted to only work at night. A nice little unit. 
16647 Great product 
16648 Nice idea but not use friendly. Hard to tel which mode it is in. 
16649 Awesome external flash! 
16650 The problem I had with this is that it was very easy to dislodge. A couple of times I did not notice that it had fallen off. Apart from that worked well. 
16651 Broken clasp as soon as I opened it. It also has a film glued to the back door. Wish I would have bought the real deal. 
16652 I purchased this for my father with many grand kids out of town. Although it seemed like a nice product, the software, especially the remote are terrible. This is NOT a good product for non-tech savvy individuals. I would avoid. 
16653 Although I had no problems connecting it to wifi, just could not get it to record to SD. 
16654 works great 
16655 I have replaced larger (too large) straps on my Olympus E-M1 and E-M5 with the Leash Camera Straps from Peak Design. I like the concept, size and weight and they are easily adjusted to a different length. Just perfect for the mirrorless cameras. 
16656 Pretty simple mount and work perfect 
16657 This is a fantastic lens at an affordable price. I have been having so much fun photographing everything from grandchildren to wildlife to butterflies! Easy to handle without using tripod. 
16658 Delivered as stated, packaging was great and batteries charged and work in my camera. 
16659 Great unit charges two batteries at the same time unlike other chargers. Speedy delivery! 
16660 I was totally amazed of how small and easy to handle, is the FotoTech ML-L3 Wireless Shutter Release Remote, I could not have been any happier. I had other type of remote before and this is absolutely the best, my congratulations to FotoTech. 
16661 Package came exactly as ordered. I needed the batteries and charger more than the cleaning supplies, but it is nice to have a fresh cleaning kit to go with a new camera! I always like to have a spare battery handy. 
16662 No. Very Silly. No where near loud enough. 
16663 Precisely what I needed to replace my older Lumix (also with Leica lens.) It s my fourth Lumix and as each is replaced I give it to one of my granddaughters. That way I get razor sharp pictures of my family. 
16664 This case is pretty nice! I am quite happy with this purchase. 
16665 I got this battery charger today and plugged my Nikon J3 battery into it. Worked great. Fast shipping and a third the price of a replacement from Nikon. I m a happy customer. 
16666 This case works wonderfully with my DSLR. I have a 55-300mm lens that fits well in this case while attached to my camera. I have brought it along while traveling internationally and it did a great job at protecting my camera. 
16667 Works great and a great price for the functions. 
16668 Great fun for my wife 
16669 GoPro equivalent w/ Camera viewing/controlling & file downloads wirelessly on phone (Droid or iPhone) or tablet through App. App allows you to take pictures remotely, view screen is low quality (circa 2001 digital cameras) but the picture/video quality (3000x4000 option available) is very good! 
16670 Excellent stuff. Canon makes good cameras. The bag is actually pretty good as everything from this kit that I will use fits just fine. The mini tripod is pretty much useless for a camera of this size. 
16671 awesome 
16672 just cant find a way to square them up to my eyes properly - really don t understand it because having owned about 10 different sets of binoculars over the last 40+ years, these ones just don t allow unobstructed vision in any adjustment range. its weird. 
16673 This is a great tripod! 
16674 Very helpful & handy! 
16675 Seems to be working fine. 
16676 Must have if you use the Sony RX100III, Affordable. I always have a spare batt in my pocket when I m carrying my Sony. 
16677 Cute product. Some stickers didn t stick well but others did. I would buy again with other designs. 
16678 The case is made of steel and, although gives protection to the PCB, adds a lot of weight to an FPV system. Better video quality than many others- I still use it on my 250quad 
16679 If you just want a case that could keep your GoPro and some basic accessories safe and with a minimal size at the same time, this is it. 
16680 Real bargin 
16681 Not a bad camera, but the color is way off! It works, connects is easy to use but the picture quality is very low and it does not display colors correctly. 
16682 It not the type of charger that will charge your battery? It took long time to get my camcorder charged enough to work right? I would like to find an original one for my camcorder instead. 
16683 This is a fun thing to have, but it is very hard to find anywhere to buy the film. 
16684 Excellent versatility. Out of the few I have seen this seems to be the most durable as well. 
16685 simple but effective 
16686 Only the clock worked. Web camera did not work. Recording camera did not record. It was a very expensive clock, that s all! 
16687 One battery wouldn t. They replaced it quickly. No complaints 
16688 Buy one! Having so much fun with this. Seems to work with all of my lenses, minus some vignetting on certain ones. 
16689 great product 
16690 For the price you cannot go worng, It is perfect for persons who travel as it is extremely lightweight. I was a little cautious at first to put my camera on it but it held up my Canon DSLR very nicely. 
16691 Excellent 
16692 I ve never used a circular polarizer before but this seems to be doing what I need it to do. It fits nicely on my Canon SX60 and has a nice case for storage when it is not in use. I m very happy with this product. 
16693 bulky 
16694 As opposed to other reviewers, I see no jumps or jerks with this. it just plain works. the 5-minute 360-degree is good for getting quick interior rotations. It is now an essential part of my kit. dead easy to use. 
16695 I did not use the stand up tripod but the lens work great. 
16696 I love those things and already used them a lot. No complains! 
16697 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16698 does *not* work for my new d3300 or mh-24 charger -- it just flashes rapidly. nikon website says this means defective battery. 
16699 Just what I needed. 
16700 This item does not work. I have bought it two seperate times and continue to have the same problem. Will Not Turn on, never even got a chance to test the quality. Very Disappointed. 
16701 Item delivered in a timely manner and was just as described on the web site. 
16702 Does the job of replacing one I lost while working on a window. No fiddling necessary. 
16703 Works like a champ. Good quality. Shipped quickly. 
16704 AWESOME! Worked great for fast lens changes while doing street photography! 
16705 Love it !!! And the delivery was awesome!!! 
16706 Good 
16707 The product is not set up easily by the average home owner, and the instructions do not tell you how to connect to your home wireless network, instead directing you to the company s cloud service. Only one smart phone can be connected--a product limitation. 
16708 Lens caps fit perfectly on my T3i and seem like they are an even better fit than the Cannon cover that came with the lens. 
16709 My wife loves it, enough said 
16710 Disappointing 
16711 Night view not as expected 
16712 No better than the 700TVL and 450TVL cameras that I have already 
16713 Does the job, but inserting a battery is tricky, I have to juggle it and make may attempts before the battery will go in. Something is not quite correct with the physical interface between the charger and the battery. 
16714 The lenses are loose and the glass actually rattles around. I am going to return them and order something better. 
16715 Worked like new right out of the box as it should. Still using it a year later and i m still very happy with my purchase. 
16716 Everything fits good, works good. No complaints here. 
16717 Didn t work for my Canon SX280 which has a known battery flaw, nice package otherwise though from other reviews the fast charger may cause problems. 
16718 I love this Camera..... 
16719 Nice backdrop. 
16720 Great product, 
16721 After installing this product, your nice bright camera screen becomes a blurry &#34;frosted glass&#34; hardly usable mess. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I put it on a brand new Nikon Coolpix AW130 and removed it promptly. Its like looking thru steamed up glasses. I returned it to Amazon for refund. 
16722 Don t use the wrist mount I lost my hero 4 at the lake in the water the top of the part of the mount that spins broke off warning not use it 
16723 so thankful I found these 
16724 This drone is a bit difficult to control and camera quality isn t great so I mounted a gopro and got amazing footage. This thing goes out of control in soft winds!!! 
16725 This remote works wonderfully with my DSLR. It s very handy to have for photos taken with a tripod- much more convenient than self timer. 
16726 I don t know if the Energizer name is the same as the battery manufacturer but the price and multi-type card use capability caught my interest for the task ahead of me. 
16727 The audio/sound is bad. The capability to hear whats going on thru the app is very static. The microphone capabilty to talk thru the app to the device doesnt work at all. 
16728 Fits my Nikon D600 perfectly. 
16729 Works well. I ve purchased 3 so far. 
16730 Nice to be able to still get this film. Worked fine. 
16731 Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. 
16732 Good buy 
16733 Great trigger. 
16734 Ok 
16735 Good replacement parts. Both charged up very well. 
16736 Even when you are in others place,you also can keep closer to your house,your loved people any time by your phone or PC. 
16737 kenneth was very very helpful. He was very knowledgable about the foscam products and got me up and running in no time. 
16738 It worked great. My battery was charged in no time 
16739 Item arrived on time and works well. I have used it for sports photography and like it much better than the neck strap. 
16740 its ok 
16741 Great product, exactly what I was looking for! Excellent customer service. Highly recommend this case as a travel case for your GoPro... 
16742 Fix perfect to my AZ1. 
16743 This was bought as a backup in case my battery ran down and I had no place to recharge my camera. 
16744 they are very weak 
16745 Does the job....thanks!!! 
16746 Amazing camera and the best customer service I have seen in a very long time! 
16747 IDEAL! 
16748 Light weight, but solid. Exactly what I needed to attach my video light to my c-stand for a halo light. 
16749 love it 
16750 I love the feel of this little camera in my hands! Be careful with charging it though! Easy carry and fits in a small purse. 
16751 It is a garbage, can not be used. 
16752 Bought two of these, but neither works with the Foscam 9805w. The cables seem to fit, but not delivering any electricity. 
16753 Awesome product. Exactly like the original Gopro 
16754 Perfect for our SLR, very sleek and compact to do day trips with. Rain fly is clutch. There is no room for any other gear you want to carry, except for very small essential accessories like a battery, a lens cap, or things equally flat and small. 
16755 AWESOME!!!! 
16756 EXCELLENT, No complaints 
16757 Easy to use and everything you need 
16758 Perfect size. High quality photos. Love it! 
16759 I would have given it 5 stars -- delivered fast, packaged well -- but time will tell how they last. But so far, so good! 
16760 Just as I expected. 
16761 Excelente 
16762 Not worth buying! Came very wrinkled and you can not iron it. 
16763 Nice slim, filter. 
16764 Alsome works with vision 2 
16765 Super fast shipping! Great product! 
16766 INCREDIBLE. HUGE. GREAT VALUE-- high quality--- these have taken my portraits to another level. 
16767 Built-in Z-Wave Plus! Can t get better than that. 
16768 Great for the price. Real sturdy. 
16769 Sturdy Construction. Good resultas as of today. 
16770 Great product 
16771 I love using this! It is the best product! 
16772 Do not buy if you re going to be cliff-jumping or any sports or similar nature 
16773 Works like a Nikon lc-52 snap front lens cap should😏 
16774 Works great!!! 
16775 Arrived quickly- works great with my Nikon D3200 and I love that it also comes with the car adapter to charge on the go! 
16776 A++++ super deal! super fast delivery WOW 2 days from the order to being at my door! 
16777 Solid fast good product. 
16778 Accurate, fast, quality construction. 
16779 very good. thanks. 
16780 Fantastic camera, better than I hoped for!! 
16781 Didn t need all of them, but down the road am sure I will use them 
16782 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
16783 Good and economical at less than $15 
16784 These are great! Totally real looking, I trembled when I got them the package. I left my own house, before I called the police. They are big chunky and totally sell the gag. 
16785 Before buying good filters I wanted to try this package to see how I would like using filters. This package gave me some good options to learn and work with filters. If anything the adopter ring alone were worth the price. 
16786 great 
16787 Great lens and excellent price! Timely delivery. Included one year international warranty. I registered the lens online. The lens delivers sharp pictures, typical Nikon quality. 
16788 Great 
16789 great cd on how to use the camera 
16790 SOOOO much fun and easy to use. Have not tried to add my camera yet. 
16791 I love the ability to change the color with the gels. For video work, I use the blue for daylight color temperature. 
16792 so far so good, and it it arrived in a most timely manner. many thanks. 
16793 having trouble with the auto focus...servos will not operate. anxious about warranty 
16794 This is a great lens for the price. No need to go into great detail because if your a beginner like me it just goes over your head. However you can trust at this price point the lens will not disappoint! Get it. Great Value good quality. 
16795 It took the same quality pictures as before. 
16796 Patrick at Foscam support did a wonderful job of helping me to install and understand the IP camera. I thank him very much!!This is one of the best outdoor IP cameras made. Can t wait to get it mounted!! Thanks!! 
16797 Always got to have a spare! 
16798 horrible product. Felt very cheaply made and has little to no projection of light. It barely iluminates the corner of a 5x5 room. 
16799 Looks like a real camera and the red link blinks brightly at night 
16800 Works well on my non Nikon Flash 
16801 I am very disappointed with camera and am returning it I am not able to access it all day but. Half of the time when I try, it gives me &#34;Connect Timeout&#34;. It s a disappointment. 
16802 Unbelievably great price and exactly what I was hoping for. I will be grabbing a second one for travel, so I can do two at once. With the X100T a notoriously awful battery performance, at least it s cheap to buy extra power. 
16803 I haven t had much chance to use this item, but I m glad I purchased it at a wonderful price. I love the red color and it will be used quite a bit during my next trip. 
16804 Exactly what i wanted, exactly what i thought it was and what i needed it to do. Great product and great transaction. 
16805 GOOD PRICE 
16806 Works great, fast shipping, reasonable price. 
16807 I lost exactly the same camera and bought this as a replacement. I love it. 
16808 Waist of money 
16809 Battery s last just as long as official gopro batteries, and so convenient to charge 2 at a time... I have 6 batteries total since the life is so short on the gopro 
16810 works great and lasts longer than the gopro battery that came with the camera. 
16811 works great never have to charge batteries just plug the camera right into the wall 
16812 Works good for the price but the instructions are not not well documented and be sure to get a SD memory card for it. 
16813 2 the 4 no good they was used moters 
16814 Satisfied with the product. Should have gotten sooner. Just got it. Hope it lasts. 
16815 These batteries worked perfect for my Canon Vixia M500. The charger work good and charges fairly quick. Would buy again. 
16816 Easy to set up right out of the box. Couldn t be happier with it! 
16817 This small battery is perfect! The old one (that we had to use) was rather large and bulky - but it came with the camcorder (gift). Thank you!!! 
16818 I think some of the people need stronger fingers or use a tool to tighten the clamp. It works well. I have no problems. 
16819 Great product. 
16820 Used right after I received the package. Very happy about the purchase. Would recommend to friends. 
16821 worked as should thanks 
16822 LOVE the Samsung NX3000 and all the lenses I ve purchased for it. A great go-to camera, small in size, that delivers top-quality photos. 
16823 Not what is advertised. AT ALL. Trust me, if you re looking for a Sj4000L, this is not it. 
16824 fits into a laptop sized bag nicely, very sturdy when fully extended. Overall very happy with the stand. 
16825 Sonys mounts are crap.... And half of them are discontinued.... Buy a go pro 
16826 Great product, works great and does exactly what it is suppose to do. 
16827 Great 
16828 Fit perfectly 
16829 I need it. It was delivered quickly. So I m happy. 
16830 The mounts provided with the camera are somewhat useful in most cases, but difficult to adapt for non-typical applications. Camera works well, and very good quality video. 
16831 it is broken and does not work and no one has returned my calls to replace it. and my name is not richard, I am BJ at bjdaneshfar@gmail.com BJD 
16832 Fast service and great price. 
16833 Great rain/dust cover but unfortunately it is too large for my Nikon D3100. Thank you for the fast shipping!! 
16834 Does a good job of lighting up the front door for the security cameras. Cheap but works...I m happy. 
16835 Excellent value and amazing performance. My money was well spent! It is still flying well with no damage after 40+ flights of 7 minutes each.. 
16836 Ordered 5 p.m. and received 11 a.m. the next day. AMAZING!! The batteries came fully charged and carefully packaged. They fit into the camera perfectly (Casio x-s10). I can t tell you about the charger yet, but the entire purchase was 100% worth it. 
16837 I am very happy with this lens. It makes a great addition to my camera kit. Takes nice close-ups of flowers and plants which was my main reason in purchasing it. The filters that were sold with it are also good to have, as well as the cleaning kit. 
16838 Everything is blurred when the Magnifier is attached. Looks great when looking through it alone, but once attached, it s useless, unless you want blurred pictures. However, customer service was excellent o deal with. 
16839 Works great! 
16840 fits 
16841 It worked well for it s price. Not the best but not the worst. 
16842 Have been taking practice shots and the camera is very easy to use. 
16843 thankyou 
16844 Great film. 
16845 The metal strap was scratched (looked like a used product was sent) and crooked covering a half of the camera window, and as you can see on the picture it shows that is comes with a 16GB card what actually is a lie, there was no card at all 
16846 I have not had to use this protection plan but it is always good to have in case you need it. 
16847 This was the first flash kit ive ever bought and they work amazing! 
16848 The camera produced no signal, or was incompatable with my DVR of same mfr. Return process of defective product was very simple. I will probably order another 
16849 Have no tried it in the field yet bit seems sturdy. Using it with a Sony A5000. 
16850 I debated a case for the Phantom Pro 3 for about a month and am lucky I didn t damage it; this backpack works well - and keeps the unit secure. A must have to protect your gear. 
16851 Just received 2 of these. This item is falsely advertised it does not have 30 constant LED lights ,It has 1 very bright blinking red light. 
16852 It does what it s supposed to. Works fine. The tilt seems a little chintzy with the clicking you hear as it passes what I assume are &#34;notches&#34; somewhere, but it s working and tilting just fine. 
16853 Works great with my Canon hf g20, I only wish I had another camera so that I can purchase another on!!! 
16854 Battery charger works well and was a good price, too. Arrived in good shape on date when promised. 
16855 Had no problems with this. Worked like OE battery. I would buy another one. 
16856 Camera gets haze after a few months and amazon won t replace it. Not happy 
16857 Great product. Worked as expected. Easy enough for a 10 year old to use. So far only used on a video camera and worked without any problem. 
16858 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
16859 I ve said it over and over.. you can t go wrong with B&W. I am tough on my gear and B&W is always there when o th her brands fail. Quality glass and top construction. 
16860 Was not up to the dimensions advertised and not adequate for my needs. 
16861 Works great .easily recharges 
16862 Works up to about 60 feet for me. The only negative was that it took about 3 weeks to arrive from Australia. I would order another one. The good part is that it works on a 9v battery. 
16863 Eh. Kinda useless. Props still broke in a pretty mild crash. 
16864 For the price it works great!!! 
16865 works good put around our garden to scare deer out 
16866 Butter-smooth shots with my GoPro HERO3. Easy to use, but reco buying the Neewer Feiyu 2PCS Ultra Reach Carbon Fiber poles also for some nice different POV shots. 
16867 great seller - delivered as promised! 
16868 Very poor!!!! There s no reason to buy this product/item.... 
16869 ok. 
16870 I purchased this to use my 77mm Hoya ND filter on my 67mm Canon Macro Lens. The construction is solid. I m very picky in regards to what I put on my lenses, and I have no concerns using this adapter. 
16871 Wasabi Power is the best aftermarket brand battery maker I have ever owned. They just work. 
16872 Problems with quality. Audio is crap.. 
16873 It s okay but doesn t add too much difference to your regular lens. 
16874 Great value. Cheaper then the stories 
16875 Excellent product!!!!! 
16876 Great Product 
16877 Product arrived quickly as promised and works as advertised. I was able to tuck the clothes into various bags etc so as to have available to use on glasses, iPads etc. 
16878 Bought as a gift. For the price, it s an excellent set of binoculars. Little hard to adjust for comfortable viewing, but it s not hard to use. 
16879 Good economy spotting scope. 
16880 B+W and you don t worry about IQ degradation. 
16881 Exception Quality Glass. Doesn t introduce vignetting and is excellent for protecting your lens in harsh conditions. 
16882 a good camera. this was a good purchase. 
16883 This thing charges well and I have 2 extra batteries. Can t ask for more because shooting in the fly and having a dead battery this will Dave you time. Hasn t failed me now. 
16884 sets up really quick and easy. I like the size and resolution. 
16885 Very good 
16886 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16887 it works so no issue with it 
16888 Pros: - Protects lens - Inexpensive Cons: - Feels a bit bigger than original Nikon cap; fits very tightly when in place - Doesn t clamp on as quickly as original cap; falls off a couple times before staying on 
16889 Works as advertised. Can always use additional protection. 
16890 it s okay for the price you pay. getting started the filter does the job, once you know how to use these tools you ll get a better one anyway - the one that covers the spectrum you desire for the scene you re after. 
16891 A great inexpensive alternative for the causal or semi-professional photographer. The battery continues to run well with moderate use. 
16892 a good back up camera if your SLR or smartphone dies on you while you re in the middle of recording. 
16893 These reflectors are exactly what I was looking for... I love that they are compact for travel and store easily. 
16894 My experience with this product has been excellent. It was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected based on the description on the Amazon website. 
16895 Just what I needed before taking a trip. The camera is about 6 years old. I ve been using the original battery since then. 
16896 Great item 
16897 This is great. Cheap price and good quality. 
16898 very easy to mount and setup. has good depth and wide angle. very clear picture both day and night. 
16899 great reflector - great price - no problems with it yet! 
16900 This is an excellent product. Shott Glass screen protectors cost a fortune. This is a well made, and good looking, alternative that is very cost effective. I ended up buying a second for another camera. 
16901 Great Product 
16902 Has a lot of features for the price, easy to operate, I think it is a lot better than my K-7 that cost more. 
16903 This is one &#34;great buy&#34;. for the money. Its an easy install with great built in features and the picture quality is excellent. I would highly recommend this product for all tech enthusiasts as well as parents with newborns for monitoring. 
16904 doesnt last long 
16905 Excellent 
16906 If you don t have this lens yet, what are you waiting for. Its a compact lens that has amazing clarity, and with a f/1.8 you cant beat that with a stick. It has the same quality feel an look you would expect from a Canon product. 
16907 product good 
16908 The camera is easy to use and carry in your pocket. I had it my pool and it worked fine. I m happy I made the choice and got it. 
16909 Very comfortable and floatable. Great product and great price. 
16910 Item worked exactly as intended, It enabled me to take photos and video of my snorkeling adventure in the Virgin Islands without worrying that I d lose my camera! 
16911 Perfect for my purpose 
16912 they work great 
16913 Recommend! Quickly detects someone in its view and alerts. Bought 3 of them! Great for anywhere around your home, set tones differently and quickly isolate the area you need to check. 
16914 Does exactly what it s meant to at a great price. Solid build and mounts firmly. Using with a 57mm 1.4 an no issues with aperture when on the mount. 
16915 Perfect 
16916 great value 
16917 Worked Perfectly for my Sony DSCHX90V/B Digital Camera 
16918 I had some issues trying to set up my foscam, and thanks to Danny all the installation went smooth. Great customer service thank you. The camera is looking sharp and I love the HD resolution. 
16919 quick service, product as advertised 
16920 Very good stuff 
16921 Remove the internal spacer and the fz70 snuggly fits in the case. Seems to be well padded and decent quality. 
16922 These are ok. I thought they would add it little more to photos, but I think they are really more just for photo gimic. 
16923 So easy to use! 
16924 The telescope itself works well after about 20 minutes of getting used to its adjustments the tripod however is flimsy trash. I believe 3 Lincoln logs would be sturdier. So before you buy just make sure you add a tripod to your order 
16925 Worked as expected. 
16926 This protective is very good. 
16927 Nice 
16928 Brought it as a gift and they love it 
16929 I bought this to wear a go pro while skiing with our group. Its a great way to wear under my jacket and have a hands free platform to capture our fun. Its well made and has plenty of adjustments to accommodate many situations. 
16930 This is great upgrade for any basic telescope. 
16931 It was simple to set up, the picture is excellent, and we ve especially appreciated having it during a crazy wildfire season. It gives us peace to be able to see our serene living room from a distance. 
16932 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
16933 Its solidly build all metal mount. I bought it to mount it on orion 15x70 and managed to do it and took really good pics of moon at night using this. 
16934 very happy with this easy to use- love the zoom - used a friends camera when we went on a cruise to Alaska took great pics- so I decided to purchase one for my next cruise- the package deal was a great find too! 
16935 Great solid tripod, better than expected for the price! 
16936 You can feel the difference by the packaging, but it won t stop there. The engineering and glass are really superior. It s worth it to have something of this quality on lenses you love and work so hard with. 
16937 The battery cuts out all the time. It says the battery is low then says it is full. 
16938 This camera works great. 
16939 BW the way to go 
16940 Very good 
16941 I love my new tripod, I didn t realize it would hold a camera and my phone! So affordable and it weighs close to nothing. Can t wait to take this bad boy on vacation. 
16942 I like it, its great for the price. It can be a little unstable when you a light and a sandbag on it raised high, its just smaller diameter metal poles. works great for a beginners boom stand though, would recommend 
16943 Hard to download 
16944 I have set them up to email me and also to ftp on my nas and it all works as it should be. 
16945 Works well but have had some issues using with Canon Rebel. It caused some issues with screen. Had to call Canon. Bottom line, must shut down camera totally before taking battery out. 
16946 The camera was as easy as the thermostat and smoke detector to set up. We had no issues. I would like ability to pan and tilt the camera remotely. 
16947 Works as intended! Great price too. 
16948 everything i expected it to be, took awhile to learn all of the settings but it is very beginner friendly. ISO above 400 or 800 gets grainy fast. 
16949 Works pretty well. However Feiyu support doesn t answer all questions. For example, why you can t trim the forward position even though you can trim the other axis. 
16950 Great Camera. I use of it for work and research. It s user friendly and very light. 
16951 Bought a second set of these cables and I sm very happy with the service and fast delivery. 
16952 I love this light box - takes a little while to put together, but worth it! I can take pictures of all the craft projects I do anytime! 
16953 Camera requires a ridiculous amount of focusing, pictures are blurry, it takes 3 or 5 times to get a non-blurry photo. Recording is blurry too. Just cheap and bad. It s a headache to just take one simple picture with this thing 
16954 Good job. 
16955 Great!!!!!! 
16956 I bought this unit when mine stopped working as a replacement , because the last time it went out, I had no phone and no internet.and I had to wait for 10 days before getting a new one from my provider, this is my backup unit. 
16957 excellent power for operation of camera 
16958 kept dropping off the network 
16959 Works just fine - a great lower cost alternative to the branded unit. 
16960 Protects the camera from Water but the audio does get muffled enough to the point where it s not very useful. Construction isn t great but it does the job 
16961 Horrible underwater quality, will be returning it. 
16962 Can t go wrong for price; primary work is macro. Bought to replace a similar unit that broke after less than a year. Only odd thing is the backside depression where your forefinger rests has locating nubs. It would be more intuitive to have the nubs on the trigger button. 
16963 Fast delivery! really good fit! all edges lined up. Thank you 
16964 Works as well as the name brand but much more economical! Please with our purchase. (Does fit tightly in the battery compartment so sometimes needs an extra push to get it to pop out). I would purchase again! 
16965 Seems to work as well as my OEM battery at a substantially lower price. Hard to beat that. 
16966 Wouldn t hold a charge longer than 20 minutes in the cold. the picture was acceptable and would have been fine if the battery would stay charged longer. 
16967 nice product for the price. love it. 
16968 bought it as a gift for my daughter, she loves it! 
16969 They get 2 stars because they are indeed waterproof. But picture quality is terrible- bad color, not sharp, and expensive to process (not too many film processors out there these days!). Don t waste the money unless it s for a kid to play around. 
16970 perfect replacement for the hood on my fuji 23mm 1.4, looks like a stock item. 
16971 This works great! 
16972 glad i got three, plastic and cheap they are i have broke 2 already hoping the 3rd one last until I get my aluminum ones i ordered 
16973 perfect 
16974 was worried that my battery would not fit.... I was delighted when it did. 
16975 Super socks and do stay dry. 
16976 I love this camera!!!! I m never without it!!!! The size is perfect and it takes the most fantastic pictures on Auto!!!! I just hold on to it!!! 
16977 This camera worked, but it wasn t very easy to open the compartment to change the batteries. The batteries also seemed to die out fast. I wouldn t recommend this camera. 
16978 This ring fits well with both sets of threads, no issues whatsoever with this stepping ring. 
16979 I love it. .... 😆 
16980 Exceptional quality for the price. Easy (and fast) to assemble to put to good use in the studio. 
16981 Wish I could see more! its probably just me--- over all easy assembly. 
16982 SMALL, COMPACT, AND PORTABLE.... I like it because its nots a big bag and I can just swing it over the shoulders. Has a enough space for small compact camera, charger, cables, batteries, memory cards and several micro fiber cloths. 
16983 Works great for my SJ4000 camera. 
16984 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
16985 Great filter for the price !! 
16986 Amazing 
16987 Horrible. Yea it mounts up nice, but once you get driving along, it creaks and rattles so badly I had to take it down. The mounting threads are weak too and will strip if you tighten too tight. I threw mine out. 
16988 So far they seem to be very reliable. I ve used them on a couple of jobs and they have worked flawlessly. Time will tell if these were a good investment. 
16989 Was missing the leather &#34;guard&#34; that would keep the attachment ring from scratching the camera - I found something else 
16990 High quality. 
16991 Incredible product, seems to be new, but some screens have problems with resolution, but not much to worry about. Some adaptors also don t match 
16992 The batter did arrive promptly and did charge. Assuming it holds it s charge, I ll change to 5 stars. Great price, fast service. 
16993 fantastic product! 
16994 I miss the viewfinder and you can t take pictures while are filming. In all other features, the camera is great. Wifi is nice, you can take selfi with your camera and send to Internet easily. 
16995 It is really easy to install and quick to understand. The video quality is not the best, but you can see everything clearly. I don t know why their are the negative reviews, maybe they are not tech savvy. 
16996 Can we say generic?? 
16997 Great camera. Does everything they said it would do. 
16998 These Marumi filters have gotten good reviews, and I have no complaints. They are well-made and work well. 
16999 Good camera. Nice resolution. However, occasionally loses connection to my D-Link AC1750 wireless router which is very close by. A pain to repower when power cord is not within easy reach outside. 
17000 It does exactly what it was made to do. The auto adapter cable is a nice bonus. 
17001 present for grandaughter, loves it 
17002 product as advertised, very good 
17003 Fantastic camera. Cannot believe all that it can do. Easy to set-up and use Beside all that the pictures a fantastic 
17004 Love it. 
17005 Awesome deal 
17006 Thanks 
17007 Does what its intended to do and fits the instax 7s perfectly, with room to store film 
17008 Pretty but so complicate to find how it works, I just want to return it because I try record so many time and this one do not work. The instructions are vague. I still trying to figure out how it works. Never record anything 
17009 exactly like the original 
17010 I got this item on a discounted price. I found it really helpful for my presentations and projections. I use this to hold my iphone and project it to the screen just like any projector. 
17011 Clever design and very sturdy. Easy to add to your bag without weighing you down. 
17012 OEM replacement for the Panasonic LX7 and Leica D Lux 6. These cameras are identical, and the batteries are as well/ 
17013 Very solid with great optical quality 
17014 This is a great item just as good as rocket fish with the clarity but much cheaper. 
17015 Love this strap. Would buy again if I had more cameras 
17016 so fun! 
17017 Used them for our wedding and worked out Great!! 
17018 Does the job. Effective on my Rokinon Lenses. Would buy again. 
17019 Its good 
17020 Very good quality, easy to set up, and easy to use. All good stuff here. No complaints. Have been using for about a month now and no issues to report. 
17021 Nice Product works as expected ! 
17022 Charges great. Nice replacement. 
17023 I have been using this for a while now on boats, on bikes, and underwater. It has worked wonerfully and the quality is great. 
17024 Nice addition. 
17025 Leaps and bounds better than built in D5200 microphone. It looks great too! Fantastic buy for the price I have some tests on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqrVuiG7FXg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rpSp02sbOU Both of these videos were filmed with the mic!! 
17026 I needed a new battery for my Nikon D100. This battery works great. Good price, fast service. 
17027 saved me a lot of time and headache!!!!!! worked great! 
17028 Good replacement at a good price. 
17029 Very tight fit. You have to be careful when squeezing the camera in without any lens attached. It will cover the base quite well from any scratches. 
17030 it s nice 
17031 Worked as intended, kept water out :) 
17032 They do the job. Great price. 
17033 really can not see the details on the coins like I expected. 
17034 Best mirrorless camera I ever owned. In fact, I would put it up against my much more expensive DSLRs. Outstanding features second to none. Especially like the fast continuous shooting and focus. 
17035 This is a great product if you use in bright sunlight. Love it 
17036 It s a case...It does what it does well. But I love the design, wished there were more options though. The product showed up on time it was packaged professionally. 
17037 I appreciate how light and thin it is - easier to tuck in my AC bag 
17038 The batteries that came with the charger do not fit the charger. It was returned. 
17039 Best price I ve paid yet. So much cheaper then instores 
17040 exactly as expected and arrived super quick! 
17041 Ok for the price 
17042 Its a little smaller than I expected but I love the bag. The many outside pockets make up for the small interior. 
17043 A bit pricey, but I used during vacation in Mexico during the summer with success. Going from AC to outside and including snorkeling with 20 dives. No fog at all. It was worth the price to come back with good quality video. 
17044 Nice looking camera case. Very protective. Its a little awkward to flip open and let front drop ... I have to hold it out of the way. Still Its a nice case with a placed to screw my monipod. 
17045 Love this bag. Great for photographers who don t always have somewhere to sit the bag down to get something out of it. One of the waist bet straps came out of the adjuster, but it was an easy fix. 
17046 I have a Nikon coolpix P600 and these are a great fit with quick shipping. I am so happy with these lenses. I have been out everyday since i received them, trying them out. Cant wait until i actually set these up with a tripod. 
17047 Quick, easy, cheap green screen. You ll have to iron it out before use (just a note). 
17048 Works well even up to 90/100 feet and is very well made. 
17049 So far the camera seems fine, all early shots are great. However the additional items in the package were either rather pointless (ear buds to clean the lens!), or useless, such as the camera case which was too small for the camera, and the strap which did not fit. 
17050 These are a fantastic value, and I have had no issues charging them, putting them in the GoPro, or removing them from the camera. The charger also charges the standard GoPro battery, which is great. I ll definitely be buying more of these. 
17051 Fits what I need wish there were more pockets to store the extras. 
17052 Best Camera bag ever! 
17053 Very usable,perfect match for the camera 
17054 great camera 
17055 So much for easy installation! More than 3 weeks later still can t figure out how to install them and have to hire someone to do it :-( 
17056 Working well. Easy installation. This is the 3rd camera I bought 
17057 Works as expected! 
17058 This worked perfectly for cleaning my mirrorless camera sensor. All of the tools I needed in one kit. 
17059 amazing pictures 
17060 Mine came with a baffle. I put it together in five minutes. Brilliant product for my needs. 
17061 Easy to install and remove. Effectively blocks most glare and locks securely on lens. 
17062 Great!!!! 
17063 Works perfect on Nikon and off camera in S-mode. Bonus that it can be triggered by another flash going off. Build quality good. Only negative is that it over exposes slightly when used on camera in iTTL, though it is easily fixed by compensating. A real bargain at the price. 
17064 I really liked this Camera Case. 
17065 this is not what I thought it was. I didn t send it back because it cost more to ship it back than to purchase it. 
17066 Not delivered as advertised advertising five separate screens received one screen and a case that have different colors on it but not individual screen. this eliminates the ability I m doing a photoshoot with two different screens at one time 
17067 Very good 
17068 Works ok not consistent with exposure 
17069 okey 
17070 This is the best security camera i would have ,very easy to connect and is stil working well.I have no regret of buying it. 
17071 Very good 
17072 Work perfect very satisfied with it 
17073 This is only for the camera and strap. There is no lense, no flash, no bag. I was informed after my order was made that this is not what will really be sent. 
17074 It is exactly what I needed. It installed easily and feel secure. As for eForceCity they stood behind their product. The first shipment never reached me, they resent the item and I received it as promised. 
17075 Great 
17076 Synergy Digital substituted an EXPIRED OFF BRAND battery for the listed Synergy battery listed with no resolution. Beware ...you might not get what you purchased! 
17077 Great camera. Did an install for a salon & it works great. Very good picture quality too. Recommended. 
17078 This is the best floating handle on the market. I use it for my Bahamas trip and it work as intended on the pool and ocean snorkeling. 
17079 good float. 
17080 After struggling with the original finderscope and many replacements of same with no success, I finally bought this one and was able to align immediately. 
17081 Five star 
17082 the battery died after only taking 37 pictures. I was at a batchlorette party and missed all the good picture. Very sad. 
17083 If you need glasses at all, even just specs, this is a great tool 
17084 A little more skinny & spindley than I had hoped... But if you don t put a lot of weight on it or bump it during slow exposure, it should be fine. 
17085 Works great, functional, and at a good price. 
17086 This is a great solution to the lens cap issue. 
17087 Works just as good as the OEM batteries. No camera errors. 
17088 Sheds bad... Even after washing.. But photographs beautifully!! I might try combing it out.. 
17089 great batteries 
17090 Good Product for Such an Economical Price. 
17091 Excellent product quality, arrived on time and well packaged. Would definitely recommend if you want to design your own case layout 
17092 I bought these batteries to replace the ones that came with our dog s bark collar. They work but don t seem to work as long as other alkaline batteries. 
17093 I used it with my Kowa spotting scope at the shooting range. Worked great. Used it to photograph the northern likes with my Canon 70D. Worked great! I used for bird watching. Got great eagle shots. Very steady and versatile. 
17094 I loved it. I think this is awesome for the price. 
17095 Works awesome as advertised 
17096 Bought this for my husband for his Celestron NexStar 6E telescope. The scope, arm and base fit just fine on one side with pouches for accessories on the other side. This is a nice case. Spend the extra money on it. 
17097 Great VND filter! Works wonders on the BMCC, since it doesn t have an IR filtration itself. Highly recommend it. I haven t seen any video degradation in my footage while using this filter. In fact, my favorite footage that I ve ever shot using this filter. 
17098 Much better quality than a $60 tripod I purchased from Best Buy. I am very pleased with the quality of this product. 
17099 I ordered this for my Nikon D40 and the lens caps don t fit on the lens at all and the adapter is way to small to even fit on my camera. this was such a waste of money 
17100 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
17101 This is an awesome product. I can email photos to it. No more cables from the computer to the frame required. 
17102 Great deal! 
17103 Cable gives me super clear audio through my gopro hero 3+ black. It gives both engine audio and radio audio. Postage was also very fast to the UK. Very easy to use. 
17104 great bag, very sturdy/comfortable 
17105 It worked for a couple days. Now wont turn on. Battery is ok. 
17106 Item came without the cord that hooks the camera to a computer. Please send ASAP. Thank you! 
17107 This kit had most everything I needed to get me started with my GoPro fast shipping as always and packed perfectly.Great price!! 
17108 This goes in my husbands nikon and he is very happy with it. 
17109 Awesome! 
17110 Does exactly what it s supposed to. 
17111 Pretty good, but I ended up with a Tamron 18-270 VC which in my opinion offers slightly better image quality and obviously a killer range. 
17112 I d give it 5 stars except for the directions which are unintelligible. Very poor translation. Equipment works great so far. Revised 7/1/16. I m now giving this one star because it failed after less than one year. 
17113 I have been testing the cameras, now can suggest that aly004 with onvif technology is faster than p2p camera, the wifi setup is easier configure with lan cable using the software or the app, for now setup throught browser its not avaible. the camera works perfect 
17114 It s amazing ! My wife loved it. 
17115 Bought these for a Christmas gift, they re okay. Sturdy enough for the price, but even with all four set up, it s hard to get natural tones and eliminate shadows.. 
17116 Everything as advertised. Good quality. Good customer follow up. Highly recommended. 
17117 It does the job. Its a bit too fragile for my liking. Then again, the price is unbeatable. Had i known though, i would have bought a better, sturdier tripod. 
17118 Great kit! 
17119 Excellent filters they work great ! take photos during the worst high sub hours without washout. 
17120 best deal out there, great camera have used underwater with great results 
17121 Cute....no selfie mirror though 
17122 Great product very reliable, do not buy the wireless I have seen them fail in the field twice. 
17123 :) 
17124 Does not record video only audio, horrible item 
17125 Great DVR system. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had the hiddns ddns option. Excelente video quality and great mobile app. My customers are very pleased with this system. 
17126 Good battery for its price. 
17127 This stand works great! Much larger than I thought it was going to be! 
17128 Fits my nikon 17-55 perfectly! Great product from a very reputable brand/company! A must have! 
17129 Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, fills the gap between the 6mm and the 15mm nicely. 
17130 Great product!! Would recommend to any Drone Pilot! 
17131 my nephew loves it 
17132 It s just what I needed. 
17133 Works as Advertised...love it... 
17134 Use on trips very nice. 
17135 Klarus!!! It doesn t get any better! A reliable tactical flashlight that allows single hand use! This should be the go to light for law enforcement! n 
17136 great did and still doing it job 
17137 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. update : night vision not working any more 9/25/2016 
17138 Makes shooting with the E-X1 a whole different experience. IMO, the camera should have been made with a better grip in the first place. 
17139 Came really quick, lens was great. Did a lot of research on this one and it s almost as good as the nikon counter part, the only difference is its a full stop darker sometimes, but can be adjusted through shutter or iso. Happy shooting! 
17140 This product worked great. We took it to Mexico and used it in the ocean, pool and while we were scuba diving. And it did float!! Super quality and worked great! 
17141 Great price and great quality. 
17142 Nice filters. 
17143 Great product! 
17144 Dog chewed up my old charger for my camcorder and this package came with everything I needed to start recording again at a great price. 
17145 Fairly light-weight, and holds the camera tightly. 
17146 My kid s love this looking at the pictures on the camera is not the best but when you upload them they are great and capture all the fun and smiles. I will be getting another for my other kid 
17147 Bought it for back-up when we travel 
17148 Very nice 
17149 Wonderful bag...needs wheels 
17150 It gives my baby power. Beautiful power and can t be angry with that......... 
17151 Works as expected. 
17152 A decent option for the SB-800 
17153 FAST shipping. Haven t been out to take some pictures with them, but I expect good results. 
17154 perfect perfect perfect 
17155 Great product 
17156 Bought it. Haven t had to use it. Can t say how good the response is to failure of the device. 
17157 8-in-1 for that price?! Hell yes. I use the selfie stick most out of everything. The chest one is pretty good. and so is the thing that like sticks on windows and surfaces haha. 
17158 Serviceable and attractive 
17159 It was great not flimsy at all for a low price! 
17160 Great buy! 
17161 The best of the best I use them for continuous lighting for cam shows and they are truly amazing!! 
17162 Great deal and they work perfectly. 
17163 Just wish I could open port 16 on my pc for full functionality. 
17164 god 
17165 Much crisper than the MKIII, a little slower but the sharpness is VERY noticeable. I shoot studio and landscape and a def worthwhile upgrade. I will hold onto my MKIII for now and sell when I used it for a month or so. 
17166 Nice build, light weight, but really to much trouble to use and adjust when I telescoping stick is so much more convenient 
17167 video quality is atrociously blurry, even when the subject is hardly moving. total waste of money 
17168 This is a great concept but an extremely cheap product. It s flimsy and the squeeker is tiny. I ll use a dollar store dog toy for the same effect. Not worth the price. Sending it back. 
17169 Seems to work real good as a dash can in car, you can also plug a power cord in it and run it all day long, also records over old video s. 
17170 The right battery for my Sp-100. Now I have two of them. I bought other batteries but they did not last. great battery. Steve 
17171 Heavy and not as much room as expected buy OK! 
17172 great price for oem battery. the Wasabi power batteries I have are much cheaper but perform at the same reduced rate, they do not hold charge nearly as long as the factory batteries. 
17173 The worst instruction ever. 
17174 It is the product I was looking for. Thanks! 
17175 Package arrived in perfect condition. 
17176 Works good 
17177 So far so good! But being my second one, you get what you pay for as well. Take careful care of the part that inserts into the camera when storing and you should get ample use out of it! 
17178 Missing parts 
17179 Very Good 
17180 It was what I wanted a little smaller than I thought but it is OK. 
17181 Perfect fit, focus to infinity ! 
17182 It works very well for me. I m satisfied in the video quality. Just need a noise reduction for the sound. If you put it in your motorcycle or bicycle and wind blows 30mph. You only hears loud wind and engine. But overall, it s ok. 
17183 Works great and easy to store away. In love with with gold one I recieved. Awesome kit if your looking for a selfie stick as well as a tripod. Very nice packaging also. Would make the perfect gift for any age 
17184 I love it 
17185 This is just what I want. JUST PERFECT FOR MY LENS. 
17186 Great clear pictures. Using with a Night Owl Dvr system. 1000tvl picture much clearer especially at night. Have 4 and would order more. 
17187 Just as expected!!! I love it! 
17188 This charger works fast and efficiently. Much better than having to plug in the whole camera. 
17189 Does not fit the Canon Powershot SX530 HS as stated by the seller. I wish i had read the other reviews before buying. A total waste of money. 
17190 I love the product, as I am using it to inspect small mineral growth. It s perfect for my use as I can take still pictures or video if needed. 
17191 Just a question. Since you can put a UV filter on the camera with the lens adapter, can you leave it on when the camera is turned off? I get tired of taking the camera s lens cap on and off. 
17192 About what you d expect for the price. 
17193 delivered exactly as the image 
17194 awesome piece for lens protection THIS IS A MUST, fits tightly, does a perfect job and it looks good on my camera .. now on a side note i feel this is something that should come with the camera already like every other camera around 
17195 Great bracket. Great people to work with. The remoter trigger release I received with the bracket didn t fit my Nikon D7100. Had to return it. Got full refund plus my return shipping charge. 
17196 Great camera great video excellent point and shoot 
17197 Very sharp lens. I was impressed. 
17198 good 
17199 It is good. And arrive quickly, thanks 
17200 very good pic quality, and at wery low cost and fast delivery 
17201 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
17202 I am very happy with my go pro camera very good value with all the asecssories 
17203 Great value. Love this camera! 
17204 Fantastic on the go tripod I use it all the time when I got out and can t bring my regular tripod 
17205 I love my camera. Very happy with the quick delivery. The seller was great. Thank you. 
17206 Like it a lot 
17207 ok 
17208 I love my camera. I suggest if you aren t familiar with this camera that you read up on its usage. The company did not adhere to the timeline set forth from them with sending the package. 
17209 i wish it came with big enough back drops, they are not big enough at all, everything else is 100% 
17210 Didn t fit the camera I got it for, but still found a way to make it work. 
17211 The color as same as photo👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 
17212 Works without a problem with my Sony minicam. The only reason not five stars is that the charger can hold only one battery at a time. I would have loved to be able to charge both at the same time. 
17213 These lights are great. I bought one for every closet, and one above front door keyhole. Everyone who walks in my front door asks me where I got it. 
17214 good product 
17215 Good quality and works as described. 
17216 Great quality, cleans well and can be washed and used many times over. 
17217 I ve never been able to take such amazing pictures before with any other camera. Best camera I ve ever had! 
17218 Excelent product 
17219 great buy for the money 
17220 Exactly as described, fit my Canon Rebel Xti like a glove. Very happy with the purchase 
17221 These sunglasses are outstanding they re great I haven t had any problems whatsoever I would just like to say thank you for such a great product at such a great price 
17222 Hard to put items in place 
17223 I absolutely love this camera and the bundle was much more than I anticipated. I had one small issue with one of the items in the bundle and Focus Camera replaced it almost immediately. 
17224 It does it s job. I find it is just a cheap feeling replacement. It often doesn t thread as nicely as the original Nikon HB-32 lens hood. The extra included microfiber is a nice addition, but doesn t make me feel any better about the lens hood. 
17225 Works very well, but very poor manual. We use it for an elderly person who is in hospice care. We get a good clear picture night or day from anywhere. If you leave your phone on all night to constantly monitor there is significant white noise from your phone. 
17226 Fit great... 
17227 Surprised! Very nice lens for a bargain price. I purchased it for my daughter s film class along with a used canon élan ii body and tested on a Rebel T4i with great results. 
17228 Works as intended, it s great. 
17229 Good 
17230 Works very well. I use this a lot and have had no issues with it. 
17231 Great technical support! Technician handled my request in an efficient, courteous, and professional manner. Camera works great both local and remote. 
17232 Works good havent had a ptoblem yet 
17233 Foscam seems to have stopped supporting their products. j 
17234 Awesome! 
17235 Works perfectly for my 50mm Nikon Lens. Thanks! 
17236 I bought this over 3 years ago and I love it still. If you still keep an old camera you know how easy it is to lose your charger. It comes in handy on trips or when you just need a little bit of juice. 
17237 Great work, and speedy delivery. 
17238 It was a birthday present for my son who has started a small photography business, and he is very pleased with the performance, while I was very pleased by the price. 
17239 was very happy with product, arrival was persise. 
17240 Awesome, best quad I have used. Having a memorial service for mine today. Taken out by a white SUV :( 
17241 Replaced a lost cable. It works well. 
17242 excellent product 
17243 Absolutely what I wanted!! 
17244 Great!! 
17245 Fits my camera perfect, really like having it protected and the extra space for more sd cards. 
17246 works as it is supposed to. 
17247 I used this camera to record the school musical. It was easy to use, light weight and produced a beautiful picture and sound. I do think it works best with a stand of some sort. My arm was tired holding it. I did get a stand. 
17248 Works great, fits well. 
17249 great! 
17250 Very handy. Each is individually packaged. 
17251 Paired with a couple Nikon flashes, no one would be able to look at the photo and say &#34;You didn t spend $500 on that flash you used.&#34; 
17252 Works great, suction is strong. I have used it mounting my GoPro to my Mustang when racing and it s never fallen off. Even mounted to the side of my car it stays on. 
17253 Low light performance is unacceptable. 
17254 Ok 
17255 will order from them again. was exactly as what was posted 
17256 A OK.... 
17257 Perfect camera 
17258 Camera seems to work fine, but is not a US version. From what I m reading this is a version from a different country and has no warranty here in the US...... 😯 
17259 Would not set up with windows 8.1 I returned it. I spent way too much time trying to set this up. Not a plug n play camera... 
17260 Works. Could be a little clearer 
17261 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
17262 cheaper made than I thought but it was only like 10 or 11 bucks 
17263 Best selfie decision ever 
17264 This is not your same old peel stick sheild it is much better go on line see how they say to put it on take the time it is worth it and the sheild fits great 
17265 This camera is junk. You get what you pay for. Could not for the life of me get it to work correctly. Would not recognize my SD card and could not get it to connect to my computer. 
17266 Cheap and great quality. I lost my old one for my 2007 Canon Powershot. I was glad to find one here on Amazon. 
17267 This bag is a great bag, I knew it was a good choice the second i opened the package. it seems to be of solid construction. 
17268 I have only had this for a few days, but the batteries work (have to be charged when they arrive, no biggie), The charger seems to work. The package arrived on time and in good condition. The price was great. We have the cybershot WX9. 
17269 This is a very good camera case and i would highly recommend it. 
17270 cheap, holds long charge, good quality. 
17271 This is the only battery I use for my camera. It is a long lasting battery, holds it charge very well. I recommend this battery highly. 
17272 As advertised, was shipped and arrived in a timely manner. Would purchase again 
17273 Absolutely no customer support. Software is crap. 
17274 Battery works like a charm! delivery was very quick!!!! 
17275 Great product, however wasn t shipped on time. 
17276 Excellent camera!! 
17277 seems to work fine so far 
17278 Awesome if you have more than one battery. You always have one charged and ready to go 
17279 Outstanding product. Delivered quickly and the instructions are very simple. Now looking for soft case to store this product on my Tokina 16-28mm lens. 
17280 This selfie stick came just as pictured .Works great with my iPhone 5s syncs to Bluetooth feature .Perfect for traveling and being packed away as its compact size allows for easy storage ! Zoom feature is awesome .Takes great group pictures I recommend this product 
17281 Very sharp lens. Produces some really great images on the Nikon D810. 
17282 does all that is advertised so far... 
17283 Perfect for my 8ch DVR 
17284 Purchased for a friend, His D5200 was always draining the factory battery. I purchased this brand for My Canon & was so pleased, I got one for His Nikon. 
17285 Cheaply made. 
17286 I have only had this for four months and used it for three indoor shoots. The AC power cord stopped working in the middle of the third shoot. Very frustrating that I cannot return....this product stinks! $300 down the drain! 
17287 Got these lights very fast. Great price for such versatile lights. Came well packaged and the lights perform very well. The fact that these lights are portable and battery operated too is a plus! Helps out lots for outdoors shoots. Very satisfied customer 
17288 This camera has more than everything you will need. The tripod is a little weak, and the bag a little small... but the lens options and the wireless mic make this an ideal camera for quick filming and interview pieces. 
17289 smells horrible 
17290 Easy to install. I just put it on and it looks good so far. Decent price. Fast shipping. 
17291 Love the product. Made it so much easier having back-up batteries...and ones that last longer than my original one!! I highly recommend this valuable deal! 
17292 fits iPhone onto strap. 
17293 Great backdrop we used at our wedding! Quick shipping too! 
17294 Perfect and great price! Just what I needed. 
17295 Just received this item a few days ago and I am very pleased. It is exactly like the GoPro version, but for less than half the cost. It is very sturdy and easy to use. 
17296 Lens with good quality optics. However, the focus mechanism seems noisy & always try very hard with AF. Noisy barrel synonymous to poor quality control. May need to send back for either exchange or repair. 
17297 Love it 
17298 It did not fit my Canon G16 as stated it would, had to return it. 
17299 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
17300 Good strap! 
17301 Good package for a first timer with drones. 
17302 Its good. 
17303 Good product 
17304 No good bad quality even on HD wasted a lot of money on this pretty disappointed 
17305 my sister loves her camera takes excellent pictures and the picture quality is good 
17306 Performed as expected. Great for lithium batteries. 
17307 Its a great lens but very heavy. Pictures are sharp. 
17308 Only problem is screws are not stainless 
17309 Great value!!! So much fun to shoot with! Lots of useful tools came in the package. 
17310 I love my new Nikon. 
17311 all within expectation... 
17312 The camera does not take clear pictures. I can no longer return it and can t get a hold of the seller. 
17313 great price, lasted 5 months and will not hold a charge now 
17314 Wonderful! 
17315 Pure class. A Leica M6 with this strap slung around the neck and shoulder look as much like a major fashion statement as it is functional. Perfect. 
17316 Every piece of my New Nikon D7100 fits perfect in my new Backpack and it s comfy so far. Thank you 
17317 Works well 
17318 Great lens for the price. 
17319 Works. Bends. Stiff. Durable. 
17320 Nice Umbrella s. Work as expected. 
17321 Its nice and i thought it had a button and stuff but be careful what u buy 
17322 Works good but it s not too comfortable to use it. 
17323 Did NOT fit the Canon PowerShot G7X AT ALL. I wrote to them saying I wasn t going to bother with shipping it back. 
17324 Very solid and well constructed. Would buy again. 
17325 Good product. Would have given it 5 stars if it had a screw on ring to connect a carabineer. 
17326 good stuff 
17327 doesn t fit the lens. 
17328 Easy to get, cheaper by far than others I found 
17329 kenneth helped me greatly with my camera. I love foscam cameras. Customer service will talk you through and walk you through the issues you may have. 
17330 Great product 
17331 my husband loves the camera 
17332 Help protect my canon 70 D from rain. 
17333 I LOVE THIS CAMERA BAG. 
17334 Pretty good design, plenty of padding, but the top strap broke loose on the first use. 
17335 Poor quality, sound was spotty... Sometimes it worked sometimes it did not. Nest is better. 
17336 Just FYI ... With this camera or any camera you plan to use indoors for outdoor survalience, buy an inexpensive 55mm or smaller Polarized lens filter and figure out a way to gently attach it. This removes 90% of &#34;window glare&#34; from the equation. 
17337 Does the job. I carry this in the belt pouch with my filters so it always at hand. No problems with it. Great product at a great price. 
17338 Good 
17339 Durable and lightweight. Great product. 
17340 Great!! 
17341 Amazing. Does everything it claims to. 
17342 i got to alaska with my package and realized...NO charger was included and all the shops we went to did not have chargers...should have just bought in person 
17343 Works perfectly speedy shipping 
17344 Item was better than I thought! Extremely pleased! 
17345 This has been very difficult to hook up and view out side of the home. The software is typical import stuff that seems to have been quickly throw together. 
17346 Fits like OEM eyecup. Good deal! 
17347 Awesome and affordable.Recomend it for starters 
17348 Great quality and strength. I ve used this for multiple shoots through cities over the course of 15 hours. Holds up well, feels decent on back 
17349 10 points. everything was as expected 
17350 Took this white water rafting and stayed on my life vest the whole time. The clip is very tight, sometimes even a little difficult but perfect to secure a camera. 
17351 This is a great product! Affordable and fast shipping. I really only needed the dust blower to clean my camera. The extra accessories were bonus! Would recommend and would buy again from this seller. 
17352 Great remote trigger, the button has a slide lock for shooting bulb. Nothing to complain about. 
17353 Good carry-gopro-bag! 
17354 Product is fantastic. I highly recommend. A good value and works perfectly. Software is flawless. 
17355 excellent product, very satisfied with tripod. 
17356 Good 
17357 very good item delivered as expected. 
17358 A very clever and useful tool for dolly shots 
17359 attaches easily and securely. 
17360 Installation is simple and easy. Like others said, the sticky tape provided is not good and used 3M extreme mounting tape. All sensors are working with factory settings. No issue. 
17361 I got my order on time and it was.perfect 
17362 Takes great pictures 
17363 an inexpensive and super wide lens 
17364 Very happy with this purchase. 
17365 Good build and design. Tripod mount is metal under center of lens. No block on speaker and LCD monitor tilts downward and upwards. Good weight balance with XF23. Feels good in my hands better than Fuji hand grip MHG-XT10 especially with bigger lens like XF56. 
17366 It works perfectly. 
17367 Camera worked Great I love it so much. Shipping was only 10 days. I would definitely recommend this camera 
17368 Wife loves it. 
17369 Worked fine, but would sometimes stick when trying to extend, and was difficult to fix. 
17370 Exactly what i wanted to replace the one i broke. 
17371 Works as expected. Great to have the camera working again. 
17372 work great 
17373 Perfect just exactly the safety we were needing. 
17374 Bought for a 8 year old fishing nut and he loves it! Caught his biggest fish shortly after receiving this camera! 
17375 Lenses caps fit tightly, and the elastic band is strong. I have one of these on each of my lenses, as I do a lot of active shots. This is a great buy. 
17376 perfect 
17377 except for the labeling, battery is exactly the same as the one that came with the camera. Charged it up and away I went. Works great. Nice to have a spare so you don t have to be charging all the time. 
17378 Smaller and not as stretchy as the write-ups imply. 
17379 Everything was a presented. i thought the case was a little bigger but my wife says it s fine and she is the one using it.. 
17380 This grip works great and easy to use. Slides on without any problems. Does add some bulkyness to the camera. Did not break and was not defective. 
17381 Worked well on my dive trip. 
17382 This product was as advertised. Everything was present and the shipping was on time. Having only played around with most of the features of this kit, I would say that I m impressed with its quality and price. 
17383 great lens 
17384 LOVE IT! My lens arrived on time and came in perfect condition. The box was wrapped as if it was brand new. The Lens had no scratches on it. Definitely worth the price. 
17385 My 7-year old Cyber-shot camera died and I was glad I could replace it with one that was similar: pretty much the same features and operation, uses same card and battery, not too expensive. It will be way cool if I can squeeze 7 years out of this one. 
17386 this quadcopter is amazing! the camera is super clear and stable in flight. the controls are a cinch to handle. Its great in wind and will stay very stable using the gps. really, its incredible. Photos are super clear. 
17387 Love it! 
17388 Really good 
17389 Great service, quick ship. Product packaged really, really well. So far the product performs as I expected. No complaints! 
17390 Excellent polarizer. Build quality is good. Does an amazing job at removing reflections (see attached photos). One must be mindful of the exposure time however as it does darken the image some and the best way to compensate without having to use a tripod is to increase ISO. 
17391 Nothing fancy, but for the price you can t beat it. It fits my canon g7x. 
17392 This camera was working as advertised for 2-3 years, but this summer, I took it to the beach and water got into the camera (LCD screen area) even though the latch was locked. Now the camera doesn t work. 
17393 Fits my camera-plenty of room to add on devices. 
17394 The camera arrived on time. Took on vacation this summer. Takes very good pictures and the price was right. 
17395 Camera does not work and phone app does not recgnize camera. Two thumbs down!!! 
17396 Very good 
17397 My 15 yo daughter loves it! 
17398 Just what I wanted for a great price! 
17399 I use this frequently when I am taking landscapes. It weighs nothing, is simple to connect, and works flawlessly. Cable is just the right length. 
17400 Package deal with all the extras for your new camera 
17401 They hold sand like they re supposed to. 
17402 I am starting in DSLR cameras and the Nikon D3200 is perfect for beginners who wanto to grow at fast rate. 
17403 I use camera batteries as fast as I can charge them. These Vivitar batteries last as long as my Canon batteries & these are A Lot cheaper in cost! I use them in my Canon SX700 HS. Also fast shipping by seller. 
17404 was supposed to be color, but the prints come out almost sepia. would not buy again. 8 prints for over 20.00 should be good quality 
17405 absolutely SOLID !!!! my original broke while skiing, it ruins the day it is well worth the peace of mind. feels heavier but it isnt. 
17406 I was happy with my lens filter 
17407 great camera 
17408 Fits tight but not to tight 
17409 Works fine for what I needed it for. 
17410 Fits perfectly in the hot shoe on my A6000 
17411 Camera works great! Software is smooth. Easy to connect. Update: This camera sends all of your video to the &#34;Cloud&#34; located in China. If you are into privacy I suggest you try a camera that connects to your home WiFi network rather than directly to the Internet. 
17412 Fits well. Keeps things clean. 
17413 Nice camera for the price. Be aware that it comes in at 240, the 933 cameras come in at 480, so this is not quite as sharp. Does the job for what I need, tho I do wish I would have known this before I bought it. 
17414 Great device for controlling lights! Representative AR004627 was a great help on DLINK 
17415 Wonderful product. We use it on our binos. Great quality. Love the soft neck strap. 
17416 I m using this with a Fuji X-E1 - works great. 
17417 SUPER PRODUCTO 
17418 Works great, has a few quirks to get used to. 
17419 Gets the job done but the instructions are not very good! Tilt function did not work. 
17420 Great product have been using it for years. 
17421 Item shipped was not as described/pictured. 
17422 Still going strong, after all these years. Great quality and design. Very light weight too. Great for trips and special occasions. 
17423 Good 
17424 Works great, suitable for close recording in low light areas. 
17425 Thanks! 
17426 Great camera. PTZ and connects with wifi about 200 feet away. 
17427 These things really are magic. We use ours to remote mount cameras and flashes at weddings. The versatility of this arm is amazing... and worth every penny. 
17428 As described! Better than expected! 
17429 This battery replaces one that been in use for a couple of years... best recommendation I can give. 
17430 Good camera case but wish had more space to get extra SD cards etc 
17431 It works as expected! 
17432 Cap perfectly fits and has a very good quality, almost as good as original one, also it has a hole and a string to attach it to camera, its very helpful 
17433 This soft box is great for the price! It was easy to set up and does the job well. Getting it back in the pouch was a little hard but the same could be said about 99% of these things! 
17434 Item just as stated. Worked perfectly 
17435 So good The best color calibration tool 
17436 The battery is good so far. I will find out more when I take them to a long vacation next week. The battery can only be charge with the Nikon Coolpix W130 NOT W120. Don t know why? 
17437 My sister in law loves it and is easy to use if you are familiar with smart phones. 
17438 Neither of the batteries worked in my camera even though they were the correct type and model, 
17439 Sturdy step up ring, nothing fancy, does what it needs to do. Bundled cleaning cloth is a bonus. 
17440 Good price, solid metal construction. Fits on my A7S well and it is easy enough to take off. No light leaks that I can see. 
17441 Night vision sucks everything else a+ 
17442 I like it, it s small 
17443 Nifty 50 works great on my Canon Rebel T3i! 
17444 keeps popping off 
17445 Perfect fit work great! 
17446 Pretty good, for the price. Not the best quality mask or camera, but it has lasted a couple of years and it captured some good memories. 
17447 Great price for getting two backup batteries for my SX 510. 
17448 As far as the camera image quality is concerned, great, as well as the sound too. However, the lack of email alerts is a must have which this camera/software does not offer. The app you use with the cam is buggy at best at alerting you. 
17449 Super fun case 
17450 This contraption is perfect. Fits really snug and you can make any and all adjustments needed to get the perfect fit. My first time using this was for an alpine rollercoaster in Austria with no breaks. Solid and sturdy. Two thumbs up. 
17451 So far so good quality hardware. 
17452 Very cute album ! I thought it would be a little bigger but it s ok! 5 stars! 
17453 Bought a few times now. No problems at all. Everyone loves it at the party. 
17454 Good space, good side pockets, but........ shoulder belt side holders (hooks) are a disaster, totally broken with only a lifted. The dividers are poorly sewn, too much thread around 
17455 doesn t hold a charge as well as my other batteries, my camera shows the health as 2 of 3 bars when new. 
17456 Great heavy duty and heavy 
17457 Henry was excellent. He took over my computer remotely and fixed the issue within a few minutes. 
17458 Nice bag when you want something light and don t need a lot of protection. Great price. 
17459 A must to protect your camera. 
17460 love it 
17461 Excellent lens - A little bigger than the older I Had, a compact 20-50 ..which started with an 00 error and ended, a month later with a dead diaphragm, making all the photos totally dark. I m very satisfied with the Samsung NX 18 55mm 
17462 It s decent for the price. It does spin and after couples uses got a little sloppy. I Used it in the water mostly it hasn t rusted. 
17463 Excellent product and service 
17464 Good 
17465 Arrived right before my trip out of the country and it worked perfectly to charge my recorder! 
17466 Just what it s supposed to do. It connects an Olympus EM-10 to your computer. 
17467 Ok 
17468 Good functionality and fits the ARLO camera perfectly. It is a white/grayish color. Definitely different from the Netgear Arlo white. Although this doesn t bother me, it provides the angles I need so it s good! 
17469 Excellent 
17470 I did not received NIkon L28 20.1 MP the one I ask for. 
17471 This backdrop is pretty large, but it gets the job done wonderfully. 
17472 Very thin like a shower curtain liner, I was upset when I opened it up. 
17473 I would buy again with no hesitation 
17474 charger usb collapsed and broke ! purchase a separate charger! everything else very well 
17475 Easy to use for a beginner Sturdy stand nice lens 
17476 This is the perfect products for my camera! 
17477 This was for my father, and it is great. Simple, functional, unexpensive, compact, the menus could be easier to use but my 70 year old father learnt the basics and be happy with it. 
17478 Excellent for price for what it does 
17479 Fits perfectly 
17480 Exactly like factory cap, fits perfect. 
17481 This lens hood is nice, and works probably just about as well as the Canon one. The only problem that I have is reversing the hood. Other than that, it works well for pictures and video. It s a good buy. 
17482 Using this on an ASP-C sensor (A-6000) to great advantage as a 36-360 mm. Sharpest just beyond close focus. Great bokah at widest f stops. 
17483 Works like a charm. 
17484 Works great!!! 
17485 I have an older Nikon Coolpix point and shoot and its wobbly on this tripod. I got it for shooting videos outdoors so I can attach to a tree limb and it should be fine. The loose part is right at the junction of the 3 legs. 
17486 The product was good once hooked up, but the instructions and software did not work well. I had to program the cameras by using a direct IP interface. If you have some IT know how, you can get to work. 
17487 OK 
17488 great batteries 
17489 Very good camera great photos very good 4k video 
17490 Worked perfectly with a Canon 6D and a 24-105mm lens in a trip to Yosemite. 
17491 Fits perfect, Love it 
17492 Works just fine. Easy to connect to phone. Easy to use the companion app. Photo colors are alright but a tad off. Ink doesn t smear. 
17493 Died just after using for 2 nights. 
17494 Danny was so great! helped me for over an hour! 10000% HAPPY! GREAT CAMERA ALSO! 
17495 Nice looking but the snaps are low quality. First time I unsnapped the top piece the snap broke off. Replacement snaps are difficult to find. 
17496 Amazing quality and works great 
17497 It doesn t give any information it s very expensive and you don t know what your buying 
17498 Excellent product. I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
17499 Magnets and snaps could be stronger - front flap frequently falls of when trying to use camera 
17500 Nice styling. 
17501 Wow! What a great product at a great price! 
17502 Great, same as the name brand just way cheaper. 
17503 great 
17504 Excellent case. Highly durable and a good price. Fits all your gear for your go pro. The pocket on the inside is a great feature. Everything fits in the foam snugly and wont go anywhere or get damaged. A+ 
17505 Very good camera case. Basic, with some useful pockets well made. 
17506 changed out the battery for wife s Sony camera and it works as good as the original battery and didn t cost very much 
17507 awesome and seals 
17508 When i bougt it i think there is a cable for i phone 6, but it dose not 
17509 Great little camera. Has an external mic plug so we can plug it into the church sound system. Getting nice videos. 
17510 Waste of money, none of then worked 
17511 Great idea, Needs more solar panels...charges WAY to slow but it does work 
17512 Nice 
17513 When they say it fits the GoPro 1... they must mean a different one than what I have. Mine came with a case that isn t removable. I had to return the case and just replace the piece that came off. Bummer. 
17514 Liked the feel, weight and capabilities but went for the Samsung WB2200f instead 
17515 The knurling of the ring makes the rotation of the filter easy through the hole in the lens hood of my new Canon 100-400 zoom. Much easier to use. 
17516 Works ok will not transfer video. Make sure to put in airplane mode when transferring. 
17517 Works fantastically. Would definitely recommend 
17518 This little camera works great. Had some trouble with the wireless connection. But thanks to the excellent tec support this little camera is working fine. Thank you Mylene #AR004212 case# c6721279. Ask for her she s great. 
17519 Very fine 
17520 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
17521 These are great. I lose these all the time so its nice that they come with 6 in a pack. They work well with or without a cleaner. Great for my iphone and ipad and they also are great on eye glasses. 
17522 This is my second Targus USB 2.0 Digital Card Reader and it works great. 
17523 Lasts longer than factory battery and multi use charger is handy for trips. 
17524 Henry performed a Remote Install for the FOSCAM F19816P camera I purchased. He performed the install without any problems got the install completed in less than 45 minutes. Very pleased with his service. Real pleased with the quality of pictures from the FOSCAM. 
17525 Easy to use and setup whether you use it internally or view from external networks. View on 3 iPhones, iPad and a computer. Haven t tried the SD Card features. 
17526 Extremely happy with my purchase. This camera is so easy to operate and takes beautiful photos. Already wanting to buy some better lenses! 
17527 a bit tight fit 
17528 Great kit for any phone to help with pics 
17529 Great buy for the money. 
17530 Thank you! 
17531 Most excellent range. Superb build. Prime focus points throughout. Travelling through India with this lens has been a pleasure. Few other lenses were needed. And it has been rained on, smashed against trains, auto rickshaws, and mass humanity. No problems but real fun. 
17532 So far, am quite happy with it. I have not used it much yet, still learning how to use it. 
17533 We bought these cameras for three rooms in our house and I love them!!! They work great and are at an amazing price!! We plan on buying more!!! 
17534 It s good 
17535 Great 
17536 I love this product. It allows me to know when someone comes down the driveway and extra security at night. I plan on getting another set and putting on the steps on the deck to protect the back of the house. 
17537 This Tripod gets the job done, but it is extremely flimsy. I thought it would ve been a little thicker to be able to hold my canon t5i comfortably. 
17538 This is just the ticket for all the extra things you need while videoing. The arm is very strong and as long as you keep the weight even it doesn t bob up and down and all around. Very useful to a videographer. 
17539 all 4 are exactly the same, all have the same product number 
17540 Great! 
17541 Very good walkaround lens. Beware it´s big and a bit on the heavy side but this is a step up from any kit lens. You won´t regret it. 
17542 Good fit for Nikon d3100 
17543 It is a real nice looking case, but it is too small. 
17544 it has alluminum legs, very stable even w/ a 4 lb binocular. 
17545 This is exactly what i need to work on my youtube videos with 
17546 Works well as a replacement for the Leica batteries that came with my camera. 
17547 I m not reviewing the product, the product didn t work out for me, not that its bad, it wasn t compatible. The service of the seller was excellent, resolved the issue well, stayed in contact throughout. thank you 
17548 No instructions at all. Still trying to figure it out for android and no way will it mount on the binoculars. 
17549 it broke literally 10 minutes after getting into the water and I lost my brand new camera! 
17550 We purchased this case to work with Nikon S9900, unfortunately it didn t fit well. It was extremely tight fit and we re afraid it might scratch the camera. We returned the case immediately. Positive side, it arrived quick. 
17551 Works as it should. I would have desired a power cord to plug in, but with 4 AA batteries and the LED system, it works just fine. The more solid diffusion rings are a bonus. Using with Sony A and 49 mm without issue. 
17552 Well built, provides extra space and cushion for SLR cameras, I m using this one with a canon EOS 60D with 18-135mm lenses. I m able to fit battery charger and extra memory easily. 
17553 As expected. Got to see Jupiter and Saturn with it in a clear night. It s pretty cool. 
17554 Sweet charger, not as fast as I expected. But it works great, and easy to charge, too! Fast shipment, packaged well, and a great price. Thanks! 
17555 excellent! 
17556 as advertised 
17557 nice camera for the price 
17558 I m still finding things to use. I just got done with an afternoon of wearing the head mount while I was climbing a tower [inside] and walking on campus. Worked great. 
17559 I m really satiafied with this great combo. 
17560 Great, but be careful not to over-tighten. 
17561 Excellent choice of lenses at a very good price and very nicely packaged for easy transport with my camera. 
17562 Light and cheap, fits perfectly, but to be honest the original ECG-1 is better - more grippy, slimmer base which is better for pinky finger and doesn t get so cold, so if you can get that one, I would recommend it more. 
17563 Very low quality. Short life. 
17564 Lots of missing items, the camera s fine though 
17565 This is a great buy. Also my neighbors think that I have a real security surveillance system. It a great but to deter Crime. The blinking solid red lights on the camera make is look realistic. 
17566 Great 
17567 The hook broke after couple of months. I never received any response to my email. 
17568 Awesome mount and fitting is perfect. Used it at the beach and caught awesome moments. Well worth it s price. 
17569 I definitely needed this! 
17570 Perfect. Just prepare for long wait, arrived 10 days past due, but it works good. 
17571 This is a wonderful lens 
17572 Good 
17573 Fits my Nikon D7100 and was very useful in shooting in rainy Alaska. 
17574 Good deal/product 
17575 This scope works exactly as I expected, using the Cheese app on the Fedora 22 version of Linux. A problem with the ON/OFF switch on the first unit I received was quickly resolved by an immediate vendor replacement. 
17576 Works great and charges my batteries quite fast. 
17577 I like it very well and work great in many positions and keeps secure. Thanks!! 
17578 I m criticizing myself...not the product. I should have noticed that I was buying BOTH a remote and a camera cleaning kit. The remote can be purchased by itself for around $20 elsewhere on Amazon. 
17579 Works well, no issues. Great price and does the job. 
17580 Probably one of my favorite GoPro accessories. I can easily get the footage I need when doing a run and its easily transportable. I personally think there is less shake vs the head and chest strap. 
17581 It is smaller than expect but the resolution on the screen is great. 
17582 Love them 
17583 Excellent 
17584 Kool look will fool you but the only thing it blanks, and a real cam don t. 
17585 Giving a 4 start only because it lacks the ability to collapse it to store in your camera bag... But for the price I wouldn t complain... 
17586 Item worked once and then stopped working. 
17587 Love it. 
17588 Everything we needed! 
17589 it works really great on iphone and android. I bought this one for a gift but i tried it first to be sure it works pretty well and my friend loves it! 
17590 My wife loves it! Still learning how to rock the shot but getting some amazing photos. 
17591 Works perfectly with camera and charger. So happy! 
17592 like the colored borders 
17593 For short footages is an ideal tool. Lightweight, strong and confortable make me gladder that I though 
17594 The joint and plates themselves seem to be pretty well made, but the shipment lacked the hardware necessary to connect the case to the plate. Be prepared to supply your own nuts. 
17595 This camera does not have a jack to support an external microphone. 
17596 clarity was less than expected 
17597 Love this paper. The color works very well for my children and maternity sessions. 
17598 Perfect for what I needed 
17599 People keep running into my wife and I ve looked for a decent little camera to use in the car. Then, some neighbor dogs attacked her while out walking ours, she needed something to clip on and take with her. This little baby does both pretty darn well. 
17600 fast shipping will do more business 
17601 I have just used this remote shutter at the fireworks show on Aug 22nd without problem. 
17602 Crystal clear focus without the Image Stabilizer! This is wonderful. The USM is required if you need quiet such as photographing wildlife. 
17603 a 
17604 great product great price works as description 
17605 Poor product had to send it back twice product was open already and used 
17606 the tripod assembly is a tad difficult when assembling the unit, but other than that a fine refractor. 
17607 Even though it s a little harder to carry this case with you everywhere it does hold alot if you are going out to take pictures. 
17608 Great product, and perfect little photos for keepsakes, would recommend to edit photos on your phone and increase the contrast and saturation since the pictures do fade a little bit when they print, but overall I m pleased with the products 
17609 Great price for a nice, basic camera case. Item holds up well. 
17610 Great kit! 
17611 Very happy with the picture provided. 
17612 works nice 
17613 Lightweight, and quick and easy to assemble. Material could be a bit sturdier, but as is, works well with paper or other lightweight backdrops. 
17614 Functional 
17615 Perfect for what we wanted. Works very well, easy to use. 
17616 Kenneth was a great help setting up my Foscam to send email when motion is detected. He is quick polite and knows his data. Thanks Kenneth, Jerald 
17617 Great product and fun for many events. Everyone loves it. 
17618 Camera does a decent job even in relatively low light. The housing clip got loose after only a couple of uses. 
17619 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
17620 Excelkente! Fits all accessories! 
17621 Good finish and packaging macro lens is also good 
17622 Very handy item,more when you forget the charger, and have one fully charged in your pocket. 
17623 Great camera for any small application especially for FPV embedded in racing quads. I have had a few cameras on various models. Also, comes with easy to use wiring harness for attaching to video transmitters such as FatShark/Immersion. 
17624 So far so good. SOMETIMES the individual items move around and that should t be. Otherwise no problems 
17625 good 
17626 Great! 
17627 Grate 
17628 great idea, not great implementation, doesnt slip on or fit easily onto the screen 
17629 So cute 
17630 Works great 
17631 works as planned, ideally matching the a6000. 
17632 Works good and in new condition. 
17633 Product is exactly what was advertised 
17634 This accessory fits perfectly for my camera! 
17635 As an owner of both a Gopro 3, and Gopro 4, this is a fantastic charger than can handle BOTH batteries, and can recharge from my computer s USB port. 
17636 Super filter for the money! 
17637 Is as advertised 
17638 Perfect - does what it says on the tin! Very sturdy and easy to fit 
17639 Works great, fantastic feal! 
17640 Works fine at a good price. 
17641 Delivery on time. Was due for new battery, old one about 5 yrs old and wasn t holding charge very well 
17642 Works well. I have only tested this and not actually put it to use. It should eliminate the camera shake when I press the shutter release button. 
17643 Does exactly as it s supposed to do. 
17644 I love it. 
17645 This camera is pure garbage. Until iIbought this camera I ve hadn t ever submitted a review or even a star rating. Now I wish there were an option for a —🌟rating. 
17646 Work just as good as my og canon battery and super cheap. 
17647 Takes nice pictures above and below water. Seems like the ones under water are nicer/clearer if the sun is directly above you. For the money you can t beat it. 
17648 these are propellers. I used them as such 
17649 Awesome 
17650 Great. 
17651 I m very pleased with our purchase. Camera works with our iOS devices flawlessly! We can monitor our little puppy from most everywhere. I would highly recommend this to family and friends! 
17652 Was attempting to take photos of the glorious mountains in our backyard. These lens did the job, though I had to edit with instagram afterwards. 
17653 Can t beat the price - bulbs burned out within 2 days - but very pleased with the quality. 
17654 I love this large air blaster. It works and works well. I always keep it with my camera and lenses as I use it before any shoot just to be sure that I get the desired impact from my equipment. Compact yet effective. Thanks. 
17655 Great when shooting all landscape stills or working with video cameras. Mounting to longer lenses causes some issues when going vertical but a work around is to have your vertical lens on you dominant hand. Good quality material. 
17656 we love it!!! 
17657 The camera was easy to setup. To access it on the computer remotely on another network was easy and picture quality was great. Even the app worked great on my phone for remotely viewing the camera and allowed for pan and tilt and speaker and mic usage. 
17658 Much better fit than the one that came with my lens. The branded original kept falling off and I ended up losing it. This cap is so secure I feel it is safe even though I removed the lanyard. 
17659 Works for basic monitoring 
17660 Does have lots of features too. However many people have complained about interference with garage door transmit and I had same issue when i put it in my garage. So beware. 
17661 Super cute and easy to carry around everywhere with me! 
17662 Good size float 
17663 Love this light. Fit perfect on my canon rebel. Just what I needed 
17664 Had an XE1&2 This is a great camera. I do wish the flash could be manually tilted back to bounce the flash like my XE2. Also I love the drive dial! 
17665 works well. small enough to put in your pocket 
17666 Print very small, not really what I would like to have as a quick reference guide. Need magnifier to even begin to see what they are saying. 
17667 Another satisfied grandkid. Super easy to use and takes good pictures. 
17668 It doesn t stay on an active dog very well. 
17669 This thing has some zooming power, but you need to purchase a tripod to help hold and steady it. Looking forward to getting some moon shots; so I`ll let you know how they turn out. 
17670 Great 
17671 Excellent! We re very pleased! 
17672 great head, very heavy sturdy build as you d expect. just as good as other name brands but 30% cheaper :) so I have a couple of these now and happy with them 
17673 It doesn t actually detect my dog. 
17674 There is not enough space to tell one how I feel about this product or the company customer service! 
17675 good 
17676 This is what I needed. 
17677 fits good cant wait to try it out. 
17678 work hard to make this work 
17679 Works perfectly. 
17680 Great bag and perfect size! 
17681 My cousin is happy with it! He was searching it for a long time. So let s see, how long it s gonna last. 
17682 Need to learn all the begins the scenes fearless of this phone but love it! 
17683 As with all the other Pelican cases i ve used in the past, this is a top notch product. I use it to store a Nikon D5300, multiple lenses, a portable hard drive, a portable NAS controller, backup battery, nikon battery charger, and memory card case. 
17684 For those claiming the cap has poor fit, it took me a bit to figure out as well, but you need to TWIST it on so that it mounts properly after putting it on the barrel. It will snap into place and fits excellent afterward 
17685 Small, light weight and perfect for a 180mm or smaller quad. 
17686 Very nice quality. 
17687 Kept camera from sinking and came in very handy! 
17688 Works great. Do wish it had room for a second lens though. 
17689 playing with it all the time! 
17690 bought one more than a year ago, it has worked so well I got another. once charged, it lasts a long time, about five hours. extremely satisfied with the purchase and the second one was actually cheaper than the first one. 
17691 Does the job though the plastic is cheap and tends to chip off. 
17692 Difficult to focus 
17693 Fits perfectly on my camera screen and doesn t make it blurry to see photos. Very clear and easy to keep clean. 
17694 Nice 
17695 Fit perfect and strong 
17696 Great lens!! 
17697 Fast Shipping, product as described. 
17698 Quality product for a very reasonable price. 
17699 These cases are so amazing. Holds my sniper rifle and a couple pistols with out a problem. It takes a while to cut the foam but it is so worth it in the end. 
17700 having lots of fun with this 
17701 All the parts you need to make 4 lanyards. Pick your own length. Works great, and easy to make. Just need a hammer and lighter. 
17702 such a great, fun camera. I love the the pics it produces. Such a great camera to bring to a party and hand out the pics 
17703 Best deal for the amount of accessories in the box. 
17704 worked great. forgot my charger on a beach trip used my prime to have this delivered love amazon! 
17705 Ideal 
17706 Works great for us! Thanks!! 
17707 It is just right and came with in a few days of ordering. 
17708 Will this work with other lenses or just the 16-50mm? 
17709 Cheap and doesn t work right 
17710 its a very tricky camera if you are trying to setup wirelessly quality of this night vision camera is great and price is ok too but man its a headache to set it up, it should come with a Advil 
17711 Works good. 
17712 Best thing ever... 
17713 Very cheap quality! Bought 2 and one of my buttons were already broken! Also product heats up very fast so it is a potential fire hazard! Was looking forward to these but on to the next amazon find! 
17714 Thank you, it good quality. 
17715 Absolutely brilliant little piece of equipment! A must have for astrophotogtahy with an SCT. 
17716 I have had the speedlight for about 3 months and the mode button longer works. 
17717 Fraud. 
17718 Works as expected with no issues 
17719 Gave 5 stars because quality was good for price paid. Holds a6000 with no issues and will be perfect for traveling. Little flimsy but if you take care it will work fine and last. 
17720 Out of the aftermarket BP-511, these seem to work the best with Canon 50D. 
17721 Good price. Good quality. Fast shipping. 
17722 it s a good items. 
17723 Great product! Easy to transport, set up, and use. I love the lighting I achieve with it indoors and out. I definitely recommend either having an assistant to hold it if you are outdoors or bring sandbags as a 60&#34; umbrella will blow over in the slightest wind. 
17724 Great start up kit. 
17725 Works perfectly! Very happy with the product. Especially the price. 
17726 Don t wast your money - you ll never use it. Way harsh on the orange. 
17727 Excellent product , very satisfied with it s function. I recommend this item in a heartbeat. 
17728 Clear and crisp photos. Good price! 
17729 Great price. Works as promised. No issues at all. I mounted them both behind the 16-50 PZ - no issues! We had a little fun creating a lego dance scene (captured on a Sony a6000) 
17730 Got the quadcopter running and after a few dry runs got the hang of it and it runs very well.....I am very happy with it!!!!! 
17731 Perfect camera mount for car dash or windshield. Sturdy and strong, very reliable. 
17732 If you have 70 yr old eyes as I do you better get real good magnifying glass 
17733 These perform as good as if not better than the Canon battery that came with the camera, and at a fraction of the price. UPDATE: Batteries last 1.5 years and then completely died. Took to a camera expert - and said that neither batter was holding any power after charging. 
17734 I rarely use the camera and it stays in the camera bag most of the time, however, the jacket started to crack after several months. 
17735 Always an excellent product. 
17736 This was super easy to set up - the hardest part was finding the button on the camera. Once that was set up, the remote worked instantly. 
17737 Perfect!!! 
17738 Holes only 4.3mm not the 8mm advertised. I had to return it, would not fit photoflex box rods. 
17739 Ok ordere the camera nad htis drop magic together, camera was dropped by amazon 
17740 Not too smooth moving it whilr shooting 
17741 Extremely sturdy. Love pistol grip 
17742 I recently purchased this kit and I am very impressed with the quality of the product! The images are wonderful and the kit is very easy to set up. It is definitely worth the money! 
17743 works well. 
17744 Great inexpensive, alternative to baby monitors! Great for the price!! 
17745 not good Quality.. take too long to arrived 
17746 If you need a reliable battery. These are the best out there. They constantly out perform my GoPro branded batteries. They last around an hour and 15 mins of filming and the price is great. Don t overlook these batteries. They are amazing. 
17747 Great case. The cube foam works great and gives you a very professional result. Very satisfied. 
17748 DEI products are my first choice for security and remote start 
17749 Kinda weak ,but ok for price 
17750 These batteries last forever. I snagged a spare and have yet to run my primary battery down. 
17751 I bought this for a gift for someone and they really like it. Does everything they want to do with a camera. Very good lens apparently. 
17752 Fast enough for my 810. 
17753 loved it 
17754 enjoying 
17755 works as needed for little dollars. Don t know how long it will last. 
17756 Spend 12 hours won t able to work stay away 
17757 does what it s supposed to. 
17758 Works perfect. 
17759 Perfect. 
17760 This product is awesome and works great! The video is very clear and clean, I suggest everybody that wants to spy and look cool get this product!!! Great product SpyCrushers!!! 
17761 lets me take picture of different objects without the burden of having difficulties in finding the stable position and exposure. glad to find this camera before our exposure trip in the slums of detroit. 
17762 Only half of my purchase works. Somehow one of my light fixtures and a bulb doesn t work. Sending it back. 
17763 Perfect, performs the same as the old one. 
17764 Works great. Easy to install and use. Great picture and sound quality. Love that there is an app for it. And send notification when any motion is detected. 
17765 Thought I was getting new prod this whole order was a disappointment 
17766 Battery life is comparable to the OEM battery, however it is a bit snug in my X-T1. It doesn t come out as easily as the OEM battery. I have to pick it out with my fingernails. 
17767 Works great. 
17768 camera came with 2 batteries and a charger.. but having another is NEVER a bad idea.. especially when this one comes with a car adaptor! charges actually FASTOR than the canon one!! product was delivered on time as well!! very pleased! stays in camera bag 
17769 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
17770 OK, the câmera is very goood!!! 
17771 Although i have too many lenses for this case it is perfect for my favorite two. I love the rain protector and how solid the straps feel. I totally trust this case with my most expensive equipment 
17772 its ok 
17773 Canberra does a good job for the price. Takes great pictures and once I know how to use it better I m sure video and picture quality will a go up. 
17774 It has met my expectations. Easy to install but with fact that this was for a new home build and wiring already in place. Very good mobile app that did the job when went out of town just after getting it installed. 
17775 I purchase it to extend my LAVIEW camera which works fantastic day and night view is great. 
17776 cool toy 
17777 I love this camera it has a stablizer which helps me take beautiful pictures!!! 
17778 so far works great! 
17779 Nice case! 
17780 Good camera, only use it a couple of days but it serves our needs very well. 
17781 I got missing parts 
17782 Very happy with my purchase 
17783 The effect in photography is as intended, however the plastic feels much less sturdy than I expected for the price. 
17784 does the job, but a little awkward. 
17785 Met my expextativas , good near vision 
17786 good lens kit from Goja. I am really loving the look of this and set 
17787 I got this to charge up and use for a back up on my camera. It appears to have charged well, I haven t had a chance to use it yet! 
17788 Great 
17789 Great Pics....Manual lenses are the best 
17790 Works fine but there is this problematic &#34;feature&#34; that turning it on/off 4x in 4 seconds makes it reset / forget the network. So far my kids have done this twice and it s really annoying. 
17791 Arrived as promised. 
17792 Great results every time with this film. 
17793 Love the metallic blue color! 
17794 Love this! Awesome purchase! 
17795 THE ONLY ONE THAT I FOUND CAN FIT AmazonBasics 52-Inch Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod.... 
17796 Would not work with computer - very dark photos - not easy to use. 
17797 strong holding mounts. need some extra mounts for the go pro. these hold up well, used some on the RZR running bumpy tarain and they have stayed mounted. 
17798 Great batteries at a fraction of the originals. 
17799 These things scratched the crap out of my 2 month old glasses lenses, even with glasses cleaner. Thanks. 
17800 Didn t work for long... don t waste money. 
17801 Good value. 
17802 Lightweight and exactly what I needed for all my gear. 
17803 never used a selfie stick before.... Very easy to set up, just charged it, held down the shutter button until it flashed, paired it with the phone, and started using it. It works great! Compatible with all the apps on my phone. The folding design makes it very compact. 
17804 Nice value 
17805 Pretty much didn t work for me. Too bulky, and i don t like letting my camera dangle by one side. I walk - a lot - when i shoot, and this just forced the camera to bang against me, no matter how i rigged it. 
17806 efficient & accurate 
17807 Crap 
17808 Not a solid yellow case as depicted in the photo. Otherwise a typical quality Pelican case. 
17809 Great Buy ! 
17810 It s not as heavy as a Pelican case so it s much easier on the back. The case seems exceptionally well designed. It fits the drone perfectly and the storage slots are well thought out. Everything fits perfectly. 
17811 Great product! 
17812 i have this product and I definitely recommend it. i can see my kids whenever wherever i want. totally worth the price 
17813 good 
17814 Excellent fit and was amazed that once installed my screen actually looked brighter and clearer. 
17815 Could not get it to work properly and couldn t get the lighting adjusted. I ve never had this much trouble with a digital camera. It wound up going in the trashcan. :-( 
17816 Broke the first time I used it on a motocross bike and lost my friend s GoPro that I borrowed for a shoot. Spent hours looking and had to buy her a new one. So this piece of junk actually cost $400. 
17817 Extremely good value. 
17818 didnt work for me but quality looks good 
17819 We love it! 
17820 Great camera, good price 
17821 Great product, highly recommended 
17822 Perfect pictures but SONY colors are nicer. 
17823 love it love it, pictures are very clear easy to carry around 
17824 Great bag for the price! 
17825 This kit is the worst. No instructions, just a mess of products most of which I have no idea how to connect or what they do. No instructions 
17826 Good!! 
17827 Work for the camera I purchased them for 
17828 A little pricy but worth it 
17829 nice bag 
17830 Works very well, easy to attach and take off, simple lil mirror accurately helps set up the shot 
17831 great deal 
17832 Just fine. Camera works now 
17833 All parts are quality, love the package! love the price! 
17834 Excellent 
17835 Original item, functions perfectly! 
17836 I have mix feelings about this. Thought about returning it but decided to keep it. The selfie stick is extremely short. Everything is just cheap quality but gets the job done. The case is probably the best thing about the kit. 
17837 not bad it is very usufull 
17838 Sometime it didn t adhere to camera... 
17839 Great light. It is plenty bright and can be dimmed. Also, like that it comes with a battery that can be used in your GoPro. Fits perfect to the camera. Would recommend. 
17840 I never want to take this lens off of my camera. It s so sharp and focuses faster than my Canon 50mm 1.4. The lens distortion is minimal. Love it. 
17841 very good 
17842 I am very impressed with this lens. It is very sharp and the Bokeh is out of this world. My portrait business just went up a notch. 
17843 These work great! I like the cell phone screen cleaner it works pretty good too! 
17844 Excellent 
17845 As advertised 
17846 working great,no problem 
17847 These batteries work just fine they power my digital canon camera just as they are supposed to do. 
17848 Great camera--so pleased with it. 
17849 A big help in keeping a full bag of gear on your shoulder. Highly recommend. 
17850 really surprising 
17851 Works awesome, camera see s this device as a Nikon product. Its built well and all functions work flawlessly 
17852 Great affordable product, but the software is quite glitch. You often need to close the software, shut down the FLIR device, turn it back on, and load the software back up. Or else it d be a 5 star. 
17853 Great easily charges batteries. highly recommend 
17854 Easy to adjust and use, good quality. Great for hiking, etc. Good solution when you need a quality product but don t want to pay a small fortune for an item that will only be used on an occasional basis. basis. 
17855 Quality is great, no complaints so far. I use them for wiring outdoor camera s and they have held up to direct, hot sunlight as well as rain and moisture without any deterioration. 
17856 Works great for going through hundreds of slides. Great sellers 
17857 Purchased a couple of these for kids going off to school. One of them was defective and the owner promptly replaced it (thank you!) They work as intended - pull the cord and it goes off. I just hope my kids never have a need to use it. 
17858 I have an 8&#34; Dobsonian Zhumell. I have used this time of camera eye piece previously. Could not get it to focus at all with this purchase. Tech support suggested that I move the main mirror. Back in the box for a refund. 
17859 very good product 
17860 Awesome camera. I bought this for my wife for her birthday. My oldest son played with it and ended up buying one for himself he liked it so much. 
17861 High quality A/V stick. Works well with Saumsung S5, Iphone 6 and Hero 4. I was able to use the stick with a Hero4 in air flight going around 100 mph and the device worked flawlessly. No turns or twists like the cheap sticks. 
17862 For the price, which was very reasonable, it is a great charger. Seems solidly built. Of course, I ve only used it once so far. I had a charger of similar size, brand X, which was pretty flimsy and stopped working after a while. 
17863 Very handy, and just the right size! 
17864 Is great and is the best mini camcorder ever 
17865 Easy to use, good quality. 
17866 Got these as a gag gift for my brother who is a photographer, but he actually loves them and uses them often. 
17867 Uh it ended up not working but I was sick of trying to figure out how to work with the files AND the camera itself. Bad product for me. 
17868 Everything was exactly as advertised and well packaged. My son loves the camera. Great value package!!! 
17869 works wonderfully my first photo backdrop stand would buy again would recommend to others 
17870 Great value and always handy to have extra power for my go pro on hand. 
17871 Works great. Planning to use it for remote live video of a baptism. Can t wait to see how it all turns out. 
17872 This was a gift. 
17873 good buy 
17874 It fit and work as described in the add. It is working great 
17875 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support did a fantastic job helping set up my camera 
17876 looks cool 
17877 Great bag, for a great price! Fits both my camera bodies, lenses and flash. It s much easier to transport my equipment in a backpack. 
17878 Created a new quadcopter from an old quadcopter using this and some new blades. The frame is stuff and solid, odds are that it ll break the first time it falls out of the air (but we won t let that happen). 
17879 It doesn t Work 
17880 Wow fit perfect 
17881 excellent product. deliveried on time as was promised. 
17882 Great 
17883 This is perfect to keep my zip from just being banged around in my bag. 
17884 Works great! Awesome value for the money! Does exactly what I need for 1/4th the price! 
17885 Good quality for the price. 
17886 Great little camera...no problems so far!! 
17887 hard to find yet you had in stock at a low price. I am impressed 
17888 The charger works perfectly and the delivery was extremely fast. I highly recommend this product! 
17889 Not meant to be on a supervised system, no &#34;in / out&#34; leads. 
17890 i have LOVED using this instant camera. its fun & vintage! takes great shots. even my 3 year old loves using it. we display the photos on our fridge and in an instant film sized album. 
17891 The optics aren t great but I guess you get what you are willing to pay for. At this point I think I would have spent a little more to get one that will last longer and have better optics. 
17892 It is good. 
17893 I am sure it works well, but I couldn t use it. I thought I only broke the lens but turns out I completely destroyed the camera. Giving it 5 stars because I can t justify otherwise, but I did not actually use it. 
17894 The bag is very beautiful 
17895 The batteries are very good !!! The charger is very slow, but they give you the charger like a bonus !!! 
17896 Excelent 
17897 these are TOUGH 
17898 Kenneth at Foscam service did a great job walking me through the setup. The Foscam works perfect and looks great! I would recommend Foscam because of the ease and customer service. 
17899 Just what I needed to help in the digitizing of my slides ... saved time sorting what should/should not be saved. 
17900 Works perfectly!!! 
17901 Item shipped fast and was as described. 
17902 Works fine. 
17903 Henry did an excellent job of support. It is the first time the ipad has connected to my foscam camera. I also now know what to do to access from a remote location. THANK YOU HENRY. 
17904 Illuminati. 
17905 Works great! High quality! 
17906 Excellent 
17907 This was my first time placing a order with amazon, very pleased and will be ordering again soon. 
17908 Does not auto focus on a D3200. 
17909 Works extremely well. 
17910 Henry has been very helpful in setting up all my Foscam Cameras. Great tech support! 
17911 Lost my charger while on vacation , got this because it came with a battery for my camera as a bonus. Works well and haven t had any issues so far (2 months). Battery doesn t last as long as oem but it does have the smart info. 
17912 A set of standard cold cathode tubes with all required hardware to mount in a computer. I use these for interior lighting in my car as well. 
17913 Easy set up instructions! Took me 10minutes to set up and that was mostly due to the fact that I forgot my home wifi password. The quality in picture both day and night vision are very clear! I am so happy with this purchase! 
17914 I ve enjoyed these filters immensely. They ve been a huge help on my sunset and landscape photography. 
17915 Just what I needed 
17916 Battery only hold half the charge time as an actual Sony Battery. Good for emergency backup but no way would I use this as a first line battery. Very disappointed.... 
17917 Good service and product. 
17918 Nice set. Works great.. I d get it again. 
17919 Great package - great camera - service was very responsive. 
17920 Not my favirate a replaced this one with a much better that also holds my wifi remote. 
17921 works great for easy close up shots and much cheaper then buying a macro lens just for a few fun shots 
17922 Excellent, Love it 
17923 It never worked even once, and the company refused to suggest a repair. 
17924 This is my first drone and I must say am truly enjoying this. 
17925 Work good didn t have any problem 
17926 Okay product 
17927 Love it and easy to use which is a must for me! 
17928 Good buy and it s light and nice 
17929 All in all it s ok. The pin in oddly rounded and makes for an ill fit for a lot of lights. The tensioners are plastic. 
17930 Works beautifully for the EF-S lenses whose focus rotates the lense, ruling out the use of a petal hood. Best features are the accordion collapsibility for wider angles or storage. Being rubber it does prevent the end of the lens from some knocks against walls and such. 
17931 Good 
17932 Very pleased so far with the package. I really like the adjustable screen position. 
17933 Great product. 
17934 Really expensive to use, but totally worth it 
17935 I was under the impression that they would have sand inside of them. Needed them for a last minute fashion photo shoot, but since they weren t full, they were useless to me. The quality seems decent though, but since they come without sand I think they should be cheaper. 
17936 Just what I needed for my GE X600 
17937 This is a lovely camera i m learning how to use it,other than that it takes beautiful pictures. And oh delivery was so quick 
17938 Awesome lens. Gives a much larger view with minor distortion. 
17939 Caution: Does not fit iPhone6 Plus. I had to modify it. 
17940 absolutely love my Polaroid! easy to use and small enough to carry around! although the Polaroid can easily get scuff marks on. the best way to use the Polaroid is by watching a video on how to use so every picture will come out great! 
17941 Great product. Very sharp display. I increased the saturation and contrast slightly, but very pleased. Initially had a problem, but realized I had a corrupted file, and as soon as I fixed that, it worked great. 
17942 works great 
17943 Really nice construction. Quality product. 
17944 This unit is priceless. Nice and compact and does the job. 
17945 these cameras need SOMETHING for bright sun. This helps, but I d rather have a viewfinder. Don t like that it uses adhesive, but can t think of another way to do it. 
17946 Excellent.. Super easy to install!!! 
17947 A great charger 
17948 Very powerful despite its size. 
17949 Great deal 
17950 This is a great size to put my camera. I could put a Sony a6000, Sony Carl Zeiss 16-70mm lens, and have enough room for storage with a Goal Zero charging stick. 
17951 Thank 
17952 AVOID, especially from this seller. Mine won t turn on and the seller won t take it back. Thanks for the $300 paper weight! 
17953 it would be nicer if it had some sort of timing feature 
17954 Great! I love it! 
17955 Great so far - does what it s supposed to at a great price and I haven t noticed anything awry so far... 
17956 I cannot tell if cases were &#34;used&#34; as they said because they look brand new! Highly recommended! 
17957 AWESOME 
17958 Worked well 
17959 Works perfectly with no degradation of quality. 
17960 product as expected, delivered on time 
17961 works perfect. Great fit and finish. 
17962 Very nice and high quality 
17963 For the price nice piece of gear. 
17964 Great Flashes at a Great Price.. 
17965 dont buy this it s trush work fine at the start few days later less then 1 week it not working it s junk 
17966 I use this with my Microsoft LifeCam and it works great!! Definitely worth the money!! 
17967 two months after installation the hard-drive stop working, can t get help from Zmodo, email only support. I do not recommend this system, poor quality and no service. 
17968 nice chair, works great 
17969 A great tool to take your pic s very well made. Thanks very much 
17970 perfect. easy. durable. 
17971 Very good and faster 
17972 Was very disappointed because the Coolpix came with only a user s manual written in Arabic and couldn t find instructions or manual online. 
17973 DO NOT BUY. Hard to install. Tech support is a joke. Returned. Do not buy. It s a POS. 
17974 I have not figured out how to get it to work TTL. Must be me, however I used to be in the camera business. This flash/camera combo has me perplexed. 
17975 Received when promised. Good quality product. Will be buying more. 
17976 This lens has been wonderful at teaching me about depth of field. I m still learning of course!! I love the look of my youtube videos when using it and the look of my photos. The price was excellent for me as a beginner. 
17977 worked as advertised. Full charge within a short time...replaced original. 
17978 This lens is what I expected it to be..It s well made and offers a more graduated transfer from ND to UV that most others don t offer... 
17979 Perfect for small trail cameras. 
17980 Great system and service!!! 
17981 The cameras are good but they are not wireless.Thats why I gave 3 starzs!!!If they were wireless I would give camera system 5 starzs.The setup is very easy... 
17982 You can t go wrong with these cases. They ll last a lifetime. 
17983 The Mount works perfectly. Sticks like glue to the windshield. 
17984 It was a good purchase 
17985 So far, these batteries appear to last as long as the original. Most important, the Panasonic FZ1000, for which these batteries were ordered, absolutely consumes battery power so quickly, a couple of extra batteries from DOT-01 are necessary! 
17986 versatile, compact, easy to use, excellent picture quality. 
17987 Really handy accessory for the point & shoot cameras. This is my 5th or 6th one (I keep giving them to folks who have not seen one before). 
17988 sturdy! 
17989 Used the batteries on my sony action cam and it works great. So much better than buying at the store for a lot more. 
17990 Hard to connect. Wish I sent it back before it was to late. 
17991 Snapped right into place on my Nikon D90. Same as original eye cup. 
17992 Awesome, loads of fun to fly. 
17993 Perfect for one big lens and one small lens 
17994 It s really light, easy to fold and unfold, sturdy, and all: the seating area, the size when folded and the height of the stool are just perfect for my husband and me (weight 240 lb.) I will buy another. 
17995 Could not get a response back from the supplier. The motion sensing does not work well at all. I would not recommend this product if motion sensing is what you want. Also apparently there is no support from the supplier so I suggest finding a different supplier too. 
17996 I bought this lens primarily to shoot high school football, and it does a fantastic job! Built like a tank, operates very smoothly, and has great optics. You can t beat the Canon L glass! 
17997 Slider works well. The screws for the feet were sized incorrectly. I replaced with my own screws, works fine! 
17998 Great value, good lense for close up/portrait 
17999 WILL NEVER WORK NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. A REAL PIECE OF GARBAGE. 
18000 These batteries are a screaming deal. I have the two pack plus the original for my K-3. I am pretty sure that they last longer than the stock battery that came with my camera. Don t hesitate to purchase these for whatever camera system you use. 
18001 Great product, no issue at all. 
18002 Changed the way I shoot iphone footage. Takes a little bit to get the hang of it but the difference between with and without are staggering. Can t wait to try it with my GoPro.. 
18003 AAA 
18004 My glasses broke after the second day. The ear piece dosent work and broke inside of the glasses. What do I do about this? 
18005 Exactly as posted. Thanks! 
18006 Absolutely, it came complete with battery-charger and cable. It would have cost me close to $50.00 to get these items on line from Panasonic. 
18007 like the way this ride on the side of the body... a true neck saver! 
18008 this works GREAT! I was shocked that it cost so little! Wish I had it sooner! 
18009 One of the best low budget cameras. Super cool pictures and the display is really awesome. Only thing is the delay while taking the snap which I don t worry about. Excellent 5 start. 
18010 Flishing is fine but does not include any len cap 
18011 Got this for my daughter, she loves it. Works as it should, 50 count, and shipping was fast! 
18012 I use these for both the Nikon Remote and for spare SDCards ! I use 2 of these one in each camera strap ! Very useful little item ! 
18013 Easy to install. take me for less 5 minutes to completed. The camera look good with the blinking red light. I love it, it perfect. Hopefully nobody messup my front yard. 
18014 Works well. I use it on my bicycle. It grip well and it adjusts well. 
18015 All good, no issues 
18016 This item could stay connected it would be awesome. as soon as it says the download is starting it disconnects and the download is canceled. currently it just hangs on my camera strap but it dosen t work. 
18017 I didn t realized it had no hard drive so I cannot record. 
18018 These come in really handy, because sometimes your oe battery will run down and as soon as it does you just pop one of these in and continue recording. 
18019 Love my camera just what I expected 
18020 Great product! 
18021 Just right and beautiful. I bought these lens protector filters alongside my canon 24mm -105mm lens. The quality is unbelievable and well built. I truly recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a good quality lens filter on a limited budget. 
18022 I love this thing. I can fit everything in there, except a mini tripod (gorillapod) and my larger RAM mount attachments/arms. Really nice to have everything in one package. 
18023 Ricahrd did a great job of helping me get this set up Great product and great price 
18024 Great product. Is working flawlessly. I only wish there was an option to turn off the in-mirror display. It is fine with it on, and doesn t really mess with your ability to use the mirror, just a personal preference. 
18025 It is everything that it said it was. Plenty of room for all of my daughters equiptment 
18026 great camera, great value 
18027 Fits the camera well. All buttons can be used while in the case. 
18028 Very good product 
18029 Does not work with the GoPro which i bought it for but it does work OK with my Nikon 
18030 great solver for battery = ) 
18031 Great 
18032 liked very much 
18033 As advertised. 
18034 Excellent quality /price ratio 
18035 Now he has a second battery and can keep shooting. 
18036 For the price this is really great. I needed it so I could get family portrait shots and I have used it a bunch of times successfully. It is WAY cheaper than other ones. 
18037 Incredibly solid and sturdy unit comparable to ones costing significantly more. Very good adjustment features. Holds an 80mm Kowa spotting scope at various heights and positions without a problem. A great buy at twice this price. 
18038 This is great way to use my camera now I can connect to my computer in the field without wires running everywhere. 
18039 I was expecting the body to made of metal like other cameras I have that were like it 
18040 Its the perfect accessory to protect your lense. A must if you own this camera. 
18041 Poor product. Easily comes off strap, does not hold cap well. I threw it away. No way to fix it except design a totally new product. 
18042 I got this for my granddaughter s 14th birthday and she just loves it. She told me it takes great pictures. I highly recommend this camera plus you can t beat the since it includes so much more than just the camera. 
18043 Bought extra cameras to synch in with a previous purchased unit. Works great! 
18044 Good product. Holds GoPro really good. 
18045 If you are looking for a floating handle...do not buy this as it definitely does not float!! 
18046 Works fine in our Olympus Pen PL-7. 
18047 These battery replacements were just ok, for me. I have found them to lose their charge more quickly than my 2 year old original Nikon battery. 
18048 Not the easiest to use but takes quality photos. 
18049 Excellent piece of kit, I was looking for a decent frame mount so the head strap was a bonus. 
18050 Great camera 
18051 Too much noise. 
18052 Great little kit for my Nikon D3100. Nice quality filters and accessories. I have purchased from this company before because they have good products. Super fast delivery too. 
18053 Perfect, exactly what I needed. The cover is cardboard with a thick plastic slip over it. The inside pockets do not stick to photos thank goodness!! 
18054 Great product 
18055 Whenever I purchase a camera the first thing I do is attach a clear filter for lens protection. B+W is the best out there on the market. Their quality control is stellar. 
18056 Great Product. works well. 
18057 I purchased two of them and they both ran *extremely* hot. Hot enough that you couldn t even touch it for more than a few seconds. 
18058 Perfect for GoPro. Same quality as name brand. 
18059 I Love them. 
18060 Product is exactly as the same as described, easy installation, good quality video pictures and a must-have for home security!!! 
18061 Good 
18062 Made in the Japan!!! This product came all the way from Japan and it is the perfect fit for my camera!!! 
18063 i like it ! 
18064 Worked as expected. Very fast charging 
18065 Installed it on my PVS-14, works great for the money 
18066 This Canon EF 28mm F/1.8 Wide Angle Lens has made such an improvement in my photography. Now I am getting more wide range images especially with mountain landscape shots. I am very pleased with the product. Canon is a favored product at my house. Highly recommend both! 
18067 While the image quality is excellent, the audio quality is really poor. 
18068 Only one battery was any good and tripod broke on first use. The other battery was swelled and would not fit in camera. Lenses work great though. 
18069 Can not claim to have a lot of experience withthe camera yet, but ran out of battery firt time using it...-yes it was fully charged, and yes you can buy extra battery capacity, but this should be standard. 
18070 Great unit for the GoPro - I attached it and forgot about it. 
18071 Happy with gift 
18072 Everything is OK. Good quality product as described in the announcement. Thank you! 
18073 Nice pack. A touch short for a D810 with an 80-40-- but its manageable. 
18074 It is such a cute and functional little bag. I just adore it! 
18075 I bought this for my daughter and it never worked. 
18076 Works in my camera just fine. Priced right! 
18077 Works great; It is delicate however. If you are a &#34;masher&#34;... well you know...buy a kodak 
18078 it is written on the box, IP Camera &#34;Internet Security Camera&#34; and it only works in the same network. That s a joke! 
18079 Lots of storage areas, hold camera and lenses tight and secure. Plenty of room for additional equipment. 
18080 These cables worked fine. Connectors matched. Video and power seems to both be good over the cable. 
18081 This is big enough to hold my camera and all my accessories safely. I love it. 
18082 Provides quick convenient protection against bumps, scrapes, condensation and dust when carrying a camera outdoors in cold windy situations or when my camera is thrown into a loose bag or back pak. 
18083 Woks very nicely to steady hi power binoculars. 
18084 Excellent product. Light and easy to carry and very useful 
18085 Arrived on time and as described 
18086 Fit and finish: good to excellent. Battery tray sometimes unclips from the charger, but appears to be quite robust. Gets a little warm for my liking, but not as warm as the supplied charger for my iPhone. Quite happy with the purchase. 
18087 Works better than described. Lights everything amazingly. 
18088 Good picture. Fairly easy to set up. 
18089 fits perfect works well 
18090 excellent, met my expectations! 
18091 The setup was some what of a pain to get online with my secured router. I have been using it for months now and it shows great reliability and app works great. Great purchase for the money! 
18092 It fits but falls easy when underwater 
18093 Nice camera add-on, but extremely difficult to remove from the camera once attached. 
18094 Looks like a photo on smooth material, pretty heavy duty. 
18095 great transaction. Product as described 
18096 Works great. 
18097 This camera is awesome! Takes the best pictures and it s simple to use. 
18098 perfect little lens. 
18099 It has solved my main purpose of connecting my lense with the desired body. Only due to it s inability to connect with the circuit of the body, many functions like Focus Point, AF etc are not working. But you can use it if you are expert in manual functions. 
18100 what I wanted 
18101 Great camera 
18102 What an amazing camera 
18103 works like it should 
18104 I love it! 
18105 Just what I was looking for. Much easier then the earlier versions. Definitely more cost effective since it came standard with the LCD display. 
18106 Superfast shipping. I love the camera. 
18107 Works great. Would not stay submerged on it s own and did not allow a drop of water into the case. 
18108 From the description I was expecting two. This isn t worth the price for only one. 
18109 excellent product. 
18110 Great lens. Awesome upgrade from the 18-55 Nikon lens. Very impressed with the colours and quality. 
18111 Great product 
18112 Good and fast shippinging 
18113 Works great.. 
18114 It s a good filter. I did have to clean it as there was some sort of film all over the lens when it arrived. Luckily it leaned up well. 
18115 It does what it has to do. So far it have endured cold weather and a lot of adventure. 
18116 Poor picture quality, slow 
18117 This floaty is awesome!! Make sure you do not use a selfie stick with it because it will sink, otherwise it worked great in the water! 
18118 Perfect fit for my Sony DSCHX90V/B! 
18119 Easy to hook up. Great quality picture. 
18120 Just as shown 
18121 very good. keeping the smudges out of my camera lens 
18122 It is great for the things I want to use it for thank you 
18123 great product 
18124 Terrible, Go Pro hit the water and the Velcro separated.........Go Pro is now at the bottom of the lake!! 
18125 Used this wakeboarding, hiking, snowboarding, and around the neighborhood. Great length, I really don t need more than the 40&#34; extension. Vey sturdy, no flex in the pole when it s fully extended. 
18126 No issues with the camera however it is not supported by Hikvision USA since it is not North American version. Called them for support on their NVR and they refused to help once they saw where the cameras were from.... 
18127 Excellent 
18128 great! 
18129 ONLY LAST CHARGE FOR 2 MONTHS JUNK. AND WILL NOT KEEP A CHARGE. I GOT A NEW BRAND 
18130 bad 
18131 not user friendly 
18132 Ended up not needing this order. But it was exactly what I would have needed. 
18133 I never knew i needed to measure light, but damn my photos have improved dramatically, post production time has been cut in half. Overall works well, but the build quality is a bit flimsy for the price. 
18134 Not worth spending money for this seller or product company. Its totally a garbage item lying in my house .And its of no use 
18135 The fit is fine. I have yet to use them, you will be bugged for a review every few days until you fill one out. 
18136 It fit on my Nikon J1 camera easily! It comes packaged in small transparent bag that easily opens without ripping. 
18137 Works well the the camera where some extension needed 
18138 Great items to have. 
18139 some reason it becomes hard to connect to other than thru android 
18140 Product failed after about 3 months of VERY LIGHT use 
18141 not an electronically robust product. Unable to return to seller since it s past 30days 
18142 After just a few shoots - it started to smoke. Faulty capacitors overheated and melted. A FIRE HAZZARD 
18143 DO NOT BUY 
18144 I used for 3 years now and still going strong! 
18145 A set of 4 lenses that can be stacked to achieve some amazing macro results. The set is compact and carries easily in the case which is included. 
18146 Does exactly what it is supposed to. Highly recommended. 
18147 Excellent bag; roomy, sturdy enough to pack camera, lenses, and overnight gear. 
18148 Good quality, great price 
18149 this quad is my second best of 11 quads that I have 
18150 Great frame, very easy to use and setup 
18151 Arrive on time. In good condition. Working as should with camera. Very please. 
18152 lens hood was just as stated perfect fit no problems. 
18153 The mount that came with it was not the one pictured. It isn t the mount I wanted or was expecting. The mount that I received is for a bike not a shotgun. 
18154 good battery 
18155 Love this film! 
18156 These are amazing. Big capacity and long life. So worth the money and I highly recommend this item. 
18157 I use it all the time, no problems. 
18158 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
18159 This is a little bit hard. 
18160 Added an extra one of these transceivers to my kit that came with the controller. It works great with Canon and Yongnuo flash units. No issues so far. 
18161 Love this drone! 
18162 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. 
18163 One of the zipper-pulls on the main compartment of the bag snapped the first time I used it. The bag appeared to be functional and well-built apart from the zipper issue. It does have a nice rain cover and comfortable straps, but because of the zipper issue, I returned it. 
18164 The worst assembly instructions ever. They should try out one together using their instructions - not possible. The instructions are flat in wrong order and confusing. 
18165 Really good item 
18166 I feel like a professional. 
18167 Don t bother. Don t know what I expected for the money. Fish eye is exactly that everything looks barreled, the other lens combination does absolutely nothing. Very strange. Packaging was probably worth more than the lens. 
18168 Just wanted to say that this thing is awesome 
18169 These cameras are great. 
18170 THEY LAST SO LONG!! 
18171 High Quality and great price! 
18172 Tried it once received & it s very good. The packing is also very good. 
18173 This stand works great. I used it with a muslin backdrop for the first time yesterday. Although the poles were labeled with the wrong letters it was pretty easy to assemble. 
18174 Doesn t work with Sony Nex 5 LT as description said. Waste of money 
18175 Bought 2 of these. As long as your router can keep up, these cameras are awesome. Setup was so simple! 
18176 battery is good 
18177 Awesome !!!!!!! 
18178 Okay 
18179 it was ok 
18180 Case is awesome but I m missing the padding that was suppose to come with it 
18181 Works without a problem. 
18182 it works. 
18183 Very Nice 
18184 While these items are not the quality of OEM lens caps, they are very good quality and given the price the value is amazing. I am completely pleased with the product and would definitely buy again -- and definitely before buys an over-priced OEM product. Great job guys! 
18185 well-crafted 
18186 Pretty good 
18187 Nice size. Good quality. Easy to use. 
18188 Arrived super fast and fit perfectly. 
18189 Awesome lens... but you already know this. 
18190 clamps work wonderfully used to hold photo backdrop tight 
18191 Price vs quality and performance I haven t seen a better PoE camera 
18192 Nice product. very water proof. Does interfere with the auto focus a little 
18193 Lots of pieces for a good price. My only grievance is that there was no instructions. The pieces should have a least been labeled. 
18194 It s a good switch for automating on/off. Just make sure you have access to the RadioRA 2 software beforehand. 
18195 Don t know how I lived without it. 
18196 way too small for canon t2i 
18197 Awful. Won t fit in my T3i. 
18198 Great deal!!! 
18199 There were only the barest of instructions included with the camera. To learn how to operate it, you must download an 85 page instruction book. I find that very inconvenient. 
18200 it was OK 
18201 If summed up in one word, it is a short board camera. I the deepest impression of it is his top focus system, the menu focusing system option is only up to a lot of pages, for its predecessors, is definitely a big improvement corners. 
18202 Yup just buy it you won t regret it 
18203 Water gets stuck inside and takes forever to get it out. One more downside is the camera cannot be tilted 180° (upside down). 
18204 it s very good. the condition of the product is good. there is no scatch and no used. 
18205 Battery works just as my real canon battery! Love it and great charge. 
18206 love it 
18207 Works great......thanks 
18208 LOVE this. My camera charger access quit working and now I can recharge the batteries with NO trouble! Got a spare battery to keep on hand, too. Love my camera and didn t want to replace it. 
18209 Love these backdrops. Lot of fun to use. 
18210 It works perfectly, straps around my wrist comfortably was great for vacationing, water sports, stays on tight - drys out fast. Well made and makes the go pro easy to find in mucky waters of for any reason it ever fell off. Very happy I got this 
18211 great deal, we use the camera all the time, saves jacking around with a cell phone, pix are exceptional, camera easy to use. 
18212 Up close pictures are kind of fuzzy. 
18213 not work well. lost my gopro.a big loss. not good shopping exprience 
18214 Love this! Will use with the umbrella light kit for photo booth. Will order another one soon. 
18215 Brilliant little well stocked kit, I might recommend picking up the cleaning solution if only to save on another order. But i ve already made great use of the pieces in this kit. 
18216 Handy. Compact. My new traveling tripod! Thanks! 
18217 Works well as a relatively affordably little light modifying system but I definitely don t think it s up to commercial lighting standards. For me it just works well for impromptu events/gatherings. Good bonus is that it is portable. 
18218 No comments 
18219 VERY nice camera bag!!! 
18220 Our Studio is 100% manfrotto and these plates are a new addition that work so well! Wether you have the traditional 577 plate or the new &#34;long ones,&#34; this will integrate into your system perfectly. 
18221 Simple, rapido, buen servicio, y excelentes tutorias. simple, fast, good service, and excellent tutorials. 
18222 The batteries work well and the charger is a small size - good for travel. Just remember to push the battery to the right to remove it form the charger. 
18223 Better than the part it was bought to replace 
18224 I love it 
18225 Works fine as long as I have a 37mm lens on the camera. Which is the lens I use most. 
18226 Very good 
18227 Doesn t shoot well in low light, but you get what you pay for. 
18228 Good value for product bundle versus price. Batteries work well. 
18229 Does not work for the Sony A-6000 camera (doesn t physically insert into the Sony). Unfair to give it a low rating for that, since they don t claim it will, but the compatible list has several Sony cameras they I thought were similar. Dummy me. 
18230 I received this camera yesterday. I have not been able to set it up. The directions stink, the video gives the same info as the instruction book if not less. My Galaxy wont pick up the camera. Cant seem to find a phone number to call for assistance. Not happy. 
18231 These work so well and they are perfect. I am new to photography and these are much less than the Canon brand. 
18232 It s ok I was expecting the whole thing lit up 
18233 I love it. 
18234 I put this on a model rocket and the videos it has captured are great! 
18235 Comes with every accessory and has a great video quality, I use it mainly for offroading and shooting competitions and it works perfect, the belt clip accessory clips perfectly to the strap of a hat for a perfect first person point of view 
18236 works wee. 
18237 Just a cable - works fine.. No issues 
18238 Love the camera. This is my first deviation from the point and shoot. Great deal for the money. Everything is in excellent condition. 
18239 This was a gift for my daughter. It was shipped in a timely manner and at a great price. Everything was as described. She has loved it. 
18240 works fine with my Nikon Coolpix S01. 
18241 Genuine Canon LP-E6N Battery. I don t trust cheap third party batteries for my 5d Mark III camera. One star off because its Made In China.. 
18242 Excellent equipment for a great price! 
18243 This is the second one of these I purchased. It is very well made, and I love the bag, but geez, I wish it were a bit larger to carry all of the accessories todays cameras come with --- and the reason for the 4 star rating. 
18244 Very good 
18245 Excellent tripod. High quality. Shipped very fast. Highly recommended 
18246 Fast delivery, items as advertised 
18247 [[VIDEOID:58d2b7f2a34eb0053781a1de8164886d]]Great camera for the money. 
18248 Best extended battery than the gopro one. 
18249 Love this camera, nice image, really easy to use App, easy installation. 
18250 once installed works like a charm 
18251 A great case and does exactly what I need it to do. My only complaint is for the SD cards the slots are a bit loose and I have to be careful when opening it. 
18252 Fits perfectly. 
18253 It s more bulky than I thought it would be. It s really for full-size DSLR, so if you have Sony NEX lines, don t get this. 
18254 Fit camera nicely, A little snug which made it slightly difficult to release. 
18255 Works Great! Easy to assemble and disassemble, sturdy, and adjusts easily. Having the quick release is very handy, though I ve had tripods that are quicker, this one seems to stay still better. Overall worth it. Oh, and it come with a bag! 
18256 It worked out really well, I needed something to hold plans for an airplane I m building and it held every page in a well protected plastic sleeve with plenty of additional sheets for Engineering Changes, notes etc. would definitely recommend. 
18257 excellent 
18258 Needed a back up battery for my canon and so I order this. It came in a in the mail fast and works perfectly! 
18259 It helped. Bright reflections around water. I understand that is a big test. 
18260 Fit perfectly on my D800 and much clearer than the original. Recently opened my camera bag and found the protector damaged badly. Took it out and suprisantly found my camera screen still in tact, not a scratch. Buying another one to replace right now. Highly recommended. 
18261 Good value and works very well. 
18262 great product. GOPro works well with this 
18263 I use this with my Canon 1.8 50mm prime and it works great.. it s obviously not going to be as good a legit macro lens, however it s fantastic when you consider the abilities this $20 metal tube. Would recommend. 
18264 A TOTAL RIPOFF! Batteries will not haold a charge. Cannot get 10 pictures per charge. 
18265 A great little camera for the money. Bought it as refurbished, but looks and works like new. Canon makes a great camera. 
18266 It worked as advertised and the price was very good. 
18267 This works perfectly with my Phantom 2 that I have Fatshark goggles installed on. It is nice to have another monitor for other people to watch or sometimes it is just easier to fly without the FPV goggles. 
18268 Works great thks! 
18269 just what the Doctor ordered 
18270 A gift for my son, he says it is great... 
18271 Didn t have all the film !!! 
18272 good 
18273 Works well. 
18274 I received a tripod with a defective ball head (it won t stay in place). Over the course of months I tried to contact Manfrotto so it could be replaced, but got no answer whatsoever. Shame on Manfrotto. 
18275 My husband loves his watch but has tucked it away to use on special occasions which I find a bit strange, but I know he is really pleased with it. 
18276 I have not had the opportunity to use it to the full extent as of yet, because of my work schedule, but the little time that i have had to play with it I love the small economy size of the camera, and it came with every item as advertised. 
18277 This system works well for us as we travel a lot and can watch our home. 
18278 Great little quadcopter, perfect for learning. Do buy teh blade protectors for it. 
18279 Fast delivered, very nice! 
18280 Works Great 
18281 I am in love with this product. Works really great on my Nikon d3200. Absolutely recommend this product for others. 
18282 I didn t purchase this on amazon but through a local store but I have to say that it takes absolutely gorgeous photos. Really amazing and manually focusing with the A7 cameras is a breeze. Highly recommended. 
18283 So far Loving it 
18284 great 
18285 Works great! 
18286 Works great! 
18287 I m not happy with this product, is really bad, I d never recommend. 
18288 Great compact size camera, i have a canon 60D and it fits fine with a standard lens. 
18289 Love it, but the battery life is under 30 seconds. I think there is an issue and I m not sure who to contact. Could you contact us? 
18290 I received Different camera that I bough t and I Lost money 
18291 Very good 
18292 This has helped me from straining my voice from yelling across the house. It s my voice saver. :) 
18293 Worked great no issues 
18294 Works fine, no problems. 
18295 Super easy to put on my D3200. Looks GREAT, and makes the camera easier to grip/hold on to. I have had lots of complements on it. LOVE IT!!! 
18296 The motion notifications is amazing. I m able to cut pieces of videos I want and share it with my family. I truly recommend nest cam. I also have the thermostat and is awesome. 
18297 this paper is so fun, and now it s so cheap! 
18298 Very nice case with lots of adjustable compartments for an additional lens, extra batteries, etc. I would recommend this case to a friend. 
18299 Awesome! 
18300 Very impressed. Need to see the You Tube video for installation. Takes about 10 minutes to install. Watch the video. 
18301 Great insert if you have a bag large enough. 
18302 I felt like it was hard to good a good angle.. Complicated and failed when I needed it to work. 
18303 cool 
18304 Perfect for handgun storage. I own a dozen Pelican cases of different sizes for storing everything from handguns to a high end camera. Foam is pick snd pluck for a perfect fit. Sturdy, water and dust proof. Also TSA compliant for airline travel. 
18305 Worked like a champ did have problems with led but you can turn sensitivity down and back up light will go out. I m guessing the bad reviews were given by people using to fast a shutter or to slow a lens. 
18306 Good for priceG 
18307 Excellent quality photos and easy to use! We had a Canon similar to this for the last 8 years and it just now started using a lot of batteries. Love the zoom and other features! Great color too ;) Will always stick with Canon! 
18308 Great...Worked out very well for filming parent children interactions 
18309 Fits and works like the original, but at a lower cost. Great deal 
18310 Great protection for the camera. It has got a nice little side pouch to stuff in any extra cables, etc. There is also an extra side zipper where i stock extra batteries and sd cards. 
18311 Perfectly convenient and durable bag to carry my new camera in that has a nice shoulder strap making it easy and safe to carry. 
18312 Good price 
18313 Not bad 
18314 Definitely met our expectations! Very nice! 
18315 enjoying 
18316 This bag is perfect for my camera. Durable, quality construction. highly recommended. 
18317 A neat gadget for anyone with a smart phone that enjoys photography. It is nice to have a few more options to the iPhone s camera. 
18318 It works great with my new camera! 
18319 Perfect for my camera. 
18320 Couldn t ever figure out how to set up 
18321 Good 
18322 Charged up easily, held charge, and WORKS! 
18323 Quality of pictures was not good. Customer service explained that they might not be compatible with existing analog DVR. He gladly set up a return which I did do. 
18324 Great camera and kit for the price! 
18325 I bought this case for my husband for his GoPro for our anniversary and I am so glad that I did. It s extremely heavy duty and fits everything including accessories very well. 
18326 I love this little camera, so great to check on my property from 3000 miles away. The images are good enough to identify a person s face at a good distance. Totally worth the price. I got this as a gift. 
18327 These batteries work well and hold their charge. 
18328 Great set to have!!! 
18329 Good product. Good service. 
18330 Worked fine. 
18331 They work awesome, I will recomended this product to everybody. 
18332 nice quality 
18333 It works fine but the bucle is quite fragile, must close it with care:-) 
18334 good product prompt shipment 
18335 Works great. I even dropped it shortly after buying it and only a tiny piece chipped off. Wonderful product for the price and greatly extends battery life. I leave it on 24/7 and hardly ever worry about not having enough juice. 
18336 great does all the cameras with the one plugin 
18337 Lost the one that came with the camera. This worked like a charm and at a great price. 
18338 Very happy with this purchase. Prompt shipping and everything arrived as expected. 
18339 Came neatly packaged in its box with directions! :) 
18340 Works as intended with my vk750ii speedlight. I like that it uses AAA batteries vs hard to find batteries like the altura flash. Two step remote button for focus then capture is a great addition! 
18341 Returned this item. No directions as to how to put it together. Did not seem to be flexible enough to move and catch the light in a timely manner. I just use the reflectors by hand now. 
18342 Got the charger quickly, without a problem. Charged up our extra batteries and it works fine! 
18343 Great tripod for the the price. I am in no way a professional photagrapher but you can tell this is a high quality product. 
18344 Perfect little container with premade slots for my basic GoPro equipment. 
18345 Works great. The first time I have used a light meter, but in unusual lighting situations it has worked out very well. Why did I wait so long to get one of these? 
18346 This camera is amazing just what I was looking for. 
18347 fast delivery and good product, works great thanks 
18348 Works great. I bought the D3200 Nikon Book for Dummies which helped a lot with initial use. You need to take the time to learn all the features available. The perfect camera for my needs. 
18349 This selfie stick gets tons of use! A perfect holster for the Gopro Hero 4. 
18350 Very nice. Takes great photos. Just what I needed. Not a blurred photo since I got this camera. 
18351 Looks more powerful than it is. I might as well used a small pair of binoculars. It was a birthday gift so I don t want to be to critical... 
18352 what an excellent product .leave your premises with no worries and best of all no cables. 
18353 Good protection for the camera. Great Product. 
18354 I just started taking photos with my camera, and this has made a huge difference in the quality of my photos, especially outdoors. I highly recommend! 
18355 Good price. I will buy these again. Got them when they said I would 
18356 Great size if only 1 camera and couple lenses. 
18357 Not recommended for mounting accessories to your camera rig, since they seem to wobble even when torqued down tightly. 
18358 good battery 
18359 I have a few old Canon 40D cameras that were in need of new batteries. This package deal of 2 BP-511A batteries plus charger fit the bill perfectly and the price was very reasonable. Very happy with the purchase. 
18360 This tripod is very good, it is lightweight which makes traveling easy while being sturdy considering its weight. But most important of all the tripod has great stability and captures good videos for vlogging and pictures for memories. 
18361 Delivered on time. Great price. Works great. 
18362 Easy to use and the zoom power is great 
18363 Just what I needed to keep my Canon lenses and sensor clean, at a good price 
18364 Lens seemed to get a little foggy, but easily wipes off. 
18365 Not what I expected. 
18366 WiFi is weak and not friendly. Reverted to an Eye-Fi card. Good price. 
18367 This bag is perfect for travel and allows me the versatility of packing not only all my camera equipment and computer, but also other small things I need from my purse so that it is not necessary for me to carry a purse any longer. 
18368 This is great. It keeps me from backing in the garage too far. 
18369 A little bit of learning curve but truly great resolution and ease of use! 
18370 Good camera for the price. If you want to have a high quality camera for vacation, causal shooting and etc, this is perfect. But if you aim for more professional shooting, this is not enough 
18371 good sttuff 
18372 OK. What was sold was an older version.than current new. So far so good. Wish it had a a zoom! 
18373 batteries came charged and lasted a good amount of time 
18374 As Tina Turner says &#34;simply the best!&#34; 
18375 Loved the binoculars , but they were toast after dropping them ONE TIME. I baby all of my gear, but come on... You re outdoors and things happen. If your product is shoddy enough to break after one little drop, I ll look elsewhere. 
18376 Works great. 
18377 Love this bag!!! Very cute and roomy too! The material feels nice as well 
18378 Great price. 
18379 Good product, but NO MANUAL. Be careful. Frustrating to install but once it s done, it works very well. Until now, I don t know how to create multiple PIN and delete existing.. 
18380 Why can t you at least provide 1 hour of video history for free? I don t need or want 7 days of video. All I need to see what just happened a few minutes ago. 
18381 Good entry level mount system. Works great on road; but allows camera wobble when off road. I have since gone to a metal mount with a rigid clamp system. 
18382 While adjusting the angle gently, it broke. I super-glued it back together but now it s at an odd angle and looks fake. If it wasn t broken it would look okay for the price. 
18383 Fast delivery and pretty quick charge. Great product, as stated. Haven t used it besides charging cause I bought them to replace the one I lost due to really not using the camera. We will see how well they hold a charge this weekend in Disneyworld :-) 
18384 I lost my camera 
18385 Good product and transaction. 
18386 Excellent product, price and delivery 
18387 It s great 😍 
18388 Cheap, and work like a charm 
18389 Excellent product, fits and protect the camera (nikon 5200) and all my gear perfect 
18390 This camera has nice zoom range and video capability but the picture quality is only average. 
18391 it sucks 
18392 Hard to adjust and kind of looks stupid in your head. It works, but I immediately started looking for other methods. 
18393 It was perfect. After all it is just a lens cap. 
18394 Just what I was looking for to be able to attach a small microphone to the side for better voice clarity. Fits perfectly into the tripod as well. Good choice. 
18395 Works perfectly! 
18396 Excellent 
18397 IT S WHAT I SPECTED. GOOD! 
18398 Ended up returning this item as it did not correctly describe that it does not support continuous streaming. 
18399 Stand is worth the money. Stable & ridged. adjustments work and it folds up small. 
18400 Not the highest quality picture but gets the job done. Close up range is rather narrow. Looks like winter all year long. Everything green is white. 
18401 Great little camera. Has the features and then some. Easy to allow your creative side to come forward. 
18402 Great case except could use a little more room for batteries and charges so it could be a complete kit 
18403 Purchased this for a backup for a wedding. Works great. 
18404 I didn t expect it for a week and it came 2 days later. Awesome!!!! Love it. Keep up the good work!!! 
18405 Video is ok, set up is rather easy although not well explained, especially for iOS. However, both my Foscam monitors clicks very loudly throughout day and night, waking up my kids every single night. Both my monitors are now in the attic collecting dusts. 
18406 This is exactly what I needed for my camera. The product was on time and worked perfectly. I need a backup battery for my Nikon Prosumer camera and will by from this seller. 
18407 Still learning how to use it, so far it s been a great tool 
18408 Love this camera so far!! Am learning to shoot in manual mode to get even sharper images!!! Only wish it had a view finder!!!! 
18409 Great product!!!! Incredible at evening out light.... Great for on the go photographers. 
18410 All went well with the purchase 
18411 Took these as backups on several trips and they worked flawlessly. They seem to get a bit less charge than the oem Sony battery, but definitely worth it considering the price difference. Used in a Sony RX100 m2 camera. 
18412 Excellent fit for my 7D MKii Great! 
18413 The worst matte box ever !!! Don t waste your money and you time !!! 
18414 Works great - light is bright, and close up picture (macro lens) is great. 
18415 It took me a little patience to put the hood and lens cover on with the filter already on. I first thought it wouldn t fit and then just &#34;relaxed&#34; and tried again! I like having the different filters and the case as well. 
18416 Works as expected, very sturdy and doesn t slide around, attaches well to the camera. The product was shipped and delivered surprisingly quickly. All around very happy with the product and order. 
18417 Do not like it 
18418 Nice quality product. Excellent price! Delivered on time. 
18419 I m not a camera person...not what I expected... 
18420 very good 
18421 This is a good bag, and is a very good size. I just wish there were more padding included to make it a bit more stiff. 
18422 Very durable, nice camera bag. It gets a little tight when packing more than one lens, but mostly fits what I need. It looks nice and I feel my camera is protected. 
18423 Really Nice Case 
18424 Awesome camera, great features easy operation. 
18425 In fact it was not a good buy. The product has good resistance, but unfortunately my shaft with the cake support bar, which causes the two wheels never touch the ground. Also bad finish of the wheels that generate some shaky movements. 
18426 Cleans better then expected. I got it for my ASUSZ T200 and it cleaned my wife s ipad better then her cloth. 
18427 Happy with product. 
18428 The app for the phone sucks I have HTC m8 I can download the videos and pictures but I when I watch the videos no sound 
18429 Love some pieces but the tripod stand is not sturdy, gave it to the kids to play. Many pieces missing in the package too. Not happy, will not recommend it. 
18430 1st pair I purchased worked ok for several months until it stopped synching properly. The new pair never synched properly and I was not able to return it because my first photo shoot was after the return period. Very disappointed. 
18431 I just unpacked and assemble and I m very happy with it. The seller shipped it quickly, it was double boxed and arrived in excellent shape, even all of the light bulbs worked. The quality is very good. I would buy from this seller again! 
18432 Great camera. Use it while boating, camping. Fine photos and meets all my expectations. 
18433 Good Quality. It came with Nikon D3100 bundle. So nice to have this once if you buy bundle. Personally I don t use it often though. But yeah sometime you required this. If you are not buying any other lens 18mm-55mm and 55-200mm will work great for beginners. 
18434 Not as flexible as i was hoping, but it s very sturdy. 
18435 Not bad. 
18436 Great. The perfect cost effective solution to water fun with my coolpix. 
18437 Really nice strap. Works just as your expect. I almost bought one of the Black Rapids straps, but this one is higher quality and more attractive. Looks damn sharp 
18438 Excellent product ! Thoroughly recommend - super for glasses ! 
18439 I AM SURE I WILL LIKE IT, IF I CAN EVER PURCHASE ONE. HAS BEEN ON BACK-ORDER AND MAY NOT BE AVAIL. FOR ANOTHER MONTH. 
18440 I purchased this item for my 13 year old granddaughter. She likes it, but has not used it enough to offer meaningful feedback. Delivery was prompt. I was surprised it was delivered on Sunday. 
18441 Fits perfectly and easy to hold onto. looking forward to using it in Hawaii! 
18442 Work good and last a long time on a full charge 
18443 Excellent. More than I expected. It has so many functions that you may not have to use the retouching programs. The Zoom is awesome !! 
18444 SO COOL 
18445 Great product! 
18446 Nice device. Clear and compact enough to carry easy. 
18447 Excellent walking stick with camera mounting at good price. 
18448 The system is great. Simple to install and makes you feel safer. 
18449 nice little camera 
18450 Great grab n go back for your DSLR, and a few lenses and accessories. 
18451 Even it is not perfect goods,but still has all the key features a security camera needs. 
18452 Great for cleaning eyeglasses and small screens 
18453 They can be easily stored in your pocket for that on the go cleaning 
18454 I got one and then bought one for my wife. They are a simple point and shoot that does a good job of taking photos. 
18455 Handy 
18456 Charger works great! I like the fact that you can charge you batteries AC/DC. Batteries not so good! 
18457 Waste of money. Save you dollars and by a good macro lens 
18458 Once installed, I was able to increase my original GPS from 4 satellites to 9 and fly safely. 
18459 Perfect fit. Same as the ones that came with drone 
18460 Great everyday lens, need the hood to prevent glare thought 
18461 nice 
18462 Great camera still learning how to use it properly 
18463 great Companion to my Pentax K-50 
18464 These are like some smaller ones I bought for eye glasses except much larger and a better value. They are great for large screens or any surface I do not want to scratch. They are one of the best I ve ever used. 
18465 Very nice night vision picture quality for the price. 
18466 Perfect replacement unit for my aging ADEMCO - Drop in replacement, didn t have to program a thing. 
18467 I have already used a few of these packs and just started on the shiny stars pack! All the film works great and I love love the themes! I def recommend this pack as it was also such an awesome deal!! I use this with my Instax 8 
18468 The battery last a long time. Simple to use and to download. They produce surprisingly clear video.exceeds my expectation. 
18469 Perfect 
18470 Battery last for very long time and quickly charges. The power of this Flash is far more than I expected. Time between firing the flash is very short, leap change compared to Canon 430 EX II Flash 
18471 Fast shipping, just as expected! Thanks! 
18472 good quality product. I ll buy it again. 
18473 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! Easely fit a 24-70 2.8L ii 
18474 Brought two as gifts but you get what you paid for. The power adapter gets &#34;hot&#34;, not warm but hot. The unit would restart for no reason. The speakers are low end. Would not purchase this again. 
18475 to big and complicated to use 
18476 Camera case is very nice and my camera fits nicely into it. It has good padding and places for batteries. I didn t want something too big. Perfect. 
18477 Worked as expected. 
18478 Great plan 
18479 Followed directions, plugged in, little spark, died. 
18480 good quality 
18481 very shaky if attached to moving position. 
18482 cheap 
18483 Great lens to be used with Canon DSLR cameras. I hated to purchase the Canon brand lens for so much more, when I only use this lens as a hobby. Great zoom lens for a good price. 
18484 Works perfectly, fits perfectly, highly recommended !! 
18485 Works great Wish they offered a round version for people with glasses 
18486 Great Camera. Got it to send pictures with the Wi-Fi. Works great. Easy to use. A+ 
18487 It is good to have it, but hard to use it, 
18488 Excellent multi section monopod. Reduces to just over 15 in to easily fit in small suite cast. Easy to extend sections quickly. Strong when it is extended. Light weight. 
18489 Love this zoom lense. You just need to make sure you have a way to stabilize it for. 
18490 It works great 
18491 Broke after a month of use. 
18492 Works but it came in a case far to large for a 58mm filter. Also the case had a large crack going down the front of it. 
18493 Great 
18494 No problems 
18495 re-furbished- so was not sure about the quality. met my expectations. thanks 
18496 There are many times I want my binoculars but its just not easy to lug around my full sized set. These are serious binoculars with good optics, weight, and feel. As with all Vortex they carry a no hassle lifetime replacement 
18497 The charger was fast and the batteries held their charge. The entire set was great for my trip to the Caribbean. 
18498 pictures were blurry and underdeveloped 
18499 Great little machine. The company is having growing pains in the customer service area, but the device is first rate. 
18500 Very Good Product 
18501 You can only replay video that was recently recorded using your mobile device. When going back a day or two it takes a very long time if at all. The image and sound is delayed. Not worth $10 a month in my opinion. 
18502 The best lens on the planet! Dont settle for anything else..., 
18503 No support. 
18504 All lenses should be protected with this inexpensive &#34;insurance&#34;. Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
18505 My toddler pulled Grandma s Nikon D50 off the kitchen table and broke the bayonet ring on the lens. Rather than buying a new lens, I was able to replace the mounting ring! 
18506 Perfect 
18507 poor image, poor focal range, not for small places, poor battery, poor software and manual, sound better than image. it s a middle range USB pen drive more than a camera. 
18508 Loved this set! A great versatile set-up, looks professional, obviously not quite what you would get for hundreds more dollars, but I was very impressed. The lightboxes are really nice and the backdrops are huge and work well. The carrying cases are very nice. 
18509 Very low quality battery. I get about 40 shots on a fully charged battery before it goes dead. By comparison, my 3 year old Canon battery gets 300+ shots on a charge. Would not recommend. 
18510 The clamp has an adjustable rubber band inside the jaws. Useful in keeping the clamp from sliding forward. The gooseneck is eghh... 
18511 GREAT!!!! 
18512 great product used it to take family group pictures and didnt have to hire a photographer to do it set it up and used the remote to take the group picture with love it 
18513 Durable and stays in place.. Highly recommend 
18514 Good quality glass with convenient carrying case. 
18515 Very sturdy and fits camera well. 
18516 love the product works very well. Can charge multiple products and is very well made. 
18517 Word great.Idea Product 
18518 Delivers as promised. Works very well and included the 12v and european converter. Great price 
18519 good quality 
18520 The user interface leaves a lot to be desired and the motion alert and recording fails constantly. But it is cheap and otherwise works. My one worry is that if the manufacturer ever stop supporting it via their website then the device is entirely useless and inaccessible. 
18521 Works great. Just what I needed. 
18522 The insight switch would not connect to the internet. I was on the phone with Belkin and they couldn t help. The cam connected to the internet but it kept losing connection. Sent them back. 
18523 love it.nice and light.compact.fits my canon perfect.nice traveling case 
18524 excellent deal, no complaints , and fast ship, thanks, -J 
18525 The LCD screen on your camera could easily be scratched. You re crazy if you don t use a screen protector. 
18526 The build quality is superb. It s solid and balances nicely on my D610. Produces beautiful portraits with nice bokeh. A favorite of mine. 
18527 perfect 
18528 thanks 
18529 ok 
18530 used mine in a dive off the coast of la jolla and it took great pictures and videos 
18531 Simple to operate. Gives more value for the money, and gives quality pictures & videos. 
18532 Wow what a camera 
18533 Works but takes a lot of practice. 
18534 Fantastic 
18535 A little bit disappointed with the unit. Picture is not as bright as another brand that I already have. Besides that when displaying some of the pictures it cuts them so I can t see the picture complete. I bought it to give it to my brother as a present. 
18536 Bought for grandson. He has used several times and loves wearing it while he captures all the action. Fits comfortably and doesn t slide. Even wore it white water rafting. 
18537 good deal! 
18538 Good quality for the money. 
18539 First class! 
18540 Picture makes it look big but in reality it is very small. 
18541 It is super tiny and incredibly uncomfortable. Not sure what human this was designed for :-( Sorry. 
18542 Perfect - works great! 
18543 Works well! 
18544 very good 
18545 The Flycam 5000 is harder to balance then it looks. I am still working at it. 
18546 Works well with Olympus C5060 and C7070. 
18547 It s convenient to dive 
18548 Product received in a timely manner and as listed/pictured. Thanks! 
18549 No need for warning tag. Price can be reduced 
18550 Nice camera. Order came on time. 
18551 Product packaging solid, fully applicable to outdoor sports, good quality, practical,I have used the suction cup and it did a fantastic job,and will use other accessories for a free time. 
18552 One of the best thing i ever did i think this lens is magic,of course lens like this Tripod must if you want the best result. 
18553 Seemed cool at first, but the problem is that while it shows what you re taking a picture of, this item attaches to your lens and will blow out photos due to the way the lens attaches over and doesn t compensate. 
18554 Good system overall. I wish the codec was in a .mov or .m4v format instead of .avi. 
18555 Love them 
18556 Easy to install, fixed my problem (scratched lens). A whole new case is only $15, but save a few bucks and this works just as well. 
18557 My niece loves it 
18558 good, but I like the other one I purchased better 
18559 works great 
18560 very nice 
18561 Awsome product! I used everything in this kit and it was all A ok. My only complaint being the plastic is a lil cheap not high rated type I feal. 
18562 cool nice pic and video for the money 
18563 Easy to assemble, fun to use! 
18564 Super nice and light for a case this size. Wish they made it for the Phantom 3. 
18565 works great. 
18566 I am So glad to have left the Nikon/Canon world behind, after playing with this x body for almost a full month there s NO way that I would go back to the BIG two. A+++ 
18567 Good for the price 
18568 Great 
18569 Perfect lens for my camera shoots. Sharp pictures. 
18570 Good, just don t use it while diving 
18571 Works great and fast delivery. 
18572 Fantastic binoculars for the money. Watched 2 wolves fighting over an elk carcass with 2 grizzlies in Yellowstone on their first use. Wouldn t have been possible without them 
18573 Great product, works as it should. Delivery was fast and without issues. 
18574 Worked perfectly. It lets me use my old Vivitar telephoto lens on my Nikon D3100. 
18575 I couldn t resist the 2-pack, but quickly lost both due to a not so secure fit. The eyepieces just don t seem to click in the same way as the OEM part does. 
18576 PERFECT 
18577 Good size for my camera. Plenty of pockets for accessories. 
18578 Awesome Charging Device ... Works exactly as advertised! 
18579 Pretty awesome compared to most tripods I ve seen. I only wish the feet were heavier for two reasons - so they d drop and fully extend without pulling, and to be more stable. It s nice and light for carrying. 
18580 Product as described...works great 
18581 I bought this as a replacement for my battery pack, but this one broke off in the camera as I was pulling it out. Worked great, but not super heavy duty 
18582 Although it s cheap, it works swimmingly. I sank my point and shoot in the sink to test it first and then took it to Cancun and the Green River in Moab (not in the same day). Worked perfect and kept the camera dry. 
18583 American Craftsmanship at its BEST. Far nicer , more functional, and less expensive than the OEM grip!!!! 
18584 This is exactly the head I was wanting to get. 
18585 Great, my brother love it. 
18586 good 
18587 I lost my charger and this was a very cost effective replacement. It even came with a battery when I only needed the charger. So now I have two! I haven t tried the car charger yet so I can t comment on that item. 
18588 works well as advertised. Beware that Disney parks do not allow it to be carried inside just like other parks. It can not fit in the pocket. But otherwise does its job well. 
18589 the filters came unprotected one of them is al scratch up. Will return them. 
18590 Great Product 
18591 Battery and charger work perfectly!!! You brought my old video camara back to life!!! Thanks!! 
18592 Perfect 
18593 Just used it once for in car race video in dirt oval stock car 
18594 worked fine. not go pro quality I suppose but for 50$ i ll use it again even had a bit of a wreck and no glitch.no trouble when used with PNY brand micro sd card. 
18595 When you zoom out you get a black vignette. 
18596 great price for a great product 
18597 A little difficult to figure out when you first get it. But once you figure it out, it works great. Great for long exposure photos. 
18598 All is ok! 
18599 It functions the way that I expected. 
18600 Great batteries. Would buy again. 
18601 Works Great 
18602 Build quality is cheap, but that s the norm nowadays. Light as a feather. Battery life is less than I expected. Projector works as expected, enough to share pictures and movies while out and about. 
18603 All batteries came expired. Very disappointed 
18604 Some access were missing. 
18605 Good wireless camera system. A little bit of interference based on distance. 
18606 garbage 
18607 Not the best quality, it is hard to make the lens move, sometimes as if it was stucked and the pictures are not really high-pitched. 
18608 Great camera. I ll be buying another soon! 
18609 Fits my new Jamstik+ perfectly, with room to spare for strap and other accessories. One star off for the extremely long shipping time, but the wait was worth it. 
18610 Great price! 
18611 Came with everything I needed to put it on and the instructions were easy to follow. 
18612 rec d as promised and as advertised 
18613 As advertised. Works just as well as the OEM batteries and I will buy more in the near future. 
18614 I wish I could say I love this bag. Oddly, it doesn t hang right. It s very uncomfortable to carry. Hangs at a strange angle. The snaps are very difficult to close. It looks fabulous, but I never use it. It s become a storage bag. 
18615 They do work, but are pretty cheap on the tie on end 
18616 Looks good and fits well - no complaints. 
18617 Fast delivery and worked perfectly! 
18618 I haven t had a chance to use the tripod with my camera yet but it looks good and easy to use. 
18619 Aircraft flys extremely well but am having problems with video. This is the second one. DJI seems to be having problems with transmitting video from aircraft to controller. Ritz Camera is very very fast with their shipping. Very pleased with Ritz. 
18620 Door doesn t even close right, the foam inside does not hold the battery tight the place where the iPad is advertised to go is filled with foam. Would not recommend this to someone else 
18621 follows up on any issue. Good quality cabes. 
18622 Do yourself a favor and swap out your heavier aluminum rails for some of these. 
18623 This lens is great 
18624 worked great! Good value. 
18625 Best E mount lens out there 
18626 this is easily be the single best monopod i have ever owned! 
18627 good camera, night vision and internet based monitoring 
18628 So far, I really like this camera and their technical support is awesome. Today I needed assistance connecting my camera to my i-phone and the Foscam technician (Calvin) was very informative and helpful in assisting me. 
18629 Henry was a good tech, Henry helped me with clearing up my major issues I was having with my connections.Thanks Henry for your help. 
18630 Perfect---quality and shipping! 
18631 This strap works great, it is adjustable to fit hand size and camera height. Noticeable increase in stability. 
18632 Works Great! Love the Price 
18633 This tripod will work; i like it. 
18634 Fit perfect. Good quality. 
18635 Good set of pouches to protect your lenses. 
18636 I thought it was going to be difficult to apply. Maybe I would get it off center or with an air bubble but it was very easy to apply. Now my new camera is protected. 
18637 Great price and great quality. 
18638 I took this to my trip to the Philippines. One of the activities I used it for was tubing - horrible decision. My GoPro snapped off and got lost in the river! Thank goodness the locals found my GoPro after a couple of days. 
18639 Works well. 
18640 The camera is very good and easy to use. The case that I bought, and was recommended, CASE LOGIC DCB-302 is too small for this camera and someone made a mistake suggesting this casa to be purchased along with this Olympus. I will return the case. 
18641 I mounted this to my airsoft gun, fits on their tight, didn t need to tighten after a few hours. 
18642 As someone who uses my gopro a lot for just random purposes, it s awesome! I ve had it now for about a month, but I ll do a proper review later on. So far though, I take it everywhere! 
18643 Product was exactly as described and at a great price !!! 
18644 excellent purchase, exactly what I needed! 
18645 One product is missing. 
18646 grabacion aceptable 
18647 Cheap, works well with my J1. 
18648 Works great, gives a little more room when turning the camera to portrait 
18649 Great it works 
18650 Works as advertised 
18651 Works great! Refurbished but it s a very small accessory with a small case designed to attach to the strap. The WPS button and indicator light is an easy setup along with the Nikon WMU app. 
18652 It was prefect beside that strap that made my camera drop but it okay so I am happy 
18653 Does the job! 
18654 Thank you 
18655 Very strong item. I would highly recommend this to protect your high dollar camera on the DJI Phantom 3. 
18656 Incredible barging 
18657 Owned one exactly like this and loved using it. It met my every need; traveling, pictures for newspapers and monthly articles about our club. Was happy to be able to find the this camera to replace the one that was worn out. 
18658 Perfect size for mirror-less system and 3 lenses. Using with a Sony a6000 and could not be happier. The belt stores when not needed and included should strap helps to stabilize. Think Tank is, as always, very robust and well built. Thumbs up! 
18659 Excellent 
18660 Great Product .....easy to use ! 
18661 Not easy to adjust the length But it seems that the quality is good, I felt that the product I ordered was too old or used because the stick was covered by dust inside its Box. 
18662 Works well but the swivel isn t very strong and can t support a camera in every position. 
18663 I was very disappointed to find that the lens opening on the case is too small for the Samsung WB350F. The lens opens but then shuts down. Bummer! It s too bad as it was just what I was looking for! 
18664 Holds a charge, better than the one that came with it. 
18665 Horrible Item. Cameras POS. 
18666 Having trouble with this camera. Went to the Bahamas and it only took a few pictures. Very disapointed. 
18667 So far so good. Will see how batteries hold up 
18668 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1CPL polarizer and it is just as good. 
18669 Needed sleeves to hold index cards on a magnetic white board, these worked out. 
18670 I love it. 
18671 Very Nice 
18672 I like the style of it but the functionality just isn t there. The sliding on switch didn t stay in the on position so if you wanted to turn it on you had to hold the button down. It did come with 4 color filters which was cool. 
18673 Pretty good although it will not work with the Sony vixia hf r62 with the battery attached. You can remove the battery and stuff it in next to the main unit. This would have been helpful to know before I bought. 
18674 Easy enough for a monkey to install. Prettier than a foscam. 
18675 Good product I enjoyed using it 
18676 Very good battery, I use it all the time, thank you. 
18677 Cheap! Broke 
18678 Works like a charm, people think these are real cameras! 
18679 Love it 
18680 Great product for the price. Nicely made and the length is long enough to cross over your body. The camera lays about hip length. The color is vibrant and the leather gives a secure feeling to hold a heavy camera. 
18681 very good 
18682 Bought for Son s birthday. Awkward to download data. 
18683 good product. Fits my lens perfectly. 
18684 good little tripod. could be more sturdy, but overall, not bad quality. 
18685 Very good!! Works very well..we can see in the TV...it was awesome!! 
18686 Great price, great fit, fast shipping - a five star seller! Just as good as Nikons - as if they really make them!!!! 
18687 The cords arrived very quickly and they are really nice heavy quality 
18688 Nice product for sure. Very quickly delivered and was everything I had expected. Many thanks:) 
18689 I expected the front to hang from the back cover when you take off the front cover to take a picture, but it always falls off. It looks great, fits great but not useable in the field. I returned this. 
18690 I like these better than my other baluns that are longer with a swivel - this connection isn t flawless but more dependable than the other kind 
18691 Picture quality is decent, so is audio stream. However the motion detection is very inconsistant. Sometimes they alert for no reason and othertimes you can walk through the room with no alert. 
18692 Great product. Haven t had a change to use it much yet but it seems to support my Vortex 85 spotting scope well, 
18693 Excellent lens with great optics. A little challenging to get in focus off hand in lower lighting, but it will force you to take better thought out shots. It s my only lens carried on my camera now, even though I have several. VERY flexible! 
18694 I really love the quality of these lens covers. perfectly easy to used and step up. Now to get the other size for my smaller lens. 
18695 Stop working after the 2nd day. 
18696 Cannot tell the fake TV from the real one. 
18697 Love this lens on my Nikon D3200. I bought this for a walk around lens for vacation however I haven t had it off the camera since getting it. 
18698 When used in the manner describe on the back, all the labels will be upside down to the user. Seems like a design oversight/flaw. It is also much smaller than other similar charts making it harder to find what you want or read the (upside down) labels. 
18699 You have to take off the front ring of the LX7 and the Neewer cap bayonets into its place. Its not very elegant looking but works very well. I have had it on the camera for a couple of months now and it works flawlessly. 
18700 Simply didn t work ...bought 2 thinking first one was defective ...got 2nd one ....same results 
18701 Kept giving me same reading regardless if I increase intensity of my flash or light source ....or near pitch darkness. 
18702 they are great quality, but I though it would work with reflectors, but it only works with lights 
18703 Excellent... love the camera and accessories so far... Not sure why Panasonic doesn t include the adaptor and batteries with the camera like other brands... 
18704 Works very well with my camera 
18705 It is a great little camera 
18706 Holds photos well very cute but only has 49 pockets NOT 72 
18707 Love the look and the feel. My son bought a pair and raved about the support. I totally agree and I have sensitive at times painful feet. 
18708 Fits great to my Phanton 3 drone 
18709 Great little camera -awesome pictures. Usually always just use my phone, but decided to try small camera for Hawaiian vacation 
18710 Great product, good price! 
18711 Love it 
18712 Great camera I only wish it am with a sim card. 
18713 So glad I got extra batteries for the GoPro!! Dive trips with multiple dives and video made the extra batteries a must! 
18714 I have a small point and shoot and wanted bag that would be a better fit. Yes this bag is the better fit for my needs 
18715 Strong design and perfect size for my monopod Oben ACM-2400L 4. 
18716 It did exactly what I needed it to do it stable , lightweight and easy to transport 
18717 camera fits well in case. Product received promptly by seller 
18718 love it all!! Great camera! 
18719 Good product. Works as advertised. 
18720 Happy with product. 
18721 Everything was there... save for the instruction book. Would really like the instruction book. How can I get the instruction manual... other than I love the camera. 
18722 Love the high-speed sync without the typical high-speed sync pricing! The recycle time is a little slower than I d like but, for the price, it s worth it. 
18723 this is a nice case to put all of your equipment in 
18724 Perfecto por ahora. 
18725 Diferent 
18726 Really enjoy the camera strap. Had a Joby previous and was unhappy with the thin strap. The shoulder pad on the Fastfire is much more comfortable. I prefer the attachment point of the Fastfire. Never really felt secure with the mounting point on the threaded tripod hole. 
18727 Fit well on Sony a6000. Pain in the A** changing battery! 
18728 Quality is okay for the price. 
18729 takes great photos but the stripes ripped off!!!!! don t buy cheap plastic. I want a full refund 
18730 Easily telescopes and is pretty durable 
18731 Definitely small. Good for specific uses but going to need something bigger to hold everything I have. 
18732 Nice product, all is well 
18733 Good 
18734 Still being exposed... 
18735 It does work for it s purpose. However, when the mount is screwed all the way in, the GoPro doesn t line up straight with the way the handle faces. 
18736 Works just like a cell phone screen protector! It was perfect! 
18737 Easy set up. Simple to install. Cameras work really well. 
18738 Great case for the price to protect my lens. 
18739 I was expecting this bag to be smaller. from the photo it looks like i can fit the fuji polaroid 210 perfectly in there. I can fir the camera in there and a small village. good quality though, shipped quick so kudos. 
18740 it would work great with light weight speedlight but not able to lock well on heavier ones 
18741 best thing ever to be created 
18742 Didn t fit camera. 
18743 camera does not record to micro sd, the software that came with it doesn t work either. 
18744 Fast delivery. Works great! 
18745 Highly recommended for The Phantom 2 users! This gimbal is awesome! took my ability to capture smooth crystal clear video from my gopro hero 3+ Black to a whole new level! 
18746 Every accessory I can think to use. 
18747 I received the batteries promptly and they are as advertise I am very please. 
18748 Works good. 
18749 Review for GoPro 4 Ssolid snug fit with all parts and pieces. no cover for the additional UV lens though which stinks but at least they throw in a lens cover for when the UV lens is not on. Overall very happy 
18750 great 
18751 I bought this per recommendation of my mentor, who s an experienced prof photographer, and he was not mistaken, it s a great product! 
18752 Samsung s server has been unavailable since I received this item on Thursday (today being Sunday). Friday when I called Samsung, they said they were sure it would be taken care of by the end of the day - it wasn t. 
18753 Wouldn t fit my camera good quality those. 
18754 Great product! I live on the gulf of mexico and have used my Smapole about a dozen times in the saltwater and it has worked great and shows zero signs of wear or rust! 
18755 Received quickly, all parts and items were accounted for and in condition indicated. Great set of accessories at a great price! 
18756 I love it,bought it few years ago for Canon T1i and it still works fine, using it with Canon T4i. 
18757 great back up batterys and came quick in mail 
18758 Installed it myself. That went smoothly all parts labeled clearly-what plugs into what-etc. Did need help from support to get the remote access working Amcrest s support was excellent. Still exploring the feature-rich capabilities of the system. Very satisfied with the product. 
18759 satisfied This product was very satisfactory and much fun for all the family I would highly recommend this product delivery was prompt. 
18760 These are a joke. Wasted my money 
18761 It is an older version no metal on locking holes and fastners are not double throw. 
18762 Great little umbrella for location work. Inexpensive, easy to use. 
18763 Much better than the 5X5 cloth you get with your glasses or sunglasses. This is exactly what I expected and the price was right! 
18764 Love it! 
18765 This is a fantastic camera for the price. It has a very good quality image, both day and night. 
18766 Very good video quality, best bang for the buck. 
18767 It s always good to have a few extra batteries handy 
18768 I am using this, along with several other cameras, in my vacation home in Arizona. I use it in conjunction with an INSTEON HUB, these work together very well and was easy to set up. 
18769 Looks very nice and the quality is very good. Is a bit uncomfortable to open take off the whole thing when you want to take the memory card out, but it s not a big deal. 
18770 Great deal 
18771 This was a great purchase 
18772 Coolest invention ever, I use it all my smartphones and you get stability of steadicam on your smartphone. 
18773 Product was as advertised. 
18774 not bad 
18775 excellent product. 
18776 SFSG....and you can t beat the $$$$$ 
18777 It s an &#34;okay&#34; system. The software is a bit tricky to sync with the camera itself. The picture quality in daylight is fantastic, but in low light the picture quality is poor. Seems to work fine. Does the job. 
18778 Cheaply made, only use for storage, will fall apart if you actually try to ship it. 
18779 i use it all the time on hikes and under water 
18780 it was the exact size I need it! 
18781 This camera is amazing and takes the best pictures! 
18782 Good quality, and firm connection without being too tight. 
18783 very well pleased with this purchase 
18784 I bought this camera because i was seldom at home,i could speak directly with my family when i was on a business trip. 
18785 Great deal 
18786 Great tipod for travelling fits every backpack 
18787 poor quality. It looks and feels like a cheap plastic toy. 
18788 Exactly what the picture and description shows. 
18789 they fit my camera perfectly... 
18790 Not able to keep lens pen in pen holder. Side Pockets are very tiny and unusable. Padding is not great at the bottom. 
18791 Great price! Much better quality than I was expecting. Very user friendly. 
18792 It works great on my camcorder. 
18793 Good camera for the price. 
18794 Great it works. 
18795 Cheap! software was not user friendly. The siren kept going off at every movement because software wouldn t save settings to shut it off. I ended up getting the Kodak camera to replace this. 
18796 Recommended by Amazon when I bought my Sony A3000. Just barely fits camera and extra batteries. Consider something bigger if you plan on carrying extra lenses, chargers, etc. 
18797 Good quality, has trouble staying on when moving fast 
18798 Bought this as &#34;refurbished&#34; - Nikon approved. Delivered &#34;as new&#34;. Saved about 60% so was well worth it. 
18799 The product s instructions were in Japanese and completely unusable. Previous review was not accepted by Amazon 
18800 Works great 
18801 Camera plastic mount broke off after 6 months. 
18802 good price.... 
18803 Awesome lens! Totally great from a business perspective. You have to have lots of room to get everything in view when indoors, but the bokeh is beautiful and it s quick and sharp focus. Totally love this lens! 
18804 Works great but rotation left/right has not been working. 
18805 lite came to me in an obviously pre opened box.lite is missing battery holding part.no instructions leaflet to advise type of batteries to use.i only paid 10 bucks. not worth the hassle to return it. 
18806 Works great. Fast delivery! Awesome. 
18807 good little camera for my needs. 
18808 legit 
18809 Just what I wanted in a flash. I needed something with more power than the built in flash. It s great for inside photos, but I wanted it for photos of owls in our tall trees in our yard. Love it! 
18810 great 
18811 Love how this thing softens the light, love how lightweight it is and its so easy to install and compact to carry, definitely im buying more and ill be switching the softboxes for these 
18812 GREAT 
18813 Danny @ tech support was patient, knowledgeable and awesome!! 
18814 The strap does not stay on. Lens protective filter works great. 
18815 Works fantastic!!! 
18816 Missing 1 of the sd cards. 
18817 Ugh...it works! Lol. Good construction and fit both tripod and gopro fine! 
18818 I got this for my 67mm canon lense to proactive from scratches. Works great and my lense cap fits over it nicely. 
18819 Great 
18820 easy way to carry an extra battery 
18821 its a good head strap for a cheap price. use it a lot 
18822 Give you that assurance of tight fit. 
18823 Great product 
18824 Great for the price. Bought new camera and only had one battery 
18825 Worked for a week then stopped now no computer recognizes external connection - bummer Cannot easily replace is Nikon has specialized connections at 12 buck a shot this is not acceptable 
18826 Received it on time and was exactly what i was expexting 
18827 The balance is not good, The grip is very loose, They should inform buyer you may have balance issue. 
18828 Great Product! Came in a timely matter and so far I am very satisfied with this Camera. I m very excited and confident when purchasing from this buyer. 
18829 Great filter! I didn t notice any discolorations. 
18830 Love my Yongnuos :) fast shipping and awesome product! 
18831 Perfect 
18832 My Polaroid 100 Land Camera is up and kicking thanks to this. No need for a battery mod. We ll see how long it lasts, though. 
18833 This replaced another mount. It is an exact match for another brand. Worked great and at a very good price. 
18834 This little camera is awesome!! Great footage 4 wheeling in the woods, crystal clear, picks up all the surrounding sounds 
18835 OK it all! 
18836 The battery is gerat! However, all the other stuff like the &#34;off-brand&#34; charger can be without. If I had to do it all over again I would get the Nikon Battery & the Nikon Charger to go with it (if it was offered that way). 
18837 Does what it should. 
18838 Works as expected. Decent build. I don t use it much but it does the job. 
18839 Now I am able to film underwater. Yeah! 
18840 These are great! I hate fingerprints/smudges on my iPhone and macbook screens. These cloths work great. Love them. 
18841 Good lens for the price. If you would liek to save money get this lens 
18842 It works great,I like it. I will buy more of it,it helped for recording vedio during my last crusade 
18843 It is very good quality! I love it! I just hope they would make it in different colors too. 
18844 Everything in it was just what I needed to get started. For the cost of another battery I got got so much more. The case is lightweight and well made. Plenty of room for the camera, spare battery and a few lens covers. 
18845 this is one of the better ones I got this to use in case of power outage for use with a portable solar panel it is nice to have the option 
18846 The threads for the screw that holds the hot shoe were stripped when it arrived. The screw needs to be longer. Functionally useless, but not worth the cost of shipping to return. 
18847 Worked great and was very inexpensive. Leash could be a little longer. 
18848 I used some other light diffusers, that worked great but was much bigger, this diffuser works great as well but is much more compact, small and carries a big punch. 
18849 Good 
18850 Very nice compact tripod. Its a great travel or hiking tripod that can handle moderate weight. 
18851 So far I enjoy my little camera. It takes beautiful pictures. No complaints. 
18852 It s what I m looking for. But the batteries won t charge. It seems that the charger & battery are not compatible. 
18853 item as described 
18854 You can shoot a lot more stable on hand held shots. Very comfortable. 
18855 Excellent video and easy to use. 
18856 ilikeit 
18857 Worked well. 
18858 Door sensors do NOT work with vera 
18859 Could have used some instructions on mounting this plate. 
18860 This camdera produces photographs that equal cameras 3 times the cost and with automatic focus and exposure setting. 
18861 No complaints 
18862 These performed perfectly! 
18863 When it s not falling off my camera due to the crap connector, it takes great pics! 
18864 Item arrived fast and secure. High quality accessories. 
18865 Generally I wouldn t write a review for such an inexpensive item, but I thought I would pass on to anyone considering this that it works perfect for me. I have it on my Canon EOS 70D. I slipped right into the hotshoe and does it s job perfectly. 
18866 Excellent visual quality. Plastic screen cracks easily if not secured in shatter proof box when packing in suitcase when traveling. 
18867 Great product. I use it on every photo session. Works great 
18868 Works great!! 
18869 Excellent service. Great product. 
18870 Good 
18871 S***ty, tinny audio quality. Buy if you love mediocrity. 
18872 Loved it! 
18873 Works well - did have it jump off the network once and re-establish a connection with a different IP address but was easily fixed. 
18874 Excellent item, quick to post, Thanks 
18875 Arrived as promised and earlier than I expected. 
18876 Didn t line up exactly but we made it work. Excellent quality!! 
18877 Love this! Took it snorkeling and parasailing on vacation and it did an awesome job! 
18878 Very useful for shots that require a long exposure time and a tripod. Love it! Works perfectly with my Nikon D3200. 
18879 the monitoring device stopped workingwith less than 4 months of service 
18880 The quality is not quite as good as the real GoPro stuff, but for the price it s definitely worth it, very good value and better quality items than I was expecting. 
18881 THIS WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED! I want to start up my YouTube channel and I needed a camera to do so :) this one takes incredible videos and audio isn t bad either! 
18882 kenneth was great and walked me right through 
18883 simple & functional; easy to use 
18884 okay. 
18885 this is a huge improvement over the standard plastic snap that comes with the case. This will outlive the camera for sure. 
18886 Thanks for fast delivery and the best product came in a good way with everything written and shown in the pic 
18887 Great battey. Lasts and then some 
18888 I was a little worried if it s going to fit around my vanguard tripod, it actually attached snug on the foam part of the leg, only one lever to control both of the angles was not the best, but it got the job done for now... 
18889 Giving this 5 stars now because it is a well made product and an excellent value. I revisit this after I see how long the batteries last - that is key! 
18890 We got my 13 year old a dslr for her birthday. Needed a fun looking, but sturdy and secure bag. This fit the bill perfectly!! I m a photographer myself and would love one for myself. 
18891 Good price vs Nikon product. Nice inclusion of a charger. Theses are small batteries to start with so not spectacular but as good as Nikon. 
18892 Work s great. No problems at all, charged the battery quickly. Arrived quickly nicely packaged. 
18893 Excellent product at a great price. 
18894 Does not fit! Pieces are too tight. 
18895 Vincent was very helpful and very patient with me for me not having no knowlege of cumputer and the camera s are great I would highly recomend the camera and again THANK Vincent. 
18896 Very comfortable and lightweight! 
18897 As promised. 
18898 Cool. 
18899 Quick delivery and great product 
18900 It was quickly delivered. Very good. 
18901 I am finally able to carry and store my gopro properly. 
18902 I couldn t get it to work 
18903 Works great! 
18904 10 points. everything was as expected 
18905 Toy binoculars! These are okay if you re a kid who wants to use their imagination. These binoculars do not focus very well and I would only recommend them for someone under the age of eight. 
18906 Great pack! 
18907 works great and cant beat the price 
18908 Beautiful photos. So glad I got this filter. 
18909 Like the product, Great tech support by Walter 
18910 I wear glasses and they some what work out. It s good enough for a substitute. Its annoying adjusting them sometimes. 
18911 i love it 
18912 Sooooo the cameras are black and white picture with no resolution and they aren t really wireless... Also did not receive the remote needed to control the LCD screen.... We just set them up, and they did not meet my expectations. 
18913 Almost perfect. Works fine and all but has a few scratches. I wish it was flawless :I 
18914 Sometimes you get what you pay for. If you really want a gopro, buy one. This has everything you need but just doesn t work. I have no memories of my trip because my camera didn t work! 
18915 Just a nice lil charger. 
18916 Well designed with sturdy pouch. Good value. prompt delivery. 
18917 This frame did not fit my GoPro Her 4 all that well, it blocked the shutter button. 
18918 These are great. I ve been using these straps with my go pro to record working on a vehicle and the accessibility is awesome 
18919 Ok 
18920 This camera is SO extraordinary-- I recommend over any other camera on the market-- easy to use, AMAZING sound and video/image quality... And at a reasonable price! I m just super over the moon about it! Also shipped in a secure and expedient manner! THANK YOU!! 
18921 Works well and attaches to the lens easily without binding. Be careful not to over tighten. 
18922 Ordered this for my daughter 
18923 She loved it ! Takes the cutest pictures 
18924 Very good construction. You can design your own layout as I did to accommodate my Sony NX3 video camera. There are many storage compartments of various configurations to store and organize the way you work. This is a professional bag with the option to shoulder or wheel your equipment. Nice.... 
18925 Just what I expetded 
18926 Works great 
18927 Works exactly as expected. Great product! 
18928 I was very pleased with my purchase. It was shipped right away and exceeded my expectations. I will purchase from these guys again. 
18929 Good value for the price! 
18930 Yes....just what I wanted and expected. Convenient, strong, can be used as a walking stick or a camera monopod. 
18931 I love the film for my new camera. Received on time! 
18932 Nice system. Not the best but works fine for the size and the cost. 
18933 Not bad. So far so good 
18934 Awesome. Everyone loves it at parties. 
18935 A little loose and comes off sometimes on its own. 
18936 Protect your investment and make sure it doesn t sink to the bottom of the ocean. Comes with a new backdoor and everything you need to affix it. 
18937 Excellent reasonably priced product from camera producer Nikon. 
18938 Henry Campbell helped me figure this thing out. great camera but setup is a doozie. called customer service and sat on hold for a few min and he had it figured out. 
18939 I ended up returning this item, because I found one that I liked better, but that was all just preference. It was a good lens, I just decided I would rather have a macro lens. 
18940 The soft box is is great quality, the mount was wobbly because the two Philips screws were stripped, i applied some glue and now it is very sturdy. 
18941 Not big enough for all my equipment. 
18942 Works great, thanks 
18943 Great lens but everyone knows that already 
18944 I love this!!! Amazing kit 
18945 not as tight as expected 
18946 great seller - delivered as promised! 
18947 Melts when left exposed to the sun! Don t leave your helmet locked to your bike and expect the camera mount to be there when you finish lunch. 
18948 over priced period 
18949 Great product. I use this as a backdrop for short informational training videos and interviews. Well made and appears it is built to last. 
18950 Fantastic deal! Couldn t be more satisfied with this digital camera. For all the accessories you receive along with the camera itself...Best deal we ve ever found on Amazon!! Awesome! 
18951 Had to take a file to the plastic mounting foot so it would fit the hotshot on the camera...now it works pretty good. 
18952 works well and much less expensive than brand name 
18953 Not happy at all. Wrong plug in for US 
18954 Comes with everything except the clip for the brim of the baseball cap. Would be nice to have that included. 
18955 Great value! 
18956 I do enjoy it design and Bluetooth operation and connection. 
18957 By far my favorite lens. Quality is crisp and sharp, takes excellent low light photos and depth of field is superb. I would highly recommend this lens 
18958 I m confused, some people say yes it does come with an AC power adapter some people say no. Jeff Thoele 
18959 I purchased 2 and I need to return one. 1 works fine and one failed to turn on 
18960 &#34;Good points Easy setup Well built chassis Long enough power cable&#34; 
18961 the best case for a single camera !! 
18962 I use my go pro 3+ as a dash cam for my motorcycle trips. Extra charged batteries are a must. This is a great product. 
18963 Great Diffuser, I was looking for one that fit my Neewer NW670 / VK750II 
18964 Not exactly shaped but fits perfect. I definitely recommend it. great product! 
18965 Awesome!!! Totally worth the money and I still haven t got to play with everything yet. 
18966 Great product, for the price. Worked as advertised. 
18967 Worked great. Wish flip was still in business. I would recommend gettng a tripod that has legs that wrap around railings and that are flexible. Otherwise this tripod was perfect. 
18968 Seems like a great tripod so far! top notch, with a great bag included. The only thing I miss is an arm to pan. 
18969 Rubber strap would ve been easier than Velcro. Kinda hard to fold and put away without loosening Velcro all the way 
18970 Everything was as advertised...great way to carry/store GoPro and accessories!!! 
18971 Excellent! 
18972 Jerks when rotating. 
18973 Not even worth one star. Bought this for our cruise and took pictures while snorkeling in Cozumel. Returned home and went to download pictures and they were gone. Can t return for refund because my time limited was up the day we got off of cruise (yesterday). 
18974 Very sturdy blocks 
18975 The camera I received didn t work I charged it several times even tried a different usb and tried an electrical outlet and it still wouldn t hold charge. 
18976 Products are very worth the money. Only object that I don t like/can t use is the tripod, it s very cheap. Other products are on par with GoPro brand products 
18977 Great addition to the kit for my Camera. Tripod is a little flimsy, though. You get what you pay for. 
18978 fits nice and tight. tighter than stock parts. 
18979 Fit great. I feel better knowing my new camera is protected. 
18980 Works great, very inexpensive. I used wasabi batteris for my Sony and Canon DSLRs, other brands just cannot match performance and compatibility. 
18981 Works just like it shows. 
18982 Does the job well... 
18983 It works perfectly. 
18984 Loving it! 
18985 Best suction mount for the GoPro Hero 4. 
18986 Don t waste you re time or money. I got it free as a promotional and still feel ripped off. Video is beyond horrible, pictures are un viewable and embarrassing to show to anyone. You would get better video and pictures from an old smoke signal flip phone. 
18987 Works great -- I just wish the microphone sound was better quality like D link. Otherwise so far, so good. Great value. 
18988 This is a great case. Nicely put together. Of course, every case is particular to your camera and how you like to use it. So I m managing to make it work for me. It can be used in a variety of ways. 
18989 Great for travling 
18990 Just a good accessory to have. I bought both my grandson and husband one for their Go Pro s. 
18991 I had some trouble connecting to my wifi because I use google chrome. Tech support was very helpful. Too bad this doesn t work to watch the outside from behind glass 
18992 great buy, good price. 
18993 works great! 
18994 Works as described. 
18995 Pretty easy to use, but you have to make sure the images are the proper size or else it stretch and distorts the image. 
18996 Title says it all 
18997 Grandson s Christmas present. Wasn t really submersible. 
18998 Way better than the generic ones... spend the extra. 
18999 Does NOT come with memory card. 
19000 I m very happy with the case. It fits perfectly and the strap is a perfect length too. I will defanetly recommend this case to anyone. 
19001 A++ 
19002 Just what I expected 
19003 It fit my Audi perfect. The price was lot better then dealers. 
19004 After experimenting with different bags this is the perfect bag. I really feel my camera gear is safe and secure. 
19005 Superb lens. Lovely bokeh, sharp even at f/1.4. Nice colors and contrast. 
19006 Its started to getting hanged while recording. Media card is not read properly. Lost some images also 
19007 I would have give 5 stars BUT, it missing one memory card. Everything else was good, delivered on time and well packed. 
19008 After receiving my replacement stick I m quite impressed not so happy with the part that hold the phone. I find the spring to be a bit cumbersome but overall it does its job. 
19009 Awesome is about all I need to say the constriction is solid and out has good features I have a mini ball pivot on top, with a Canon sx50 camera and it supports it easily I really Like this for shooting on the go very stable base 
19010 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
19011 ok 
19012 Thanks for the fast shipping. Looking forward to future business. Also it was an easy install and works great!! 
19013 More than I expected and better quality could have hope for. 
19014 This is exactly what I was looking for to be able to take pictures on the water with out the glare off the water. 
19015 hard to manuevar 
19016 Fantastic filter but Does not work with 24-105 canon 
19017 Very easy to apply. 
19018 Good value for the size and quality. Outside is hard enough to protect against normal wear and tear and traveling and inside foam pockets have a versatility of use. 
19019 Fair Price good Product 
19020 Love the gimbal, works great, the app could be better. 
19021 Beautiful and functional custom soft release button. Expensive but well worth it. Has an rubber O ring that keeps the button from unscrewing, unlike the cheap plastic soft release buttons. Highly recommended. 
19022 Initially, it is only OK for a emergency situation as backup to take a few more shots. After a while completely useless. I have had my original Canon battery twice as long and it is still going strong. 
19023 Very useful tripod and great value. Give it a shot! 
19024 Very good quality film 
19025 fit perfectly and happy with the purchase. 
19026 Works great with my D3300. Just turn it on in the camera s menu and push the button. I believe this to be a camera thing, but you must focus the scene using the camera s shutter button ahead of time. 
19027 Great item just what I was looking for. 
19028 No problems with it yet.. everything fits fine. Good price too. 
19029 Excellent price and very fast shipping 
19030 not a clear view distributor, not a new product, product is not under warranty. call clearview direct 
19031 Battery did not fit Had to be returned 
19032 I don t want to give a bad review because it wouldn t work with my NVR system (Q-SEE QC838) My mistake for not checking the right specs! 
19033 nice 
19034 It s a high quality material , easy to use, perfect size for shot a portray. 
19035 It s amazing..we loved it.. 
19036 Works great 
19037 Quick delivery, item just as described. 
19038 Not a toy. Need to get used to it. Learn how to fly it 
19039 How do turn. On the camera 
19040 I really like it but the diffuser fabric is already starting to pull away from the seams. 
19041 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos. Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps daytime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpDS_aVjA5Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ4A19GoEFk Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UQICoPTPlw 
19042 Shipped fast and amazing quality! 
19043 I love B&W product 
19044 REALLY BAD, THE THREAD FOR THE SCREW IS MADE IN PLASTIC, AS SOON YOU MOVE IT WILL BRAKE APART...DONT BUY THIS EVER !! 
19045 great little flying machine for the price. It s a great little quad to learn on. I originally got a dud but the company had great customer service and sent me a new one. This one flies perfectly. It can handle good bumps and crashes as well. 
19046 My Yongnuo YN600EX-RT does not work as Nikon Slave in iTTL mode, firmware version 1.8.3, anyone face the same problem. Nikon Slave M mode was working well. 
19047 Absolulty love it and I recieved it quick 
19048 Time saver. Easy to use. Nice and bright. Has audio too! 
19049 B+W is a trusted brand and first class product. 
19050 super easy to use. Works GREAT. 
19051 This cover will be perfect for my Peerless watercolors. Oh and I did get 2 in the pack! 😊 
19052 Well I bought mine for YouTube and I think the video quality is amazing but talking thru it isn t and it sounds like I m a far distance away so that s very disappointing. Taking photos with it is okay but in probably going to take it back ! 
19053 Better specs than the OEM item. No issues with charging or delivery. 
19054 The product was described as having no damages except a small scratch, but the automatic cover does not open or close all the way. I can easily push it down with my fingernail so it doesn t bother me. Especially since this was offered at such a fantastic price. 
19055 Exactly the product I need. This is very useful and the quality is outstanding. Gives me the angles that I need especially when doing outdoor shots,group pictures. Holds my big IPhone tightly without worry. Price is very reasonable and delivers swiftly. 
19056 Very good quality case just like my Lowepro sling bag. However, this is just not a fast out great travel case like I have for my old film cameras. Nothing wrong with the bag, but I don t love it like I do my sling Lowepro. 
19057 Works great and costs much, much, much less than a Canon original. Awesome. 
19058 Seems solid. Just didn t trust it for my SLR. Wife has it on her pocket cam know. 
19059 Just I hoped. Great deal 
19060 Easy to install and operate, good quality, functional. 
19061 Great amazon purchase! Thanks. 
19062 Good basic wired remote 
19063 so far so good 
19064 very good 
19065 excelente 
19066 Made of very cheap materials. The Velcro is barely on. The design does not allow for it to be angled down. 
19067 good so far learning it with flash kit 
19068 Was perfect but had some white spots 
19069 Great except for the swivel lightening shoe that broke hopefully the replacement does not brake! 
19070 It works fine 
19071 Pricey but got my Canon EOS Rebel up and running. 
19072 Good product 
19073 This item only came with the speed ring insert and not the actual speed ring as shown in the photo of the product. 
19074 Excellent and fast shipping 
19075 Very much like the camera. Four stars for not great anti-shake capabilities. 
19076 It works well. Sometimes, it is difficult to place though. 
19077 Came fast and work as expected. 
19078 Works well. I get two days of hard use with it with my Sony DCR-SR45 camcorder. 
19079 excellent 
19080 Does just what you need it to. Count only goes up to 399 but you can set it to go forever if you need more exposures. It won t work for exposures less than a second long. 
19081 Old GPS quit working, so the drone quit flying. After many minutes of trouble shooting and youtube videos thought that i would start with this bugger. Worked like a charm. Fairly easy to get to and replace (even for someone with big hands). 
19082 Bought this as a present for my father. This device was his first experience with a &#34;smart camera&#34; with a touch screen. It took a few days but he has become quite the wiz at using it, editing pictures and videos, etc. Basically this was a huge hit. 
19083 This monopod is definitely lightweight and durable.... Had it for about a few months, and no problems yet! There really isn t anything else that is worth saying, because this product is exactly what it says in the descriptions! No lies or anything. 
19084 Happy that I purchased this package will now have extras on hand 
19085 purchased for my wife in 2010 and its easy to use and takes great pictures 
19086 bad design, when power on P3 yr gimbal will hit it. 
19087 Worked out great. A little noisy but okay. 
19088 Shooting even a few minutes of video drains the battery. The regular Canon battery, though it has lower capacity, has no problem doing such short clips. Fully charged battery, two or three minute clip, first the battery warning, then the camera shuts down. Returned it. 
19089 perfect. 
19090 My son enjoyed this for 1.5 days and then it broke after hitting a tree branch. Needs to be more durable. 
19091 This case does fit the old/outdated Magellan 6000T with room for the AC adapter. 
19092 Good price, but not for the model television listed. Bulb can be carefully removed and placed in housing from old bulb 
19093 such a great case. goes well with my pink camera. 
19094 This case is fantastic. It fits all of my extras in here along with my new Gopro Hero 4 Silver. Very happy with this purchase and the price was great too. 
19095 Looks like a simple cradle but I really can t write anything about it because I didn t have a need for it as a result of returning Removu RM-R1. 
19096 The only problem that I had with this is if you utilise other products - such as the Vello Snap-On LCD Screen Protector - it does not fit well.Without any other attachments works well. 
19097 Works great! Easily adjusted and the positions are solid. Great little tripod. 
19098 Everything works exactly as advertised; the colors on the monitor are accurate and sharp. I also use it on my tv. (my tv runs off a 2nd computer) Easy to use, nothing else. It s awesome. 
19099 Great camera, works perfect. I only wish it was a bit more compact. 
19100 Works perfectly. Delivered exactly as promised. Vendor was very responsive and easy to contact and work with! 
19101 Excellent product. Very happy with the quality and craftsmanship. 
19102 It works as advertised. I lost the directions and forgot how to use it. 
19103 Nice! 
19104 Great for taking wildlife shots. 
19105 Will they come back ? I need some more 
19106 I have been using these tubes for a couple of years now. They aren t fancy but they get the job done. You can do really quite amazing stuff with them. I shot a video recently about how to use them. https://youtu.be/qtW4uCNjqzU 
19107 As a long term DIY video home security guy I have purchased many different cameras. If these led illum. has as a long life then this is the best in my experience. 
19108 Good photos, was a gift for a 7 year old child. Only downside is lack of a rechargeable battery. 
19109 very good material 
19110 Works just fine for the job 
19111 Works great and is very useful. Came when promised 
19112 Works as advertised 
19113 On time, as advertised, with contact info if needed. A great value. 
19114 Great product with excellent support 
19115 Very good, I like the camera! 
19116 Great speaker. Thanks 
19117 Really good product. Velcro makes the fit snug and secure. Only tried it on around the house but think it s going to be great while hiking and dirtbiking. 
19118 Works perfectly in my camera. 
19119 Built like a tank, durable, the pinnacle of B+W quality. 
19120 Its exactly what I needed 
19121 Pelican cases are fantastic! The pre-cut perforations make customization easy. They really protect whatever you put in them. I live in the desert, where very fine dust is the issue, but I have to believe that if our fine dust stays out, so will rainwater. 
19122 Fantastic, customizable. I keep my GoPro cameras and accessories in this. It s perfect for bringing the cameras to some other location or just to bring everything to the garage without juggling a bazillion expensive gadgets. 
19123 Works great! 
19124 simple to use and works well 
19125 Straps are a little thin and the rubber bottom hits me in the small of my back. Otherwise it is a great product with good protection and storage. 
19126 cant compete with the Canon dslr in quality but its still a very good camcorder 
19127 .easy to set up and quick too 
19128 .you can always make up for the quality during Editting 
19129 .so? 
19130 The picture quality is great. I use it mostly as a dash cam. The screen is real small and I have not been successful with connecting to wi-fi. 
19131 Good uv filter for panasonic lx100 
19132 its an awesome camera 
19133 Good product 
19134 Falls out easily. 
19135 Good product and nice price 
19136 great product and fast delivery! 
19137 Good, compact, powerful, simple scope. Not working with Windows 7 though. Only XP.... 
19138 These are small, which is specified and what they are meant to be. They are much easier to take along than a large grey card. The only problem is learning how to use a smaller card which is user error, nothing that the card did. 
19139 Its too small and feels like it is going to brake :( 
19140 the best low coast drone out there. great trainer... for the money, its the way to go.... 
19141 Great product ... Exactly what I needed 
19142 Very nice light weight case. Plenty of storage areas for batteries and accessories, and fits the Phantom 3 Professional with prop guards perfectly. A bit pricey but worth 5 stars for quality. 
19143 great buy 
19144 For the price it s hard to beat. I plan to sell it to upgrade to a 70 200 in the near future though 
19145 good 
19146 Does exactly what I wanted it to do -- for my GoPro... Easy to use. 
19147 Easy to use and does well as a cary along quick clean. 
19148 Great lens ! Great price 
19149 good idem 
19150 good product 
19151 This is one of those things that I hope I never see how well it works. 
19152 Exactly what I was looking for 
19153 I have zero complaints. This tripod is easily the best I ve owned and it feels so solid. 
19154 Love it. 
19155 Cool 
19156 I was worried about the film being left in warm conditions but it develops perfectly and looks great. Film was within use by date. 
19157 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
19158 Not what I spected for $24.00 dollars. ...one sheet of badays plastic, I ended buying a cell phone screen protector it work bettet.. 
19159 Great for selfies and tripod videos from different heights and angles. 
19160 Just what we expected! 
19161 Great product for the price!! 
19162 Worked like a charm! 
19163 Good product 
19164 The camera is outstanding so far, sharp images at day and at night. Worths the money! 
19165 Doesn t fit my Nixon Coolpix cameras eye holes at all. Much too wide to slide into slits. 
19166 This is NOT a neck-strap! Don t be fooled. Def a great shoulder strap though. 
19167 I use my own tote bags and just move this from purse to purse when I need my camera. Love it! 
19168 Works like a charm with both my Neweer units and both d5100 and d7100 bodies. 
19169 I wish the batteries came with the protective plastic cases like they have with past orders 
19170 Inexpensive, but works perfectly...charging the batteries a little faster than the charger that came with the camera. Excellent product at an excellent price. 
19171 Works great. I use it attached to the end of my pole and it is able to hold it up. 
19172 I bought my first tripod Its good I like I saw many videos before buying it The only reason i am giving 4 stars is the one button to open it wide was coming off the body So i have to glue it and now it cant use wide legs 
19173 Too big ....need a smaller version with the same loudness. Something you can comfortably fit in a pants pocket 
19174 A must have for the extra chargers to keep at the ready. 
19175 Arrived fast, easy to attach to my T3i 
19176 Love the look at night. The adhesive on the lights could be better. I had to tape it to keep it on. 
19177 Using this in several trips abroad = quality product that is worth a few extra dollars. 
19178 Great item! 
19179 Great quality. Sturdy and seals perfect. 
19180 Work Pefect 
19181 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
19182 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
19183 Absolutely perfect. This is a steal for the price that it s at. I highly recommend it. It comes in a little case, so you can put it in there without worrying about it getting scratched up. As someone who is experimenting with long exposures, this was a great lens. 
19184 Good quality definitely! They have nice little details. The elastic fabric (I dont know the technical term) feels so soft but firm. They have the non-slip coding, which makes the firming pretty steady. 
19185 These are such AWESOME lights. I use them when I film my YouTube videos and they make my videos so much better when it comes to lighting. 
19186 Backdrop is good for the price that you pay. The screen sizes are very misleading as the picture makes it seem like it is meant for a larger screen but they are relatively small sized. 
19187 Fast delivery and works fine 
19188 The screw and metal loop on the bottom started rusting right away. 
19189 Works perfectly! 
19190 I just bought this camera and i dived for 21 meters and when i went out it does not work anymore.. 
19191 Awesome flash for the features and the price. Works great with my 70D! 
19192 I use this for all my batterys and it works perfect with no problems 
19193 Will recommend this to anyone 
19194 not to work never got chance try until to late to send back 
19195 Great for travel and makes all your shots even better...was unsure what to expect but love them. Got it as a gift for my sister, said they were amazing and worked on both iphone and ipad, Would buy again! 
19196 Seems to sometimes not work with my android (it looks like this is ONLY capable with android phones) but I think it might just be me...so far I really like it! 
19197 thought it came with a sd card , did not explane well and i could get better quality from an old phone camera do not buy this. 
19198 Really helps with low and high angle composition 
19199 Very useful & practical size. 
19200 So much more reach than the prior 11-16. So bright , so clear. Almost no distortion so little or no software correction when processing in Lightroom. Wonderful for taking pictures in the forest. I photograph sun rays in fog and see none of the flare reported in prior copies. 
19201 Factory product, quickly delivered. 
19202 perfeito pelo preço 
19203 Great travel camera. Takes two AAs so it s ready to go when you are, no need to charge before you go to that important event. 
19204 I bought this to store my new ViewSonic PJD5255L video projector. Even though it is designed to be more of a camera and lens case, It fits perfectly. Only complaint is the plastic hinges and latches don t seem too sturdy And may wear out if used often.. 
19205 Nice product and it just works! 
19206 would not focus correctly 
19207 This is a small company that offers a quality product and really extraordinary customer service. I rarely have the time to write recommendations. MooJou Enterprises moved me to make the time. 
19208 I bought this as a birthday present. The preteen loved it. I think it might have been her favorite gift. 
19209 Item arrived as promised (very fast). They also included a 32gb micro Sd card (thank you). Definitely would purchase again and will look here for any accessories. 
19210 Fast and Very Early. I have a lot time in my hands to finish the preparations on my Son s Birthday 
19211 What a great price. 290 refurbished is the way to go. !! Searched everywhere for the best deal and im pretty satisfied. I still need to mess with the camera a little more to learn more about it but overall im liking it :) 
19212 Quality great but disappointed about the print direction. It doesn t state it will be portrait printed. The picture of the item shows it to be landscape which what is needed and would work best for pictures. 
19213 As advertised. Works great. Short delivery time. 
19214 Had to send one back to HTC due to water getting into the unit. Will be trying it in water again soon, as that is one reason I got this. However they replaced without issues. 
19215 Works like a charm 
19216 It is definitely a good buy with the bag that I bought to place it in. 
19217 Fits my Fujifilm and 2 lenses well. Build quality is solid. 
19218 I got the item on time and nothing damaged. It is all they said it would be. I lreally like it 
19219 i took this to a trip in Rocky Mountain, mounted D7000+17-55 f2.8 (quite heavy combo) to it. Surprisingly, this little guy is very sturdy and the ball head is very easy to use, and I enjoyed it a lot. 
19220 Works well. Would get a &#34;I LOVE IT&#34; rating if it was not so heavy. 
19221 Arrived on time and as described. I have yet to really test the product but so far so good. 
19222 excellent product! meets and beats the quantum tubos at 75% less cost. And I use them in the harshest environment of all. underground photography all over North America! www.dupontphotography.com for examples of the work. 
19223 i would have preferred the VR mode in addition to auto and manual 
19224 works good 
19225 These float wristbands for holding camera are great. they have enough size and float capability to keep any small waterproof camera from sinking. Plus, they provide excellent cushioning when in a camera bag. 
19226 Fast delivery. Heats up a bit. 
19227 It broke really soon, on/off button did not work in some months. 
19228 Pretty good item Work great and nice 
19229 Great little video camera. Easy to use and great picture quality. I bought this off of Amazon Warehouse and got a great deal. 
19230 Perfect. I love it so much. Super cute, colorful and trustworthy 
19231 Really nice quality photos! My room is very dark and normally when I take photos, they tend to be really dark and unappealing. With this lens, it really does make all the difference in color and clarity wise!! Definitely recommend. 
19232 Use it for an exercise device. Great power saver. 
19233 Great little flash dose a wonderful job very easy to use and understand no unnecessary mumbojumbo. 
19234 there were a few useful items and other things i ll probably never use. Bt considering the low price, the useful items seem well made and they make the package worthwhile. 
19235 Fit great, feel great, and work great. 
19236 too small. 
19237 This tripod worked great for me, fits all me phones including big ones like Samsung Notes. Great value. 
19238 Nice for off iPhone flash. 
19239 works exactly as advertised, and very reasonably priced. using it with a Canon 7D 
19240 Camera did not take pictures or movies when installed. It registered on the controller and the light showed camera active, but no video could be played. 
19241 Nice just as they said 
19242 Just got one and it works as advertised. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Very helpful as we travel a lot and will be able to keep an eye on our home. Might add a way you can also connect through a laptop. 
19243 actually has three mounts! 
19244 It works for personal use, no complaints for the price. 
19245 excellent product for the price 
19246 Make sure u update to 3.0 for 1080 60fps 
19247 Wow! Very impressed at the quality of this item. I looked at many other versions and am HAPPY to have selected this one. You will love it! 
19248 Great ball head I use this for real estate shooting on the manfortto pro 55 legs and the two fit together like bread and butter. No need to spend more for exotic materials. This combination gets the job done with flying colors. 
19249 Excellent camera and price. 
19250 cheap. good deal for what it is. 
19251 Love this camera and the price was great! The quality of the pictures is amazing and this is easy to use! 
19252 This is the best digital photo frame I ve ever owned. Pictures are crystal clear and fill as much of the screen as possible. Very little effort to set up also. Thanks, I love it!! 
19253 Ok 👌 
19254 Its an exceptionally solid FF for its price. Maybe a little heavy against the lightweight cameras it will likely be attached to. 
19255 Nice while it worked. I sent it in to be repaired and learned the repair cost was more than what I paid for the camera. 
19256 Great item - good price. Thanks! 
19257 Best grip for rollercoasters video 
19258 love it but i lost it:( 
19259 No issues, it is was it says. 
19260 Charger didn t work 
19261 This lens is compact, light weight and always come handy. 
19262 Unbelievable quality!! Super slim. Amazing clairity. Hoya- B+W- throw them away. If you are reading this - do yourself a favor and click purchase now. I received no incentives for this review - only read the review and agreed. You need this lens. You want this lens!! 
19263 Very cheaply made. My granddaughter dropped it by accident and now there is a lens error and the lens won t open so can not take pictures. It is a waste, now. 
19264 Good camera at a reasonable price. You really can t go wrong with a PowerShot from Canon. This is actually my 4th one over the years. This model is nice and light and only requires two batteries. The quality of images are great and it s easy to use. 
19265 It s OK! Seems kinda useless. 
19266 Coats 6$ to return 
19267 Great accessory kit. The kit comes with more items than I know what do with them 
19268 My only complaint is the camera doesn t fit snug in case. I am pleased with kit and would do business with seller again 
19269 excellent! 
19270 The cap fits fine, but the adhesive for the strap was completely dry and useless. Super glue took care of it easily however. 
19271 Everyone knows GoPro is at the top of the Sports/Action Cams. Best camera quality, lots of customization for settings and all around amazing piece of technology. 
19272 buuenas camaras 
19273 Great thanks! 
19274 Works good 
19275 I am rather disappointed as the Camera does not appear to have night vision or it is certainly not working. what are my alternatives as I desperately require night vision on my camera. All of my Logitech cameras have night vision and are very clear at nights except this one.???????? 
19276 Easy to install. Fit perfect and waterproof. All I can ask for $6 
19277 looks real 
19278 Is great!!! 
19279 nice 
19280 charger looked great shipping on point- but due to my own error it was thew wrong one and i had to return it 
19281 Soft-sided but very well made. I love the bag and use it every day to carry my K-3II with a 24mm Sigma lens and my lunch to my office. A+++ 
19282 This thing is useless. Doesn t work at all. It worked, marginally, for a day or so, then stopped all together. Changed the battery for a new one-still nothing. Zero stars. 
19283 Pro: Light and compact Easily adjustable/remove Con: Lack of padding makes uncomfortable after long day if you have a dslr w/battery grip and heavy lens 
19284 This item is sturdy and very easy to set up. 
19285 I think it would work great if you had sent instruction I could understand. You need to get someone who speaks fluent English to write your instructions. Please send them to me. I cannot use the camera because I cannot understand how to set it. 
19286 bang for your buck and still have the whole set going strong. if you take care of it it will last you. very good especially for a starter set in flash photography! 
19287 It works. My camera will float. That s all I ask of something like this. 
19288 did not work for me with GoPro black and fatshark... could not get video signal. Played around but it never worked. 
19289 Great product and great price. Highly recommended 
19290 New version of the Fuifilm NP-45 Lithium Ion Rechargeable battery worked as it should. I was disappointed in discovering my old battery charger for the older version of this battery isn t the one recommended for this new version. 
19291 I have bought these before, in a 100 pack. Now just hoping there be enough. Well made, no problems. Little slow on shipping. 
19292 Skeptical, due to price. Read previous reviews here & decided to buy. Great bargain. So happy I gave it a go 
19293 Good protection wish it came in different colors. 
19294 after less then 3 days of owner ship the eyepiece will no longer adjust for power setting. 
19295 Excellent! 
19296 Excellent service, nice product 
19297 Easy to use with auto settings, fun to experiment with advanced features. Great camera for the price. 
19298 I bought one for my girls but have been using it quite a bit for myself. Good quality and works really well. Love it!!! 
19299 works great 
19300 Works as promised. Excellent produce at a fair price. 
19301 One of the packs was damaged and it comes out filled with ink! 
19302 Great buy love my gopro!! The extra batteries come in handy 🙌🏼🙌🏼 
19303 For years I had wanted a Nikon and when I purchased the D3100 I was not disappointed. Great camera for amateurs like me. 
19304 as described 
19305 Really good camera. i took it on my trips over seas and took some amazing shots. I am not a professional photographer so this camera helped in making my shots better. 
19306 Everything arrived as described. Thanks so much!! 
19307 Short shaft. Didn t fit right. 
19308 Very appropiate for the Go pro cam and it´s accessories. 
19309 Works like a champ 
19310 This is the third one I ve bought and none of them work. They only work for the first 5 minutes you have it going. I kept buying them because they are cheap and I thought maybe I was just having bad luck. But nope, they just don t work. 
19311 Good product, will not lose/break your camera--just as soon as GoPro original accessories. I just wish there were extra screws in package--lost one almost immediate upon arrival! 
19312 It s ok 
19313 Not what I wanted! 
19314 Works fine. 
19315 Not working as well as when new.. 
19316 Don t like it like the white one better 
19317 The camera that was supposed to have come new was used and had damage ax they left the batteries inside the camera and the had fallen out and rattled in the box leaving dents and chips in the camera body. 
19318 Works well 
19319 Purchased this for my son s Gopro, he loves it. Makes it easier when fishing and hunting. 
19320 Good quality handy, collapsible white balance reference reflector. Easy to stick in the camera bag so no excuse to not carry it all the time. 
19321 Excellent product BUT terrible smell of leather which was not possible to remove at all by several known methods 
19322 Amazing for the price! Haven t failed me yet! 
19323 works as advertised... 
19324 I love, love, love having this when I have to shoot a busy baby or toddler. I can turn on my phones front facing camera and they can make faces at themselves or turn on a favorite movie. Great product. 
19325 Super easy to install. The material looks real from a distance but once close and when you have it on your hands, it s a very cheap plastic material. 
19326 This is an excellent product. Well made and well worth the money. Perfect for my Nikon 3300. 
19327 These are replacements for my old ones and worked perfectly! 
19328 I will recommend to my friends as it came quickly, looks nice, video quality is great. 
19329 excelent 
19330 Pricey but works as it should. 
19331 Work, but when my camera given that still has 20 % of the load suddenly goes off and makes me lose Scenes 
19332 Excellent product and fast delivery 
19333 A good medium range lens. On the Sony Nex7 I found results very good. 
19334 goes with the camera 
19335 original fit, and perfect ability 
19336 I love this camera. Very easy to use. Favorite part is the instruction book that gives tips on taking better pics. 
19337 C6722043 TECH ID AR004273 My customer service personnel was friendly and helpful. Thank you D-link for providing me with the safety I deserve with a &#34;very&#34; small business. 
19338 I purchased this as a gift for a relative last Christmas. I was blown away by the quality. Great bag for the price. 
19339 Great 
19340 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
19341 The camera was shipped promptly. I have only used it a little bit, but so far it works like a charm. Takes photos quickly and they look great! Very easy to use and so lightweight... 
19342 Love it.. bought it due to the one that came in the box was always out. After the replacement I got up to 4 hours without any issue. 2 hours each battery shipped. 
19343 Worked just fine.!!! Perfect. 
19344 great lens. i use it for northern lights photography and it works really well for capturing landscape. 
19345 poor signal very difficult to connect to wifi... 
19346 A very nice frame. works well; nice size to have. I am well pleased with product. 
19347 Garbage, don t waste your money or time. 
19348 Great lens for starting out! 
19349 Easy to install, The design is attractive for a sensor. I haven t had the opportunity to see it in action and I hope I never do. 
19350 Camera is great and the bundle is a good deal. I love the hero 4 silver. 
19351 Not compatible with Nikon D5200. The product description is misleading in mentioning that the product is compatible with all 5000 series DSLRs 
19352 A really excellent camera that is wonderful to operate. I m a bit angry that 2 months later there is an updated version that I wish I had. 
19353 Very expensive, but it works right, and now I have two. I still wish I could sell the camera for nearly what I paid for it, though. 
19354 We haves bunch of these around the house. Like, 5 or so. Weekend have one outside, protected from the rain, in Miami- no issues. 
19355 I like it ,but after the first pic it start to shot black (blank) pics. 
19356 great product! 
19357 Great to have on had in case you forget one or don t have it attached to the bottom of your camera. Looks like original MEFOTO. 
19358 As advertised. 
19359 Great! Well designed, had room for camera w/ lens plus two addition lenses, flash, accessories, with some room left over. Lots of adjustment on the partitions, a big plus. Just wished it had a chest strap between the shoulder straps. 
19360 It flies so easily! Controls are not too confusing for first timers either. 
19361 PERFECT. 
19362 Turned out not needing 
19363 The binoculars came with a nice strap. 
19364 I got this to shoot video reviews and blog posts. After reading reviews about the knock-off versions, I decided to spend a little more to get the real thing. Also, I love that I can hang my phone upside down or mount it somewhere if needed. 
19365 This is the first accessory that I purchased for my GoPro 4 camera. It is easy to put on...easy to attach the camera to the Chest Mount. And, it is sturdy and comfortable to wear. 
19366 Good, works perfect but a little pricy 
19367 works great, easy to use 
19368 Hoya glass is the best. This is a great variable nd filter for video. I ve used it several times now and have never noticed any diminished quality to what I m shooting. 
19369 I loved this camera outfit, great product for a great price. Loved the accessories that came in package, liked having everything I need in one deal, easier shopping. Now just to learn how to use it. It takes good pics. 
19370 I have used their outdoor camera for years, excellent product. Customer service is also very good--Walter helped me diagnose and fix a minor problem in no time at all; also very courteous. 
19371 saved my lens when i dropped it on gravel. 
19372 This filter was about 3 stops darker than the ICE 10 stop. Well worth the money. 
19373 It was the wrong item and was returned. 
19374 After purchasing the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT, I ordered this unit, hoping that it would work. It fits the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT perfectly. I ll probably be picking up a few more Yongnuo YN600EX-RT units, so I ll definitely get more of these Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce units as well. 
19375 Very nice quality!! 
19376 We love it. Works great. 
19377 Does just what I wanted it to do. Makes preparing the camera gimbal for flight easier than the included DJI camera lock. Love the bright color and lens cap. 
19378 This is another stand i ve added to my collection of other LimoStudio stands. Cant beat the price and service of these stands. Stoked on this purchase and previous LimoStudio products. Steven Caro SCg Shoe Co 
19379 This is easily 1/4 the price you would pay for the same amount of product from any photo equipment site on the internet. Fits easily in a backpack and is an amazing tool. 
19380 battery charger works like a charm, I love it 
19381 Nice stuff, cleans with no residue. 
19382 It is a super long lanyard so I feel like the gopro could hit the ground and then be dragged. 
19383 Quality light but the boom stand was poorly design. Over all OK for the price. 
19384 The lights are weak, the stands are s***. The best parts are the umbrellas, but especially the bag. It s become my go to case for stands. 
19385 Looks good and will do a good job. Is closest fit that I could find for my phone. 
19386 Great idea and works flawlessly. Very snug and comfortable and easy to use. Cheap too :). 
19387 I use primarily for above and below water deep sea fishing photos/videos with my GoPro Hero 4+. It s strong, light, and easily transportable. 
19388 battery charges and holds its charge works well 
19389 Excellent product. Rubberized, finger grips, easy mount system. 
19390 Easy to use, like!! 
19391 Takes great photos and HD video! Love the way it feels in my hands This is my 3rd Sony camera in 8 years - however they are more point and shoot cameras....but I do still use all three of them. 
19392 Does not fit 1.25 scope I repeat DOES NOT FIT 1.25 SCOPE.The specs do state dimensions as 2&#34; but also states fits any 1.25 scope.I feel it was wishful thinking on my part but really bummed out my crystal clear night sky. 
19393 Rock solid! Best tripod I have ever owned! Worth every penny. There is nothing about this tripod that I don t love. 
19394 Good build quality, but did not fit my Sigma 50mm 1.4 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
19395 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1UV and it is just as good. 
19396 Excellent flash. I love it. 
19397 Works great 
19398 The extra large cleaning clothes seem easier to use and clean better than the smaller size. 
19399 Easily hackable. I had the camera on one day and it started moving. Someone had hacked it and was panning my living room. Creepy. Never plugged it in again. 
19400 Definitely dont hold a charge near as long as a nikon battery but it does a good job if your photo shoot is short otherwise without backup, your photo shoot will indeed be short lived. 
19401 It does what it s intended to do, hold my cam nice and steady! 
19402 Light is green as hell, but look how cheap it is! 
19403 This film is great and the photos come out perfect. I m still learning with my mini8 camera, but this film is perfect. 
19404 good 
19405 The screws popped out of a couple of accessories almost immediately. 
19406 my granddaughter (13) loves it 
19407 love it - nice and sturdy. thank you! 
19408 Very good product for the price. I would buy it again 
19409 Love the ease of using this camera! 
19410 I have purchased 2 of these cameras. They are very easy to set up and I can view and point from my android phone. 
19411 Great price. Not sure yet of the quality of pictures. 
19412 Yes it saved my life from spending money on that bitch I found her sleeping with other guys , so I dump her , I m so happy today ,thanks again a lot 
19413 great 
19414 I bought it for my wife as a gift, she is the camera hobbyist, she loves it so much, it adding to the quality of the pictures so much, also very easy storage, isn t bulky, nice case 
19415 The instruction are vague and you need more than what comes in the package to install it. 
19416 Batteries work flawlessly! Fantastic purchase, especially for the price. 
19417 Worked perfect 
19418 so far it is performing as I hoped 
19419 So impressed with this product! Easy setup and works like a charm. Didn t anticipate this, but I love the 24 hour activity log I can review on my phone. Even when I don t have the alarm engaged, I have a sense of what s going on. 
19420 Works as advertised. Very sensitive to sound. Works great with Foscam fi9805W. 
19421 excellent product will have to get more 
19422 works as expected 
19423 Great accessory kit with just about everything you could need for your gopro! 
19424 Fit device 
19425 great camera for young filmmakers starting out i just used this camera for a short film and it worked perfect id buy it again if i have to 
19426 For the price this can not be beat. I use it with my Note 4 and have no issues. I am very happy with it. Holds the phone secure and has plenty of adjustments. 
19427 Quality product! The white parts are grippy so that you can hang the tripod virtually anywhere, although you need to take some time to make sure it s balanced because the camera s weight will throw it off and might fall 
19428 great 
19429 malisimo 
19430 Not sure if it the stick or not but my mom that lives in Ark. Can t seem to get it to hold the phone. I live in a different state so I can t help her. 
19431 great technical support - Walder 
19432 really good for my needs 
19433 So far so good. They did well over a 5 hour shoot with about 700 photos. If these hold up over time, they will be a much cheaper alternative to the Nikon. 
19434 Great alternate to the expensive gopro cameras. Great features and image resolution for a great price 
19435 Fit my camera perfectly and now I have backup lens caps. 
19436 Haven t used it yet in the water, but it works great as a handle and for storage. My son stores the charger cable inside. 
19437 great tech service 
19438 Excellent for what I want. 
19439 hope I don t have to use it. 
19440 The camera worked well, however the film I received did not work well. Overall the camera itself was a good purchase, and a blast from the past. 
19441 Not sure how pleased I am. The first 8 batteries only lasted 2 months in my trail cam. 
19442 Works perfectly for my needs ! Couldn t ask for more for the price ... 
19443 Broke The second day i bought, i was on a concert.. 
19444 fit very tight 
19445 Bought this specifically for a snorkling trip during our last vacation. Good performance and easy to carry. Wish I had spent more time learning the menus because glare from the sun made it tough to make changes on the fly. 
19446 My favorite favorite selfie stick- so easy to connect, holds the charge long, highly recommended!! 
19447 Delivered on time. Great deal! 
19448 This battery works just as well as the original battery. The seller gives instruction and guarantees the product. 
19449 I enjoyed gazing into the starts at night and I am just so happy that my son finds it fascinating as well and this telescope has been helping him view the stars above in the sky at night 
19450 I just really dislike this tripod. Flimsy when fully extended and doesn t feel like it supports the camera well. 
19451 Would NOT work on my Leica M. 
19452 Direct replacement for my broken lens cap. One of the two plastic springs on the original cap broke and it will be interesting to see if this one is any sturdier. 
19453 I called customer support because i was having issues viewing the cam outside of the wifi it was setup on. Henry was very helpful. He got our foscam working in no time. Thank you! I will recommend your services to friends and family. 
19454 really weak 
19455 Great product 
19456 Work great, and have been using them since I bought them. 
19457 Just scared people away 
19458 It only came in one piece not as advertised! It only has a small piece that doesn t cover my entire lcd for the mark iii such a piece of crap 
19459 very big , much larger than other cameras ,, but nice nite view 
19460 Good one, but hard to wear and use... I will bet u will not use it often.... 
19461 Great product. Very nice camera 
19462 Only works up to maybe 5 feet away... nought this to take my family pictures and didn t work for me. 
19463 Bought this for big family trip to New York and absolutely LOVE it! Got some great pictures with it and transferring them to my phone has been soooo easy! 
19464 It s awful 
19465 Works pretty good with my 70D canon. No problems. Kick ass price, too. Canon should lower their prices. 
19466 no memory card including 
19467 Sharp, crisp photos and videos. 
19468 These directions are terrible and I dont like that u have to have a computer to review the images. 
19469 I have now had time to use this device and it performs as expected. 
19470 bag looks flimsy and does not hold the camera in place 
19471 Used this product for a couple of weeks in order to give a proper personal review... WOW! What a piece! Won t focus, can t single to one image, zoom is complete junk, coma is HORRIBLE! Can t even see saturns rings! Go with Baska 
19472 Great camera!! The case is nice also! 
19473 Must have if you re shooting with a 4BLK. Been through many charges for a few months now and still working great! 
19474 I like that this chest mount is so adjustable. I put it on my grandkids over their life jackets while they were wakeboarding (age 10 & 14) and then put it on my husband while he waterskied. My husband has very broad shoulders and chest. Got some fun footage! 
19475 This one fits what it says it does just by luck. Very hard to figure out according to info given. 
19476 Takes pictures well, and the zoom is great. Dies in 3 minutes if you take a video. 
19477 I don t know if it s the paper of the printer, but every picture has a blue tint. The paper fits as advertised but prints odd colors. 
19478 Works as advertised, Nikon D-3100. 
19479 Go-to lens for portrait and inside work... 
19480 I used to have this camera in the year 2007 boy do I miss it! It was so reliable I am glad to see it again! Purchase button CLICK!!! :) 
19481 Exactly what I needed to add a Rode Mic to a canon g20. Works great! 
19482 Sorry, it did not work after about an hour. Had to return. 
19483 Completely transparent. Works perfectly. 
19484 Now really I trust.... 
19485 Don t spend the money on Sony batteries this brand works just as well at half the cost. 
19486 Did a lot of research and glad I ended up with this one. Small but well built and takes great photos. 
19487 very light and easy to use 
19488 Everything fit and worked great. Nice having the extra battery for backup! 
19489 I only have one thing to say...BUY IT...I recommend this to everyone, It s incredible....The last pic is a pic of my Mom s house in a dew drop on a pine needle... 
19490 I use these for my wedding film shoots and put LED lights on top to add great lighting. Sturdy stands with great quality to them! 
19491 Very pleased with product. Shipping was quick and packing prevented any damage. Will consider when purchasing again. 
19492 Guy that I bought this for loves everything about this camera. Was shipped super fast.. 
19493 Love the images these attatchments take. Dislike that I have to remove my phone case in order for the lenses to set flat. I use an otter box, I will purchase another case with a smaller lens opening so that the attachable lenses set flat. 
19494 the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade. 
19495 These eyepieces are probably One of the best values available.Every amateur should Consider this set. 
19496 Ok 
19497 Amazing number of accessories and surprisingly nice quality. Will have to take advantage of the online tutorials to be able to handle all the functions of this gem. The bag to hold everything--doesn t. It needs to be about half the size larger. 
19498 great construction. Sturdy and well made 
19499 amazing product!!! fast shipping!!! just what i needed 
19500 Good cap for the Leica televid spotter... 
19501 Works great, what a bargain! 
19502 its great..alot of attachments..downside not sure what is for what 
19503 OUTSTANDING 
19504 Exactly what I needed! It s also portable so I can charge my battery anywhere! Amazing! 
19505 Had it about a week now and loving it! Easy setup! Great for watching away from home! Love remote tilt and pan!..and especially the notifications when alerts turned on!! Thinking of adding another! 
19506 The camera came on time but it was not a white one, it was black and silver. 
19507 Best investment EVER 
19508 Awesome 
19509 A must have they recharge fast 
19510 Beautiful case! Fits the camera like a glove. Great for protecting it and carrying it. A great buy! 
19511 I purchased this item at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion. I think this is an excellent security camera and well worth what I paid for it. I am considering getting a couple more to complete a remote security setup I have in mind. Easy to setup and use. 
19512 cute stuff, everything works. 
19513 working as advertised. like it 
19514 Perfect substitute at lower $. 
19515 What a major upgrade this is for the 50 f1.8 lens. Smaller, lighter & well built. A great choice for the money. 
19516 This is my first telescope. I ll probably need to take a class on how to use it. So far, do to my inexperience, I ve been disappointed in difficulty of use 
19517 super nice... la recomiendo. 
19518 Solidly made, works very well but you need high rings for your rifle and patients to tweak it to preform. Once done its a beaut! G :O) 
19519 Batteries hold full charge......great buy! 
19520 Worked as expected and came on time.... 
19521 I wish to know if this lens is compatible with Blackmagic Design Production cinema Camera 4K (EF Mount) before I place my order. Thanks 
19522 Great item 
19523 Wasn t as expected 
19524 Great lightstand!!!!! What I like most about it is, you can get it low to the ground. Great for setting behind a model and shining a light on the background. Works great for photographing dogs with it low to the ground. Sturdy, well made. 
19525 well designed and high optical quality 
19526 This tape leaves a sticky residue if left for a long time 
19527 I am glad I found these 
19528 I have 100 uses! Great! 
19529 I have been using both of these batteries and this charger for quite a while now, they work perfectly, and actually last a lot longer than the battery that came in the camera! Would purchase again! 
19530 Worked perfect !!! Helped me get an expensive camera working again! 
19531 I love it 
19532 It has room for various lenses and sizes. Perfect to take to hikes and get landscaping portraits. Very happy with this purchase!!! 
19533 This strap is great for many uses other than preventing serious metal detecting fatigue. It s strong velcro holds up to the toughest of jobs. I use it to hold my hammock together while backpacking. So far I have not fallen. 
19534 Arrived on time, and was just what we expected! Great job. 
19535 This was a great deal for your Cannon camera. 
19536 Simple installation, good quality, setup was okay. 
19537 Excellent birthday gift. 
19538 GREAT Clarity. Put it on my Sony NEXVG,, the zoom Not 2 smooth, But The Picture VERY Nice. 
19539 It is good value for money, but I bought if specifically to protect my Nikon Coolpix camera and expected it to be more of a tight fit. It did not meet my needs. 
19540 Works great , good price, stays where put , for mountain biking would be nice to have a shock absorbent mount. In rougher terrain the playback has a little rattle like sound. But so does all the camera s I have tried.. 
19541 As advertised. 
19542 It is a easy to use product. The price is low and worked better than my friends. 
19543 Great product! Took it on vacation and had a lot of fun with it. Easy to use. It fits my Note 3 if I remove the Otter Box. 
19544 Does not work. I will be sending it back. We tried it on several different phones. It came in a new box and appeared to be new, but did not work. 
19545 heck ya 
19546 nice 
19547 Works as expected and gpod deal for price. 
19548 sucks 
19549 Super Comfortable bag, fits my Canon 70D with my 18-55mm lense attached. I dont think it will hold a lense any longer than that with it attached. Fits all my GoPro accessories. 
19550 Came on time and nicely packaged. The quality is way better than I expected for such a small camera. Design and finish is very good. Exceeded my expectations. 
19551 Solid little stick. Unfortunately, I took it camping and lost the nut before I could even use it. I will glue another one in from my spares... 
19552 Awesome kit! It made my trip to Africa easy n efficient. I was always ready for the next shot. 
19553 Great strap! Easy to attach to my camera and its so comfy especially if you are using ur camera for a long period of time! Its good quality and I m very happy with this purchase! 
19554 Amazing results. Now, the sky comes out blue with white clouds... Most so called Pro photographers do not use this product and the sky looks white on thier pictures. Our sky is not white... Nice product. 
19555 Light and very stable for medium size weight. 
19556 Robust and durable. 
19557 Good product, thank you 
19558 This item was just what I needed to mount my GoPro to my road bike and take it on a 100 mile ride. The price was right and it performed as expected. 
19559 I was SO happy to get this. Can t wait to use it! 
19560 Fantastic !! 
19561 Works great but is really expensive. 
19562 It read i very good review about this camera and the shipment was excellent and new as described 
19563 For the money its a great deal 
19564 Excellent lens, one of my favorites I use when I am not using my 35mm. 
19565 These are pretty good, I like them. I ve used them for several years now. 
19566 functional bag, if a bit heavy. i will be using this as my DSLR bag/purse during my upcoming Italy trip. 
19567 Beatiful lens - clarity is amazing. Has become one of my favorites. 
19568 Amazing lens, built like a tank, I really love the build quality and the results. 
19569 very Poor Quality 
19570 Just what I needed 
19571 Great cover 
19572 Returned this because there was a bunch of wires and I expected less but returning process was quick smooth and easy thanks 
19573 Very nice camera takes great picts. 
19574 Don t buy, if you have a Galaxy S6 Edge. Wide angle somewhat of an improvement but with a huge drop-off in quality. Discarded. 
19575 I gave this polaroid camera to my girlfriend for our anniversary. Pink s her favorite color so I figured she ll love it. And she did! Now e have tons of photos posted on our bedroom wall. 
19576 Love it. Works great!! 
19577 Great deal for the price works like a charm! 
19578 It s a little small for all of the attachments we have for the Go Pro, but is good protection. 
19579 A great toy. I can tell you what not to do. 
19580 good product so long as one can fly the unit well 
19581 Not nearly as good as the Lumix battery but its ok as a back up. Dies really fast. 
19582 Extremely easy to use and comes well packaged as pictured 
19583 good for the price. Have been using it for a month now in my climbing trips and holds up well. Keep all my connectors, 4 batteries and extra backs and works great. Can toss in my climbing pack without being worried about crushing everything. 
19584 once I figured out how to get it on I love it. 
19585 Great case. Not too big, not too small 
19586 Work great for what I do - YouTube interviews with a DSLR. 
19587 Pretty dope!!! I like the fact that it has the plug on the device itself without the dumb cord a+ for that 
19588 100% dissatisfied, under the Product Details it says &#34;5.7x5.5x3.2 inches&#34;. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and fond a 1x1 inch screen 
19589 too small but other then that great one 
19590 Batteries work fine, and was a quick ship, no complaints 
19591 Perfect solution 
19592 works as expected and reasonably priced 
19593 Small, but large enough that I can find it. Even the dark. 
19594 The lens arrived on time and in excellent condition. It is a great portrait lens. I am very pleased with the clarity of the photos produced with the Sony SEL18/B 50mm lens. 
19595 fits my aw120 just fine. 
19596 Great trail camera. Very sensitive capturing much more than expected. 
19597 Great amateur starter telescope, simple enough set up and good enough optics to view the craters on the moon! 
19598 Excellent by all means. 
19599 OMG!!!!! Thank you very much! We were worried that something would be wrong for that price, but everything came! The shipping was fast and everything inside was perfect. My DOUTHER so happy. It was her birthday present. Thank you very much!!!!!! 
19600 Works on my X100T. Documentation leaves a lot to be desired, but I managed to figure stuff out. 
19601 excellent lens for the money; the accessory kit was a nice bonus. 
19602 Fit much better on my lens than previous purchase 
19603 Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. 
19604 No good. 
19605 Works great - used it underwater and on hikes. Very comfortable, you ll forget you re wearing it. 
19606 Great value. We keep it in the car so we can always refresh our batteries while we are away. 
19607 ok 
19608 GREAT PRODUCT!!!!! 
19609 kept dropping off the network - pan feature did not work well 
19610 i love it! i thought i would have a hard time getting the thing attached to my camera, but it was easy. does a wonderful job, pleased with my purchase! 
19611 Photography is a big hobby for me and this camera does a really does a amazing job. I completely love it and would buy again in a heart beat 
19612 All I can say is this is a great deal! Charger & batteries all work great! 
19613 WIFE LOVES THIS ITEM 
19614 This pole was exactly what I expected and fits perfectly with my GoPro. 
19615 Excelent 
19616 This turned out to be an excellent, turn-key front light solution for my Parrot AR Drone, so I can fly it, see it better at a distance, and use the camera in low light situations. The light accepts all the factory connectors, and is super light weight. 
19617 The protector does not fit the rear screen on of my Nikon D750 well. Would not recommend to other D750 owners. 
19618 Works well. No issues. 
19619 Good kit and has been working well. 
19620 Was too difficult to attach to my Canon T3i. Celltime said they would have someone call me, but never did. Lens produced blurry pictures. Needless to say, this lens was returned at my expense AND a restocking fee, which I feel is unfair. 
19621 Works great thanks 
19622 I ve gotten some very nice shots with this lens. 
19623 Nice product for tripod work. Allows easy access to the microphone port and comes with a decent lens protector. I am very pleased with this product and have used it for approximately ten hours already with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. 
19624 Functions as advertised 
19625 Nicely made item, but the cutouts do not fit my Hero 3+ and accessories. 
19626 Absolutely love this lens. I m an amateur photographer but this lens really makes taking a quality image so easy. I have had it for over a month and it is sturdy so far. 
19627 Works as advertised. The only thing that could be better is a more precise charge indicator. I will leave my OEM charger at home on my next vacation. 
19628 Great stick, used in salt-water with zero issues. The anodized blue parts look great and it feels top quality. 
19629 Works like original... 
19630 Love it! 
19631 Good 
19632 I use this on top of a monopod - works great, quick to set different angles. 
19633 Has been really useful in our camera kit, thanks 
19634 And GoPro sells their piece of plastic for HOW MUCH?!? This part is cheap and fantastically well made! Don t know why they went with hex-screws though... But you can replace them if you want. I replaced the one main one with a smatree metal screw on mine. 
19635 Works just like it should. 
19636 I got a defective item. I have tried to change a new battery. but i have never used it still now. so i want to return it. 
19637 works great 
19638 I m very happy with the purchase. All items work perfectly for my Nikon D5200 camera. I think the assortment of the products was a very clever one. I recommend this product. Many thanks. 
19639 Works as advertised. Very satisfied with this product. 
19640 very good product! Love it! 
19641 Yes, exactly what it says it does. Works fine and I have extra rings for all kind of needs. 
19642 Sucked. I have a rebel t3i which it says it is compatible with. ... it s not 
19643 Work as expected. 
19644 Easy set up and works great. Have also used foscam which is a huge pain to setup compared to dlink. 
19645 Doberman Security met my highest expectations, was easy and quick to install, and provides an extremely alarming signal to deter any possible break-in. 
19646 Looks like genuine parts. Thank you China! 
19647 Perfect camera. Have seen caregivers not taking care of my husband! So, it was perfect. I could check on him through cell phone when I was gone. I CAN TALK TO THEM, ALSO. 
19648 good 
19649 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
19650 Excellent! 
19651 Grip is very sturdy, and made if very nice material, it doesn t seem cheap at all. very happy with this purchase, would definitely buy again. 
19652 Fits perfectly 
19653 Charged the battery very fast but I haven t used the battery yet to see how it preforms. 
19654 Camera has difficulty focusing on small items, zoom is so-so. If I had to do it all over again I would shell out the extra money for a better point and shoot. 
19655 Works great only issue is getting connected to view it from my phone if i am not on the same network at my house. 
19656 Great camera, great for beginners but looks like you can go next level if you want to learn how to use all the bells and whistles. I managed to get it on sale for 300 which is a steal. 
19657 for the price its ok not stainless steal it rust within a day other than that it floats and holds go pro 4 very well in water i like that it has the screw hole on bottom thats why i went with this one 
19658 I just order for one.. then now after i reviced.. i found it double.. can i return? 
19659 I really do love this dual mount. Extremely affordable an great quality. 
19660 Great product. 
19661 Better than the one that came with the camera.I am very happy 
19662 For paying that price, It is good... 
19663 I loves me the X-T10, but it is small and not so easy to hold if you have large hands. This handgrip, while outrageously expensive, helps give a better grip. I wouldn t be without it. One star off for the price. 
19664 Excellent lens 
19665 Housing arrived exactly as described. Shipped and received promptly. Well made and good quality. No problems to 27m depth. See photos from Daymaniyat Islands in Oman attached. 
19666 I like that the hot shoe mount is on the handle to the side and not directly on top of gopro. I also like the foam grip. 
19667 This was purchased for my daughter for her DC trip. Takes great pics and very easy to use. After seeing the photos she took I want one for myself! 
19668 Good quality and good fit. Very satisfied 
19669 One of the batteries was defective or was not compatible with my Sony A77ii. The charger would not charge & stopped working a few days after initial use, & left me in a lurch work-wise. Would not recommend. 
19670 Does not fit Panasonic Lumix LX100 as some have claimed. Looks like a solid case otherwise. 
19671 Great option if your camera doesn t have a pre made version available. Nikon d5300 
19672 Great lens and probably the least I ll ever spend on a lens by far. Image quality is really nice can t believe this lens was so affordable. 
19673 Awesome accessory for my Olympus TG-4 
19674 Good 
19675 Flew for 5 minutes. No longer will lift of the ground. Don t waste your money. 
19676 I love it a great purchase would bye it again 
19677 excellent product. 
19678 Nice unit, very afforable. 
19679 Perfect,just what I needed. 
19680 A+ 
19681 Camera came and didn t record video, just took pictures. I returned it. 
19682 Works very well 
19683 Works as described. 
19684 great design, not dorky looking.. great space, fits my Phantom 3 pro + 2 bats very well.. raincover is a plus 
19685 grandson loves how clear the underwater vedio s are 
19686 Fit perfectly on my D200. 
19687 It had a bad camera and it would barley fly outside and the controls were very difficult to control. 
19688 I like it. I just understood it had wifi. 
19689 Super solid tripod. Great deal for your money. It s a steal, really. Highly recommend to people looking for a high quality tripod in the sub-$150 range. 
19690 Beautiful 
19691 Loved it! Best price and great pictures! 
19692 Thank you 
19693 not good...-.-;; 
19694 I have liked the results of using these filters. 
19695 I love the zoom-great deal 
19696 Batteries both fit perfectly. Holds a good charge. Obviously a great bargain. 
19697 They work, a bit more flimsy than one would prefer, but THEY WORK! 
19698 Nice wifi cams. I set them to record to my 3T external drive. Easy setup and a decent picture for the price. 
19699 good quality works great 
19700 It easily slips off but it s overall standard 
19701 Its a must have for the gopro! Easy to install and stays on through case removal after case removal. Must have! 
19702 These cleaning cloths are perfect for cleaning my touchscreen and portable too! Plus they come in great packaging to keep them all together! 
19703 Big, but beautiful results and isn t that what you really want? 
19704 Excellent ! 
19705 Great deal. I am very pleased with this purchase. The camera takes great pictures and has lots of great festures. 
19706 I am very satisfied with the package of 47 street photo. several useful accessories. as far as I gopro camera 4K super-happy with the performance. excellent resolution and crisp videos. 
19707 Great tetelscope! 
19708 Great! :) 
19709 It s a bit small for an Iphone 6 plus 
19710 works great! 
19711 Works great a+++ 
19712 Fit right on the camera, good quality 
19713 The alarm is fine if that is all you want, but the &#34;chime&#34; setting is loud and harsh and blares in your customers ear as they walk through the door. 
19714 perfect to my d3200, good hand Grip and more power to shoot. 
19715 great. 
19716 nice to be able to charge 2 batteries at the same time. You have to wiggle the batteries a little sometimes to get them plugged in correctly 
19717 Exactly what I needed; arrived in great time for upcoming cruise. A handy device 
19718 Delivered what was described, quickly. 
19719 Works perfectly. 
19720 Excellent 
19721 Good for the price. 
19722 good camera. everything fine 
19723 my batteries seem to last forever when you can put two together. plus the grip is comfortable. 
19724 Exact replacement at less than half the Verizon phone systems cost to me😃 
19725 Used it a lot until I bought the 18-250 lens 
19726 Really nice boom stand, as other reviewers said, this is a really nice stable and sold product. Im really happy with it. 
19727 I m very satisfied 
19728 complete camera for all ocasions 
19729 Perfect fit 
19730 Worst 
19731 Love the camera! Looks and works great! 
19732 Nice 
19733 This works great lots of features, interchangeable lenses, 
19734 Love this! It works exactly as described and very easy to install and can be moved around the house as needed. 
19735 it worked cliffdiving from 40ft! with the string was longer though 
19736 good, but on the smaller side 
19737 I got what I expected, I can t complain? 
19738 The axis are too loose..never expect to be disappointed for this... 
19739 As expected! 
19740 Product just as advertised. Great merchant 
19741 good 
19742 Piece of junk. Simply does not work and instructions were for a completely different device. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM. I filed a claim with Amazon and we will see what happens. I am not going to return to China. 
19743 Nice bag! 
19744 Velvia never disappoints. 
19745 great 
19746 Awesome product 
19747 cheap. but do the job. 
19748 The product is great and we have not had any problems with it. It was delivered ahead of scheduling and the packaging was well done. 
19749 It s Wasabi Power. Charger, batteries work great. Much less than the Panasonic batteries in cost. 
19750 With a go pro it s hard to balance this thing getting it to balance without moving is easy but keeping it balance while moving seems impossible but maybe it s just me lol 
19751 Great value and great quality lenses. I m shocked at how good it is. 
19752 Good replacement 
19753 Mounted it on the ceiling, it works well, nice pix. 
19754 Absolute must have to protect expensive lenses from impact damage.... 
19755 The card makes it worth while, but probably won t use most of the items. 
19756 So far so good. An improvement over previous models. Touch screen. Easier navigation through menu opens. Easier download to memory card and thus to editing. 
19757 One battery lasts my just under a year in my range finder, playing three times a week. 
19758 Worked great 
19759 love it. 
19760 Considerably over priced, I believe. 
19761 They seem to have worked great while being used on my first dives and first time use of the GoPro! 
19762 Stands are very weak and wobbly. Lenses are mediocre. 
19763 Nice camera! 
19764 Shipping was a little bit late, 4 days but that was on USPS not on the seller. Great lens great quality and not full price :) cant be happier. 
19765 The LCD screen did not work 
19766 Item was fairly priced-described just as I got it-shipped quickly-great purchase 
19767 as advertised. 
19768 I love this camera...easy to use and SHARP pictures. The quick video button is a newer feature and GREAT! This is my 4th cannon camera and I would not consider buying any other brand. Focus Camera bundles are great money savers. 
19769 I m always trying to find the right mount, screw, whatever for all the mounts for my GoPro. This gives me a little more to work with. Felt it was priced a little high for what I got, though. 
19770 bad panel. Hooked it up and just made clicks. don t buy 
19771 Fits my Canon 430 flash well; snaps right on and does not fall off. Great item at a good price. 
19772 Easy to install, great picture day or night. 
19773 This is an amazing lens. I took it out for a test drive and it blew my mind in reach, clarity and contrast. 
19774 The harness looks very well made. I am looking forward to giving the Geekpro and chest harness to my Grandson for his 14 th Birthday Nov 2nd. I will be happy to review it at that time. 
19775 Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! 
19776 Great product. Fast shipping. Thank You. 
19777 Great product. 
19778 Waste of money. Terrible distortion. 
19779 Fantastic light or the price. Pretty well built stand too. I appreciate the fact that it has 5 switches so that I can get exactly the amount of light I want. I did drop one start though because one of the 5 bulbs was defective and did not work. 
19780 DJI battery what can I say, it works well. 
19781 perfect carrying case for the fujifilm instaxmini8 
19782 These have every look and feel of OEM GoPro mount clips. 
19783 The hprc case is amazing. Just what I expected. Heavy duty baby. The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is the foam layout was different than the picture. I wasn t sure if I received the correct case or not. 
19784 Not a great camera. My fault should have read more on it. Too slow to take a second shot. 5 second delay. Quality not as good with final photo. 
19785 These batteries are okay. They drain too fast for me and don t put out as power as I think they should. 
19786 Greatest glasses cleaner out there 
19787 Perfect, and so much better than paying at a retail store. 
19788 Just received mine yesterday. It s very comfortable and light, which makes my Nikon seem lighter when I have it over my shoulders. I also like the color designs on this strap plus it s not expensive. I d recommend others buying this brand of camera neck strap. 
19789 Bought this to store/carry all parts for Sylvania 9-inch portable DVD players (2 screens). Both players fit along with all the cords, chargers, etc. and 2 DVDs. Perfect. 
19790 Works great! Plug it into my laptop and upload my photos quick. 
19791 It functions as advertised - price is right. 
19792 great product thank you 
19793 broke on 1st use 
19794 Bought 2 neither one works. Waste of money. 
19795 works well sofar 
19796 Poor product. The lens is so lousy it cuts your pictures. The camera is so poorly engineered that the film gets stuck. The film is so small. The old polaroid was perfect why did they have to change it ? 
19797 No good resolution 
19798 Works very well on my Nikon. Very comfortable. 
19799 Sensors work as expected and you get 5 of them at a nice price. 
19800 It was pretty great, until it broke after about a month of use. The attaching screw on the bottom snapped in half, so now I can t attach a monopod or anything of the sort to it, therefore rendering it pretty useless. I got what I paid for, I guess. 
19801 Love it...perfect for selfies. 
19802 works very good on my helmet and very pleased. Thanks!! 
19803 Great price for this one! It s a steal! 
19804 I really can t find a fault with this light. It is bright and the quality of light is good. It has barn doors, a remote and other accessories. This is a very good product. 
19805 Works as described, arrived on time and with no problems. I use it in my daily log and it s great. 
19806 Scope works great. The program is a bit skepitcal. 
19807 You get what you pay for. Replaced it after a year. 
19808 Nice! 
19809 great product. 
19810 Works perfect for my camera!! 
19811 worked great 
19812 Can t figure out how to use the stupid thing. Instructions are as poor as they come!! Wouldn t recommend it to anyone. 
19813 I Traded in my Canon 7D, which I never really enjoyed (it has since been discontinued), after purhasing this camera! I love this camera - the pictures look amazing! 
19814 It works well. It helps me stabilize the camera when I shoot. 
19815 Just purchased this and found it only fires at full power on manual and TTL is stuck on one power as well. Tested it on several attempts. Hoping this is just a fluke. 
19816 Very durable and sturdy strap 
19817 very reliable 
19818 Has come in pretty handy 
19819 Not made cheap this is a steardy tool I use it on gun range in windy days does more then I expected it be for $ thanks for the deal 
19820 Works perfectly. Definitely adds bulk, but worth it to only need to charge my daily-use camera once a month. 
19821 Works well. Just a tad off in color though. 
19822 Great Deal, Fine product, Five Stars***** 
19823 Amazing~! I love it. Holds really well on most surfaces--glass, body panels on a car, most flat surfaces. Grip is extra tight. Get this! End of the story. 
19824 did not work for the model it says it does 
19825 The aluminum material was too lightweight and the head was not fluid enough for my needs so I returned it. 
19826 It works perfectly for me. It gives that extra light that I need and having the shoebox gives it a softer and warmer affect. Very pleased. 
19827 Works extremely well and can be used with either eye by turning the eyecup. 
19828 Great inexpensive tripod bag does the job, was a bit small but I can not blame the bag for my tripod for being a few inches to big Good price good quality travels nicely 
19829 Good for mounting outside 
19830 Fits well into the camera. Would have liked a car solution as well, but that was not promised. 
19831 This is inexpensive and does a good job. 
19832 solid app. worth the price. Caught my dog turning on my gas oven.. No joke 
19833 Works great! 
19834 beautiful and good quality 
19835 This is a great accessory for hiking, or really any hands free activity. The hat clip is genius, I like to clip mine to a bandana. 
19836 Comfortable and stylish 
19837 Bought this for my new lens and it is awesome. Easy to fit. A great purchase! 
19838 survived my purpose and the price was right 
19839 Nikon is the best! 
19840 It could be a little bit louder and a little more vicious sounding but I think it works fine 
19841 This accessory kit is amazing! You have so many options of ways to film from your GoPro! 
19842 Very light weight and easy to use. Takes great photos. Purchased for my wife and she prefers it to her Iphone. 
19843 A good product. Fast battery charging. Displays information accurately. Battery is compatible with fujifilm xp80. 
19844 I am satisfied with device and the product support. AR004218 was very supportive at DLink. 
19845 using it with the sony rx1r. Does the job even though a bit overpriced. 
19846 Having problems with some of the futures to my camera when the battery pack is connected. As for the power supply it works great. 
19847 Great handle for a gopro 
19848 great 
19849 Was not a Honeywell part, rather a generic off-brand replacement. Does work, but not what I thought I was buying. 
19850 Awesome 
19851 Pretty good protection and pricing, however it s a bit hard to take my Xiaomi Yi Camera out of it. The camera kind of gets stuck inside. I still use it daily though since I have bunch of goPro accessories to use between this and my Hero4 Silver. 
19852 Thank you, arrived as stated. 
19853 Nice color, nice design, durable fabric 
19854 Remote shutter release. Works as promised. There are cheaper alternatives out there, but I had two cheaper ones that stopped working after a while. 
19855 Could not get a clear picture Returned 
19856 Perfect! 
19857 This seller is fantastic! They have excellent customer service and their prices and products are great! I am a very satisfied repeat customer! 
19858 Great for most situations, It would have been perfect if it had a 180 degree rotation so that it can be bounced of side walls. 
19859 Arrived quickly and works as it should. Instruction aren t very good but YouTube can help you with that. 
19860 Great product and works really well. I use it as my outdoor cam without any issues. 
19861 Perfect! 
19862 Inexpensive and good quality. Will likely upgrade to higher wattage bulbs, though stands and umbrellas are great. Good customer service as well...they send-out replacement for broken bulb immediately. 
19863 Great little action camera. Well worth the price. 
19864 good quality everyday backpack. comfort, style, alot of pockets. 
19865 Camera case was great recommend this if you have move video Camera 
19866 Perfect an fast delivery 
19867 Great lens on a 5DsR. 
19868 Perfect 
19869 Ignore the negative reviews! I got this to see what my puppy is doing in the when given new freedom. Setting up the internet connection is not easy but following the directions closely will work. Very awesome! 
19870 Good communication and quick shipping. Excellent product-much better than expected. Does not leave filmy streaks like the others I ve tried, they disappear immediately and you don t need to go over your screen again. Can be reused several times. Great on cell phone screens, Ipad, Ipod, etc..Highly recommend 
19871 Item arrived as described. Quick ship. Highly recommend! 
19872 Don t use it 
19873 Great camera. My daughter loves it! 
19874 Made of metal so it s more resilient and can hold up to a lot of use. Threads seem to line up nicely and go on without a fight. 
19875 Great value brought for a present the individual didn t want it. 
19876 Took it to Europe buy plane and train, came back and it s like new. 
19877 Danny at Foscam helped me with the port forwarding so I could view the cameras on my mobile device while away from home. He was fast, easy tho understand and professional. 
19878 This is a standard UV filter. It appears to be performing just fine, 
19879 OK combination of price and performance. 
19880 Eh worth about what it costs 
19881 This was a gift to complement my daughter s 10th bday gift. It was a perfect fit and she loves all the extras. She has not yet tried the selfie adaptation but the rest I would recommend. The delivery was extra fast which was a great plus in my book. 
19882 Works great! Simple to use, paired easily with my S5. Much better selfie, and will use this a lot for event pics. Compact size fits in purse. 
19883 The device is pretty good, does it s job, nothing special about it, the clicking sound is a bit annoying but otherwise it s ok to know if it s still moving or not. https://youtu.be/yoQnYusGtPo 
19884 Great case. Fits camera like a glove. Leather and stitching excellent. Even ithough it was shipped form China, I got it in less than 2 weeks 
19885 bad 
19886 So many tripods to choose from, why not just get one from Amazon? I couldn t be happier! Tripod has very sturdy build, can be set to any height you desire, and any of the adjustments will stay tight wherever you put them. 
19887 Fits well. As advertised. 
19888 Hard to get camera in and out of case 
19889 Super easy to install and great picture. 
19890 small - compact - safe - wellmade 
19891 got this as a gift 
19892 perfect for what I wanted...holds plenty but isn t too bulky....very comfortable 
19893 this item is designed very well and installed pretty easy 
19894 They send me a completely wrong battery in a A640PX box. Don t buy this if you re looking for this battery! Very dissapointed. 
19895 It was nice to have these extra battery packs for my honeymoon! Worked wonderfully and would recommend to anyone! 
19896 love it 
19897 This is one of the best monitor we have worked with so far. Super easy useful interface, very well thought design, light weight, luts via SD card insert. It is worth every penny. Big respect for SmallHD to put such a product. 
19898 not bad 
19899 All the items in the picture arrived. I didn t test all yet, but at least looks good and work. 
19900 Been waiting for this truly wireless video security solution for a long time. It works exactly as I d hoped. I recommend this system to everyone that will listen. Go ahead and pass Go. 
19901 not a dvr 
19902 I haven t used it that much yet. Still learning. But so far everything Seems to be working just fine. 
19903 Beyond happy with the purchase might be expensive but well worth every penny, I had a phantom fc40 before but this well surpasses every phantom so far in every way, well imo it does the inspire was to expensive 
19904 typical 
19905 Perfect, works as intended 
19906 Really like having lens clip holder on my camera strap. I don t always take my camera bag or have pockets to put lens cap in. This solves that problem! 
19907 Love it. 
19908 Got this for my wife who s an amateur photographer. The kit comes with everything you need for a quick and easy lighting boost. From making home videos to shooting scenes outdoors, it works great. The price was excellent and gives you a lot for the money. 
19909 Took small tumble to the side and these cracked without even protecting the props. Chipped a prop and completely broke off a guard. Cheap pieces of s***. Very light though 
19910 Works perfectly as described. Anyone with a DSLR should have one of these (really though, they should just come with the camera...) 
19911 As addvertized 
19912 excellent item, solved my problem 
19913 Wonderful camera! Got it for my 10-year-old daughter for her birthday and it s her favorite gift! Love it! 
19914 Holds camera, USB cord and batteries fine. Less expensive than similar cases offered by camera manufacturers. 
19915 Does t put out much Ir light. the video camera has some IR led s and I see no improvment when I add this for extra light. 
19916 Great deal and excellent product for our purpose. 
19917 Perfect fit for my DSLR but the sting broke within a couple months of use :( 
19918 Fast shipping looks good works awesome battery doesn t last long do wich sucks connects to any smartphone doesn t have a motorcycle helmet attachments only for bike helmet wich sucks but other than that it s awesome 
19919 never worked peace of crap 
19920 it s hard to remote this DVR. 
19921 Great lightweight tripod. 
19922 Love this to turn any purse into a camera bag. I took it on a trip to Prague and it was perfect! I had a canon rebel t3i and batteries, Chargers, etc with plenty of room. 
19923 Just bought this product and two cameras don t work at all 
19924 Who do I send this back to ??? Amazon or zmodo 
19925 doesn t really fit the rx100-3 but is fine on my rx100 
19926 Works great with my Sony camera! 
19927 Not sure why people say it was stiff? It s probably the softest strap I ve ever felt. The next best strap would be an Artisan and Artist silk strap, but they re way more expensive. 
19928 Loud enough ! Works great ! Sensor is super accurate ! 
19929 Very nice monopod. The carbon fiber is very strong and this thing can take a load. Very impressed with the fit and finish of this item. Benro makes a Quality piece. 
19930 An extra battery is always nice to have on hand and if it is already mounted, even better. The grip works just great, but the remote is another story. I have followed the the directions and can not get it to work. 
19931 Great little shoulder rig for the price. Used it yesterday on a shoot and did the job perfectly. 
19932 Works great as expected. A goodvalue 
19933 A great alternative to using the one by Nikon, cost effective and sturdy, no issues works great. 
19934 Item performed great on our recent trip. Item delivered on time. Batteries charged & worked right out of the box. Very convenient on trips. Will order another set. 
19935 Love it. 
19936 Purchased for the tamron 150x600. VERY tight fit. Not ideal for this lens 
19937 Great 
19938 love it 
19939 when you turn the camera , I realized that in the configuration the WiFi option is not listed, this camera brings wifi? Help me configure the wifi 
19940 Works great 
19941 Came exactly as described. Works great with my GoPro Hero. 
19942 Clarity is good. A little too sensitive at night - even after adjustment. 
19943 Works great with my lumix. Would have loved an extra pocket for a extra sd card. 
19944 fits very well!! would buy again 
19945 Good as it is Nikon s. 
19946 I will give them a 6 Star if I could. It does not matter where I am I can see my pet. Great colors. Delivered on time and does everything the sellers says it suppose to do. 
19947 Not worth the money. The battery cannot be changed. Picture quality was bad. Returned it. 
19948 Wonderful 
19949 This is a great case. Fair price, keeps my expensive Nikon 5200 safe and snug. Plenty of pouches for other things, batteries, chargers, SD cards, etc. Highly recommend. Good quality. 
19950 Excelent for the price, but don t expect durability. 
19951 I installed this button camera on my clothes with a mini DVR, it looks very good, and no one knows this is a camera. Like it. 
19952 Just what I needed. Very White cloth. Very portable. 
19953 Great product at a great price! 
19954 Works well. 
19955 It s was just could meet d expectations 
19956 The action pack is a better deal. Wish I had waited. 
19957 Item does well jobs as described. Thanks. 
19958 just what I was looking for. 
19959 Good product 
19960 Very useful and great. 
19961 Half of the pictures would develop and the other half never turned out. Waste of money. 
19962 Thank you 
19963 As with everything Phantom 3 it s tough, durable and beautifully engineered and constructed. 
19964 Exactly as described and just what I needed to round out my Nikon d3200. :) 
19965 this backpack fits everything and I take it everywhere. I especially liked it it has straps that can hold my tripod on one side and the stabilizer on the other. There also pockets for all your little accessories including ST cards. It is also made of really really good quality. 
19966 This item was a waste of my money. It never worked right out of the box. The instructions were not in English and it went downhill from there. 
19967 1 
19968 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
19969 The description says &#34;Which Has The 18-55mm Lens&#34;... Lens cap (Polaroid) says right on it: 52mm. It does not fit a 55mm lens. Not the first complaint about this...but they still do not change the description. 
19970 Perfect for my telescope needs 
19971 The camera is that easy, or you can do it all manually. I love my new camera, and I am learning how to take a better quality picture with all the different options. 
19972 Perfect for the basics, holds camera extra lens, batteries and filters 
19973 Quit working after 2 weeks. 2 did the same thing don t buy. 
19974 Works great! 
19975 Works well, seems to be pretty steady and sturdy. 
19976 Saved me $90 from having to take it in to my local camera shop and clean dust off the sensor. Thanks! 
19977 Excellent product just as advertised. Well built solid. Only complaint Is view finder must be at a angle when opening or it hits the top of cage. Arrived 2 weeks early love that. 
19978 Great camera at a great price 
19979 Seems to be a nice bag just what I was looking for good size and movable dividers inside on Velcro 
19980 Good photos and video quality with shown mounts. Good for basic and occasional usage. L 
19981 Nice to be able to use my old lens again. 
19982 It fits perfectly with my requirements I even use it for my underwater photography. 
19983 Was spectacle at first, but they did the job as expected. Glad I brought these diving goggles!!! 
19984 Well done, I Like 
19985 Seems to be very solid quality 
19986 Works as advertised, no complaints. 
19987 Perfect camera for our kids works great easy to use. 
19988 Perfect 
19989 Items work great. Perfect description. FSt delivery. Great price. Over alll excellent transaction 
19990 It works well for my purposes. The app is easy to use. Replacement cameras are not too expensive 
19991 Nice camera. I ve made many a picture and memory with this camera. 
19992 Love it amazing 
19993 good deal! 
19994 Love this lens. First copy had front element fall out of it, as it was only secured by glue. Had to buy a second copy, but image quality and usability is great. 
19995 Haha good junk camera! 
19996 Fits my T5i like a glove 
19997 Great illumination from this. Saved from replacing a camera in which the IR died. Can now use at night without issue. 
19998 it did what i wanted 
19999 really good heavy duty camera... its a pain to adjust you need allen wrenches but other than that its a great camera 
20000 Too small for anything! 
20001 This is a great bag at the price I was looking for. I like that I can put my laptop in it, but it does make things cozy for my fat camera. I d buy this again. 
20002 perfect for capturing about 2 hrs of video 
20003 Saw the stand broken upon opening the box. I had wished to place the unit on a table but as a result of the broken stand had to screw it to the wall. 
20004 Floats phone in water and with a waterproof case. Fits great on any size wrist, even kids and stays on wrist. 
20005 This is a decent mic for the money and I have no complaints 
20006 Great product, just wish the cable was a little longer but not a deal breaker. 
20007 Didn t come with the 8GB card and had to send back. 
20008 Fits my T5i and extra batteries. Great for anyone who films. Also fits in another bag so you don t look sus with a camera everywhere. 
20009 Yes this is very good, easy release or attach for camera with help of ball release 
20010 Awesome product it is great for the price and works really well. 
20011 Actualy works 
20012 Value formoney 
20013 As expected. Very satisfied with the product. 
20014 Easy to use! 
20015 A most have for go pro owner, the go pro battery only last 2 hours max so it good to carry few back ups just in case. i have 4 of these because i go out on long hikes 
20016 Works great! 
20017 This camera was the perfect replacement for our parking area 
20018 It s a great looking strap, it s not that comfortable but what to be expected. It look beautiful with my film camera. 
20019 Great camera, easy to use. feels good, great pictures. 
20020 Love the camera, easy to use and great pictures 
20021 So far have had good signal strength with my fatshark goggles. Definitely needs power filtering, without filtering I was getting all kinds of horizontal white lines. I tossed in a cheap UBEC and then it went perfectly clear. Range tests coming soon! 
20022 Met my needs. 
20023 These cameras work very well. They were easy to setup and once they were setup I was able to go wireless. Work great with my Android phone. Looks like a good design and seem very durable. Try one or two like I did. 
20024 I like it overall, not always the best quality in low light 
20025 Very high quality battery for GoPro Hero 4 Black ed. Just like OEM battery from GoPro. Worth every cent. 
20026 Great product 
20027 I just received my set. I m now going to purchase units for ALL of my lenses. It s a great investment. I have noticed some vignetting when mounted on my 16-35mm f/4. That one might be returned. The 24-70mm 2/8 seems fine. 
20028 Did the job just right for what I wanted to do. I clipped it to a Garmin bean bag mount. 
20029 Great product. strong/sturdy/nice case/well made 
20030 Excellent!!! Great price. Prompt service 
20031 will not record for me! 
20032 I got mine.. And after one day it refuse to turn on.. I charged the battery but still isn t working.. Planning for a refund! 
20033 Fast delivery, product as described. Would do biz, again. LOVE this monopod! 
20034 Fit well, easy to install 
20035 Generally good, but i m in the bushes and trees a lot. The adhesive that attaches the strap to the lens cap is not good enough for me. 
20036 Excellent tri pod. I use it for my spotting scope. Light weight and fits in my backpack. 
20037 Okay. 
20038 Wish the camera came with this, works like it is part of camera! 
20039 This accessory kit fits my canon camera prefect. It is a great accessory to have to protect the len. 
20040 Super 
20041 Easy to work. Good quality. 
20042 great 
20043 Great camera, clear pictures with vivid colors. Like the long range zoom 
20044 purchased this pristine camera with battery grip, magnifier eyepiece, sigma flash. Well-pleased with everything i have used so far; have not used flash. Shutter count was low 1500. Seller answered all my questions to my satisfaction and i recommend this seller. 
20045 Not a very good replacement for the Panasonic branded battery. Short life, very fast rolloff of power at end. Wouldn t recommend, wouldn t purchase again. 
20046 Connects very quickly with other Yongnuo and Canon products. 
20047 Exactly what i was looking for. I use it a lot. 
20048 So light and worked perfectly on my rafting trip! Fit nicely on my helmet! 
20049 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
20050 The D750 camera is everything Nikon says it is. 
20051 Received in a timely manner and as advertised. Haven t utilized all of them yet but they do fit well on the adapter ring for my PowerShot. Thanks. 
20052 Another perfect fit for my studio from the good folks at Cowboy Studios. 
20053 Does what its supposed to. Easy to install. I recommend using a UV filter along with this to protect the exposed contacts on the back of the lens... the adapter has the treading for the filter so its perfect. 
20054 Good strap, but has a tendency to want to twist around & the placed side ended up facing out. 
20055 Nice camera for the price! 
20056 little poor quality zipper 
20057 I carry a Sony DSLR camera and several attachments in it. Not a lot of extra room, but enough. 
20058 Concept s OK but battery does not really last long. I used it few times but battery does not last +2 hours albeit I charge it full when I first got it. Not sure if I got a bad unit. 
20059 Great stuff for great price though the step up has wifi 
20060 Perfect fit, was a replacement for the one I lost. 
20061 So when I ordered these, I though they where air cushioned, they are not they are spring, however, they are 100% metal and I have no fear of the clamps letting go on them... They would be 6 stars I hey where also air cushioned 
20062 MORE THAN ENOUGH WIRE SERVED ITS PURPOSE GOOD BUY 
20063 Very easy set up. Quality of camera s is good during day and night. Able to view from smartphone with ease. I like being able to monitor my home while I am at work. 
20064 Very pleased with the camera. The instructions for the WiFi connection are sorely lacking. Fortunately Nikon was able to walk me through the procedure. 
20065 Great!!! 
20066 The lenses are a little smaller than I was expecting. But other than that they re really nice. Fit well and do not fog up at all. The zebra lenses are great from driving in bright sun to biking through shaded trails. 
20067 too big 
20068 I wear reading glasses and this help me see what I am taking pictures of without them. 
20069 Love this camera bag. Is the pecfect size, compact, not to big. My Canon EOS Rebel T6i with a 18-135mm lens fits perfectly! 
20070 Display is barely readable after only a few weeks of operation. Logitech has lost their hold on the WiLife market. 
20071 Exactly what we needed 
20072 These &#34;bags&#34; provide great protection for my Canon lenses. I keep a small Canon Vixia video camera in the largest bag. 
20073 Great Camera, for the price picture resolution a lot better than my cam s that came with my DVR. Im going to replace my other two cameras... 
20074 great 
20075 So far, so good. Haven t taken it into the water yet...we ll see what the second half of this review looks like... 
20076 Awesome for the money. Be sure to use 720p (60FPS) when shooting fast paced footage 
20077 waste of money!!! Not happy at all. very bad quality. 
20078 The NEST cam is wonderful but......The website to view the recordable is far far less than apealing to use in comparison to the dropcam website. The drop cam website had this ease of use whereas the nest website is slow and has a lot of bugs. Mainly slow...... 
20079 Works just fine 
20080 amazing 
20081 I bought this camera for my recent vacation. I had it in the water with me on several occasions. This camera is excellent for the price. I love the selfie function too. Overall I m very happy with this purchase! 
20082 Great deal!!! 
20083 is working real good. 
20084 Expensive but worth, my daughter love it and have so much fum taking pics with her friends! Received it quickly and well package. 
20085 I could not get the camera to charge, so I returned it. 
20086 So easy to set up and use. It s very practical. The Nest Cam gives us peace of mind when we re away from home. 
20087 as described. Thanks! 
20088 simple to use, excellent starter camera set for my friend s 14 year old daughter 
20089 Pretty cool toy, Easy to fly and best value! 
20090 Just Okay, Rarly use it due to its flimsy nature. Don t be fooled by it s rugged appearance. The part that turns is loose and never is really stable. Good for hanging a small LED light. 
20091 I wanted to tell you how pleased i was with the way my order was handled. It arrived earlier thank expected and the product was just as described. The customer service was \\ top notch\\ thank you 
20092 Great value pack for the price can t beat it batteries last longer than I thought they were gonna too 
20093 I never regret buying this. Great product by a great company which I have known since I was about 4 or 5 years old (in 1995 I guess) 
20094 They work, but was hoping they d be a little longer on the handle side. Probably would not buy again. 
20095 Works great! Good for placing plants in your house that have certain light requirements. 
20096 Great product for the price!! 
20097 This screen protector fits my Canon 5D iii with amazing precision and clarity. DEFINITELY an A+ 
20098 It works very well but the lens cap is very hard to take on and off. 
20099 Great bag, well padded and just the right amount of storage for day to day use. 
20100 Awesome product 
20101 LOVE the zoom.... really great so far. 
20102 Works Just fine. Would recommend 
20103 Not as listed and had white screen P O S!!!!!!! 
20104 Upon arrival, the rubber part came 75% off from the hard plastic frame that slips over the bracket. This was why I bought a replacement, as my original one had finally pulled apart after three years. The replacement was useless. 
20105 I like my tripod a lot. It s everything I needed. 
20106 A little cheezy for the price, but interesting to experiment with. 
20107 Great price and quality 
20108 Recommended, but slightly pricey. 
20109 Very good. Worked well. I have the door open at my store and need it something to let me know when someone enter. 
20110 Could be a little more sturdy 
20111 One of the batteries failed after one month. The camera simply doesn t register that it s there anymore. The other works just as well as my Sony battery. I average about 400-500 shots per battery, but I have airplane mode turned on and auto-focus off (Sony a7ii). 
20112 This step up filter adaptor is made aluminum instead of brass, so it has a tendency to bind. 
20113 My husband has not complained at all! 
20114 Great for what I need, not a professional, but works fine. 
20115 Great fit! 
20116 THE BEST AND SLICK LOOKING 
20117 I ve been using this everything has been great 
20118 Good product, have used it a lot. 
20119 LOVE THESE!!! Easy setup and install. Great quality product and super clean HD picture, both IR night vision and daylight. Very happy with these. 
20120 No problems. Got exactly what I ordered. 
20121 This Battery delivered a full 100% charge for the 1st few months, then dropped down to achieving only a maximum of a 50% charge... This is unacceptable as now I can no longer rely on it being a backup for my camera due to limited capacity... 
20122 Love it 
20123 Really easy to set up, you can do so with just your smart phone, some knowledge of networks/routers helps do the advanced features. 
20124 Best security camera there is. Motion activated, everything is recorded on SD card, but could be connected to wifi and be monitored remotely. 
20125 I picked this up as a spare for my 2015 Yamaha V1 Waverunner. It is is comfortable and seems to be a much better quality than the one that came with my unit. This has replaced the original as my primary lanyard. 
20126 Easy to handle, frame picture and carry around. 
20127 Great price, works well, will buy from this vendor again 
20128 fast shipping and good product. all mentioned item complete and works perfectly. 
20129 Very cool if you love science!! 
20130 Nikon !!!! no need to say more. 
20131 I liked the product but it took a long time to arrive. 
20132 Excellent price and works great 
20133 Amazing value for the price. Very high quality. If i dropped these in the ocean I would go out and buy another pair that day. 
20134 wonderful item, fast shipping, love them! 
20135 Great additional lens for my Nikon camera...great price..delivered quickly. .would buy again or recommend ! 
20136 I don t use it very often but it does the job. 
20137 The camera box arrived with a hole in the side and the camera has two chips in the paint plus small surface scratches on the face side at the shutter area. Beware on this camera. Not happy at all. 
20138 Love that it syncs my photos with my cloud storage. 
20139 WORKS AS INTENDED 
20140 ok 
20141 I HATE harsh flash effects. This will soften everything regardless of the angle of the head. Yes. it reduces effective range, but that is what software is for. 
20142 They were not bright enough 
20143 So far so good. I sold my Nikon DSLR for this and everything seems to be good. Image quality and zoom are amazing. It also has very good stabilization in the videos. 
20144 Very good accept for the sound. 
20145 had to use tin foil to make them work correctly 
20146 Best sandals (flip flops) I ve ever owned. However, a bit pricey. 
20147 The battery charger works well and SterlingTek was terrific to work with. 
20148 Be aware one of the items screws on counter clockwise. I returned one unit as I thought the threading was broken. 
20149 works good. stores easily 
20150 Excellent package at this price. The screw on lenses are marginal at best. The camera and zooms, however, are excellent. 
20151 vERY VERY GOOD!! 
20152 Really strong, used it on rugged trails for months now 
20153 Great product. Just what i needed. I have only used it for a day, but it feels well manufactured and durable. 
20154 Rigth rear motor (rear black propeler) does nt run fast enougth 
20155 Great Mic for the buck. Can t go wrong. 
20156 Adjustable, comfortable, and because of the rubber lines on the inside, it doesn t slip. Great! 
20157 Does what it says it would. 
20158 So far I love this lens. Nothing bad to say at all 
20159 I thought this would be tricky to assemble and not be sturdy enough to meet my needs, but it affixed to the lens and gives me the needed surge of handling zooming, focusing, and reading the screen with ease! 
20160 Great case, you can adjust it to fit any of your accessories. The camera with underwater case fits perfectly. Compact but very roomy for all your needs. 
20161 Woks well and is relatively easy to setup and fly... however, the lack of rotor guards is a big minus, as they break very easily (the Phantom has optional rotor guards that protect it from breaking when accidentally hitting objects like trees). 
20162 I am super duper SUPER happy with this seller. The lens is beyond perfection and I would think it was brand new unused if someone asked me. I would use this seller again and again! 
20163 A good camera strap to have. 
20164 Excellent 
20165 Not bad. Well constructed but the inner detachable walls in the main pouch don t really line up perfectly anywhere. Pretty awkward to organize. 
20166 a little bulky but work well 
20167 This works great for my gaming lighting set up. Small and portable. Great buy!! 
20168 Perfect for home studio. Great value, easy to set up, and seems to be sturdy. 
20169 I had the opportunity to use it in a recent trip to Cancún. It worked out great to give me the contrast I needed on different lighting situations. Definitely makes the editing process easier in Lightroom. I loved the final results. 
20170 Buyer beware you will Not receive what is pictured. You will get a totally different clamp that will Not work with the 2000 series meters. 
20171 It s working good 
20172 Great product. 
20173 I received this defective product with audio failed. This product can not use for car recorder due to the Polariod mount design limitation. 
20174 This is my first pelican and It definitely stands up to its reputation. Shipped faster than estimated delivery, made it to Illinois in 2 days. I might have to get a second one. 
20175 works great 
20176 alright 
20177 fine 
20178 Snapped on P-tap of V-lock battery with positive pressure. Repurposed this cable to feed 14.4 volts to my Sound Devices. Solid soldering and good contacts. Will buy again. 
20179 This is the perfect replacement/additional battery that we have been looking for. Excellent quality product - Highly recommended! 
20180 This accessory is cute and fun. The case gives the camera a little flare. My daughter loves the stickers. 
20181 THE BEST! 
20182 I had to return two of these, both had a defective leg clamp. Never had a problem with Manfrotto gear before but the same problem twice in a row is too much to ignore. Going to try something different. 
20183 My dog tested it by trying to come through the glass door and it set off the alarm. Good to know it works :) 
20184 Great little widget. It has 1/4 20 tapped holes on its length too but due to angle of bracket I don t see them providing any use except making it lighter. But it does exactly what I needed it to do. 
20185 I am very pleased with my new P600 and also with all of the goodies that came with the camera. The camera has more features then I will ever use but I am having fun trying them all out. 
20186 For less than 5 bucks I didn t expect much, but the overly strong smell of the rubber used to make this, makes me nauseous. Item functions great of you can get around the excessively strong rubber smell. 
20187 Badly directional and doesn t work from very far away. Never used it successfully. 
20188 Great for DIY instead of lefting a pro to fix for you. 
20189 I use this quite a lot. works well.... 
20190 Great zoom lens. Autofocus is perfect. Great for action shots at the baseball games. 
20191 Delivers even before expected... Can t wait to test it ! 
20192 Don t waste your money. None of the buttons are marked making it hard to remember which button is which. 
20193 great camera 
20194 Very pleased with this product. 
20195 Had to return for refund as one of the speakers wouldn t work, video is not very smooth and kept locking up on playback. Great concept that needs refining. 
20196 came as expected. the battery works fine. 
20197 low quality, died during the 1st serious session done with it. you get what you pay for :( 
20198 Great Product 
20199 Work great slide on to rails with ease 
20200 Good product and great performance. 
20201 Good quality for the price. 
20202 aok 
20203 This quality leather camera case was delivered exactly according to the description plus the unmentioned fasteners are also of good quality. The case fits my Nikon D5500 perfectly and I am pleased to recommend it. 
20204 Worked pretty well for looking in the cylinders of my old John Deere. Needed the mirrors to do 90deg that it does not come with. 
20205 Excellent deal! More stuff than I can use right now, but looking forward to learning about this amazing camera. Bag is not big enough to hold all items!!! 
20206 Arrived on time, and works as expected. 
20207 Very good product. 
20208 Not typically a fan of of brand products but how could you say no for the value. 4 batteries, a charger, a mini tripod and more for under $20. What a steal!! Batteries have worked fine so far. 
20209 still using it 3 years later 
20210 App wouldn t work for the people we gave it to. I plan to return it :( 
20211 Works as it should to be. 
20212 Purchased as a gift for someone in surveillance work. They love the lighter weight and clear focus of this choice out of the dozens to choose from. 
20213 Great case for carrying the mini monitor and some extras 
20214 The clip that keeps the case together broke within a week of me using it. 
20215 I m spoiled by a Canon XS50, but the peace of mind of having an inexpensive camera that water can t damage when kayaking is worth what I miss in control and image of photo. The photos are better than I expected and it s waterproof! 
20216 Keeps camera protected, perfect fit. 
20217 Love this! They all work wonderfully! I love to vlog and these help tremendously as it gives a wide view. 
20218 product worked as intended. 
20219 I bought this to go with my range scope since it has a canted eye piece. I can adjust this mount to hold the scope sideways and don t have to strain my neck to see perfectly. It s very stable on the ground. Love it. 
20220 Great! 
20221 Great set up. I wish it came with an owner s manual. I had to download the pdf version, which I can t carry with me when I m out in the world taking photos. But it comes with everything else I need, and takes great photos. 
20222 Tripod was damage. Delivery was fast 
20223 Good Product Works as expected 
20224 It s ok 
20225 it must have cost more to make this than I paid for it 
20226 Still learning all the stuff this camera is capable of.. Way more than I am.. Somewhat confusing menu system but hopefully I will learn.. Seems like good value for cost.. Excellent Leica Lens.. The long telephoto and great stabilization are real pluses.. 
20227 Nice Fit for my new Hero 4 Silver! 
20228 My mom bought this for me for my birthday and I love it! It takes great pictures and it is basically the talk of a party. Film is kind of expensive but it is reasonable. Love it! 
20229 Works great! 
20230 Convenient and easy to use! Great product!! 
20231 This little guy is like a tank. Very sturdy and functional for the price. 
20232 Good camera. Small size. 
20233 great 
20234 Works flawlessly on my X100T - no quality loss, no fringing, no autofocus struggles. Love how versatile it s made my favorite camera!!! 
20235 Item delivered on time and as described. 
20236 very good for watching baby room meanwhile we are away from home 
20237 It works well on lens and glass cleaning. 
20238 works very well 
20239 Battery on the gopro sucks so I had to buy this thing. 
20240 One battery worked, the other looked like it was charging, but never held a charge. If you can find OEM replacements, go with them if possible. 
20241 This thing is great 
20242 It is well made and sturdy. The zippers work well and does not snag. It exceeded my expectations. However, once a DSLR camera and the extra lens is in there, it gets quite bulky. 
20243 In love with my new camera! For the camera, the batteries, the pouch, AND the film, it was such a great price. Worked just like how I expected it would 
20244 Bought as a present for our son and his wife who moved over to USA with pet poodles, allows us to have a look at what they re up to anytime in perfect picture quality and sound. Can even talk to them if we wanted to. 
20245 This little cam is awesome! It is packed with features. And it works very well. I have compared it to a few different gopro and I will say that it s comparable on several levels! And only a fraction of the cost!! 
20246 very good combo 
20247 Great price for TWO batteries and a charger! The charger can be used in a standard US outlet or European outlet (with adapter). The car charger cord is a great addition! 
20248 We love it! 
20249 Very nice quality for the price! I was surprised at how nice it was! 
20250 A+ 
20251 It is pretty large and noticeable when mounted. It works well, easy to assemble and mount. Wish the angle was wider but for the most part it s a good item. 
20252 Came as advertised. Works perfect with my hero4 silver. 
20253 camera shots are not as clear as id expected 
20254 good deal! 
20255 Great 
20256 THIS WAS A VERY VERY GOOD + GREAT BUY!! I WAS SOOO RELIEVED TO SEE THIS AVAILABLE BECAUSE I RECENTLY THREW A BIG GRADUATION PARTY, AND HAD A DIY PHOTOBOOTH SET-UP, SO I REALLY REALLY NEEDED THIS FILM TO WORK, AND IT ALL TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY!! WAS A COMPLETE HIT!!! 
20257 Excelent and original product!!!. Matches perfectly in the LCD of my Alpha 77 II at the first application on it!... Five Stars!!!! 
20258 Lens fogged over after first rain. Get what you pay for !!!! Dont buy used !!!!! 
20259 Thank you very much. My lens filter arrived quickly and I m quite satisfied. 
20260 This is a great camera for those wanting more than just a mobile device snapshot. 
20261 good stuff 
20262 The strap is comfortable but the way it attaches to the camera did not seem secure to me. I wound up sewing it to make sure it did not become unattached. Still a good value though. 
20263 Smooth Transaction! Excellent Product!! A+++ 
20264 As advertised and they even put a signed letter in there thanking us for our purchase. Very classy and great customer service. Highly recommend!!! 
20265 Great product, very useful. Does not flote. 
20266 I really enjoy it! 
20267 Works and fits perfectly for my camera. Fast delivery! 
20268 Wonderful. Nikon D610w50mm + Two extra lens + Battery Charger + Remote + small flashlight + phone + u see it is quite versatile. 
20269 great 
20270 Worked well right out of the box 
20271 Product appears well made. I will be performing accuracy test on the product for proper alignment of laser during culmination. I will update review to five stars if test proves positive. Good package and shipped quickly. Thanks VITE has been working as it should. Very nice product. 
20272 We purchased this as a back up for our camera and choose the Canon as that is what our camera called for also we read some reviews for the knock offs which may not serve as well. 
20273 workds great thats why i got 4 
20274 PERFECT. this lil guy is awesome. i didnt need/want anything fancy....just needed something to hold up my camera that didnt cost $40+! 
20275 These work real well as you can use any wire for your security cameras with this set. 
20276 A few of the items are not the same as in the picture. Very cheap versions of the extra items ( flash, card holder, tripod, etc.) 
20277 So happy with this battery charger. It works well, I have already used it. I will continue to buy from you. 
20278 Great product. Great price. Quick delivery. Thanks. 
20279 Excellent 
20280 Really nice 
20281 It is a bit different from my other canons but I have learned that each time I get a new one I have to reteach myself but this one was fairly easy to pick up. 
20282 This monopod supports my heave lens and camera without any problem I also use the Sirui Aluminium Tilt Head L-10. 
20283 Works great! Good amount of accessories for the price. Green light when done. 
20284 Great camera, very good speed, overall quality and performance. I can t stop taking pics!. 
20285 Great camera. Use it to check on my dogs and it really works very well. Very easy to install. 
20286 I tried the camera 1 time so far. It has a clear picture and love it. Good buy and quality. 
20287 Great value for money. From a bit of a distance, you really can t tell they are fake. 
20288 Really great product and at an exceptional price. 
20289 Good quality, lightweight, and easy to adjust. 
20290 exactly what I was looking for and works great! 
20291 Great value 
20292 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
20293 good 
20294 best 
20295 Great walking around lens. I also use it at work to shoot any product that doesn t require macro. 
20296 Compact and provides great protection. 
20297 this is one of my customers favorite backgrounds, it looks so real. I have used it often. 
20298 good quality product for the price, the case is very resistant and does great the job, about the quality of the images shot with it, a think is like 90%. lens are synthetic so, you will imagine. fit perfectly in 58mm mount. 
20299 Even nicer features than my DJI Phantom 2 Vision. Excellent delivery time and packaging from supplier. Truly “beyond expectations.&#34; 
20300 easy to use and works correctly 
20301 Great Camera! 
20302 Love this lens. Sharpest glass I ever owned. 
20303 My Sony was a bit small for it but it still worked great for white water rafting. Hope to use it in future travels. 
20304 Perfect 
20305 This filter does what it says...protects without introducing distortion. 
20306 The zipper gets jammed easy but it does it s job decently well 
20307 Nice unit worked very well 
20308 This has helped keep my SD cards safe and organized! I am very pleased with this purchase. 
20309 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
20310 WOW, a lot of light for a little money... 
20311 awesome! 
20312 Got my camera quickly and set it up in less than 5 minutes! Works perfectly. 
20313 They work awesome but you can go to any hardware store and spend maybe .50 cents on a 1/4 inch screw and have the same product. 
20314 Very nice bag. Structured and holds everything I needed. Now a limited number remaining, so glad I found one on Amazon. 
20315 This worked perfectly for my nikon D3100. Love all the filters and especially the macro accessory kit. 
20316 Very good item to purchase at the time of buying a drone. 
20317 the Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7DMKII was received in it orginal quality package. The grip was easy to install and use.allows me to take many photos than with the use of one battery, i recommend this Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7D... to others 
20318 This is more camera than I ve ever had. I m still learning how to use it, but the auto mode has gotten me started rather easily. 
20319 Love it, my second one,- does all I need and for the price , one cannot beat it. Newer ones by all manufac have more bells and whistles, all depends what you need and want. AHK 
20320 works well! just what I needed for my Canon 
20321 Did the job. Only thing I d get alongside is some lights. Get some really strong lights, since some small desk lamps just didn t cut it. Otherwise, it s great for beginners who are trying to get into photography. 
20322 Holds a Nikon 650 with a 18-200 telephoto lens. Has a hard bottom that protects everything well. Like it and have used several different bags for camera & lens only. 
20323 I wasn t that pleased with this used camera. My camera (same as above) printed much better pictures until I dropped it. This one every pic is blurry and there is a rainbow that shows up and you have to wait until it clears to take a pic. 
20324 It breaks very easy. 
20325 (-: 
20326 It takes great pictures and video. I am impressed. 
20327 ok 
20328 My 8 year old loves this but the camera was broken (wires were not properly attached). 
20329 Great bag i love it 
20330 TALL...for someone that is 6 foot + tall this is a nice tripod so you don t have to bend as much. Only thing it doesn t have is spikes in the feet if it had those this would be perfect. Smooth operation and easy adjustments. 
20331 this is a fake SJcam but it still works. i was surprised when the wifi actually worked but you have to read instructions to figure out how to use it and for the pin. camera does not do well with fast moving shots but besides that its great. 
20332 Bought these for my wife for travel. She bought me a set a few years ago, really like them, powerful, lightweight, easy to pack. 
20333 Great case! Perfect as a carry-on when flying. 
20334 Returned due to inability to steer correctly. Also, it was used when we received it. 
20335 Exactly as described 
20336 The product was absolutely exactly as described and met or exceeded all expectations. 
20337 Works as expected. After many wild trips to patagonia, my case is doing very well keeping my camera dry and clean. 
20338 Better than expected and better than OEM. 
20339 Highly Recommended! 
20340 Best value package available! 
20341 My best buy last time. 
20342 Fits my EOS camera well and screws firmly into the AstroTech 2&#34; Field Flattener I m using it with. It has a firm lockup and positive release, both of which are great features to have in the dark while using the camera on a telescope. 
20343 You want a great quality camera that s fun to play with... This is it. Best quality and so much fun to play with 
20344 This is quite a good deal on items you want to have on hand if you buy a Canon Powershot camera! Excellent service, great delivery, very good mix of accessory products. 
20345 I am very pleased with this bag. High quality bag. 
20346 Works perfect, especially for $5. 
20347 Excellent! I thought I d never be able to use my portable picture maker again until I found this! Thank you!!!!! 
20348 Great deal. You just cannot have enough batteries or chargers for your electronics. 
20349 Perfect. 
20350 Very nice lens. 
20351 WOW, took 3 weeks to receive, then when I get it it is not even the same product.... everything is in Chinese. DO NOT BUY! 
20352 Great Lens for my Real Estate Business! 
20353 Bought this to have an extra one for my kit lens when I want to detach both lenses from the body for storage. 
20354 I love, I have had it for some time now and I have no issues with it. 
20355 great charger 
20356 I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS SAME ONE AND LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE! 
20357 This is decent, alittle too thick on the padding. but over all was descent. 
20358 Great stuff but pretty pricey. 
20359 great camera 
20360 Replacing the exact set and don t recall them being so right to start. Hopefully break in well. Soles on my old ones just starting to wear after two years of wearing 3-7 days a week. Top side worn as you d expect from heavy use. 
20361 Not much to say here. It worked and did not lose my GoPro. 
20362 great 
20363 Very sturdy. Met my expectations. 
20364 Worked just fine. Thanks 
20365 If im paying $1200 for a drone and it is supposed to be the best on the market i should have to deal with b.s. of having to update it. It should be ready to go right away 
20366 It is very good pic quality even at night. I am waiting to buy one more if price can be a little lower. 
20367 Best 
20368 Couldn t be happier with these! Can t beat it for the price! Works every time and haven t had an issue with it! 
20369 Does not fit the d750. The top piece needs to be much larger and it is not protecting it all the way. Do not buy this for the Nikon d750 
20370 Stick paper on back is terrible. Unit falls off! I ordered two of these and what a mistake that was. Also not that sensitive. I would not but this again. 
20371 Although delivery and packaging were perfectly fine, and apparently there are no scratches outside the case, inside my &#34;Brand New&#34; Pelican 1510 Case has a terrible, terrible cigarette smoke smell! The foam inside smells like complete smoke. I wonder if this is actually brand new. 
20372 not as advertised 
20373 Bought 3 units and they all are working great hope to buy more in the future. 
20374 It s alright. 
20375 the best night and day 
20376 Good 
20377 Works as expected 
20378 nice 
20379 I got this camera for the huge optical zoom feature. However, part way through a vacation in Europe, the camera locked up and stopped working. It is locked in the open position, but won t turn off, on or reset. Bad time to break. 
20380 They told me it would work for GoPro Hero 1 and it doesn t, very dissaponting! 
20381 This wired remote shutter release works very well and can be locked on for long &#34;bulb&#34; exposures. 
20382 So far photos are good, but it has a long delay in turning the screen on. That can be annoying when you miss shots while waiting for the screen to turn on. 
20383 The outdoor connection cable and camera wire need to be cover by duck tape. It is burned when wet. Mine one camera out of 4 was burned. I don t know if I can get a warranty to replace it or not. 
20384 Has very slow shutter speed 
20385 Very easy to set up, and I am able to watch my baby while im at work and she is at home with our Nanny. 
20386 Works well. 
20387 I ve tried several cases and this is the easiest to grab the camera. No more struggling to get the camera out of the bag. 
20388 This works really well ask a baby cam. We can now monitor our 5 months old even if we are in a different room. Great quality at a good price. We purchased it at a different store. 
20389 Excellent design and very comfortable to wear. Good selection and supply of dividers included. Very versatile. well shaped, etc. Can really make great use of the interior space. Superb value. 
20390 Excellent pair of binoculars. Light and compact - my wife has used them for the Muny Opera here In St. Louis and is thrilled with the results ! 
20391 Great Camera s 
20392 What can I say. It works. 
20393 Awesome kit! It was exactly like the discription, very fast shipping and great quality !!! 
20394 Does the job, nothing fancy. I realized too late that I should have bought the one with the remote, but that s no fault of this device. 
20395 great 
20396 Well made, attractive and adds a convenient handle rib to the front. Only negative is it adds to the height of the camera. 
20397 Very good！ 
20398 Perfect! 
20399 I bought this and immediately returned it. The head is made out of plastic and does not sit level when horizontal. 
20400 Great camera for the money 
20401 Hands down the best flash I have ever owned, although I wish I had waited and bought the model that has the built-in radio. Still works great with my wireless triggers. 
20402 Very bad 
20403 Spare battery for my cannon camera. It works just as good as my original 
20404 I had a little trouble with getting it to work with my LifeProof case for my phone at first. I tried it a second time and it works great. No complaints! 
20405 really nice works better than the battery that came with it 
20406 Pease of crap 
20407 Worth the price 
20408 Great products and price for a beginner like myself! 
20409 Great replacement battery 
20410 Great product 
20411 Came in scratched/chipped and clip broke immediately. Video is ok sound is horrible. I use it as a dash cam. So sound wasn t important. Kept it because it as cheap. 
20412 Shall i say more....it s an oem battery and it surpasses all imitators. Good price here on AMAZON 
20413 Works great. Have yet to field test them 
20414 great price and fit and quality 
20415 Clear view, not happy about case 
20416 Broke almost immediately after being delivered to may home. 
20417 It came without the base that attaches to the belt. 
20418 Most pictures came out blurry. My old 16.1 mp camera was much better. All this camera did was prove to me that there is more to pictures than megapixels. Videos came out fine though. 
20419 Pictures come out clear and quality of product is good! 
20420 Great product, great price 
20421 Good buy 
20422 Its very easy to work, its just what I needed! 
20423 Is works fine 
20424 Great fun. Had to re-bind the wifi so it worked but after that, awesome photos and videos 
20425 Nice an useful 
20426 Love this lens! 
20427 Well worth what I paid for it and it was so easy to set up! I ll be getting a few more. May 2016, NOT anymore...they updated and now both my cameras always say offline and will not connect. 
20428 Good product, good price. I like the rapid charger, it takes less time than charging on the computer and having the 3 back up batteries comes in handy. 
20429 Perfect for what I was needing to hold my Video camera while riding. 
20430 Great buy!!! 
20431 I like it 
20432 i totally loved this lens..but it only lasted about 3 years..then the focus element stopped working..:/ so i sold it to someone that was willing to have it fixed..it was too expensive for me..so i don´t have it anymore..someone else is loving it now..:) 
20433 Great case for my new camera and accessories. Plenty of room and easy to organize. 
20434 Great camera, easy to set up. 
20435 Very disappointed. These glasses would not hold a charge. 
20436 Perfect. 
20437 Good. 
20438 This light weight tripod is exactly what I was looking for. I record presentations using an iPod Touch, and this tripod is small enough to pack, tall enough to see over people s heads and strong enough to handle the weight of the device. 
20439 Cheap quality 
20440 A great camera. It s going to take me a while to learn how to use it properly but I m very pleased with it. 
20441 Good buy. 
20442 great battery 
20443 The camera s sensitivity is amazing since I can see even with dim lighting. 
20444 Tried it on a Nikon D3300 and it washed everything out and had a very strong flash even on the lowest setting. Its a nice idea for a flash, but didn t work for me. 
20445 I took about 300 pictures during the first half of my trip to Norway just fine. The next time I turned on the camera one third of the screen had black bars across. I have had the camera less than one week. I am not impressed. 
20446 Works, fits my nex. 
20447 I have long used Nikon but thought i would try Canon. I am not happy with the quality of my pics. I will be switching back and selling this one. 
20448 Just got it today, initial testings looks positive, will update after the filed test. 
20449 Excellent product! Great deal. 
20450 Great product 
20451 No zoom feature. Otherwise works well 
20452 Charder for my battery just fine. The materials that the charger are made from don t seem to be the best quality but it works just fine. It charges quickly and easy to store with it s size. 
20453 Good ítem!! Thanx 
20454 Very great camera for the price! Would recomend to anyone. 
20455 Oh my god,twice as cheap as the Canon type and oh so good. If this is what you need stop now and buy,buy,buy. 
20456 Yes it was in very good condition. Thanks 
20457 Love the lens. Works.just as expected

20459 good 
20460 Great camera 
20461 I mostly love this camera; however, I always have difficulties transferring the files to the computer. The USB doesn t work and the wi fi works most of the time but is very slow and skips files sometimes. 
20462 excellent item, solved my problem 
20463 Very goos 
20464 I m New to dslr photography, these lenses & case appears good quality and fair price. Always look to this seller first for my needs. 
20465 Very good 
20466 Great set!! Everything fits into the bag and easy to use! The lights are wonderful and take great pics! 
20467 Love this camera. It s a bit of a dinosaur, but the lens is top notch quality and has a huge zoom capacity. Easy to use. 
20468 Excelente 
20469 Great Buy ! 
20470 love it 
20471 Overall good product. However, the speed disconnect is wobbly when attached and the knob to turn the mounting screw quickly broke. These issues did not address the functionality too much. 
20472 Thes are a bigger than expected size and I love them! They do not smudge or smear on your lense. Clean and scratch free. 
20473 Stand is cheaply made only used it a couple times and one of the pins came out of the leg. I have it rigged for now. Spend a little more for a better quality product. 
20474 Lightweight and compact design with great power. Well done. 
20475 Great product!! 
20476 happy 
20477 This product works as expected and is well built. 
20478 Used camera on a trip to Canada. Wonderful films! 
20479 works great ... I actually purchased yet another so can adapt (through modification) old Bay 60 filters to my prime nikon lens that I use for scenics. Good price for what you get. 
20480 clasp and handle are cheesy, ready to fall off 
20481 Ohh man! Missing parts in the first fly! 1 in 4 motors stop working! I have to buy the new replacement! The camera no good at all, it s too slow and too dark, need upgrades to 12.Mb 
20482 Doesn t work! It was advertise that it will work with Samsung Google Nexus and it doesn t! 
20483 It works very well. There is even an extra battery that I didn t expect. 
20484 I have so many old slides from the early nineties that I am able to view with ease now. The back light on this Medalight viewer is nice and bright!!! 
20485 Works as advertised. 
20486 This product is awesome! I use this to clamp onto the side of an L bracket on my D750. It gives me another hot shoe adapter for a profoto B1 trigger so I can use off camera lighting alongside a speedlight flash. It is built solid and feels reliable. 
20487 Awesome! Works perfectly. High quality, sturdy. 
20488 It was broken when it arrived. 
20489 I love this tripod I used it for all my recordings and photo shoot ♥ 
20490 Seems good quality & worked for me. Good price. 
20491 No reason not to love it, simple enough! 
20492 Very Well Satisfied with my purchase. 
20493 amazing bag. Fits all my drone gear plus my a7s and 3 lenses and atomos shogun, all batteries.. goddang this is a good bag.. EVERYTHING! audio equipment too 
20494 Excellent so far 
20495 Excellent 
20496 Good camera for the price 
20497 PERFECT for quadrotor video recording paired with FPV. My gopros are a bit too heavy to put on my 250 racer, so this was a no brainer. Quality is on par with my hero 2 and hero3 silver. Size and weight is great and the quality is awesome too. 
20498 Sweet price for a bunch of handy power adapters! 
20499 I love this case. Hold my digital camera and extra batteries in a well-protected bag. 
20500 Will only support a small compact camera. 
20501 Holy moley this camera is a champ!!! Its so clear!! So many features; especially manually! Makes me seem like a pro :). 
20502 We use it to clean lenses that we rent. Its easy to use and has enough &#34;air power&#34; to remove normal debris. 
20503 Crappy video Quality. The 720 statement while technically true makes it sound like it can record HD video. However, the video and picture quality isn t even as good as standard definition 480i tv. 
20504 Great, met all of my expectations 
20505 Hi. Quick delivery. Product conforms. Thanks 
20506 Good product! 
20507 I was surprised at the quality of this - I ve had it on my camera for 2.5 years now and it s still holding up like a champ! 
20508 Great deal for backup and replacement batteries. 
20509 Would not hold a charge returned it Love Amazon they took care of me 
20510 Perfect for all my pictures 
20511 I love it, excellent bubble free screen protector, if you follow the instruction you can apply it in proper place- no hassle, delivery was before time, very good service. 
20512 Good camera but no alerts to my phone at work, sent back and got another that did more the Wi-Fi. 
20513 Super good and best part of this item the price 
20514 To expensive 
20515 They did not meet my expectations. They are not really what I would call microfiber, they are not as soft. 
20516 great case 
20517 A fine lens for a good price, well done Adorama. 
20518 Great product for the price point.. they give off a nice natural light and can be changed many heights and directions. Quite pleased. 
20519 takes great pictures but flash is cheaply made 
20520 Filter performed as expected. I m quite happy with it. 
20521 The battery leaked and the camera spoils. 
20522 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
20523 If you don t have steady hands or can t just pull a piece off to look at then this ain t for you. 
20524 I will order them again when needed. 
20525 great value and excellent product 
20526 these make an incredibly loud cheap sound, making it obvious that they are fake. 
20527 Loved it for the time I had it, became obsolete when the IPhone showed up, but worked well! 
20528 Pretty good looking and nicely made case! 
20529 its ok. ive had better 
20530 these blocks are so cute. the price is great. i didn t want blocks that looked too childish, as i knew i would be using them for years 
20531 For true color, quick setup, portability, must have for professionals. 
20532 Frame worked great. It held our GoPro on our car from NJ to FL! 
20533 Perfect fit and as good as the Canon version. 
20534 Works great! Awesome pricing! 
20535 Used this in the field with good results. 
20536 Works as expected 
20537 works as it should 
20538 Works well and doesn t interfere with controls 
20539 The latest model of Zhiyun,it seems great! I d like to try it! 
20540 Great kit and camera. I only wish it came with a floating handle for taking in the water. If you drop it, that type of handle actually floats with the camera. If they would add that handle to this kit.....it would be perfect! 
20541 Works just fine. I won t say it shoots every time, but it s pretty consistent. 
20542 Pudiera ser mejor. 
20543 Gift for my Father-in-law, he was very pleased. 
20544 Exactly as described, arrived promptly, well packed. New batteries have significantly greater run life than original equipment. Charger works well with the benefit of car adapter and european plug adapter as bonuses. 
20545 Beautiful Picture Quality. Decent stock lens. Highly recommend picking up additional lenses. 
20546 Love! Great underwater and above water pictures! 
20547 I love the case. I am glad that I can finally protect my camera. It s really a cute looking case. 
20548 Hard to use and focus. 
20549 I m using this adapter to mount my DJI Ronin base-plate. It s not a perfect fit, in that the safety mechanism doesn t function correctly, but it slides in and locks down tight. Nice budget option. 
20550 Worked fine 
20551 Great, just what we needed 
20552 Cool!!! Love it! 
20553 Good 
20554 Perfect fit on Hero 4 and good quality. 
20555 Works great on glass. Has some trouble sticking to other car surfaces. 
20556 Overall the product was exactly as described. The directions/manual that it came with, however was not very helpful. 
20557 Helped get pictures off of a discarded phone. 
20558 Had everything I wanted and more very pleased 
20559 It needs a bit of some flex for the screw to tighten down the camera to where it won t move. Other than that, it is built well and is heavy duty. 
20560 LOVE IT 
20561 Compared to the original one, it seems weaker. 
20562 This tripod is great ! Nice and sterdy amd I can count on it for anything. 
20563 Super portable and great image quality - awesome for hiking! 
20564 no complaints 
20565 Everything was great! 
20566 nice design, this would not fall off the camera as other s have, but I m sending it back because I d have to take it off for wide angle shots because you can see a portion of the hood in the shot 
20567 +1000 
20568 Did not as described or pictured. Does not come with bnc-bnc connectors. Comes with bnc-male rca. 
20569 It is the best microfiber lens leaner I ever used in the past 10 years. 
20570 I cannot give an accurate description of how well this device works. In the product details it clearly states that it works for the Nikon d750, which the MC-36B is supposed to, however the unit that arrived is the MC-DC2 for Nikon D90/3100/7000/5200/5100 
20571 Was good while it lasted, but not very durable 
20572 GOOD PRODUCT 
20573 works great, a little different than normal, but not a bad thing, very happy with shoulder strap 
20574 Fast shipping, easy installation and inexpensive. We installed them in every window in our house. It makes enough noise for unexpected guest. 
20575 Works like a charm 
20576 good quality 
20577 Camera works like it should, the only think I didn t like was that the app for foscam are not to good 
20578 It is what it is , great material great price 
20579 Price was right. As a backup battery we will see how it performs in the future 
20580 Siren cannot be heard @10 away Replaced batteries 3 different new ones two different brands three different packages 
20581 My teenage daughter loves this! 
20582 Perfectly designed for it s purpose with superbly quality. Works great with Desmond DBC-01 RC2 Compatible Clamp. 
20583 Not get to what I expected 
20584 Awesome. Very clear and work very very good at night. I put one on the front porch and there is no, I mean no light out there, it s still clear as a bell. I love them and would recommend them to my friends. 
20585 At last this is what my Gopro3 was missing a good lasting battery that doesn t drain by itself 
20586 I love these old style cameras and although the video quality is not great, I just like the style. 
20587 Price for this type of item 
20588 Fit my canon camera just fine and has plenty of strength for being quite a small chord. 
20589 They work so well I now have 4. No nonsense triggers. 
20590 Vincent did an excellent job setting up this camera. It seems a complicated procedure, but he zipped right through. I have not had a chance to try the cam out yet, but I was happy with the installation process. 
20591 Perfect 
20592 perfect 
20593 Haven t used these yet, but the first set of 50 were great. Grandkids had a ball taking pictures 
20594 Worked like a charm! I did not have to buy a special camera, just used an old one! 
20595 Very good 
20596 Needed for Santa pictures - worked out great. 
20597 Item came quickly and as described. Bought this 5 weeks ago. Straps are holding up well. 
20598 I could not give 5 stars, because the screwing mechanism was lose, and basically the upper and lower halves of the pen did not remain attached. But the camera worked. 
20599 Great deal! Great delivery time! Thank you! 
20600 Feels fake but it works well 
20601 excellent 
20602 Great for price but definitely not high quality material. It does what it s meant to do. 
20603 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
20604 Perfect size for my GoPro. Now I want other sizes. 
20605 Pain in the butt to hook into your wireless, useless if you re trying to see outside at night in front of a window. OK for interior use only! The mobile phone app is junk and always kicks out on you. 
20606 Not an infrared filter - it is basically a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter. 
20607 Did not like this product at all. I thought maybe the camear was damaged so I reordered needless to say, I was unable to that to work. 
20608 Works well and value for money. 
20609 camera was not reliable and just not to be trusted. i could be standing in room, jumping and moving around for several minutes and it would show me still sitting on couch from 10 minutes previous and act like everything was great. not great! sorry, but just not reliable. 
20610 so far so good 
20611 Buen producto ! 
20612 Seems to work fine. Great price 
20613 Fully compatible. Works great. 
20614 great product and is great at the price goes every where with him. 
20615 Works fine and doesn t wear down too fast. 
20616 Don t waste your money! 
20617 HORRIBLE TOOK TO GERMANY PICTURES CAME OUT HORRIBLE 
20618 Good 
20619 Great Product 
20620 batterys fit to tight in charger slot that makes them very hard to get in or out. 
20621 excellent product. 
20622 Worked great as replacement for old contacts 
20623 Everything came right away, I have used the head mount, floating handle, suction cup mount and the handle bar mount. It s all worked great so far, but right when I took the tripod out, one of the legs broke off and it seems really flimsy 
20624 These transmitters and receivers work perfectly on my Nikon D810 
20625 This is a decent scope, especially for the money. However, I upgraded tot he Celestron Regal 100mm and it is considerably more clear at all magnifications. If you have the coin, skip this one, and go for the upgrade model. 
20626 Camera arrived quickly and meets all my expectations. 
20627 ok for beginner video 
20628 Great semi-professional lens, especially for the price. Very fast focus. I use it on a D5200. 
20629 Yet again I have had to replace my lens cap after it has falled off the lens and been lost, but this time they have changed the design. I believe that the cap design is better - it appears to have a tighter grip on the lens. Time will tell!! 
20630 Film keeps getting stuck in back on my camera and wont print out photos. help? Very disappointed on the waste of money. 
20631 Worked perfect for my Cannon sx280 hs 
20632 Takes a llooonng time to find the right adjustment for your camera, and the product alone is quite heavy. My arms start hurting after only 15min of straight use. 
20633 We think it works great and brings things in much closer. 
20634 very disappointed very cheaply made will not work on my pc works on my dads pc hard to focus very light weight and unstable seller sent me the 200x not the 300x I ordered 
20635 It does not hold the charge as well as my original canon batteries, which are quite old. 
20636 Excellent filter. Better than my previous filters which scratched up easily. 
20637 This battery is not compatible with Polaroid t730. I am not planning to buy another battery, as I thought this brand would have been compatible compared to the other, also purchased from Amazon. 
20638 Works great! 
20639 This is a great option to protect my lens and to filter the uv rays. This is exactly what I expected and it is a great value compared to similar lens filters. 
20640 Great little charger. 
20641 I have had this camera for about a year now and it quit working. It would get moisture in it and wouldn t turn on when I wanted it to. I wasn t very impressed with it. 
20642 It is great cable wire but not what we needed at the time but, we did find another use for it by changing out the connector ends. Thank you once again Amazon for such quick delivery. 
20643 Great product 
20644 Great lens 
20645 Got this as a gift for my sil...amazing quality camera for the price! 
20646 These do NOT fit the Sony NEX-3NL camera. Otherwise they seem like nice lenses 
20647 Worked Great for about 2 weeks, not wont go up past about 1/3 of the way. If I reset and move the camera up my self a few times it works for a day then quits again. =( Really liked this camera too. 
20648 Product was as advertised. 
20649 Love it. If the package could include a gopro locking screw that would be perfect. 
20650 No complaints! 
20651 Great camera and customer service. 
20652 GREAT PRODUCT FOR BEGINERS! 
20653 very good 
20654 AAAAA+++++ 
20655 Brandon in technical support was great, he was able to install the camera in minutes and was very polite and helpful. Now the camera works with no problems. 
20656 Great professional camera! It was great experience. It included everything that you need to do perfect pictures. Delivery was in time, everything was great. 
20657 perfect size and very light, will love it on upcoming vacation. My Nikon P600 is perfect size in this bag with room for extra batteries and cards. Thank you. 
20658 Pretty easy to use, not sure how or if it can be used without Wi-fi as in can be used cellular and it s pretty slow to move the camera via wi-fi but it s pretty cool and cheap. 
20659 Just needed it and arrived on ti,e good quality. 
20660 The USB wire doesnt fit well the charger the battery doesnt charge, bad experience see picture, part of the USB stays out of the charger i dont know if thisbis normal but it doesnt work 
20661 Dead on arrival. Tried it with multiple flashes, fresh new batteries, and then a different set of fresh new batteries. Requested a replacement or refund from Yongnuo and they refused (so much for standing behind a warranty). Risky purchase, poor customer service. You ve been warned. 
20662 Just what I needed and it got to me so fast I swear I blinked and bam I had it. Great battery and price. Do not waste your time shopping around, here it is and at the click of a button it is yours and in your hands fast! 
20663 Worked from June to February and then because it is not waterproof, it rusted where the batteries are and quit working. 
20664 worked fine 
20665 This is the nicest bag - fit my Nikon and 2 large lenses plus batteries and charger. It looks beautiful and feels like my purse ( it also fits all of my purse stuff). Earth tone colors - perfect for me. 
20666 Loving it :) 
20667 I think this item is very durable and the price is also reasonable. However, the reach of the mount is a little short because it consists of two separated sticks, not three sticks. Anyway, it was useful for my diving. 
20668 Excellent service and product. I received my product timely and the item works well. 
20669 unfortunately the remote does NOT work, the right button is so low set that you cannot access it and the left hand button works only occasionally. I need to return this item, so please send return mailing label. 
20670 Even tightened all of the way down, the arms still move around. The result is a shaky video, and unreliable angles as the mount is move around (mounted on my motorcycle). I would look for a different brand. 
20671 Best point and shoot I have ever encountered! Pictures look as good as my Nikon DSLR 3100. More settings than I will ever need, but there if I want them. If you are on the fence about this camera just go ahead and get one before they run out. 
20672 It is inexpensive and works great..... what more can you ask from a light diffuser? 
20673 Not very well made. ....same thing with this pen. I have no more ink and have no way or replacing it....thanks seller. 
20674 These fit decently, but you can tell that they are not perfect. Don t quite &#34;click&#34; on the way they should and when the two won t screw together (bad sign). 
20675 Makes the slides gook great. 
20676 Nice little camera. Bought it to take basic vacation pics. Got a water proof case as well and took pics with it underwater. 
20677 I mean, what can you say? It is inexpensive and it works. Arrived when it should have. 
20678 Perfect little bag for on the go!!! 
20679 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
20680 These might be nice binoculars for viewing the stars, but they are terrible for viewing Dolphins from our patio. I guess the Dolphins are just too fast. 
20681 Good product but arrived without instructions 
20682 Don t tweak it too hard or the joints pop out. Can be snapped back but annoying. 
20683 Perfect fit for my 5 gal. bottles. Nice and tight. 
20684 great 
20685 very sturdy, works on uneven ground 
20686 battery works great with my camera 
20687 Amazing product!! 
20688 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
20689 Awesome mounts 
20690 Great price!! 
20691 working very good 
20692 Almost no ghosts or anything. Cleans with ease by breathing and wiping with a microfiber cloth. Hoya HDs are the best. 
20693 Nice lightweight & adjustable! Very, very, very bright ont he highest setting. This will also take AA batteries or other various camera batteries. Includes the shoe/tipod mount. Very happy with the product. 
20694 In possible to navigate to set it up 
20695 Nice size and works as intended. Light weight so I always have it in my camera bag. Of the times I didn t bring it, I regret it. 
20696 Have you read setup instructions for wireless camera? OMG -- IP configuration required ..... give me a break it s 2015. Sending box back today! 
20697 Good, cheap insurance.... 
20698 Smallervthan I thought, but it works. 
20699 excellent 
20700 No words to explain how much I like it. 
20701 Very clear and good resolution. Does very close up pics. Color is accurate. 
20702 Solid construction and smart design. A great mono pod for a decent price. 
20703 They did a good job, film is of good quality. I would recommend this company to friends. 
20704 Acts funny in my camera, like it s not sure if this is an OE battery. holds a charge as I would expect. 
20705 This is a good quality versatile mount that arrives in nice packaging. Good value overall and works well 
20706 Fast delivery and as described, thanks. 
20707 Great product 
20708 I have 2 sj4000 knock off. The picture is great but the sound really sucks. But i use it on a quadcopter, so i don t need good sound. If you are going to record sounds don t bother buying this thing. 
20709 Very sturdy and light. A good fit. 
20710 Doesn t work how I expected. The night shoot is mainly why I purchased this camera and it works horribly. It was not checked before sold because it still had the last owners person pictures and video. The sound quality is also awful. 
20711 great 
20712 Delivered on time and as per description 
20713 Great camera for the price. We take it on vacation so we don t have to use our phones. 
20714 Does Not do what instructions say it does. Have not being able to set the motion detection. 
20715 No comments 
20716 Perfect for my needs. I am not a professional but take lots of pictures for friends and family. 
20717 Sturdy 
20718 I really love these styles that they come in and instead of having plain white pictures spice it up with these border stickers! 
20719 Happy with the shipping, the product and the price. Highly recommend! 
20720 Perfect gift for collecting memories. Good Value and Quality 
20721 Nice telescope. Setup was pretty simple. The star alignment process required some time to get it right but all in all we like the telescope and good for us novice. 
20722 Great and really works. 
20723 The battery worked out great. I purchased the battery as a spare for my lecia v-lux 4 which is the same as the Leica battery at half the price with the same specs. 
20724 The instructions are impossible to follow. When you call Tech Support, you they re angry and condescending. In the end, they can t help you and your stuck with a very expensive piece of crap. 
20725 I ve had my Hello Kitty camper for about a month or so and I LOVE IT!!! I recieved it fast and it was just prefect!!! 
20726 This is a perfect product what I am searching. Its awesome product and very easy to use. Don t miss like this product and its very cheap cost they are offering. Its looking very nice and very easy to handle with remarkable comfort. 
20727 On time and as described. Fits perfectly 
20728 I cannot off load any images what a waste of money 
20729 Really relieves the pressure around my neck on long wedding days carrying a heavy body and lens. 
20730 Well made cap. Lost mine during a basketball game and I am very happy that this cap looked and felt like the original cap. 
20731 Works perfectly, charges in Canon charger. Fast delivery. The only reason I didn t give 5 stars is that I don t know how long the battery will last, other than that don t hesitate to buy 
20732 It needs to be charged too much. 
20733 Good case but not as convenient as I thought it would be. 
20734 Doesn t fit newer hero s 
20735 not smooth! 
20736 Just ok 
20737 Great experience 
20738 Product is great for the price. it arrived quickly and suction cup adheres to the windshield very securely. The plastic screw mount is a bit flimsy when tightening the screw thread to camera but does the job for my small action camera. 
20739 Absolutely fantastic. 
20740 Does what it says on the tin. Offers better grip and good protection for the camera. 
20741 Nice!!! Much sturdier than the cheezy tripods often packed with inexpensive photo accessories. The ball mount actually locks tightly! 
20742 sme as gopro 
20743 I was lucky enough to not get a fake battery. Watch out for that. That s all I can really say, it works just like my original T3i battery. 
20744 Got it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. 
20745 Bought this because of the price and I love it. Exactly what I was looking for to diffuse the onboard flash on my camera. Easy to use and folds up nicely. 
20746 HSS works with Cheetahstand CL-360 
20747 Great buy 
20748 The side screw has no function and I managed to work it with an old threaded rod I found. 
20749 Good service and everything in perfect working conditions 
20750 Light weight but yet sturdy. Fluid head 
20751 Awesome just what I ordered thank you very much works wonderful 
20752 Exactly what I ordered. The cable meets my needs perfectly. Thank you... 
20753 Is very good pictures are great and clear day or night but the back round you hear when the speak is on must be fixed 
20754 Great kit full of useful components 
20755 excellent 
20756 Aperture ring is rough - a so so so product 
20757 Really love these triggers! The best feature in my opinion is the ability to control your flash power on the controller itself. Saves so much time! 
20758 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
20759 Incredibly difficult to use. Minimal directions. Photos either did not display, or displayed upside down. I spent a significant amount of time reformatting photos and rotating them only to have the frame not save any of my work. Not worth the trouble. 
20760 This case is part of the reason why I wanted the Nikon 1. I loved the sleek design and the fact that it protected the camera without making it huge. We were happy that this fit inside my husband s cargo pocket when we were at an amusement park. 
20761 Charged the batteries without a problem, but when I put them into my Nikon D3200, the camera would not accept them as usable. So, they are useless to me. Money down the drain. 
20762 This gives the camera a better overall grip, making it more comfortable to hold and less movement (in my opinion) when pressing the shutter down. It s not a perfect match to the color of the camera but so close, you won t notice unless you re really looking. 
20763 it came 5 or 6 dys early the case is very durable protects camera from many things even knives(I was bored and I m a guy :-P) the camera is great especially for the low price the mounts work and it is definetly waterproof in case 
20764 This battery grip was well worth the money. It holds 2 batteries and works great for various picture positions, without the need to contort your hands. 
20765 great! 
20766 I like this so well I have one for every flash I have (5). 
20767 Im old fashioned! Miss the instructions on paper.... 
20768 The case is great for my compact camera and accessories. 
20769 it work very well and is preciely wha i needed.,good value for the money 
20770 i love it 
20771 My new lens came right away. Due to the hot weather, I haven t been able to use it much, but I m looking forward to enjoying it when the cooler temps get here. Thank you. 
20772 Very easy set up. App has an easy to work with interface. Night mode produces clear visuals. Very little lag within normal lighted visuals. 
20773 pretty good ofr watching birds 
20774 Works well. I bought several sets. monitor both the front and back of house. be careful though once you add a camera to a channel on one monitor it cannot be added to the same channel on another monitor 
20775 I`m pro wadding photographer w. 20 years of experience I just purchased that one to have extra lens in my case and I have exactly same lens made in Japan .... Compare both of them no difference in the quality 
20776 Excellent product 
20777 Good deal. Thannks.. 
20778 great value and excellent product 
20779 Will return to seller. 
20780 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
20781 Would not even lift off once. Bought extra batteries, fully charged them, nothing. Rotors spun but never lifted off. Thanks for ruining a six year olds birthday. 
20782 Not terribly professional except for the company logo embossed on the cheap plastic tie. 
20783 Holds all the accessories for the camera. 
20784 With the kit lens, it fits fine even over the viewfinder. Just don t forget to push in underneath the camera when shooting. 
20785 A+ would order from here again! 
20786 Did not come with a book manual on how to use the camera. My brother had the same camera so he was able to show me the basics but can find the user manual online. Love the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
20787 works fine 
20788 The waterproof feature worked great, but almost all photos on land were blurry. 
20789 Great 
20790 Great camera, easy to install, works great with the app. 
20791 This was terrible, I had it for less than a week and one of the legs wont stay pulled down and one of the legs slides off the top connection bit very easily. You get what you pay for with this product 
20792 Works great and way better priced (like half) than I found in stores anywhere. 
20793 great transaction. Product as described 
20794 Pretty flimsy, doesn t realy provide much support. I wouldn t trust an expensive camera in it 
20795 I love this i no longer have to pocket my lense caps and hope I don t lose them or forget where I put it 
20796 GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT 
20797 Thank You 
20798 works well 
20799 This monitor is everything in description plus some. I will be purchasing again. 
20800 Very nice glass, highly recommended. 
20801 Don t go flying without it! It s nice to hear the beeping while flying so you know when to come in for a landing. There s nothing like losing power while hundreds of feet in the air! 
20802 Love this product. Such a good product for so little investment. I m Not a professional photographer though. 
20803 Arrival time was as posted, merchandise as promised 
20804 I love this lens. While I am still learning all the ins and outs of using a prime lens, the photos I ve taken with this really jump out ... I m very excited about learning more. 
20805 Such a fun item. Really love flying this drone, best one out there for the money to practice with. Only wish the battery life would last longer, but still a great product!! 
20806 Great filter. Fits perfect. The moon looks amazing. Thank you so much for a great product. 
20807 The lenses and accessories are great. I only wish there were some instructions. 
20808 I am very happy with this purchase. 
20809 Works great as expected. 
20810 Great performance! Love it! 
20811 Purchased as a gift. Super big hit! Fantastic product. 
20812 I couldn t be happier. 
20813 I tested each camera before installing on exterior of my house. 1 Camera had water inside of it and does not work the other three are good. 
20814 Exactly what I was after. Works well 
20815 The stick is not sturdy enough. When at full length, it is hard to handle it and take a proper selfie 
20816 Fine Dvr and cameras. Nice night vision too. Just needs better documentation. 
20817 Didn t work with my Nikon :-( 
20818 danny gave me great tech support and was able to hook up my camera. The camera is clear and easy to use. 
20819 somehow i need to use 3 swab to completely clean my D7000 sensor. Maybe the dirt has settled too long. 
20820 Great product for price. Attached to lens very easy. 
20821 These work great and will fit on any speed light. Good value. 
20822 Works Perfect 
20823 its a cool camera. the control on the dial switch for camera mode, moves on its own while you re shooting and that sucks. otherwise i would have given it a 5 
20824 Does a good job during the day and night 
20825 The extendable Telescopi Handle turns arround with the weight of the Go Pro, its not usefull. Tripod its OK. 
20826 The cameras have excellent clarity. Easy to set up - when I had a small glinch Dlink tech worked with me until it was resolved. DLink has the best customer service. Thank you Allen your were so knowledgeable and patient. AR004639 
20827 My old camera died after around 6 years love this camera for inside the house you can place it almost any place works real nice in low light 
20828 Was delivered on time. Happy with the drone. 
20829 good picture, great price 
20830 it s expensive and if you want to record you must pay monthly. 
20831 Awesome!! Great handheld light wand. Thin and the lights are very bright. 
20832 I was thinking is gonna come with memory card! 
20833 Recording time only lasts about 3 hours 
20834 works. 
20835 This recorder is working great so far , I will keep this updated in a months 
20836 This recharges batteries quickly. I purchased it for a long trip where thousands of photos are likely to be taken. So far there has been no problems. 
20837 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
20838 what I needed igot 
20839 Great quality and value. 
20840 Works really well. Not to difficult to add to the flash. Folds down and fits in my camera bag perfectly 
20841 Batteries arrived on time and were well-packaged. They are a fraction of the price of Canon batteries and do the job. I ll definitely do business with GOJA again. 
20842 Great product, Thanks. 
20843 Sorry for later writing the comments on it, this one is quite goods, it brings lot of fun in my life, I do see lots of nice birds. It s fantasic. 
20844 Works well. 
20845 we lost our camera LOL 
20846 Pin is too big on the door to use. Took to a camera store and they agreed... Can t use it. 
20847 This has worked fine for me for over 4? years. No problems... 
20848 love it 
20849 Heavy device. Needs a good tripod to use this device. Can carry bigger cam or photo camera 
20850 Great product! 
20851 Fitted nicely with my instax mini, but after using it for literally a few mintues the strap broke off. And the color is a lot darker than the picture. 
20852 Got it and setup was easy and it worked immediately. Seems to be a great product so far and I am looking forward to more usage. 
20853 As expected 
20854 Camera was awesome for a Caribbean cruise... Took great underwater pictures. 
20855 It performed as it was supposed to, but I returned because it covered too much of the LCD screen as well as the delete and review buttons on my D7100. Also, once on, difficult to remove! 
20856 It is awesome I would highly recommend this if your gonna shoot a lot of pictures. 
20857 There are many out there that look the same. This isn t the one that you want, can hardly hold a small phone.Waste of money. 
20858 It seems a little stiff, but soft. It smells HORRIBLE right out of the package though. I m just kinda disappointed, but if my opinion changes (when it smells better and loosens up) I ll change my review. 
20859 Pleasantly surprised. Easy to put on - no air bubbles. Works great and would recommend 
20860 one of the best camara protection I bought 
20861 Product was as advertised. 
20862 Them two extra batteries and 12V&110V charger is great thing to have they last 2x longer then OEM in my sony290 camera thanks for great deal 
20863 Great quality product with affordable price. Well worth the money. 
20864 Was pretty good. the seam on the handle broke the day I got it. Bummer 
20865 Excellent Camera!!! Highly recommend. Takes Beautiful Pics!!! 
20866 came scratched 
20867 Do not buy it! Damaged from my first use, very small and good for pocket, but since I used the coin to fix the camera, two of rubber pieces damaged.. 5 minutes only after unpacking! 
20868 Makes a world of difference on my D700. Manual focus is very sharp when using this eyepiece. I recommend it. 
20869 A perfect fit for my cannon camera and the 2 extra batteries is even made it better, didn t have to worry I was going to run out of batteries. 
20870 You get what you pay for. But OK. 
20871 Fits the camera it was recommended for fine. No issues. 
20872 I have used a Zomodo system which is really not good; I tried this WIFI NVR System without any high expectation,but so far it is good,outlooking, setting,APP,WIFI signal,service is also prompt.The problem is without ethernet cable which I think should be. 
20873 Great! 
20874 Great battery however, it would be smart to keep a few extra of these charged up in your bag. 
20875 good 
20876 Got it in a couple of days and works perfectly! 
20877 Don t buy it. It doesn t fit a Nikon as advertised. Spend the extra money and buy a good product. 
20878 Very sturdy construction 
20879 It s a lens hood. It does the job. While it s made for my lens, the fit feels off, 
20880 Died in no time, now I have to go thru hoops to get repaired, very dis-satisfied 
20881 Good purchase! Fast shipping! 
20882 Great product. 
20883 Totally loved this album! It s great quality and holds my pictures perfectly. 
20884 Better than I expected 
20885 I m happy to have a working camera again, thank you. 
20886 Works great for black and white film photography. 
20887 This is a present to the world. 
20888 great seller - delivered as promised! 
20889 Excellent lens. Very handy for street photography. I am keeping it all the time in my OM-D5 I hang around with this one, and my D7100 with the 18-200 on the other shoulder. Great combination. 
20890 I had low expectations based on the price, but the quality is quite good, provided the light is good. My only complaint is the Nikon style T-adapter cannot be protected by a Nikon end cap. It fits too loosely and falls off. 
20891 Only problem I have is remote. it shows low battery every time and does not working... 
20892 Works well once I got the proper macro lens. Product description is coy on that point. 
20893 Great pricing and just as I ordered. 
20894 Works great with GoPro Hero 4 silver 
20895 Use it as protection for my 70-200. Well worth price. 
20896 when an e mail is created to try to watch it outside the home, it doesn t let me. 
20897 Very sturdy tripod smart looking folds up tor easy carrying 
20898 Very handy item. I keep one in the glove box of both cars. I also would recommend the remote timer Hapurs Bluetooth to use with it. 
20899 Perfect for our T2i, and quickly shipped. 
20900 Works but not designed as good as chums brand version. 
20901 Great response from seller. One of the screen had a defect and was replaced quickly by seller. The screen saver works great and is holding up on the watch and minimize scratches on the glass. 
20902 Love it! Also have a wireless remote but I like this one better. 
20903 batteries perform at least as good as factory originals. No formal testing done though. 
20904 very sharp, great on street photography compact & light to carry around 
20905 Great bag! Lots of pockets! Wish it wasn t so bulky though! 
20906 nice gift 
20907 Wonderful product and so darn easy to use! I highly recommend. 
20908 light weight tripod stand. wish it was a little bigger. only like four feet high 
20909 WORKED AS PROMISED - THANK YOU! 
20910 This product totally served the need to which it was applied. We will continue to use the ZINK Photo Paper for our needs, as they occur. Thanks for such a reliable product. 
20911 Great 
20912 I am very happy with this purchase and it is really valuable addition to my gear. 
20913 I lost my Nikon D5300 Charger and I needed one—quick. With prime, shipping was speedy and painless, the company sent a friendly email and the product works most importantly. Much better than buying the $50 Nikon Product. Would recommend to anyone. 
20914 very good for the price--as described 
20915 I was looking for a case for my Nikon Coolpix S9700 and this one is a perfect fit. 
20916 The camera is performing nicely in my home. It sometimes loses its connectivity, but seems to reconnect over time. I held back on giving it 5 stars because of the price for a cloud account and no option to store video on customer hardware. 
20917 Very impressed with the USB charge system as compared to the direct charging system. Enjoy the use of product very much. Highly recommending the combination unit for purchase. 
20918 Lots of interference if you use as a baby moniter. We needed it for our mother who moved in. So it works ok as an intercom but it s cheaply made and we had to add 100 feet of extra wire. It s what we expected for the money. 
20919 Happy with merchandise 
20920 Great light ! 
20921 This filter paints a purpure sky while shooting on the film. 
20922 Great Camera but the GoPro Studio keeps on crashing on me. 
20923 works perfect with my video cameras... 
20924 Worked like a charm! 
20925 Great solid and sturdy lightstand for the price! I have a 4x6 softbox with constant light set up on it in my studio and have had no issues. 
20926 very good quality. Has 2 bubble levels to adjust the tripod. Fits my LG PA77U projector well. Good buy! 
20927 The product is as advertised, what more can you ask for. 
20928 This was one of my best decisions i have ever made. its so cute and the cheepest price on the market. works great and super duper cute! i think everyone should get one. quality is great and a nice fit in the hand. High remarks about this. 
20929 Hugely impressed by this product. Serves mainly as a secondary/slave. Excellent performance, nonetheless. 
20930 Love the camera, but would have liked the seller to advertise that camera does not have U.S. warranty. 
20931 nice! little heavy for dlite 4 
20932 Purchased this to cover my hot shoe on the [[ASIN:B00I8BICCG Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera - Body only]] I purchased. This is made by Sony as does a fantastic job at protecting the hot shoe since I shoot 100% without flash as a natural light shooter! 
20933 camera doesn t work right the picture keep rolling 
20934 Don t buy this product!. No connectivity, confirmed with a multimeter. Adds to frustration of getting a camera configured. 
20935 works great 
20936 My favorite camera... 
20937 Excellent product. Thank you!! 
20938 Very happy with purchase!!! 
20939 Excellent product as to price If you are entering astronomy, this is the right one! But it s extremely hard to colliminate 
20940 Thanks... Good product... Fast shipment... 
20941 The product is as described and would be fine. However, it does not appear to be very well made as one of the clips was broken on the honeycomb grid and also on one of the color filters. I guess you get what you pay for. 
20942 Purchased this to protect my lens and it works perfectly. 
20943 these were for my son; I haven t heard any complaints so he must be happy with them! 
20944 This camera works pretty good tested it at the pool also at the lake when about 5 feet under water no problem image its pretty good about same as my galaxy s2. 
20945 Did not work. Installed battery, LCD screen came on, then nothing would work, not even the light. Returned for refund. Refund was processed quickly and without question. Would purchase from Bopo again, just not from Dot Line Corp. 
20946 perfect fit for a Chrome Messenger and a LowePro Slingshot 202 
20947 As advertised fit and charges well 
20948 Great grip, very comfortable. Only problem I find is the bottom attachment is pretty bulky. Contrary to other posts, you CAN add a neck strap as I ve demonstrated in the photo. It comes with this metal bracket that is designed to add the neck strap to. 
20949 This head fits on my Sirui P-424 carbon monopod and can support the weight of my heaviest lens. 
20950 A bit pricey for what it is, but that s Canon s fault. Otherwise, it does what it was designed to do. 
20951 I found this camera hard to keep connected. Ended up returning. I ve owned 2 other Foscam camera s in the past, but this camera wasn t very reliable. One positive note: the setup was pretty easy. 
20952 Good value - picture. 
20953 Great Lens, high quality photos, contrasts and color! But taking video s with this lens on the Sony 6000 is very loud, you can hear the motor chattering when it s auto focusing. 
20954 easy tu use vert good 
20955 Fun, small camera and takes good pictures. 
20956 Love B+W I was highly dissapointed that after blowing these off, then wiping carefully with breadth/moisture and a clean microfiber cloth I still had micromarring on the surface. I feel like the glass/foil is incredibly soft in these. 
20957 Great for selfies. Easy to put on & take off. 
20958 Works perfectly. And I love being able to move it and see it from my cell phone. 
20959 Perfect! I charge my original gopro battery and my 2 smatree batteries at the same time! Gets the same battery life for a fraction of the price of original gopro batteries. 
20960 it is just ok, nothing special 
20961 Thank you 
20962 The item is bulky and cumbersome and did not perform to my liking. 
20963 Good 
20964 Works great 
20965 Great lens 
20966 Great product, clear, bright images. Definitely worth the price. The case looks pretty resistant to field work. 
20967 Enjoy this product, fun to use. 
20968 More than just a camera case - I would even use it as a purse. 
20969 This is a very nice lens, item was delivered ahead of schedule in a very secure packaging. Lens tested OK Looks good on my GX7 
20970 canon eos t3i works great. 
20971 Good price and fast shipping 
20972 Camera was good but the bag for camera was too small。。。 
20973 Great Product 
20974 fine 
20975 awesome protective case 
20976 I m very happy with the performance of these batteries. I bought two, one for each camera. I have a Gopro3 and 3+. 
20977 The right tool for the right job 
20978 Excellent product for the price, doing everything that I needed it to do. 
20979 Best you can get for the price 
20980 works great, price is great 
20981 Bought for fishing, fits great, the angle isn t great. When dehooking sharks, you see too much ground. Head mount is a better fit for that. 
20982 Pleased 
20983 was very useful and versatile.[[ASIN:B00PPXGY3O Black Pro Large Octopus Tripod with Adapter Holding 3 Kgs Size 250*60*60mm for Gopro Hero 4 3+ Camera Digital Slrs/dslr/dv]] 
20984 Definitely worth it for the money. No issues so far. Using with a Canon 70D. 
20985 It is very light weight and plenty sturdy enough for light weight light sources. For the price, it is very well made. 
20986 I really enjoy this item. The lighting it gives, out great for my photography. I own two of them. 
20987 Great product, exceeds requirements. 
20988 Great camera and great customer service from a guy named Kenneth. I was lost and he got me up and running in only a few minutes. 
20989 It s not as sturdy as I thought it would be but it s compact and easily fits in a backpack or even pockets. I would not recommend this for &#34;fablets&#34; like the iPhone 6 plus or Notes. 
20990 Excellent quality UV filter. I purchased this to go on a Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary lens, and I have not been disappointed. Thee are several less expensive filters out there, but this is worth the extra money. Jeff 
20991 gift for my son...he loved it 
20992 Works great. A very versatile charger. 
20993 This system was for a HS FFA program barn. Install was easy and setup was even easier. Been running for several weeks and it is going great. Can t say enough good about this system and the company that sold it. Great customer service. 
20994 Very nice 
20995 Very good 
20996 Very Good 
20997 Tudo ok! 
20998 Very nice unit with lots of thing you can do with it. Can t beat the price for such a versatile piece of equipment. Little bit bulky to carry with you. 
20999 Good product solves the purpose 
21000 Very Good 
21001 Great addition to the outside play area of the wife s dog business. Keeps the vandals out at night while providing great visibility to the people that have to do the late night potty break. Well constructed. Bright. Easy install. 
21002 work great nice videos, sound, pictures. it did`nt work at first but the memory card went in to far pull it out just a little and it worked fine after that. 
21003 Sturdy product and has worked for me on multiple snorkeling trips. 
21004 Bought it as a present for my grandma and she love s it. I doesn t have a great resolution but you can t ask more fore the price. Easy to use. 
21005 works well with Windows 8. auto crops the photo to perfect size. Instructions on the scanner tell you to insert every photo in the plastic-do so it is easy and gets you the best scan. Just be sure to keep scanning surface clean with tools provided. 
21006 Excellent 
21007 Battery was cheap. Doesn t hold a charge very long, but wasn t very expensive either. I guess you get what you pay for 
21008 These are GREAT. They were plug and play right away. The audio was clear and really worked very well with the filmed presentation. Very worth the investment. 
21009 Nice case. Durable. Shipped on time. 
21010 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
21011 Got it super fast and I use it everyday. 
21012 good! 
21013 Very low build quality. Not ready for prime time. Pass on this one. I bought two and they are expensive non-functional paper weights. It s the ptz motor ... It slips when repisitioning rendering it useless. Tech support virtually a joke. 
21014 Having a blast with it 
21015 Works well but after about a year of use the legs have worn down and causes the monopod to rest on one leg instead of all three. 
21016 I m very happy! 
21017 Wonderful, I view anywhere and anytime, daytime color very nice , night time with night visions perfect. Easy setup, give me 5 to 10 minutes , I will buy one more set later. Good price Thanks Eyesun Technology Co 
21018 Love this bag, Love the colors and it carries nicely on my shoulder. Plus I can carry cross ways and very comfortable. 
21019 Great product! 
21020 Adorable 
21021 Works as described 
21022 Excellent value and works well on my Cannon Rebel T5. 
21023 Threat 
21024 Ordered this two pack as backups for Nikon 1 v1. Neither battery would take a charge they put the charger into an error state ... fast flashing led. Good thing I still have two batteries for the camera. 
21025 Thanks D link customer service rep #ER004228. I was in a jam and she went above and beyond in helping me out case#C6723426 
21026 Will return these also. Read that props break on occasion and the ad stated that these are also bought with the Parrot Spider, however these are not for the Parrot Spider, much larger. Maybe should have read closer. 
21027 Simply perfect, they do what you spect to do 
21028 This that is so big !!!! Way big for my Pentax k50. If you what big it was made well. 
21029 Beautifully crafted and well designed case. Offers a reasonable amount of protection with decent access to the battery and memory as well as controls. A bit expensive but high quality. 
21030 Very good and sturdy. 
21031 Great charger. Much better than the stock nikon charger. 
21032 Yes 
21033 Great little camera.I would recommend this to EVERYONE! 
21034 Very impressive for a good price. 
21035 Looks to be a good buy for the price. Still learning how to use the camera, but am sure I will enjoy using it with the tripod. 
21036 This background paper is just what I needed. Received it quickly. Would recommend to others. 
21037 Glad we bought this for our screen 
21038 Greatly 
21039 Exactly what I was looking for 
21040 Product as described, fast shipping, a bit disappointed by the packaging which was minimally protective with respect to the expense and vulnerability of the product. Hoping the lens continues to function as intended. 
21041 The Camera is modelF19821W. I was assisted today by Walter. Walter was extremely helpful. 
21042 I would buy again. 
21043 Works great! Way cheaper than the Sony and has the wireless shutter release and intervalometer. The instructions on how to use the remote are terrible but if you keep at it, it can be figured out! 
21044 Fits perfect. For those moments when you dont need the original housing. I use it for most of the time for biking & surrounding sounds. Very happy with it. 
21045 Just what I needed. Thanks 
21046 Great case, smaller than appeared. But the quality is good and it does the job well. 
21047 The film was expired and produced black film. I would not purchase this again. 
21048 I was very happy with this iem 
21049 I wish this was the stock case that came with the action cams but very pleased with it. 
21050 It doesn t work and I cannot get any help from the vendor. It has potential, but there is no contact for help. 
21051 just what i expected 
21052 Love this , will be buying a couple more 
21053 This is a good bag but it does not fit a Nikon D330 and lens as described. 
21054 It works. 
21055 as described and match my camera perfectly 
21056 The picture are very sharp, Camera is made sturdily plus underwater photos are excellent 
21057 Package came perfect and fast. Still have to test product though. 
21058 Great convenient protection. 
21059 I have Qflash T4d and I was not sure if this diffuser is going to fit. It fits well, and I am very satisfied. 
21060 Much more convenient than my camera strap. It is comfortable and functional. Don t hesitate. 
21061 rock solid, ingenious design... total quality 
21062 Very difficult to use 
21063 simple, and practice! The pictures show better look after use this flash 
21064 Good product for my needs. Some lag in camera rotation, but still very useful for checking the house and pets when away. Very much like the night vision function. 
21065 Excellent! 
21066 Would not transfer data. 
21067 Product was as advertised. 
21068 I love this camera. Takes great crisp, clear pictures. This is absolutely worth it! Everything shown in the picture was with the bundle. 
21069 like it 
21070 cute, but not functional. No memory card included 
21071 Good camera, but not very practical and too heavy for me. I thought it was lighter to carry around. I wonder if I could exchange it. 
21072 good! 
21073 I don t use it because it is oddly shaped and I can t really fit anything in it. 
21074 Easy for setup and not expensive I like it 
21075 Received an envelope with no 0 screen protector. 
21076 I had lost my original cable and have still not found it. This one is an exact replacement. 
21077 finally can use my land camera with out modifying it, will buy again. 
21078 All ok 
21079 The head is not that smooth and the legs are not connected together. It is a sturdy stand for static shots but not for action or sports. 
21080 Good but the 910 turns out to be a little smaller than what I needed. Kept it anyway. 
21081 It is what it is 
21082 Awesome little camera. For hundreds less than the GP it s hard to beat! 
21083 Despite the fact I took me a while to figure out how to install the lens hood (operator error), the product itself is great. It does what it s suppose to do for a great price. 
21084 The digital picture frame will not turn me get damaged 
21085 Sturdy and compact with all the essential features. 
21086 GREAT 
21087 These were just the ticket for replacing a scratched lens. Fit well, and were easy to install. 
21088 It s description of the cord it will not work for ps3 or Xbox 
21089 Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area). 
21090 Really nice but really hard to fly. 
21091 If you have a Gopro hero camera and don t have a case, this is well worth the money. 
21092 Perfect data transfer! Fair price. 
21093 Very cool to wear and awesome POV shots 
21094 Henry was the best 
21095 I am very pleased with the slide viewer and it came in very soon after it was ordered. 
21096 The best in price and quality. 
21097 Good..... 
21098 Great portable light modifier. Built well enough. Works as I expected. Great item. 
21099 sometimes working sometimes don t 
21100 I thought you could take pictures w/o removing it from case. Nope. But it will definitely protect the camera!!! 
21101 First time using it and the strap fell off, thankfully I didn t lose my go-pro. 
21102 Great. 
21103 What I really like about this backdrop is how flat it stores. Bigger than I expected tall/wide (a good thing i guess for backdrops) Those black things are heavy weights that work well. It comes ready to go, pretty simple to use. (I m a guy who never reads directions) 
21104 I haven t had the camera long but it has met all my expectations and then some. I am especially thrilled to have the 55-200mm lens which allows me to take up close photos of nature. I am very happy so far with the camera. 
21105 no surprise 
21106 Christmas gift, my wife loved it. 
21107 I love my camera. I need to learn more about it 
21108 Have had it for a month or so. Received it fast. Loaded all sorts of pictures (around 2000 portrait and landscape oriented pictures) in the supplied USB flash drive. No issues. Works great, picture is great, motion sensor is great.. No complaints. 
21109 Excellent binocs. Shipping speed was good. 
21110 Love this selfie stick I wasn t a big fan of it but now I can take family pics all by myself it s nice and small fits anywhere n very cute 
21111 Happy with this buy 
21112 Great camera, easy to use and set up. I linked it to my home wifi and can email the pictures directly to myself from the camera super easy! Takes great pictures 
21113 First time using these, the Phantom 3 was extremely unstable. Even after calibration before the flight, the drone was out of control, and crash into my car. Sent an email to DJI, but they did not respond. Beware before you try these. 
21114 excellent!!! 
21115 good, shipping fast 
21116 Happy with the camera. For a used camera it easy replaces the one that I lost.. Working condition, etc. perfect. Thank you 
21117 This was bought for my daughters birthday. We found the GoPro Hero 3 to be everything the write up said it would do. The package came packed secure and in a timely manner. Not only did it work great at the pool party but survived a group of amateur photographers. 
21118 Great camera, but the accessories tossed in are mediocre at best. The Flash is crap and the tripod is flimsy, I sure wouldn t trust it for my new Nikon that for sure. Still, not a bad deal when I bought it a few months ago. 
21119 great way to carry around some extra memory caards 
21120 Pretty average camera, but it works 
21121 One of the best for all those looking for a case for their heady glass or anything really. It has the pick and pluck float so you can fit litterally anything that can fit in the box 10/10 
21122 All the accessories are great! Love them all! So glad I got it! The monopod is the best feature by far! 
21123 Although the item seems to &#34;work&#34;, it has very poor sensitivity. It can alarm of movement if the moving person or object is within about 15 feet or less of the detector. It of limited use for most applications or driveways. 
21124 Poor fit in the D750. A bit too large and could not clear space below protector at two corners. Should be a bit smaller, the Vello was much better. 
21125 Works as it should. Nice strong clasp, doesn t fall off 
21126 Wasn t as expected.. very disapointed. Couldn t read the instructions because they weren t in English to figure out how to work it. Didn t come with any film either... bummer. 
21127 Work perfectly fine with my 1D MKIII. No issues. 
21128 Good product, quality and appearance 
21129 Freaking Fantastic! 
21130 Have been using this for a while and have had no issues. No bubbles...Great protection. 
21131 How do you possibly make sense of all this neewer stuff. You buy the bulb but didn t get the light. you didn t get the diffuser. the diffuser comes in 4 colors. why? 
21132 So happy with it. It s perfect 
21133 Good 
21134 Product is self explainable. Just make sure you measure before ordering this way you don t have to roll up 30 feet of wire. 
21135 Good Quality product! Heavy duty, easy to use, sturdy. I m extremely HAPPY with my purchase!~DUG 
21136 Excellent value. Works great with my Nikon P610. Light and sturdy. Very compact. 
21137 Tippy and very cheaply made 
21138 did not work at all - 
21139 The straps ripped almost immediately. 
21140 I ve had other lens adapters, and they were awkward fitting and using. Not the case with this. I bought it to use my Minolta lenses on my Sony A3000. It goes on easily, and swapping lenses is fast and easy as well. It s a joy to use! 
21141 beautiful picture quality. Takes stunning macro images and can be used as a telescoping lens in a pinch. Highly recommended for any serious or armature photographer. I m rather armature but have included an example pic of one my dart frogs. 
21142 The sleeves work, but I would like it if they fit the film a little bit more snugly. 
21143 Perfect ... as it supposed to be !! 
21144 good start. good price with lots of accessories. light weight, easy to take. 
21145 came on time was what I expected 
21146 I bought this thinking my used camera would be sent with out a battery. But always can use fresh ones. 
21147 Fit my alarm system, came in a plain box. Could careless about the box, batteries work and family is once again protected. 
21148 excelente 
21149 For holding it does good for when doing a lot of shots. Does not feel safe for walking around. 
21150 Bulky but offers a nice blast of air - better than those little grey blowers. 
21151 Although the battery is listed as a replacement for the Panasonic original it the camera rejected it since it was not an original Panasonic product. Check out the web for the exact issue. Do not buy this battery! It fits but does not function. 
21152 Did not fit.. 
21153 Unobtrusive and effective. They break now and then, but for the price and simplicity you can replace it and go on your way. [[ASIN:B00IP22A08 5pcs Anti-lost Lens Cover Cap Keeper Lanyard Keeper Holder Strap Rope for Sony Olympus Canon Nikon Dslr SLR Camera]] 
21154 Don t. Buy this it s a. Lie I looked and. It said it was compatible with my camera. And it didn t fit. It s like I threw. A few. Dollars. Down the street 
21155 Came in less than a week! The rig is about what you d expect for the price. Nice and basic! 
21156 The slide scans are way off color. Kodachrome negatives cannot be scanned to make a useful digital negative or positive. 
21157 Good 
21158 The size and weight all work well with my Rebel T51. Since purchasing and using it has added another dimension of quality to my photos. A must have. 
21159 It is a bit flimsy but does the job. What I expected from Polaroid. =) 
21160 The arm is solid. The tripod that s inside the handle...come gopro you could ve done better. Very flimsy plastic! 
21161 GoPro does not support warrentees if you buy from Amazon. Don t do it. 
21162 good product 
21163 Fits perfect.....great price. 
21164 I have owned this for 2 years and it is still in great condition. Depending on what you re doing you may want a higher quality/more versatile tripod. This one is great for an ameture photographer. 
21165 Great lens, very sharp and great focus. Great deal, especially for the price. 
21166 Still love the D5200... even since I left it on a train in Berlin within a month of purchase! Let me know if you re the one who found it :•( 
21167 I love that the power if built into the cat5 cable! I bough extra cable, however it wasn t needed. this kit had what I needed. The app is fairly solid! 
21168 This is an excellent value for a water white filter. I haven t experienced any issues with flare, and its color reproduction is far better than you d normally get for the price. 
21169 Oh, very good camera, feels like built with good materials. Small size, quick & clear focusing, photos better than my other digital camera. Love it. 
21170 Work out well 
21171 Loved it. Easy to learn and use especially if you are just learning how to work it. It is also good for beginners such as myself. 
21172 Wouldn t hold a charge and cost as much to return as paid for. 
21173 No issues here. 
21174 This GoPro handle really makes it much easier to get different angles and shoot more interesting clips. It floats so enables you to take underwater video without someone holding the camera. The strap helps a lot to allow movement without losing the GoPro if you are in the ocean. 
21175 The package was opened when it arrived and the screws were not the right size at all! 
21176 Sucks!! no way to secure to rail!!!!! 
21177 Great Items 
21178 It works as it should, despite being flimsier than more expensive brands. It does it s job. 
21179 lens fell out on first use, and casing became chipped immediately. Very poor quality item. No response from seller beyond requesting photos, which I provided repeatedly. Very disappointed. 
21180 excellent 
21181 YOU JUST CAN T BEAT THE PRICE AND HOLD S A CHARGE...HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.. 
21182 Product arrived on time and was exactly as described. Have only used them around neighborhood but have worked perfectly. Will be using them in the field in 2 weeks 
21183 This battery was about 1/16 inch shorter than the original 504 is was to replace. Waste of money. 
21184 i love it...as expected 
21185 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
21186 Worked exactly as described, and easier to use than expected. 
21187 These 1600 mah batteries last longer per use than Kodak s KLIC-7004 at 1000 mah Charger works well. Have used these batteries for about month. 1/17 Batteries continue to work well. Have gone over to Kodak charger. 
21188 Fat chance getting license plates or facial features. Too blurry.... 
21189 Works keeps it aflote 
21190 just sold this housing to a friend and upgraded to the same one but for the canon d5 mark iii, i love ikelite and they make a great product. amazing lighting products as well. well worth the investment1 
21191 small, durable, gets the job done. Highly recommended 
21192 Sometimes it is difficult to get the camera leveled, but in general it is a good product. 
21193 Arrived in great condition. 
21194 Good batteries, great value. Highly recommended. 
21195 Fast service and a true fit. Service is the key they have the products and system down pat..... 
21196 Well made and worth the money..... 
21197 Got a clean sensor on my Canon 30D now. 
21198 Wish the price for storage was 1/2 of what s being charged. Too rich for my blood. 
21199 Easy to install, work great. One had issues and replacement was very easy. 
21200 Excellent 
21201 Love this Lens. Color came out to be very good. 
21202 Works great 
21203 Fits great and works amazing. Sure, if you have time to set up there are light modifiers that will do a better a job but if you are shooting an event where things change too fast to allow for set up this does the trick nicely. 
21204 OK 
21205 purchase 2 of these for other deputies. I finally got one for my self I recommend it to all LEO s works great. 
21206 Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS 
21207 I am using this case to hold my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera and it keeps the camera well protected; the small additional compartments can hold other accessories like batteries and battery charger and memory cards, etc. 
21208 Don t waste your money, time and frustration level. It s not worth it! 
21209 Works! 
21210 thanks 
21211 Complete junk 
21212 Its a cool little extra to have around but I wish it wasn t plastic, 
21213 Remote does not work for my Canon 60d 
21214 Very nice backdrop. 
21215 Perfect! Love it! 
21216 Strap won t fit through the loop on my Panasonic Lumix GF-3. Too wide. No instructions. Had to go to Youtube to see how to put it together. 
21217 works great 
21218 Exactly what I needed and workes great! 
21219 Nice 
21220 This little device is great. Works extremely well, and with the addition of the bush cover makes my confidence in the cleanliness of ly lens cleaning. 
21221 This works perfectly and better than expected. It gives me peace of mind! 
21222 Fit perfect lasts a lot longer than the factory battery. 
21223 Have not been able to use it yet, husband said it looks good 
21224 good 
21225 Okay 
21226 Excellent!....Just what I wanted! 
21227 Met my expectations and then some. I recommend. 
21228 i am having trouble setting them up they shut my internet down when i try to connect them i have conntacted seller and they will not contact me back 
21229 A very nice battery for my Panasonic Lumix FZ70. 
21230 Works well at cleaning the smudges off my glasses. Great value for a family like mine with many glasses in the house. 
21231 Really nice. Downloaded the instruction book on my tablet. Better than booklet. Not heavy either even with batteries. Love the color. 
21232 Easy to use and the instruction are easy. They are written in a conversational way that is easy to understand. 
21233 Perfect! I also bought the wrist strap so that I could swap according to the activity I am photographing. 
21234 works as it should. 
21235 Not at all what I wanted. Ordered wireless!! 
21236 Awesome value and works great. No issues so far. 
21237 very good 
21238 good lens cap bundle from CamKix. 
21239 It is great for all day shooting and is extremely easy, comfortable and convenient. 
21240 Great lens, great seller! 
21241 Good 
21242 Great lens for the price and it suited my needs using my Canon 70D and my 50D 
21243 This was a great deal on two batteries, charger and 220v adapter. I had to go elsewhere to get the Camera (Nikon 610), it was $100 cheaper at 42 street photo. 
21244 Works as represented 
21245 Binoculars are great. Able to focus quite close and far distant with clarity. Binoculars would get a 5-star from me except for lens caps that too easily come off. 
21246 This lens has made a sigma fan out of me. I had an older model of this on a Canon, was good but not great. This new model is much sharper, it stays on the Pentax body now. 
21247 It is to dark, and the night vision is useless!! 
21248 im not sure how long these worked for but very unpredictable. 
21249 Great fit and very easy to put on. 
21250 Little expensive 
21251 Its OK. Works. 
21252 great little camera!!!! i d buy it again. 
21253 Terrible quality 
21254 Sent it back. Not exactly what I was looking for 
21255 Works great. 
21256 Woah, this thing is awesome! It could light an entire room with it being the only light source. However it does come with a dimmer so you are not sliding all your subjects. 
21257 What app do I download 
21258 Just exactly what was needed. 
21259 I expected these to fit the op/tech camera harness. They did not mate 
21260 Fantastic camera and I will learn more as I go,, still reading and playing around with it 
21261 Item as described works with nikon d5500 
21262 Arrived as ordered, works fine. I ve been using SterlinkTek for years - great products at great prices 
21263 There is no way to attach the gopro to the chest strap. I think you will need to have a case that houses the gopro and snaps into the chest start. I wish the description stated that. 
21264 Exactly as expected. 
21265 Exactly what I expected. It charges superfast and lasts long. 
21266 Having a case that separated into two pieces and you have to take one off (and hold it) every time you want to take a photo is really annoying. 
21267 Not for iPhone 6+ 
21268 As described, works great. 
21269 Fun camera, worked under water in Hawaii with great video and pictures. 
21270 IS A GOOD CASE 
21271 This product exceeded my expectations. I m going to test it underwater this weekend during my dive 
21272 Great product for the price. I would recommend this polarizer anytime. 
21273 Caught my crazy neighbor and daughter keying my wife s car. Happen at 3:00 am night vision was crystal clear. 
21274 it s alright 
21275 It s okay, but not what I expected 
21276 Goes off line a lot and you cannot access camera from WiFi locations...I m very disappointed with this product. 
21277 Love it so much! 
21278 Didn t work, turned on then off. Instructions were terrible not very helpful at all 
21279 I m glad I bought this instead of the Canon brand! The price is excellent and it fits really well. Highly recommended for canon 70-200mm F4 IS. 
21280 This was a replacement for the identical camera that somehow quit working properly...........we chose to replace with the warrantee rather than repair for $125. 
21281 important warranty plan if you re a vlogger who might be prone to breaking things! 
21282 Oh so wonderful and functional... I love all the compartments! I ve used it for two weddings so far... It s great for carrying an extra lens or two. 
21283 The GPS seems to work reasonably well. Photos have come out quite nicely. Easy to use. Have yet to figure out how to sync with my iPhone which is why I ve not given 5-stars. Have tried on several occasions but haven t hit upon the correct sequence yet. 
21284 They called large but its not that large, i have to leave out some of my equipment. at least is well made. wished was a little cheaper because is a amazon basics product. 
21285 This camera is very average, if you wanting to buy this for less money buy the Vivotek version rather than the Cisco one. 
21286 I wanted the protection that the case offer, and for the most part I am satisfied with it, but it makes it difficult to get the memory card out of the camera and does not offer as much coverage on the sides of the camera as I had hoped. 
21287 product was as described, great quality 
21288 Really expensive for what it is. 
21289 great quality but expensive 
21290 it was very usefull and handy 
21291 Quick delivery and fit my camera perfectly! I always lose these so I m sure I ll be ordering more soon! 
21292 Love it. Easy set up. Great quality. 
21293 very good product. excellent quality 
21294 works great, just missed the fact that a spare battery wasn t included. 
21295 It works pretty well but some of the hardware is not the greatest I had a substitute a different stand bracket for the one that came with the clamp 
21296 Works perfectly, better then I had anticipated 
21297 I bought this for my husband and he was delighted! 
21298 It fits well and stays on the Sony Nex 7. 
21299 Was pleasantly surprised. Used on vacation. No problems yet. 
21300 Fast delivery and wonderful inexpensive product! 
21301 Only one of the batteries worked. The other didn t fit the charger 
21302 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
21303 don t work 
21304 The product fits too loosely. Lens does not click into adapter and adapter doesn t click to camera body. Slight wobble is enough to throw picture quality off. 
21305 Really great accessory to have when biking or attaching my GoPro to my motorcycle helmet, the laws of physics and mother nature may come into play. 
21306 It would have been very cute, however, it never actually arrived. 
21307 best price 
21308 handle broke within the first week 
21309 Great item for the price, can t wait to use it! 
21310 Not including the holder 
21311 Carl was a great help to me as I was setting up my camera. The camera does exactly as expected. Perfect for what I needed and with a little help setting it up, it was a breeze. 
21312 Excellents 
21313 Bought the imposter, now I ve got factory battery! 
21314 Quality Product. Looks Kool. 
21315 So far the camera is great, The only problem I have found is the the on/off button is easy to push while tring to zoom in or out. Just something I will have to get use to. But love everything else about the camera. 
21316 needs 120V power not battery operated 
21317 I, unfortunately, had a bad experience with this item: 1) Installed software update 2) Shut down the camera 3) Camera started to over heat 4) Opened the case to access the camera and removed the battery 5) Noticed that the top right corner had cracked 
21318 Good value. 
21319 Highly Recommended! 
21320 High quality strap. Too bad Carry Speed products are not sold in the USA. 
21321 Great deal, easy to use. Product does the job! 
21322 Great deal worth fast shipping. Good company to deal with. Very happy. 
21323 Just the right size for my Fujinon XF 55-200mm lens. 
21324 Did not fit to my Sony cam 
21325 This baby is definitely going to be my go-to handle for the GoPro (especially as more and more places are banning selfie sticks). Love this baby, feels good, floats, and allows me to get the videos I want. 
21326 Great little camera, really like the inline, not offset, lens. Very rugged has now hit the ground in a couple hard crashes while on my 250 FPV quadcopter. A couple dents i the case but, still working! For the money very hard to beat. 
21327 Dany did an outstanding job being patient with me. The camara is very good. 
21328 The cameras are very easy to install. I found that they required about a day to get solid signals and work out the bugs but after that they work flawlessly inside and out. I do wish they had audio because everything else works so well... 
21329 one of the clips fails and for that the right strap of the bag pack works improperly. The product feels cheap. 
21330 The earphone jack is not a tight fit for the gateway S5. I could only get it to work if I held the earphone jack connection in and then what s the point of the stick. 
21331 Contacted them - no reply.. Doesn t work & it is faulty. 
21332 Has a limited range and it did not work with my wireless network. 
21333 great shipper and quality 
21334 This pod has worked great so far. It has always kept its shape and is very flexible. The level on top is a great addition and I like the quick release mount for the gopro, or other camera. It does seem a little bulky though. 
21335 Great camera 
21336 I love this camera; so easy, great pictures and great price!!! Thanks!!! 
21337 This bag is well built and well padded. I could pack D 9 attached with Tokina 11- 17 mm lens, 1 nikon 18- 105 mm , 1 sigma 18- 250 mm macro hsn, and 1 nikon prime lenses. Looks small but with enough room 
21338 Cannot beat the price! Works great. I use three of these for wedding photography 
21339 Not quite so sturdy as expected. No instructions on how to convert to monopod, but after a while figured it out. Well made with minimum plastic parts. 
21340 Great value and great performing product. 
21341 sturdy but a little heavy 
21342 Vincent was the most intelligent, helpful Tech I ve worked with at Foscam. He quickly solved all issues and even suggested and helped me set remote settings, which nobody ever offered to help with before. He s really great! Thanks! 
21343 Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software 
21344 Great deal and it works great. Its so nice to not have to rely on one GoPro battery 
21345 Great 
21346 Great 
21347 I really liked the binoculars. It was a little tough getting them to adjust. Great buy, though. 
21348 Nice travel tripod for the price. Easy to setup, already took sample pictures and movies. Looking forward to Hawaii in less than three weeks. Mahalo! 
21349 Works perfectly and a fraction of the price Canon charges. 
21350 Great lense, fast shipping and love the accessories, except the bag is so small and useless! I can only fit my camera body in it. It looks totally different from the picture 
21351 Love the items. They work wonderful and fit great. Use on our trip to Ireland and was thrilled with all of them. Would order again in a second. Thanks for a great product! 
21352 Bigger than expected holds up great 
21353 Great group of accessories if you have a gopro 
21354 Just ordered and can t use it till I update it on my computer. Such a pain after getting the app and registering my son can t even fly it. 
21355 What can I say, It is a plug, it fit my battery charger. What else can I say about a power cord. 
21356 Present for sson He really likes it. 
21357 Works very well 
21358 That coil is a nice i almost make 15 tattoo and my liner machine run good no heat. 
21359 it is good. 
21360 The camera works fine, but the barrel of one of them will not unscrew, so the memory cannot be added. The replacement and three others work fine. 
21361 Mounted to an older Nikon 300/f2.8 so it can be quickly mounted to an Arca style QR. The anti-rotation flange is ideal for preventing possible movement of the shoe. 
21362 Not super high quality. I got it for watching netflix in bed - so I can lay on my side and put the screen at about a 45-degree angle to match my eyes. It tips over even with an iPhone 5 at that angle. 
21363 Female screw at the end has no thread..... What the.... I had to use my original screws from other adapter to hold the camera onto this grip. 
21364 very good , solid thumbscrew better than the plastic 
21365 Great value for the money and super quick shipment. Buy with confidence! 
21366 Great camera but not upgradeable to this day and age, to slow must be an old model. 
21367 Quality looking blades, but dangerous! These things are very stiff and could take your fingers off no problem! After a tip-over one blade embedded itself in the arm of my quad. And the lifting ability is much less than my original blades. 
21368 :) 
21369 I flew to NYC to photograph a wedding. These got the job done well and worked as carry-on luggage. Very light and easy to carry. 
21370 Very economical camera for the price. But not happy that the waterproof case was scratched up. Not able to have a clear video due to the scratches. Need to sell this accessory separately. 
21371 High quality and good to have extras. 
21372 Out of the package it didn t work 😠 
21373 Utterly underwhelmed. For the price, this camera is uninspired and heavily sand-bagged. Switching to A7Rii 
21374 Lint magnet! 
21375 Nice , cheap backup camera... 
21376 LOOVEEE IT so much! 
21377 Great replacements for the original! 
21378 Great! Works perfectly 
21379 Works great...;love it 
21380 so far so good 
21381 great 
21382 no good, go for phottix pls 
21383 For a starter its a good product and yes the stand is shaky as written by others. Overall its a good product in such a price 
21384 it fits good 
21385 Ok so i bought these because sony charges too much. The batteries work fine for average use. However if you need a battery to last as long as the sony one that the camera came with, I would not buy these. Just pay the extra money. 
21386 excellent telephone service from Walter relatively short wait time - wait time has been better in the past 
21387 Delivered on time and what a great product. All metal light weight body but heavy duty enough to handle the big jobs. It could have been a little taller but hence the 4 stars. 
21388 Works great thank you 
21389 Awesome unit. Great value. Works perfectly as described. Very handy on shoots! 
21390 Henry from customer service was incredible. He resolved my issues with my cameras both at my site and my remote site. Very satisfied with my cameras and Foscam 
21391 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
21392 glad to find film for a special project 
21393 Great Value! 
21394 I love this camera and would not change it for the world. The customer service provided to me by Walter was professional and unrushed. It was perfect service and support. 
21395 Yhe dogs aren t happy. 
21396 I am an amateur, but I love photography. I now have a lens that gives me the ability to get great Micro shots. I love it, and I got it in 2 days. Bonus!! 
21397 Don t think, just buy. This camera is good enough to pay itself off with the freelance work it can create. 
21398 works great! used it on hard hats and sports caps, not too irritating on the head as well. 
21399 I use these batteries almost everyday. The original set I purchased is still going strong after 2years of continuous use. Added another camera to the setup and came right back to the same spot for batteries. Couldn t be happier. 
21400 functions as described. Additional memory is helpful for larger application. Requires some circuit reconfiguration to accommodate the lower board voltage. 
21401 It works fine. but the button is not soft like the camera of course. 
21402 best for prise!!! 
21403 thank you 
21404 cheap and effective 
21405 Nice, for light (not heavy) work. A little weak in the construction area...but for the price, an OK value. Easy to use and LOVE the portability. 
21406 I use these with my Smart Things system and it works pretty good. I ve noticed it misses quite a few motions. I m not super confident it is ability to pick up motion at the first past but eventually it sounds after a number of passes... 
21407 complicated as hell, instructions in googled english from chinese 
21408 the class was loose in the ring... rattled something horrible 
21409 Easy to setup, phone/pc controllable camera, works as expected 
21410 Great service. Great product 
21411 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21412 I still don t understand my first DSLR, but I ve already made magic with it. I m use to point and shoot cameras and almost DSLRs. I can t wait to learn how to use it properly, but once I learned to focus it, worked like clockwork. 
21413 I like it, but I hardly use this. it is too bulky to use as a transportable piece. It would be nice if I was stationary and left it up. But if that happened I would just build a wall. 
21414 I love the color, and the pictures are great! The product arrived quickly and just as stated. I am very happy with my purchase. 
21415 Good deal!!!! 
21416 What is not to love about instant photographs. All of the kids in 5th grade LOVE my &#34;old fashioned&#34; camera! 
21417 Only one worked ... Oh Well ... both took the charge but camera will not identify one of the batteries. Not the sellers fault. This has happen before so I chalk it up to the camera manuf. being propietary 
21418 Love this product. I have one in my car for my electronics and one in my house. Glad I have this as a safe way to clean my glasses, phone, and tablet. 
21419 Nice case. Phantom 3 and lots of extras fit perfectly. 
21420 Arrived on time with all accessories...everything just as promised. What an amazing drone, this technology has reached a remarkable price point for the capability and this seller will deliver. 
21421 I don t get the positive reviews. These are garbage. They last one week tops in a bark collar. 
21422 Very tough case. Traveled to Maui with no issues. Some of the comments said, that it comes with flash drives, but thats all lies. Its ONLY the case. 
21423 Didn t trust it to hold my expensive dslr, I ended up putting it on a smaller mirrorless instead. Even on this camera it cuts off circulation and is too tight. 
21424 Easy on screen protection 
21425 It broke at the foot right upon opening of package. And I m afraid to open the second package. :( What a disappointment. 
21426 Easy to install and configure the system. Worth the money. 
21427 Really helped alot 
21428 It works great and i love how the price was low but good dvr 
21429 excelente 
21430 Great Price, Fast Shipping 
21431 This Nikon lense does an outstanding job of capturing those long and difficult shots! 
21432 nice adapter and easy to set up 
21433 Fulfilling all expectations, very happy with the choice. 
21434 Got this for my daughter who loves it. Perfect for her Fugi film Instax photos. 
21435 Lights get dangerously hot way too fast. 
21436 Works really well. Accurately charges and doesn t overcharge. I don t have many charging at the same time, but it seems to work brilliantly 
21437 High quality good fit fair price good delivery 
21438 Hello, my only complaint has been that the dvr has stopped working after 7 months. Cannot find out if there is a warranty. 
21439 I used it during couple of my treks, outdoor shoots etc and its a great tool to protect your camera from rain, dust and snow. After some heavy use, some of the joints tore off. But its still usable. 
21440 Great alternative for the Nikon EN-EL4A that costs a lot more. The charge holds well over multiple cycles, which is a concern with aftermarket batteries. The full coding is good for battery metering. 
21441 works in my Lumix. Hope it lasts as long as the Panasonics. Seems to have high rating among many users. Sweet. 
21442 Just like a OEM charger. At a good price. And it charges quick. 
21443 The handle is light and really well made. The strap has a nice buckle which allows you to cinch the strap to minimize the chance of it coming off. Overall great quality and I highly recommend. 
21444 This pack has everything you d need at a really great price. Wish the case was a little bigger to hold everything it comes with but all in all a great package 
21445 Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. 
21446 Great 
21447 it broke when tightened. 
21448 Great camera in good lighting, not so good at night. Over all not bad for the price. 
21449 very clear & great 
21450 This needs to 0 stars. This cable did not work at all. I have been busy and I need to find out how to return it. It was supposed to fit this camera. 
21451 Camera and accessories are great. But I m still waiting for the original Nikon camera manual. I won t buy from Al s in the future. 
21452 love it! 
21453 love the remote 
21454 This clearly states it s a 2 pack and we only received one! 
21455 Works great!!! This selfie stick is so easy to use. It works great with my iPhone 5 and it holds the phone tightly in place. It is made of good material and looks durable. Love using this selfie stick with family and friends. 
21456 Works like a charm and fits my battery. Exactly what I ordered. 
21457 A+ 
21458 Awesome, awesome, awesome my daughter loves it n takes everywhere, get the back door before going to the beach with it, better safe then sorry 
21459 very disappointed camera not showing cheaper cameras a showing better and as a professional installer i was very shocked not 850 TVL very blurry 
21460 The camera takes good pictures, but i am disappointed it does not have red-eye control, or control for shaky hands. My last Canon had both features 
21461 This is a pretty decent camera actually for the money! Very clear video and easy to use interface... It s not perfect but for the money I can t ask for more. 
21462 I ll never lose my camera lens cap again! 
21463 It s been over two years and still works perfectly even after I peeled it up and repositioned it 5 times. Battery died once. Only sad aspect is you can t change the tone length. Beeps 3 times for probably 4-5 seconds. 
21464 Would buy again 
21465 Ok 
21466 Awesome 
21467 I love this bag! It s light, fits my laptop has room for other stuff and travels great! 
21468 works as advertised. 
21469 I like this tool....glad to see that this cardboard technology is still used.. 
21470 Best sound ive heard after trying a few different mics. 
21471 Love this, and the fact it has multiple uses. I ve used it with my camera, and my microphone. Works great and is really stable and flexible. 
21472 Great accessory. Very strong lamp mount, will not go anywhere. 
21473 I m very proud of these items. These items arrived just in time as expected; I m very proud of them. 
21474 this product is just the right tool to eliminate the hard light on faces, I tried it with my little girl and they were able to handle the brightness. it is difficult to set it up on the LED light, but nothing that some Sticky backs can t handle. 
21475 They would have been nice if the collimation had been correct. I ended up getting the &#34;Nikon 7238 Action Ex Extreme 8 X 40 mm&#34; and I have been happy with them. 
21476 buy for a friend 
21477 Gets used every day at work. Easy point and shoot, or you can take movies. 
21478 Horrible design. Too short (I m 6&#34; feet tall) and the loops kept catching on my shirt everytime I pulled the camera up. 
21479 Works great. It is a little heavy. 
21480 Price was great and batteries are holding charge just fine. 
21481 Its cheap and nothing extraordinary about this. you get what you pay for.. which is mediocre 
21482 great set up in bag with &#34;cleaning&#34; sticker, and protector x2 and a large micro fiber cloth. good value, does the job. 
21483 Woks great with the camera. 
21484 this offers some really interesting perspectives. I use it with my telephoto lens. Tip: great for take large group selfies!!!! 
21485 took horrible pictures when it did work...most the time it wouldn t come on. 
21486 Excellent product. 
21487 I have bought Wasabi batteries for several cameras and I have never had a problem. They work just as well as the name brand, but cost much less. The included charger with international and car adapters is a nice plus too. 
21488 Just got - took about 10 minutes to setup, looks better than pics, good price, smooth operation, easy to use and pic quality is also good. If anything changes - will surely update this review. Thanks [owned it for only an hour] 
21489 A lot stronger than the case that came with it. 
21490 I loved this purchase. Seriously great quality items for a great price! AVAWO is where its going down!! 
21491 Yaaaaaaaaas, blows dust away from my sensor. My images are happy :) 
21492 This was just what I was looking for to replace old DVR. Works great. Had a small issue with viewing on phone but customer service talked me through it in a few minutes. 
21493 Never used it under water, the pictures are blurry on land what would it look like under water.. 
21494 Excellent, good prices and shipping time was quik, 
21495 This is a really great trialed for the price. Very easy to set up. Already enjoying it on my deck. Great company, shipped fast and safe. Would highly recommend. 
21496 product delivered as promised product as explained in description no problem 
21497 Awesome 
21498 I think it has all been said. I know of no downside to this lens. 
21499 Bought this for my dad and he loves it. It was easy to set up and he likes the remote control options. He shows this off whenever he has guests! 
21500 You get what you pay for.. mount secures well but materials are what you would expect for price. Even after securing screw better the hinge still has some play that will wobble on rough terrain. 
21501 Great Camera, good video quality, awesome accessories, exceptional value! 
21502 I love this funky camera. It takes flattering photos of people with its slightly soft focus and vintage tint. 
21503 the tripod works great but was damaged in shipping would buy again but from a different supplier 
21504 Camera came as advertised...like new...with a quick delivery turn around time 
21505 as described 
21506 Nice for the price and simple to set up. 
21507 don t buy it trust me. Waste of time and money!!! 
21508 I just purchased the camera and I can t even get the LED light to turn green so that I can connect it. I will be returning the camera. 
21509 Great camera! 
21510 one of the best N nikon lenses 
21511 good resolution, no space 
21512 holds my gopro securely to tthe tripod i have, and the camera slides easily in and out of the pegs. great product, shipped fast 
21513 looks like the real thing. Quality? Time will tell. 
21514 Fast delivery and a great deal! 
21515 Great value! Works just fine, good picture quality. Overall very satisfied with the purchase, especially with customer service. Received an extra battery when I notified that one of the batteries was not functioning! Overall a great buy! 
21516 Great tripod for I-Phone. Works well with 6 plus 
21517 I love it! Thank you! 
21518 Quality is okay but the bigger cover gets in the way of the lens if fully extended 
21519 Bought for the convenience and after one day at SDCC the strap keeps unhooking and I almost dropped my camera. I honestly would not recommend this strap, try another brand. 
21520 The last pack of 10 didn t come in the box, but it doesn t look like it was messed with! It arrived on time and I m super happy to have more film!! 
21521 good 
21522 perfect for the job I needed it for. 
21523 Haven t tested it under the conditions I plan yet, but setup and test runs worked great. Simple setup and good response; using a Sony A3000 
21524 The only difference between this cap and the one that comes with it is a rubber gasket! What a ripoff. Should have come with the camera in the first place. 
21525 Had trouble port forwarding the F19821P camera on a Netgear/Frontier DSL modem/router and called support. Richard, the tech support remotely accessed my computer and quickly resolved my problem. Great camera. I thank Foscam and Richard for the support. 
21526 The tech was very helpful & solved my problem Thanks 
21527 So far so good. Lots to learn about it yet. 
21528 The best fake camera on the market. It looks far better than the very cheap one being sold under a dozen names on Amazon. This one looks real! 
21529 very happy 
21530 FANTASTIC set! Love this portrait lens and all the goodies that came with it. 
21531 great kit to have for your trip 
21532 This grip fit my new 70D perfectly and shipped very fast. I am interested in extending my shooting time but the added controls on the grip will come in very handy. I m definitely a very happy customer. 
21533 it does seems to loose charge faster than factory battery. Great value for money can t go wrong with price I paid. 
21534 good protection 
21535 This is a wonderful little camera. There have been moments when I missed an eyepiece but outside that it has been very good. It takes excellent pictures, and it feels very well balanced in my hand. 
21536 My son loves this kit. Everything he ever needed for his GoPro, and more! 
21537 ok 
21538 Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks 
21539 I misplaced my orginal charger and this one is a good replacement. It somes with an accesory adaptor, USA and Eoropean power adaptor. Great bargain with two batteries. 
21540 as expected 
21541 good , fast shipping , that s great :) 
21542 They reflect light really well and the addition of 5 colors is really nice. 
21543 Great deal for a great camera! 
21544 Clear protection and great fit... Definitely recommended. 
21545 Quick shipping. Works great 
21546 I think this is pretty nice and although I only have a regular video camera, it is important because I might drop it like I always do to my phone 
21547 I don t have one of these monopods but all of the reviews below that I have read are not even for this item but some tripod!!!!!! This looks great to me especially for the price. 
21548 Best thing to hold both my Garmin AND my NyteRyder 600 headlight! 
21549 It work as advertise, all my old Minolta lenses work great in my Samsung NX500 and NX1100. 
21550 I really like this. Works well. 
21551 Good Product at the right price. They are a little on the lower quality end but they are not expensive either. 
21552 Simply magical difference in sharpness and color of photos now 
21553 bag was nice and very well padded. I didn t like the color as it was not as tan as the picture showed, probably due to flash. The bad is actually a weird brown color 
21554 Fogged up 15-20 minutes when camera was only exposed not submerged. Didnt fit my sony cybershot snug, had to really squeeze camera case to take pictures 
21555 Great lens. 
21556 This is a great lens hood. At first it was a little difficult to figure out how to put it onto my camera, but after I got it I ve been taking great photos. 
21557 Good fit,. Good replacement. Even survived the most horrific, mangled trip through the post office imaginable. 
21558 These were fantastic. Needed them for an impromptu fashion shoot and they worked perfectly. The giant CFL bulbs mimic daylight very well and that s what I used them for, to enhance the natural daylight on an indoors shoot. Easy, light, and flexible. 
21559 Couldnt get it to work. 
21560 Cables working great , been in use for a while. 
21561 Amazingly simple, Will probably get another set. I did swap the disk for a larger one. Mine came with a WD green drive. 
21562 Do not use this adpter with zeiss. It fried my zeiss Otus lens. It had to be sent back and the lens chip had to be replaced. the aperature could no longer be changed. 
21563 needed a small cable to plug into the back of my car radio , this fit the bill perfectly 
21564 Great bag 
21565 Nice protection 
21566 Bad, several of the item came broken, including lens, tripod, etc. 
21567 This is my third shell replacement. Works like a charm every time. The fact that it comes with screws is incredibly helpful, just in case. 
21568 Just got it for my Nikon Coolpix L840 - perfect size. I was going to get another bag for 3x the cost basically just because it was purple - glad I got this. 
21569 I suddenly lose lenses cap while travelling 
21570 This bundle really helped me in protecting my camera lenses. I always keep a spare cap 
21571 It funny that i haven t last the cap since i purchased the bundle! 
21572 Holds out for the entire worship service. We ll see if it will hold out for a nearly two hour cantata. 
21573 Very good glass. 
21574 Very helpful 
21575 Slightly off. 
21576 This allows me to have enough juice to record to the limit of the storage capacity. GREAT! 
21577 Great Value at a great price. I love it! 
21578 Nice case for what I wanted, which was a compact case to carry on occasion my D7000 with an 18 - 200 attached. This fits snugly without any extra room. 
21579 Exactly what I needed 
21580 Not good at all. Don t bother, save your time, energy, and money. 
21581 i like it 
21582 LOVE IT! using it for reviewing training tracks with my dog, works great, easily adjustable to other people also. 
21583 It s ok, I didn t realize that it didn t have a view finder for the eye. I am going to give the camera away to my daughter and try another one. 
21584 Goes with BG-E16 
21585 Works very well for my Application TY 
21586 The control just have approx. 10 ft of range, so I have to open the door to connect and disconnect the sensor. That s really does not work. 
21587 Great Lens, great sharpness and nice to low light and mid-telephoto lens. 
21588 Great 
21589 Does the job at a great price. 
21590 Waterproof camera, nope. First time used, Lid popped open, camera ruined. Lid is impossible to close. Call Coleman, they will not back product. Called elite brands who actually make the camera for a month straight, they will not call back. This camera is a waste of money. Do not buy. 
21591 it is wonderful. I have two. 
21592 Fits just as it s supposed to. Thanks. 
21593 Way too fun and very dangerous too 
21594 It wasn t with complet cable or (USB) I bought additional VGA USB from best buy. It doesn t have full instruction. Poor quality 
21595 Fits nicely on the headstrap. Headstrap with camera mounted doesn t even get close to being able to sink. Don t even notice the float pro attached when wearing the headstrap. 
21596 Good 
21597 Works great for the price. First one didn t fit and I received a new one that did fit the next day. 
21598 I use this to house a Sony CX-900 and it s just right for that size camera with the accessories I use with it. The lock is a bit of a joke but that doesn t matter to me. Excellent protection at a reasonable price. 
21599 Must have for securely holding backdrops. These clamps are durable and reach fully around frame bars. Highly recommend. 
21600 Great backup batteries for your GoPro. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for spares. 
21601 Love the sleek and stealthy look of this housing. 
21602 I love buying in bulk because technically it s cheaper. still, pretty pricey but IMO it s worth it. 
21603 Nice looking backpack a must have IF you are traveling 
21604 Lots of fun 
21605 Nice 
21606 Haven t spent a great deal of time using it yet. Lots of options and settings so I m reading through the manual. It does a good job in low light. The most impressive thing so far is how fast it auto-focuses. 
21607 Still getting used to the camera and settings, so far it has been a great camera for the money! 
21608 Not a bad set of batteries and had them for about a year and they have been very successful 
21609 Just as advertised. 
21610 AGAIN YOU CAN T BEAT THE PRICE AND IT WORK S GREAT... 
21611 Fits t3i perfectly. So glad i bought this. 
21612 Awesome deal, so much fabric for your money, I am very happy with my purchase. 
21613 I bought it for my 31 yr. old son for his birthday and he liked it. I like making him happy. 
21614 Just developed my pictures from Curaco. Amazing. 
21615 Doesn t really work especially with small lenses. 
21616 works great, great value, price. 
21617 Picture quality and refresh rate could be better, but all in all, quite useful. 
21618 I rec d the product quickly, but it is NOT &#34;plug and play&#34;. I could not make it work so I sent it back. 
21619 Works great 
21620 The quality of the plastic is way below par. I wouldn t recommend this product. 
21621 Very easy to install. Hard screen protector. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to protect there screen. 
21622 Works well 
21623 Love this lens!! 
21624 Works great!! Set up process took less than 10 minutes. Video quality is great. Real time monitoring works well. 
21625 Works great. Nobody comes up my driveway unannounced anymore. 
21626 material and graphics were not as expected 
21627 These are worth every penny. Great for cleaning my laptop screen, cell phone screen and glasses. 
21628 Very handy accessory. I ll also use as a light source in my macro photography. 
21629 Holds a charge for a long time. 
21630 Good price. What more to say 
21631 Great item that is durable and easy to use! 
21632 perfecta 
21633 easy to operate 
21634 Didn t work at all 
21635 This tripod is the nicest tool for your filmmaking I used this were ever I go has good grip and it can hold my a7s with lens with no problems 
21636 So far working as advertised. No complaints 
21637 Very basic, but it does the trick when you want something lightweight and easy to carry. 
21638 Great value!!! 
21639 Works great, surpassed my expectations 
21640 bad 
21641 Works. 
21642 Great! 
21643 Super sick - Came quick! Would Buy again. 
21644 A++++++++++ 
21645 This is the second Altura UV lens filter that I have bought. I m happy with both. Great product for the cost! 
21646 My daughter loved all the accessories and would have been even better if it included the photo paper. 
21647 Awesome & reasonable product. Photoshopping after was a breeze and very clean. My pictures came out great !! 
21648 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
21649 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21650 Love it 
21651 Works great!! 
21652 Love the zoom...wish image was better stabilized at full zoom but still impressive... 
21653 Was not the color shown. This case is black. I really wanted the grey version. Still it s a pelican. 
21654 I dropped my gopro by accident still ok bec of this case. 
21655 The best Adult toy! Been having a blast using it with our children. Strongly recommend adult supervision with young children. 
21656 I had to return the Camera, but leaving a review because getting credited for the Square Trade warranty was quick and painless. Thanks! 
21657 Love it,want to order another one! 
21658 It works 
21659 Terrible, System stopped powering up after 2 months. Out of Amazon return time, and Zmodo is giving me the RMA run around. Get a better brands 
21660 Good product. But field of view is small 
21661 Nice quality for the price! My dad recently dug out his old tripod that was more expensive than this one, and you can tell that this one is cheaper. But even so, it will do the job nicely and feels stable enough. I m happy with it! 
21662 itwas everthing that I hoped for. 
21663 Goid as described 
21664 The charger and battery worked perfectly for my 10 year old camer. 
21665 great value 
21666 Does everything it s supposed to. I clip this on my belt, so I don t use the strap that comes with it. Construction seems good and it fits the camera nicely. So, nothing to fault this on, which qualifies if for 5 stars. 
21667 Works as expected, its a red light to use while you are in darkness using ones Telescope. I saves your night vision. 
21668 Excellent quality, still working great 
21669 Serves it purpose for the price 
21670 Great product for the money more than met my expectations. 
21671 This item does not charge the battery. 
21672 I purchased this item to photo small collectibles. They are easy to handle one handed therefore you can easily adjust the extra light one sometimes needs. 
21673 I could not find this anywhere! I have a Nikon Coolpix, and I lost this cable. It works just as good as the original. Good price for it too! Got here quickly. 
21674 This was a wonderful by die package! My wireless remote was not wireless though... But even with that alteration, you can t go wrong with all the gadgets you get with such a high quality camera for the price! 
21675 Excellent, delivered on time, was as described, great customer service (if contacted) 
21676 Excelente! 
21677 Wish it would mount on the lens backwards for better storage when not in use 
21678 Great product at great price. I have other systems more expensive cost and the same funcion. ZOSI results very easy to instal and friendly in web. The QR code is realy a goog idea to make an easy conection with my movil device. 
21679 Very handy to have while traveling. Was able to have battery life to film/photograph every second of the 4 dives a day for 7 days. These batteries seemed to last (Though I don t know for sure) longer than the GoPro branded one that came with the camera. 
21680 GoPro auto charger is very handy. 
21681 Worked great with IPhone 6 plus. 
21682 Ok cloths but not as high quality as other cloths I got with my new glasses 
21683 Great sound quality and nice and slim/light. 
21684 I got everything I was promised The package arrived on time well worth $19 and change...Jed 
21685 fell apart in a week 
21686 works great with my Sony alpha 3000 , it s water proof .Arrived in a few days, it s exactly what I needed 
21687 This looks completely real. Lights up nicely too giving the impression it is legit 
21688 I m going to keep it because I can make it work, but it is disappointing that the strap won t tighten up enough to stay on my wrist. Service and delivery was excellent. 
21689 Perfect. Reliable and easy to install. 
21690 Decent product for the money 
21691 works great cheap price. 
21692 Good! 
21693 Can anyone tell me how to get ahold of fujifilm? My camera came with no lens nor batteries? 
21694 works great!!!! 
21695 Love my new filter! Great service, thank you! 
21696 Will buy again 
21697 camera is beautiful BUT one setting (the house one) only draws out plain white pictures so just put it on another setting. 
21698 It works well I also going to buy the stunt man harness gives extra positions for the stuff I m into 
21699 They work very well 
21700 Batteries work as expected. And were really cheap! So 5⭐️ I guess. With a product like this, it can really only be either 5⭐️ Or 1⭐️ Either it works or doesn t. And the batteries do last a fairly long time. 
21701 Perfect! I have been looking for something like this FOREVER. Now I don t have to wear pants with pockets when I shoot =P 
21702 Great price, great service, and great quality! 
21703 Pretty good item 
21704 fantastic. used for a few months now, no issues. setup was a breeze if you know a little about technology. IR is WAY better than expected. truly commercial grade 
21705 Great camera to have. 
21706 Item arrived quickly in good condition. Easy to use. The mini tripod that came with it broke after a couple of uses. Overall nice product. 
21707 Standard military issue NVG mount. Hardware fits just right. We ll see how it lasts, but seems pretty sturdy. 
21708 What a great camera this has been. Small in size but it can take some great pictures! Plenty of settings and the video quality is good as well. Didnt think I would use the feature to transfer to/from my phone but it is handy 
21709 Good product, good delivery 
21710 Auto focus does not work on Tamron 150-600. Will be returning, not as advertised. 
21711 It was very good 
21712 Excellent 
21713 It didn t come with the blower, which I was looking forward for 
21714 Bought it as a gift which has brought joy and many thanks. 
21715 battery did not seem to hold its charge. 
21716 These are original props and fit perfectly! 
21717 Not exactly as I wanted but I am using it for past 2 years. Product is working 
21718 It works well :) 
21719 These last quite a long time when used to power a video light. 
21720 Solid construction, so far all ports work. Plugs up via usb. Love that feature since it allows me to charge all via external powerbank! 
21721 It works but is pretty rinky dink. I wouldn t put a really expensive flash on this. 
21722 Great little kit , would recommend ;) 
21723 Are you kidding me??? This is the best camera I ve ever purchased to date!!! 
21724 It s a battery 
21725 A small, fabulous camera with the bells and whistles of a professional s camera 
21726 Very light and easy to use. 
21727 My daughter love it,and I do also we took it to a trip and it s so cool to experience instant pic without been able to edit or repeat it 100 times.LOL 
21728 Thanks 
21729 I don t like typing 
21730 easy to install and use i have 3 cams.One died early but we have had a really wet summer 
21731 This mini tripod has amazing applications for specialized photo situations. 
21732 bought used mint condition pics are sharp couldn t be any happier with it 
21733 Super helpful for photographers like me! 
21734 good 
21735 Good product battery life low 
21736 This is a fun and must have accessory to any GoPro camera 
21737 The FloarPro looks like it is good quality, but I used this about twice and one of the plastic mounts snapped rendering it useless. 
21738 For hiking, catching a quick shot in the mist. This product is THE Best! 
21739 Good products I would like to get two more of them. 
21740 Great replacement battery. No issues, I used it to shoot a wedding and it held charge for the whole event. 
21741 Pretty nice tripod arrived a day early too 
21742 Low quality pictures 
21743 thought this was a bigger case, it won t fit my camcorder but it will be ideal for my camera 
21744 Good quality. Have had this for a few years now. 
21745 They are not a Clear view distributor. none of the product has warranty. Not approved by company. 
21746 I ve got to say, these filters definitely are worth the price! The package came in perfect condition, ad the filters work great, although the cool only works at a certain angle lighting and what not, but overall it is worth five stars!! 
21747 Great addition for the GoPro 
21748 Love it! Works great with my Nikon D3300 I just got. No more running to get in the picture in the allotted seconds! Makes for much more relaxed group photos! 
21749 Foscam cameras work pretty well for me, except I have been worried about hackers logging into my cameras. I just set up my 4th camera however and the customer representative named Walter was knowledgeable and professional. 
21750 Excellent control, does exactly as described. No problems yet! 
21751 Worked as replacement well 
21752 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She loves cameras and she tells me that the quality of these work perfectly fine! 
21753 It works. Light alum material. Works as advertised. Will buy again. 
21754 Fits perfect for 27 mm lense. Comes with polarzer and UV filters. Only dow fall is lack of compact holding case. 
21755 Amazing!!! Lighting is perfect and very easy to set up! 
21756 Organization, good. 
21757 This is a great little camera for the semi pto or starter. It is versitile, has almost all the same components as higher end cameras, and takes great shots. Money well spent! 
21758 works fine. 
21759 Fits my iPad Mini and is well made. 
21760 Good and fit just right 
21761 Had to modify a bit to fit on my tripod but it works perfectly 
21762 Bought these to replace a stock lens cap holder that no longer sticks. These fit the lens. No issues so far, and with the 10 pack, it s not a big deal if they don t end up being durable. 
21763 A very satisfactory product. worth the money spent on it. The picture clarity is amazing. Captures the minute details with perfection. 
21764 Great quality for this price. Fits perfectly for Canon Rebel T1i. 
21765 Fit my NX1000 stock lense perfectly. 
21766 Didn t work 
21767 This battery was perfect and just what I was looking for. This also shipped promptly and arrived when I was advised it would arrive. Thank you. 
21768 love it! 
21769 Very good! 
21770 I love it! 
21771 I am still learning to use this camera but I have already took some very good quality pictures and the zoom is impressive. I am very happy with this purchase 
21772 Came quick and did the job. 
21773 Great value for the money. 
21774 Extremely Poor Image resolution. We were very glad we tested this before going on our trip. Spend the extra few bucks on the GoPro hero and you will be as thankful for the decision as we were. 
21775 going to use this for a guest book for my grandmothers 90th birthday. got it today and tried it out... took everything for me to not use all the film :) 
21776 Great and fast way to capture moments. It s so fun to take pictures with this camera! The product is exactly as described and adorable! 
21777 Not worth the money 
21778 I have Canon 6D and I couldn t get it to work even after spending 3 hours trying to adjust it. 
21779 No problems, delivered quickly 
21780 got this for my mother in-law who lost hers. it was exactly whatt she needed and she was vary happy with it 
21781 Great product! 
21782 Must have for any go pro user 
21783 I love this camera! I can t say enough good things about it. Handy size. 
21784 Great product 
21785 Love using this reflector in my photography!!! 
21786 Arrived as expected and works well. 
21787 Love my Nikon. Easy to use and great pictures. 
21788 Love this purchase! The camera works lovely, looks nice, and the pictures turn out great. Really brings back memories using this camera, so happy with it! 
21789 Thanks 
21790 ... perfect size for my unit... and not that easy to get anywhere... 
21791 Everything works as described. This is one of my most important toolset to own. Love it. 
21792 Superfast service and superb quality from this company - this is excellent &#34;no news&#34; news, I d say. You will, too. 
21793 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NBNJZEK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 
21794 Perfect, just what I wanted. 
21795 is very good 
21796 work with my hero 3 blk 
21797 Great product. It is everything I need 
21798 This one works great. 
21799 In answer to a posted question, yes. this is a true FX lens and a superb one. It works beautifully with my d810 as well as being an excellent portrait lens with my d7100. 
21800 The case appeared decent but the top clip had chipped so no use. Quality control issue. Returned for refund and getting different brand soon. 
21801 Love this camera. Works really well. Still reading through the owners manual there is a lot to learn. I love the built in wifi though, such a great feature! 
21802 Does its job for website photography for our shop. Quality is on the cheaper side, but it s fully functional and so far its been reliable. I ve had it about 8 months now. No problems. I use it for product shots. 
21803 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
21804 These cameras are Awesome! Unbelievable clarity, and capability to pan and zoom. They ROCK! 
21805 The protector seems to be of a high standard. I may just have been lucky, but the application process went smoothly. No scratches noted so far, and no bubbles. Overall, very satisfied. 
21806 Great! 
21807 Just recieved my new Drone for my son, he absolutely loves it. Great first Drone for someone starting out flyine one.. 
21808 This product does not support the 5-in-1 diffuser made by the same company.I couldn t get it to stand up with the diffuser attached. the legs didnt open wide enough (they never do, do they?) and didnt offer enough support. It constantly fell over as soon as I let go. 
21809 I tell everyone to buy these as baby monitors because they re much better and cheaper than the average or even top-of-the-line baby monitors. 
21810 good product 
21811 Great props! Aircraft even seems more stable and quiet. 
21812 Received on time and packed very well. I charged both batteries and tested them in my new Sony camera and they worked perfect. I recommend this item. 
21813 Waste of money 
21814 Exactly what I wanted it works with the car charger as well, if you have more then one battery I would highly recommend buying one of these, I have no problems with this product at all 
21815 I tried the X-rite on my Mac Book pro and my colors are still bad. Then I tried with an external monitor, A 27&#34; View-sonic VX2703MH-LED and see no change at all. I created a new user, the profile is just perfect. 
21816 Very useful for road riding for beginners 
21817 This slider is great for the price! It s really helped me grow a lot. It s sturdy too! 
21818 Was smaller than what I needed, but would make a nice office desk decor 
21819 Thanks 
21820 Product was delivered as promised and it was exactly as pictured and described. Will order from Digital Goja again in the future. 
21821 As far as I ve seen this little thing should come with a piece (adapter / marker) to set it properly.. Well!! Good news doesn t come with it, so now I have to invent by myself how assemble it. 
21822 Great piece does what I need it to do. Not sure how the auto focus is because I am using a manual focus lens with it. 
21823 Not expensive, comes with a double side charger. Works well with my Xiaomi YI. 
21824 This frame is great! I haven t had it long so I haven t programmed it for all the things it can do, but I have read the manual and I look forward to taking advantage of all the great features! 
21825 It is perfect!!! so compact and works great. Came just in time to charge for my trip to the Oregon Coast with the family! Can even charge in the car!!!! 
21826 Great product - fast delivery!!!! 
21827 Great company. The security cameras are perfect. Built to last. The picture quality is very nice, night vision is incredible. 5 star 
21828 Excellent 
21829 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. 
21830 Needs styrofoam backing to make it fit GoPro 
21831 Looks good, comfortable to use and my camera can fit nicely into it. 
21832 1 camera worked the second would never turn on. 
21833 Good 
21834 have had limited usage yet but seems great - especially for the price 
21835 it takes a fulls second to catch up when you look left or right. i would not recommend these glasses. 
21836 terrific unit..great quality for the price...range 1,000 ft !!!!! 
21837 Great product! 
21838 very good performance 
21839 bought this for my wife maybe a little more than she can handle but a very nice camera. 
21840 Love the look and no more back pain from my previous slings! My favorite camera harness yet. Great for women with larger bust lines. Only slight issues with loose clothing getting caught and pinching of skin when not wearing sleeves. 
21841 Great 
21842 do not ever use proper cardsthey don t work and you re screwed if you do use them 
21843 I like it. I am excited to use it when my is at college and I can see him and talk with him. 
21844 Replaced my 832 that died. Works great. 
21845 Just what I needed. 
21846 Not happy about how Amazon recommends this with the Meike 910 and it doesn t work with it! When it did light up, I found it didn t make a difference with my flash and now the battery pack won t power up at all. 
21847 The chopper came dysfunctional; two propellers gave out after the 2nd flight. I went to return it, but there return policy expires the day after you received it. BEWARE of the return policy, it s not enough given time to return it. 
21848 Really cool little camera. Great fun to use. Pulls you into the world of creative videography. Fun!, Fun!, Fun! 
21849 I realy like thar it also came with a car charger adapter. 
21850 great for traveling 
21851 I have an issue. I bought these a few months ago and everything worked perfect besides one pack! The last pack is inside the Polaroid but nothing comes out. I am pissed about this. 
21852 Great brace. I use it with a set of very large x56mm objective binoculars. I set the brace up to sit where my abdomen meets my sternum or atop my Alaskian Guide Creations bino pack. 
21853 Alvin Mathhews was very good and a gentlemanvery patient and knowlegeable 
21854 GREAT camera! 
21855 They charge fast and last forever running a 7in HD IPS field monitor. The included 12v adapter provides charging in the field where there is a cig lighter or 12vDC acc plug. 
21856 Works great looks great 
21857 the system works great.. but the Uniden App is totally lost.. Uniden Company needs to fix this ASAP 
21858 For it s size, this is incredibly durable. Most small &#34;travel&#34; tripods are cheap junk. This isn t. I love it. 
21859 nice nice 
21860 item was same as description. The shipping was fast. I would recommend this seller. item not that great 
21861 Waste of your money. Would not recommend buying this product. 
21862 This is quite a nice addition for my portable video shoots of presenters using a curtain backdrop. The bulbs can be replaced with brighter ones if needed. Good quality materials and the videos are greatly improved using the lighting setup. 
21863 The camera is cute and perfect starter camer for my tween daughter. She s learning all the modes and is inspired to take good photos. This will help her be on her way! 
21864 ok 
21865 I recieved this as a gift to replace a very old HEAVY tripod. It is a great replacement, much lighter to carry but holds my Nikon D3300 great! 
21866 I couldn t use the power button or the side button that switched it from vibrate to ringer once the case was on. 
21867 this product is a great replacement item for the one that came with the camera. 
21868 works great with camera 
21869 This is the Fuji flagship ttl flash for the x-series cameras... It s pretty limited in features, the lcd user interface is pretty terrible, has no slave mode (infrared, optical, or otherwise) it s only getting 3 stars because it does get the exposure settings right 
21870 Works good. 
21871 I ended up returning this item ONLY because it was not appropriate for the size of our system. Otherwise, it provided a nice spotlight for our cameras. 
21872 Work as advertised. It s nice to have backup power when making a long hike or bicycling trip. 
21873 good camera for the price, will recommend to friends. 
21874 Tris is a pes of s*** i was flaing around 200m and The drone fail down because a stall motor 
21875 I just need the nuts 
21876 I am loving this monitor right now. Super clear. For the price I am getting exactly what I needed. The refresh rate at times is delayed slightly but other than that I am satisfied with this purchase. Fast shipment as well. 
21877 Quick delivery from Amazon,Drone sucks NO directions,NO parts sheet,NO tec support,High priced junk,China crap BUY AMERICAN 
21878 Kinda cheap. You have to be directly in front of the camera which makes it not that valuable to me. Would not buy again. 
21879 calvin was great help 
21880 I have purchased two of these for my cameras. It was two of the easiest installations I have ever made. It goes on so quickly and before you know it is attached to the screen just as pretty as you please. 
21881 good stuff 
21882 Works great. It charges the battery very quickly. I d purchase again. 
21883 Perfect replacement battery form my older Olympus camera. 
21884 This is the perfect camera for my wife to get into photography with. 
21885 This camera works well, although it s limited as far as it s monitor capability. It s battery life is good and it take excellent high quality shots. I didn t like the menu structure and that is perhaps the biggest challenge. However its great for action 
21886 Worked and fit like original Canon Batteries 
21887 This arrived broken. I realize that it is inexpensive, but I didn t expect it to arrive already broken. It was unusable to me for the project for which I ordered it. 
21888 Haven t had to use it yet, but good to have! 
21889 The software stinks, poorly designed with no real instructions. While it does work, if doe s not my needs. 
21890 Fine 
21891 Ok for the price but NOT 32X. I tested it against my 10x Vortex monocular and it s magnification is less than the Vortex. It appears to be 8x, which is nowhere near 32x. I guess for the money it s not too bad for an 8x monocular. 
21892 amazing bag, tough and well organised 
21893 Easy to set up. Worked good. Shipping slow. 
21894 One battery died in a month or so. 
21895 The cameras are not wireless. So you have to have a plug wherever you place them which means they can not be DISCREET. 
21896 It s an eye cup. Nothing much to say about it. Replacement for one that fell off. 
21897 Excellent!!! Perfect time to arrive sooner than they promise .... Love it !!! 
21898 Great product, worked as described. Just what I needed. 
21899 This filter works great for long exposure photography. I really like the Lee system. You must learn how to use these filters properly, but when you do, you can get some outstanding photos. 
21900 charged the batteries up works great 
21901 For the price I didn t have very high expectations....that was a mistake! it exceeded all my expectations. About 2 seconds after I unpacked it I had it up and running...so simple to use 
21902 Enjoying this lens, I live where there are a lot of wildlife (deer, bobcats, turkeys, foxes etc) and I have gotten some great shots with this lens without spooking the animals. 
21903 The best 3-axis tripod I ve ever used. Very intuitive, strong, durable and functional. Not cheap, but worth the investment. Try buying 3 cheap ones and compare that to the cost of one nice one! 
21904 Excellent 
21905 Just a perfect purchasing experience: item was in stock, treated to timely delivery, and worked as expected lot of the box. No issues atoll; highly recommended. 
21906 Good Product. 
21907 great buy...a few dings but works perfectly !!!! 
21908 Works very well. 
21909 Small compact great product. 
21910 Love it! I also purchased the cell phone mount for my note 4 and it totally fits my needs! 
21911 just what I needed 
21912 They re poor quality and didn t seem to be put together properly, some louder than others, some batteries came dead and had to be replaced. Some people are saying there s a feature to make them ding when the door opens. Mine have 2 options, On/Off that s it. 
21913 Does what it is supposed to do. I don t think it needs extended review... 
21914 Happy with my purchase. 
21915 Great, still works perfectly after about 4 months 
21916 Bought as a replacement for another brand s replacement plastic latch. So far this one has done the trick! It might be a bit heavier but it is both strong and doesn t look loud like other colors of anodized aluminum 
21917 Excellent videos recorded and simple set up. 
21918 It has a great build made of metal only. The screw for the hotshoe unscrews easily so the whole thing swivels often. 
21919 This is a great little camera. Everything I expected. Happy with the purchase! 
21920 Charges as quickly and as well as original in first my two uses. Thicker than Canon original but not as wide; still fits in my bag easily. Haven t tried car adapter yet. 
21921 Works well and good price. 
21922 Honestly, I was super surprised by the quality of this bag. This bag is EXCELLENT for a amateur photographer (like me!) :) and $24.99?! The canon equivalent of this bag at best buy is at least $60! 
21923 I own two of these, great price I ll keep buying them for shure. 
21924 Slips off the strap too easily 
21925 Easy to install in wood as long as you don t hit buried screws or nails. Unobtrusive. 
21926 This stand doesn t hold more then 4 pounds. 
21927 Works great! I used on a 10hr plane ride to make a timelapse (http://andrewferguson.net/2015/08/15/seattle-to-heathrow-time-lapse/) and I had no issues. For $5, you can t go wrong with this. 
21928 Doesn t have a button to take picture 
21929 worth every penny!! plug into your camera and record the future... 
21930 Best accessory investment I have made as an amateur photographer! 
21931 Kenneth was very professional and helpful and knowledgeable in setting up my Foscam camera on my computer and my smart phone. Easy to understand and knows his Foscam products well. Thank you 
21932 super 
21933 every thing ok 
21934 I ve had the system installed a couple of weeks now. For the price this thing is feature loaded. Does what it is supposed to do, easy install, customer support very helpful. 
21935 Works as advertised. Gave me great time lapse photos. 
21936 Very pleased 
21937 Great case when you don t want to carry around a lot of gear. Durable, well made. Stable base - can set it down and it won t topple. Suspension cradles camera and accommodates many lens sizes. 
21938 Very nice item to give as a gift! Thrilling to see &#34;baby&#34; pics with the gift I gave :) Quality materials...very pleased with this product for gift giving! 
21939 Nice Lens 
21940 It works fine--a little cumbersome to program until you get the hang of it. Range to receiver is quite short so positioning it at the end of the drive was difficult. 
21941 Everything works good 
21942 Love it! 
21943 thank you 
21944 It is good and delivery time was great 
21945 Very handy octopus cable (well, quadrapus) for powering multiple low-draw devices from one source. 
21946 The product excellent! Arrived on time! Love it. 
21947 Great batteries last longer than my original cannon battery. 
21948 Amature Photographer....It s a lot of stuff for the price. If you purchase this stuff separately you re going to pay 3x as much the flash is $60+ alone. I m having fun learning about all the different filter and playing with the lens. no problems with any of it 
21949 It does not work. It does not charge the battery. 
21950 I m very pleased with the flash and I feel the seller did a great job..... 
21951 the body camera, lense and other items are very good but I received a wrong usb cable which is from Canon and that cant t fix with my camera!! I need the right brand and fix one. please replace it. 
21952 Thea s blades are fairly balanced and arrived on time. I have used them off and on for a few weeks and have seen them take quite a beating. 
21953 The video and audio is amazing on these glasses I was very amazed how good they work and for a great price. 
21954 These slide were great! We used them for a STEM Day Camp and the youth loved them. 
21955 Fast setup, easy to tote around, perfect for me. 
21956 roduct as described received on schedule. 
21957 FYI.....There s a $200 rebate from Panasonic on this camcorder AG-AC90APJ. The last three letters must be APJ to qualify. http://www.bhphotovideo.com/FrameWork/Rebates_Promos/093015_PANA10_070115.pdf 
21958 The bottom, where the weights are, just slide off. Almost dropped my camera. TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY THIS! 
21959 great product 
21960 This fit my camera correctly and works very well for the price. 
21961 Feels cheap but works, worried about it breaking 
21962 No instruction. Pass up 
21963 Junk ! the Bluetooth function doesn t work. I guess you get what you pay for. 
21964 This lens is much slower to focus and much louder (on my Sony A6000) than I had anticipated. I returned it and got the 35mm Sony, and I m much happier. 
21965 Perfect! 
21966 The tripod good for non DSLR camera, the bag it is very nice & the wire shutter release good for small DSLR like Nikon D3200 
21967 Excellent Product! 
21968 These items arrived in perfect condition and will be used by teachers in outdoor classroom science! 
21969 Had trouble closing binos enough to fit my eyes. 
21970 this item was delivered very fast and it works perfect. thanks 
21971 camera came promptly and is very helpful. great purchase. 
21972 Great case. Great build. Fits camera perfectly. 
21973 Works great for quick, on-the-go shoots! Easy to carry and set up. Recommend for sure. 
21974 just what I expected 
21975 I bought Two of these cameras to monitor and watch my dogs when I am at work. They are fantastic not only can I see the dogs but I can talk to them through the camera. 
21976 Awesome camera. 
21977 Sturdy and working great! 
21978 Used at water park, in lazy river and down big slides. Easy to hold no matter how many twists and turns. Worked great! 
21979 Love this frame! It helps a great grandmother feel in touch with everyone. Anyone would love this frame! Looks great and is easy to work. 
21980 this good price 
21981 Exactly what I expected to purchase. A little on the thicker side which is great. 
21982 Excellent camera, good security 
21983 Loved my purchase but it was used and the battery only lasted so many times before I packed it away. 
21984 I truly live this and will certainly recommend it to others 
21985 Perfect 
21986 Great accessory for the Go Pro ;) 
21987 If you can get the adjustments just right, this stabilizer is as good as they come for the doe. 
21988 works as expected 
21989 Works on my motorcycle, and fits my off brand GoPro knockoff 
21990 Great buy! 
21991 GREAT DEAL!!!!!!!!!! 
21992 OK - but too light to hold a Canon 5D Mk 3 with macro &#34;65&#34; lens. 
21993 Product did not keep the settings after several attempts to change them. Did not want to order another in event problem still existed with a new one. Looked cool though.. Went with a different dash cam that has worked great. 
21994 It seems like a pretty decent quality light bag. It keeps the light out. I m a little concerned the zipper is going to break, it feels very flimsy. 
21995 Unfortunately, this NVR was not compatible with my existing cameras and I Han to return it. The return process went very smoothly. 
21996 Perfect for the Sony NEX5T! 
21997 Good strong quality, much better than the cheap knockoffs. 
21998 excellent 
21999 Very easy setup, decent picture day and night, pan works well, half the price of others that don t have as good software. 
22000 Have it on my desk in the office. Gets lots of compliments for its clarity. 
22001 Used the camera on a recent 7 day cruise to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Took many great pictures. I really like the12x zoom and the camera s small size.It tucks away in a shirt pocket, but has the features of a much larger camera. 
22002 The image is better than my old cameras. 
22003 Definitely worth its money in twofold. sharp,accurate, light, easy to use. A good choice for an amateur I d say 
22004 Plate dose not have a griping strip on its surface causing plate to loosen from the lens ( Tamron 150-600 ) mounting base. Must carry Allen wrench for insurance while on a shoot. 
22005 Thank you. 
22006 Didn t expect much. Got what I paid for. Have used it for a few weeks with no problems. Attaches and removes easily. Just beware that you may pick up some silhouetting when fully extended. 
22007 This fits nicely around the body of my Nikon D5300. The silicon is a little slick, hopefully that won t last, as it is just that little bit slippery to the touch. It looks like all camera functions work perfectly, I m very happy with it. 
22008 Received as described and prompt shipping. Fits my Nikon D3200 perfectly and protects the LCD screen. 
22009 Fits tight on a 35-70 f/3.4 zoom, just like all the pro adapters I have bough from Fotodiox. A little too tight in that it s somewhat hard to remove from that lens, but not really a problem. 
22010 I only had it for a short time. I could not get it to work at all so I sent it back same day. 
22011 Does as advertized. Very sturdy and the length is perfect--though it is adjustable. This is my default, go to GoPro accessory. I have had it soaked in water and flailed around by friends yet no damage to the fabric at all. 
22012 It all went fine 
22013 Excelent for X-E2! forget the lensmate equivalent. 
22014 Perfect background for photos! Great quality. 
22015 Does all I want it to do and more!!!!! Very pleased with this purchase, THANKS AMAZON!!!! 
22016 The door of Fuji film s5000.3.1mp battery not working 
22017 It s thick black aluminum, and it s great! 
22018 Great lens. I use it with a D3100 at the moment. The wide aperture is great, I recommend a protective filter though because it would be very easy to scratch. 
22019 Vinyl is thick enough, but the product is not affixed the the cardboard core. Would also, be nice if the core was a larger size. Fair value product. 
22020 Usage very good can charge canon batterys as well 
22021 😀 
22022 Excellent 
22023 Great case, built really well. Fits my gopro hero4 perfectly. I would definitely buy more of their products. 
22024 I love my GoPro, Great quality, and great price for an awesome camera to last for a very long time! I use mine primarily for motorcycle rides. 
22025 Love it 
22026 this flash is great. 
22027 It protects very well, but you must observe their instructions for installattion re: eliminating all dust....I have a couple of small dust particles underneath that can t be removed... 
22028 A+ recommended to everyone. 
22029 never loss it in the ocean! 
22030 Excellent product. Received as promised schedule. 
22031 Great camera! A few accessories are unnecessary and probably will never be used, but overall I m very happy with the camera! 
22032 Works great! 
22033 Works as expected 
22034 Battery last long, remain full capacity after almost a year of using 
22035 Works great. At first had some issues with tilting to the left, but I contacted the manufacturer and following their detailed instructions was able to fix the tilt and stabilize correctly. Beware you need Windows PC to do that. It does not work with Apple. 
22036 This is ideal to keep from loosing a lens cover. I have been very pleased with it. 
22037 One of the screws that holds the umbrellas is bad, the screw will not move. 
22038 Excellent photo capture in the water, under the water or in the dry. Love it. 
22039 I feel this flash shoe umbrella holder is among the best. All metal construction, it solidly and securely holds my flash equipment. This is a well made product. 
22040 Would easily have given 5 stars if they had one additional feature, zoom. Otherwise an excellent value for the money paid. I purchased the factory reconditioned units, (same warranty as new), and am most pleased with their operation. 
22041 I bought others which don t hold a charge but these do. Higher priced but worth it. 
22042 The softbox very heavy for the the bracket, and the bracket start to bend in some area.!!! abd I could not tilt the softbox because of the weakness of the bracket and the totally wrong design. 
22043 Fits perfectly - excellent condition. 
22044 Just what I have been looking for. I have family photos that span the early 1900 s up to today. 
22045 I LOVE IT. works really well. blue nobs works well. awesome rig. could improve the barn doors for foldability. 
22046 This is the 3rd camera like this I have bought. I keep dropping them! It takes great pics and it s very close to professional for an auto digital. 
22047 Eyepiece would not screw into camera platform. I had to glue it? Not. Good!!!!!! 
22048 These are great. I ve used this brand for several years..all batteries and chargers are working like new 
22049 Works great for my CCTV cameras. 
22050 Great Product ! fit perfectly on my Olympus E-PL6 that mount on any Nikon Ais lenses , no regret purchase it 
22051 Tripod works great! Remote works great! Great deal! 
22052 Protects very well at a cost of making the camera bulkier. Excellent quality 
22053 Very nice, sharp. 
22054 Had an issue with the original hardware and was shipped one out to replace it immediately. Thank You! 
22055 This item is sturdy, strong and definitely worth the price. 
22056 Really nice! Quick shipping also 
22057 Worst tripod I ve ever used. Outside of it being very wobbly, the legs never extended properly. Just cheaply made in my opinion. 
22058 works great 
22059 Really like this speed light 
22060 I really like this camera case! So glad that I bought it! Fits my camera perfectly as described. 
22061 Love this case. Everone compliments it too. Looks very classy in white! I would highly recommend it. 
22062 Good 
22063 Other than the no on/off button or switch, it s great and easy to use. I ve never used a timer before, and I am a new DSLR owner, but I was able to figure it out with a quick glance at the manual (a REAL quick glance lol). 
22064 Fits good. 
22065 Can someone remind me why I bought this. Unless you have used it do not buy it(I would recommend Polarize filter). 
22066 Great film deal. Gift for my granddaughter. 
22067 I don t recommend this product. I think a gel filled strap or a single air cushion feels better than these mini air cushions. I m going to return this product. 
22068 They worked for me. 
22069 Great Product!!! Received promo code for a review!!! 
22070 Good for the price. ... easy to install 
22071 camera perfect 
22072 Performs as advertised. Very Satisfied. 
22073 My daughter loves it. She can share her pictures instantly with her friends. 
22074 works good. but made out of hard plastic. gopro floats 
22075 Nice price 
22076 as good as oem and cheap 
22077 Not good product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. 
22078 Good lens hood. It makes a difference for my Camera 
22079 Great product 
22080 Broke within first use 
22081 Hi,i received your product.It s perfect and very convenience,thank you./. 
22082 This crap doesn t work! It s a scam! 
22083 Good used 
22084 Compact and fits the Cannon Powershot well. 
22085 Ok 
22086 Fantastic camera. I used it with the Olympus underwater housing and got really good pictures while diving. I also used it as a handy point and shoot while travelling around if I didn t want to pull out my SLR. Nice sharp clear pictures. 
22087 Perfect! 
22088 if went out 
22089 The color is not the best 
22090 Amazing flash for starters and pros. Couldnt be happier with this flash. Well built and amazing features. I wud go with the panasonic enloop battieries black battieries i have confirmed they are the best for this flash. 
22091 Great for my cine lens 
22092 Had it now for quite a while. I also have a bunch of Profoto gear and although its not as good quality wise it is great for the money. 
22093 Good item.Fits well. 
22094 Wish that I had been aware of the vector effect. More than likely, will seldom use 
22095 Worst microscope I ve ever bought. 
22096 If you own a D750, this is a must own. The batteries will last for multiple photo sessions or a long day of wedding shooting. The plus side is also that it helps balance the camera with larger lenses (ie 28-70 2.8). 
22097 This lens is now my new favorite lens. Very sharp and a great price! 
22098 great product. 
22099 Great price for a well built filter. 
22100 The sticky gizmo to adhere to the lens cap didn t stick for very long. 
22101 Love it! 
22102 THEY WORK PERFECT 
22103 There was a minor cosmetic issue with the case. I contacted the seller and they handled it in the best possible way. Thanks! 
22104 Great quality camera! Gives me a piece of mind when I m not at home. Highly recommended! 
22105 Works perfectly with my Hero 4 Silver. A must have GoPro accessory. I scratched the lens on accident and CamKix replaced the whole kit at no cost. 
22106 These batteries are working well. They appear to rival the stock batteries in runtime. The charger can be powered by AC or in a car cigarette lighter, which makes it super convenient. 
22107 Great! 
22108 It s what I needed. 
22109 Perfect case for traveling because of its compact size and brief case like handle. Organizing slots make it ideal to store accessories and extra batteries. 
22110 This is a good quality case, but it s too small to hold all my GoPro accessories. Glad I didn t order the small! 
22111 Many options with this kit! Love it all. 
22112 It doesn t fit the lens even though they had my camera listed. Be wary. 
22113 Great for multiple size lenses and even storing other gadgets and cords. 
22114 Perfect Tripod Ballhead! 
22115 I bought the go pro brand because it was designed specifically for the go pro. Im not a fan of the aftermarket stuff that will melt inside your camera and ruin it. 
22116 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
22117 Was as good as described 
22118 for every 10 shots, you may got 2-3 that don t develope well. doubt it s the lighting as i ve taken it in the same location. 
22119 This was a gift 
22120 Fast shipping, works great, made well! 
22121 Excellent 
22122 make sure you just get good lighting, or it might be fuzzy 
22123 Works! 
22124 Exactly what I want 
22125 Lasted about a year and died in a barely used safe. Prior factory battery lasted 4 years. Find another brand, this stuff is garbage. 
22126 Love love love this set! Tons of fun, and felt like I got my money s worth. 
22127 Excellent case - and very affordable. Best deal I have located for my camera. 
22128 Thank you very much! 
22129 Great buy 
22130 The clamp is as good as the GoPro one. However, the gooseneck is too long and wobbles more than the GoPro one. 
22131 This was my first security camera system purchase after extensive research. This is a great product that works right out of the box. The remote viewing devices connected via internet works perfectly after looking at the video instructions. I m am very impress with the clarity of the night vision. 
22132 Very sturdy and well built. Great buy. The only downside is that it has plastic knobs to crew the flash in. So far so good though. 
22133 Very nice no problem god for price 
22134 completely discontent control does not work ... not to do ... the product without control is completely useless 
22135 One of the packs did not even work. 
22136 Purchased 4 of these, no problems, adds additional indication of security 
22137 Exactly what I needed. Fit perfectly and clicked down. Lives on my camera now. 
22138 Good products 
22139 Works for my panasonic luminx zs21. Snug fit and not the easiest to use controls on camera, but functional and keeps my camera dry. No black ring around lens for this camera. Fits well. 
22140 This doesn t fit with the standard go pro mounts and other accessories. Almost ruined my case attaching it 
22141 Excellent value. Exactly what I wanted. 
22142 Doesn t fit 
22143 Great product. Holds all of my lenses. Fits in my camera bag with ease! 
22144 This is an awesome product specifically for transporting camera equipment. It is well padded with several compartments for lenses etc. 
22145 Worked will with some binoculars that were purchased. Great for a strap replacement. 
22146 Really nice product with amazing customer service, definitely recommend 
22147 Very sturdy. Perfect. 
22148 Junk; only used three times and then it stopped working. Lost receipt so couldn t do anything about it. :(( 
22149 1 battery for the DJI Phanton 2-3 is NEVER enough. You will want to buy a few of these. The are wonderful quality. 
22150 Works great. Thanks. MauistyleAloha.com, Sk8Maui.com TexasStyleSkateboarding.com 
22151 Excellent packaging. Arrived on time. No issues. Product is exactly what I was hoping for. 
22152 Super-Duper. But very spotty so I suggest you use a diffuser like the Micnova Gel Softbox with it, and you can change the color temp with the softbox too with the included gels. Battery lasts a very long time. 
22153 Fast shipping. Product as described 
22154 Quick charging times and also very compact. 
22155 Best camera for the price, pictures are clear and the camera is very easy to use. I do a lot of nature shots with moving animals and have had very good results. 
22156 Fantastic little lens for m4/3. I ve been using it for street photography as well as recording choreography and it s performed flawlessly for me so far. 
22157 good products! 
22158 Easy to set up and takes great quality videos. 
22159 The product is exactly what I was anticipating. 
22160 Best investment I ve made so far aside from my lenses and camera. 
22161 Waterproof case broke after one use. 
22162 It works well, but these Arlo accessories are a bit over priced in my opinion. 
22163 Does the trick and a doesn t break the bank. 
22164 Bought two additional camera s and they work exceptionally well. They are easy to install, great pictures on the unit. Very pleased and if you starting our on home surveillance, this a good starter product. 
22165 books are not lifesize, looks more like it belongs in a childrens playroom. not suitable for theater or adults. 
22166 Honestly, I love this camera so much. Easy to travel with .Burst photo mode, Wi-Fi capabilities is awesome! 
22167 Worked perfectly for the beach and keeping water out off my camera but I was too worried to submerge it under water to really test it. 
22168 Did not work 
22169 I own the plastic waterproof bag for a while, and I just found out there is a float strap that really makes my phone stay. I got one from UP Program as a free review sample. I have tried it, and it works. 
22170 Love this lens on all the different zoom levels. 
22171 Very nice size and easy to adjust the legs for great shots. 
22172 A little more user friendlier than the Sony - Sonys moreso for filmmakers. 
22173 Works perfectly and came a lot sooner than I expected. 
22174 Very good just a wee bit heavy 
22175 Protects my camera so well along with being very fancy. 
22176 I had to research this camera from other websites to get it figured out. the software is cryptic... trial and error Needs a 48 volt supply with a POE injector... Live and learn Still trying to figure out how to change the ip addresses... The manual is totally USELESS. 
22177 The Battery is exactly what I needed. It looked a little different, but it works great. 
22178 The camera and accessories have been great, as I worked for a small, weekly newspaper. I didn t need anything too sophisticated. Overall,it s nothing fancy and the bag s zipper gave out within the first month, but the equipment alone is worth the price. 
22179 Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You ll be so glad you did:-) Very small unit but it packs a punch. 
22180 nice and it came all in boxes fresh new thing smell nice! recomends 
22181 Awesome Mount, it works perfectly. The build quality is Very good and it will definitely hold up to some wipeouts. 
22182 it works as stated except the Zoom for my Apple iPhone. I download the BT shutter App too but not working. Anyway i am not going to return it, as it is functioning good and also good part is charging last for many days. 
22183 Excellent combination of GoPro supplies. All mounts and screws came in as advertised. My only complaint is the extension pole is very loose and wobbly. I wouldn t feel comfortable jumping off anything with it. 
22184 good quality 
22185 Did not work at all. Cheap plastic not what I expected at all. 
22186 Great camera, and nice size, fits in my purse and takes clear pics. 
22187 These are awesome, they get really hot though, so I wonder if that hurts reliability... 
22188 I m pretty happy with this! Still getting used to focusing! When I look through the lense it s looks clear as I adjust my focus, but then when I look at pictures noticed blurry was (human error) really like it for the money! 
22189 They fitted perfectly to my video camera and are charging fine! Thank you! 
22190 Excellent 
22191 Fit perfectly, Fast shipping!!! Thanks 
22192 Arrived promptly, easy to set up. Just what I needed. 
22193 Objects were hazy and lacked sharp contrast. I compared with Orion Oiii. 
22194 Just right, excellent product. 
22195 OK 
22196 Love this lens. Very versatile and razor sharp. 
22197 works as advertised. 
22198 Even though used, it works well and I like it. Very pleased with supplier. 
22199 I would definitely buy this kit again. Great starter kit for people getting into photography. Only complaint is the tripod is pretty flimsy when fully extended. 
22200 Excellent product price-quality 
22201 Exactly as ordered. Enjoying immensely. Very happy with purchase. Few friends already looking at the same products for purchase. 
22202 these energizer batteries are just what I needed for my camera 
22203 fits great. 
22204 Wish I could actually use the auto focus 
22205 Fell in love with the strap as as soon as I took it out of the box. Build quality is comparable to non. This makes it so easy for me to carry my camera for long durations. Would recommend it to all.... 
22206 Love this 
22207 Does not fit a Sony RX100 but even if it did, I don t think I trust the velcro enough to keep my camera dry. 
22208 Nice pack. 
22209 Great portable device! 
22210 Great bag for a Sony a6000! Holds a camera body with a lens and at least 2-3 more lenses plus batteries, cards, etc. Great for travel! 
22211 All was perfect, 
22212 Exactly what I needed!! 
22213 The drone was as expected, easy to fly, hoping that DJI will be able to send updates that will allow us to program routes 
22214 Excelente 
22215 Looks so cute and love it already thanks 
22216 The lock knob on this head gets stuck to the point where I had to use pliers to get my camera off. Not great. 
22217 Easy install. I hope I won t need! 
22218 works great 
22219 Its an amazing product evryone should have one 
22220 Camera is not what I was looking for 
22221 Everything ok 
22222 Most of this is junk, but the filters and cleaner were usful. 
22223 Works great. However it does not support a 64GB card like the newer camera. Somewhat annoying. 
22224 Too expensive! Bought this and a 4 pack of the generic 52mm cap. Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for the same price as this single cap. 
22225 Wished it was a bit more durable. Didn t see much difference between the shield and the plastic shield the camera came with. 
22226 Quality, yes. Overpriced, YES!!! 
22227 Works, but the straps are difficult to adjust properly. I m a fairly wide chested person, so even at it s max adjustment it is slightly uncomfortable. The camera itself sits at an angle and requires something underneath to align it if you want it level with the horizon. 
22228 exactly what i was shopping for. 
22229 Camera picture was blurry at best. Would not focus or zoom. Install search software provided totally locked up my router. Sent it back for replacement. 
22230 Excelente 
22231 Great Value! 
22232 very good, and very reasonably priced. 
22233 Solid mount, does the job as described. 
22234 Very good product, I really do not like the alarm noise it makes when you arm and disarm, there should be a softer sound at this point. 
22235 Just as described 
22236 Just &#34;installed&#34; them on my lenses...seem to fit and perform as advertised. Lets just see how they hold up. 
22237 Kenneth was extremely helpful in getting my camera set up to use the cloud service. Excellent customer service from the technical support line. 
22238 Taking to Argentina in November. This could be the perfect camera/all purpose bag. 
22239 Fine as expected 
22240 Not great quality 
22241 These are knockoffs and total junk. Avoid this seller. 
22242 It is good but every 3 min i rather keep steady videos without stop when i want to turn off 
22243 Great and good material 
22244 I m only using it for 35mm slides right now but so far so good. My only complaint is that it would be nice to choose a higher resolution. 
22245 This was awesome!!! I have the Handycam, but needed more battery time. This product allows me to charge alternative batteries, while using the batter attached to the Camera at the same time. Good idea, great purchase! 
22246 I needed something to store my sd and micro sd cards in and so i saw this and decided to try it out. I m glad that I did because this was exactly what I needed. I would definitely recommend to anyone 
22247 Good idea but the threads don t hold it steady for some reason. I should have sent it back when I had the chance.... 
22248 Great deal for all these. Now I have backup accessories and they work great! 
22249 Wi-Fi connexion between the camera and my cellphone or tablet is unstable. Not a reliable product, 
22250 5 star 
22251 Very good items. 
22252 Very nice Lens 
22253 Save lots of money buying this instead of Nikon brand and works just fine 
22254 Easy to use, loved the flip down lense cover on the bottom. I wish the eye covers did the same. 
22255 Easy to set up and does its job without a problem. 
22256 Great price. Arrived on time. Durable. 
22257 Fantastic bag! Great quality and delivered quickly! This bag is very roomy with more than enough room for my camera, lenses, batteries and charger! It is just what I needed and the shipping was quick and painless. Highly recommended seller! Don t hesitate if you like this bag! 
22258 Don t doubt on purchase this great camera!! It will surprise you! Excellente quality video, and the seller very effective 
22259 These are invaluable if you are using any stand outdoors. I placed my sand in plastic baggies prior to adding it to these bags and I have had absolutely no issues. 
22260 This is a needed item that is not included with D750 camera. 
22261 The Nikon ML-L3 Wireless remote control is small and very handy, and it works well with my Nikon D7000 as long as you point it straight at the indicator light on the camera. Great for self-portrait taking. No wires to deal with. 
22262 Like it very much takes great quality pic & video light weight and very user friendly 
22263 I m just a novice photographer, but this is exactly what I was looking for, and at the right price! 
22264 Every thing fits in real good 
22265 The filter is fine for protecting the lens but I see some ghosting and more flares when taking photos with the filter on. I believe when it comes to filters, it s a wise investment to get the higher quality glass to ensure you get the best photos possible. 
22266 Works great. As expected. No issues 
22267 I should have read the reviews before I even purchase I would have never gotten it in the first place for adapters like this I ll stick with the vivitar that I have on my 52mm 
22268 Perfect for all locations 
22269 excellent product. fast shipping. good company. will buy again. lisa 
22270 Great camera for the money. We have purchased several for use at our church. Quick shipping and no problems with any of them. 
22271 Work great! 
22272 Good day I received the camera case is very nice and meet my expectation thanks. 
22273 It really suck it doesn t work 
22274 Worked perfectly for my Nikon d3200 
22275 Amazing camera and arrived so fast! 
22276 Worked great for me 
22277 items delivered on time---everything was intact---nice little package items were exactly as shown/described 
22278 Good Deal! 
22279 Never held a charge from day 1. Guess its too late to return this paper-weight now, but trust me - this TRULY is GARBAGE - avoid - do NOT buy. IF the company reads this, YES I d like a REFUND. 
22280 Good 
22281 Very pleased... 
22282 A good product. 
22283 great product i like that it has the rubber not many others do 
22284 Not the best quality but not the worst. I ve had no issues so far with producing great background images in my videos. 
22285 Takes great pics 
22286 Very nice product. Worked like a charm on my Fuji xt1 and my Nikon d750. 
22287 Very nice 
22288 Good quality products at a fair price. It was shipped fast and I found all the products met or exceeded my expectations. I was able to mount my Action Cam to the handle bar of my Harley in just a few minutes. It works great! 
22289 Pelican cases are uniformly excellently made. They are extremely durable, and the latches simply work well. Enough said. 
22290 You won t regret buying. Great quality, perfect fit. 
22291 wonderful camera case even if small 
22292 Great Product 
22293 Doesn t work.. tried a few times. Better to buy the battery from somewhere else. 
22294 seems perfect as expected 
22295 Takes great pictures! We had fun with this in and out of the water on a recent Florida vacation. It is s little tough to see the screen in bright sunlight. 
22296 ok, so it s cool to have a video of 360.... But the image quality is seriously lacking..... Hopefully the next version is better because this one just sits in my drawer. 
22297 Just what I needed to keep my batteries charged. Great Product. 
22298 Works great 
22299 Great 
22300 The cameras worked out great at our wedding. They come with a note asking guests to take pictures. I loved it because I didn t have to create, print, and fold anything myself. 
22301 The best, light way and durable 
22302 good item 
22303 fits great to Leupold VX-3 1.5-5x20mm (30mm) - but honestly, could be less expensive 
22304 I love these glasses they r perfect I use the to drive and on my mini Segway 
22305 Love it! Works great with my selfie stick and my phone. The magnet also works like a charm. 
22306 Great little gadget for my son s GoPro at a very affordable price. 
22307 I m using this to fly FPV on my quadcopter. Had to modify the plug to fit my needs but it works great! 
22308 Perfect fit and perfect outcome! 
22309 Works perfectly I have had it installed and working since purchase and am considered purchasing another. 
22310 Very nice. As described. Quick delivery. 
22311 Great product. It will definitely float your camera. 
22312 Love the night vision recordings.its clear 
22313 This camera takes excellent images in almost all conditions! Even though I am experienced with manual SLR cameras, I just leave this one in automatic mode and the results are generally excellent, even for detailer product closeups. 
22314 At manual (M) setting the screen is smaller. I returned the camera. 
22315 Just what I ordered. The same as my other canisters. 
22316 Gave me a great range of new lenses to use. I started with the 25mm which came with my telescope, and was wishing i had more options. Glad i bought this kit. 
22317 This was a quick buy for my daughter and the product is easy to use. 
22318 Pretty nice but on closer inspection seems to be made out of cheap materials. I ll probably end up replacing this later but for the value it seems like it would be good for a beginner. 
22319 Works perfect and is a must when your traveling!! 
22320 Love the HFR on this camera as well as all the other features. Adobe already supports the RAW format as well which was a pleasant surprise. A powerful camera in many ways no doubt. 
22321 After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised. You can t go wrong. Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are. 
22322 a-ok 
22323 Love it. Much easier to align our 8&#34; Celestron SCT and more accurate than a red-dot finder. 
22324 Works as expected. No more splicing wires. 
22325 Parts were missing in the order. all I received were the batteries, no charger. I sent it back. 
22326 the camera is great....comes with NO manual! The case they sent does not hold the camera.....just the accessories. 
22327 Well made and very secure. 
22328 Excellent product. Gives me the ability to get very wide angle shots in home interiors. Great quality, certified OE lens from Canon 
22329 Works and fast shipping! 
22330 The clip fell off the first day I got it. Reattached it for a couple weeks then once it failed for good I was out of the return window. 
22331 Great camera 
22332 I am writing this Review regarding the excellent service I received from Dlink Support My Tech Referenced Service # AR004214 was able to help me correct my problem very efficiently and with excellent customer service I will purchase more products from DLink. 
22333 Great product, as described; something happenes with the delivery company, nothing that bad. Will buy again. 
22334 So cool, I take it with me everywhere 
22335 Filled my need nicely. Fast shipping. Reasonable cost! Works good! 
22336 Great product and buyer shipped quickly! Excellent experience! 
22337 I needed this. I have an older 17-35mm 2.8L It fits well, but does not come off too easily. I m fine with that... 
22338 My GOPRO been able to keep more secure. The storage space is also a very good product than many think. 
22339 Met expectations 
22340 work very well for the money 
22341 Great deal, seems like a great product so far. Haven t had a chance to extensively user it yet, but so far it s great! 
22342 Great product. Fits perfect in my hiking pack and very light weight. 
22343 We use these to capiture images of products coming down an assembly line using remote shutter switches. Does an awesome job. 
22344 sharp image. 
22345 All but ruined my camera lens filter - use with caution! I gave 2 stars because it does work well on my computer screen and iPhone. I haven t tried on the television - admittedly I am a bit hesitant to try on the 65&#34; screen. 
22346 This camera is really easy to use. It also take good quality pictures. Perfect for blogging or if you re just a novice photographer. 
22347 Perfect companion for my 3TB external drive. 
22348 One of the best lens filter I have ever used. Hoya is the best. Same with my Canon 24-70 lens too! :) 
22349 must have for go pros 
22350 Works exactly as expected. Simply set your camera to remote shutter setting and that s it. The only thing is that the sensor on my camera (canon T3i) is right in front of the camera. So I can only trigger the shutter when directly in front. 
22351 Nice product, great price and very fast shipping..!! A+ 
22352 Go back in the warehouse make another one Cause them thing no good I bought one about a two week ago When they sent it to me it don t even work. (A-szcxtop(tm) New Mini SPY Hd... A-szcxtop(TM) 
22353 Guardian advanced camera system is really good 
22354 amazing 
22355 Amazing piece of glass. Straight out of the box to a shoot. Impressive delivery time too. 
22356 No horizontal panning. View is a cone area below the device. Limited view. 
22357 Good product. Very reasonable price. I always look at this line when purchasing this type of equipment. Frank DiFalco 
22358 Came exactly as described and looks exactly as pictured. Works great. 
22359 Battery works great. I was told by other Nikon owners that some replacement batteries would not be recognized by the camera. This is not one of them. 
22360 It was a great deal. 
22361 Great 
22362 Strong and inexpensive 
22363 im happy to find that i could get batteries at such a great price. 
22364 Was dissapointed the illustration and text all lead you to belive it is an OEM Sony battery. So I ordered it only to find it is an aftermarket battery. Hope it performs adequately, Need to more transparent that this is not a Sony brand battery, but a non-Sony replacement. 
22365 It good. It was a little too big for my needs so I sewed the ends to make it a smaller diameter. If you need to do that, it s easy to do with these. Heck, you could probably make your own from some old drink koozies. 
22366 Broke 2nd week I used it. It was worthless. 
22367 Love the little pics my daughter takes with this camera. Great buy! 
22368 was good 
22369 It was stiff and would not telescope the way it was suppose to, so I ended up putting it back in the bag and return it. So unhappy, junk do not buy it ever. So mad, hate the product. $119 down the drain. 
22370 For the price very well worth it for my nikon d3000. It didn t hold a long charge for my event like my original battery; but I brought both batteries with me and it lasted all day. Very satisfied! 
22371 Items were as expected and were in excellent condition. Very happy! 
22372 Great product, durable plastic. The screw hole configuration worked with my Lorex LRD2152 Dome Cameras. I think all Lorex dome cameras all have the same whole pattern so they will most likely work with this. 
22373 The product was apparently defective upon arrival. It would never boot from day one although it was getting power. The item was returned for a refund. 
22374 I love it 
22375 great great great.. from the 1st shot I took I knew I loved this lens 
22376 First Post! A buddy of mine bought this Nikon Coolpix P600 and he swears by it so i purchased one. Shoots great. 
22377 Great item at a great price 
22378 Works effectively - as advertized. Battery life is significantly shortened by forcing it to wake up ever 4 to 5 minutes. But this is the only way to poll for current data on a regular basis. Consider a full-power USB connection for frequent polling. Otherwise a good product. 
22379 Excellent. Seems to work perfectly and is exactly as described. I am happy to be able to use my camera again after jamming the original lens. Thanks! 
22380 I had to call for technical support. Kenneth was able to solve my problem almost immediately. I rate both the service and product FOSCAM model FI8918W as five star. [[ASIN:B0046710G6 Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle)]] 
22381 Nice cameras 
22382 Great product- Thanks 
22383 Love these binoculars...very bright and easy to locate objects while being of a nice size and weight. 
22384 Love it 
22385 Very good 
22386 the ultimate beginner addon to the camera 
22387 Arrived on time. A sturdy product. 
22388 Works pretty well for the price. The side button has started to become less sensitive over a few months use. 
22389 Good 
22390 Awesome camera. Love the quality of the zoom. It s my 5th Panasonic and I m very impressed with this product. 
22391 Takes a little bit to install properly, but looks very nice and functions fine. 
22392 great item! 
22393 We order these every three months. Great quality and a must have for all of our electronics and glasses. 
22394 Got these for my father in law before a big motorcycle trip out west. They were simple enough for him to use as he is not very good with electronics. The videos and sound were clear. Great purchase! 
22395 works, but a little tricky to figure out 
22396 Expired film do not purchase 
22397 Unusable because it would just float off our wrists. 
22398 Great product. Love the new experience. 
22399 Solved a problem for me GREAT 
22400 Did not fit properly. Not worth dealing with for the price. 
22401 Holds 4 filters and protects them well 
22402 its a great lens sharp good color but for my hand it was to hard toget on and off. would like to have kept it .if I had an extra body I would have made it a real point and shoot. 
22403 Good as expected 
22404 Great camera 
22405 good! 
22406 Do not expect any tech support from this company (FunLux) so purchase at your own risk. 
22407 It looks good, but I have not used it yet. 
22408 Rating: 5 of 5 Product is as described. Works good. Very pleased. 
22409 My niece was so excited to receive this 
22410 love it 
22411 Fit like original. Very Satisfiled. 
22412 The batteries work perfectly with my Nikon camera and the battery charger has been a life saver on trips to charge my batteries on the go. 
22413 Works great! 
22414 Great product 
22415 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
22416 Works as expected and reasonably priced 
22417 It focuses very quickly on my sister s 60D and allows you to get quite close to the subject if necessary. 
22418 It is exactly what I needed at a great price! 
22419 I really like the storage pouches, I wish they came in different configuration options for the 1690 case. 
22420 Fit perfectly and now I don t have to keep losing my lens covers! 
22421 Cut out is perfect. After I put it on and peeled off the &#34;second&#34; layer it was crystal clear and you can t even tell there s a protector on. 
22422 Awesome camera 
22423 Although support and firmware upgrades had to be cautiously followed, customer service with Terry Morgan was great help. Now I can use the camera, view via smart device, and login outside of the home anywhere. 
22424 Cameras started messing up after 6 months. 
22425 Just exactly like the OEM battery. I love how this has three slots to charge. Nothing else to say about this great product! 
22426 The pics and videos are in bad quality, it end up in the trash. save your money and do not pay it 
22427 Excellent product 
22428 Love this filter. It really makes difference in skies and landscape colors. Worth every penny spent!! 
22429 I have had only one opportunity to try out this lens so far. It performed much better than I had hoped it would. It is pretty compact and not very heavy. I look forward to having this lens with me in the future. 
22430 Don t last long short life! 
22431 So many attachments I will never use them all great deal 
22432 This fits my D5100 with Sigma 18-250mm with lens hood which is exactly what I wanted. The only down side is that you can t fit much else in the case, but that s the trade-off for a case this size. 
22433 I can t wait to use them. They will be useful when I can t my cheetah stands. 
22434 Best investment i have made for my business 
22435 They attach. They float the cameras. Not much else to ask of them. 
22436 Excellent 
22437 Very good quality... No instructions manual 
22438 very easy to set up !!!! quality of the camera is a 10 !!!!! 
22439 Great product! I ve used this floaty handle a bunch while swimming and kayaking. I really feel better about not losing my go pro. 
22440 Works great makes flying more enjoyable. 
22441 Yes it works great and it was easy to install 
22442 Excellent lens 
22443 Decent quality camera. Love the feature of ability to move the camera from my iPhone. Great night shot. Sometimes the auto mode does not work and the day and night mode have to be changed manually. Good value for indoor security monitoring. 
22444 The case is large enough for the camera and some accessories 
22445 Yes, it s overpriced but it s small, rugged and very adjustable. I don t mind paying a little more for obvious quality. 
22446 Very good camera 
22447 fits great! makes my d3000 much more comfortable to hold. 
22448 Picture is sharp with good definition. It gives a good screen resolution.Excellent camera for the price. 
22449 I ordered the 50mm and recieved the 52mm, thought it was my mistake until I checked the order. Found out it has happened to others as well. This is not just frustrating it s unprofessional. 
22450 Perfect for occasional use! 
22451 Great battery pack. I use them on my hero 3. I haven t done any testing as to the length of charge time, but they do just as well as my regular gopro battery. 
22452 This is a great product with many useful features! I love it! 
22453 The quality of this tripod is on point. So hard to believe I paid so little for it. 
22454 was really expecting a stand/legs and a light bulb holder as pictured in the product photograph. I did not receive this. sick. 
22455 Nice camera 
22456 excellent 
22457 Works great for what we need it for. 
22458 Purchased these stands a few times. I have been very happy with them. Sturdy and high quality. 
22459 I m still working on learning how to use the camera, but love the photos so far! 
22460 Doesn t work for viewing on a Mac. Also had issues getting this to view under the newest version of Chrome on Windows. Tech support was fantastic but decided to return and purchase one that works with a Mac. 
22461 There is no mirror surface on this mirror - I removed the protective coating and it hardly reflected my face -- a waste 
22462 Yup great 
22463 Awesome!!!! 
22464 This case was very cute, but it was only &#34;okay&#34; when it came to protection. The plastic casing cracked and allowed my phone to constantly fall out, there for it only got used for a couple of weeks. 
22465 Great item price and fast shipping 
22466 Love them 
22467 Great accessories kit for the Go-Pro. My husband absolutely loves it all. 
22468 Excellent product. Bought as a replacement and re-charges battery 3-4 times quicker. 
22469 A must have for time lapse shooting and astrophotography... 
22470 Love it. Superb pictures. 
22471 When putting mk 4 in, a bit of the back snapped off, extremely unhappy. Applied almost no force when putting in and completely snapped. Also the lack of battery access is infuriating. 
22472 Not the best battery life. For someone who does a lot of filming, I need something a little stronger. 
22473 So so it s k would buy again 
22474 great 
22475 As described 
22476 Excellent tech support 
22477 So far, so good. 
22478 worked fine. 
22479 Works well for small cameras 
22480 Great Camera!!!! 
22481 Love the system Works great i instslled it myself I do wish i had an instruction manual I still dont undestand the dvr completely 
22482 Highly Recommended! 
22483 At first it seemed to work well, but it would lose connection randomly causing the camera to power down and causing me to lose my shot many times. Maybe mine was just a lemon, but I returned it and I m getting the Sony version instead. 
22484 On time, and super cute! I m in love! 
22485 Really enjoying this bag. Fits so much of my equipment 
22486 It s a bit difficult to figure out how to use at the beginning but once you figure it out it works perfectly! My Yongnou YN-560 IV and this pair up perfectly! 
22487 I use this all the time. Works very well. 
22488 Works very well. I have only used it for home movies so far. It works better than the mic on my Canon T4i. 
22489 These worked sooo much better than the straps that came w the waterproof cameras! ! 
22490 Only thing mildly confusing is that the LEDs and battery slots aren t oriented in any way you can remember which is which. 
22491 does print pics but some come out with streaks 
22492 Does the job. Love it so far. 
22493 Only one of the 4 cables worked 
22494 i bought camera at flea market with no charger. not knowing it even worked. gave 6 bucks 4 camera. bought kastar battery and charger kit and the camera works like a new one. right on kastar!!!!! 
22495 Great item 
22496 Excellent product! I was imagining something more simple and not so good, turns out that is an amazing camera with all benefits is a semi professional one! Love it! 
22497 Very cool! 
22498 Camera works great, but iPhone software is garbage. Alerts never work properly and their monthly/yearly service plans are wayyyy too expensive, considering what they re providing. This device has become almost useless to me. 
22499 In my opinion, it is just more crap to waste your money on, not to mention all the wasted time and work it takes to install it. 
22500 Love this product! So affordable but great quality. Great service. 
22501 Love it! 
22502 Its really pretty and a great strap, I just wasn t enthused by the rubbery grip on the back side of it. 
22503 This flash is astounding! It zooms the flash when you zoom your lens and has a built in diffuser as well. I highly recommend this product to photographers any photographer that s on a budget or just getting started. 
22504 Convenience and compact 
22505 Works great made money with it ready!!! 
22506 Flimsy 
22507 hot mikes and paranoid. Plus, my work has Skype/Lync and some people have been known to turn on their computer camera and sometimes they are not were they should be or wearing the appropriate attire. LOL! Ooopppsss - 
22508 The battery is not new, exactly like the rest of the reviews say. Don t buy this product. It does not hold a charge for more than half an hour. 
22509 Fit fine. Did the job! 
22510 Very good Camera. 
22511 Great kit and seller 
22512 Great product. 
22513 Actually a very high quality camera, however, the hardware used to attach the camera to equipment is not sturdy at all. I had the camera mounted on my wind surfboard and it came off and I lost it in the ocean. 
22514 I have just begun using it. The back screen scratches very easily and I have not found the wire to download pictures into the computer from the camera. It does not seem to come with the camera. 
22515 Good, however a close lens is much better. 
22516 These are great, but I ll never need them since I never crash! Also all my code compiles first try. 
22517 The mouse never worked ( I had to use an old mouse of mine) The remote works SOMETIMES. Also some remote buttons do NOT work at all So I guess I give it a 7 out of 10 
22518 Great 
22519 Great value. 
22520 Very well designed and built. Definitely improves handling of the camera. 
22521 They last longer than my original Canon lithium battery. 
22522 Excelente 
22523 This works perfectly. 
22524 Excelent product, economizer of energy, sensor of motion! 
22525 Too small..go with a large size one..can t put all your accessories in it 
22526 Wrong battery. Connecting pins were male instead of female. Completely useless to me. Description was incomplete. I gambled and lost. 
22527 excellent product, very good quality, as expected. very responsible seller 
22528 Great Product great price 
22529 Love this handycam. I got the bundle which is definitely benefical with all it contains. Tripod looks flipsy. Having had need to use it. 
22530 works great thanks 
22531 Wonderful, easy solution at an affordable price! I thought my camera was broken! Now it charges up and works perfectly again! 
22532 jiust love it 
22533 Got everything 
22534 Bought this for my orange loving son s first camera. He s dropped it twice (that I know of) and the camera is still perfect. Nice little case! 
22535 The color is nice and uniform. The paper is a decent weight and is reasonably durable. The packaging was very good. The photo qualities of the paper are very good and perform well with flash. 
22536 Great for traveling. Fits in a pocket and has good quality images. 
22537 Great deal 
22538 Works very well, and is so simple to use. You can use it with cable or with remote. 
22539 It holds up the roll of paper I bought it to hold up. I ll be moving it to a new location temporarily next week. 
22540 This camera & bundle is awesome for the price. This camera does not allow a wireless remote, so the bundle didn t include the remote, even though it was listed in the description. 
22541 Great camera 
22542 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
22543 Product arrived on schedule. Worked perfectly 
22544 Excellent 
22545 Added fun for my daughter and her friends!!! 
22546 Does the job in a pinch and is highly portable. I have used it with point and shoot cameras as well as a DSLR. Just make sure you distribute the weight properly when using a heavier camera. Basic physics! 
22547 Just got a set and tested them out. Seems to work fine. 
22548 This was perfect for a grad party photo booth! 
22549 Good product. Does what it should. 
22550 broke within 2 months junk 
22551 Well great at the beginning. I think i will be buying new. The lens is not working as well. I have to get it sent in for repair. The images are blury past the 100mm range bummer 
22552 Battery was not lasting on our camera and felt time to replace the battery. Well what better was than to get 2 batteries and charger. Can t beat the price. Everythign works great! 
22553 As expected! 
22554 If you are tried of not being able to see the image your trying to photograph, then this is the one for you. Heads-up, the image in the viewfinder will appear a little out of focus but, doesn t effect the shot. 
22555 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
22556 i love it!! great fit..i will give 5 stars 
22557 Fine 
22558 Hard to focus and hold steady. 
22559 This is an awesome tripod. Itbis really easy to set up and use. I am going to get a lot of use from it. 
22560 gooddd 
22561 This is a cheap tripod. The head adapter screw broke almost immediately. The panning and tilting of the head is jaggy. Unless you are setting this tripod to a single position for photography, it is pretty useless. 
22562 A little tricky to fold/coil up, but decent. 
22563 Nice carry bag. Use it all the time. Sometimes switch it with the Sony camera holster but for most travels love this bag. 
22564 good product, arrived on time as promised. 
22565 For what this is and what it cost this is the best lens you can buy for the money. It added more fun to photography. 
22566 Better than expected. Perfect gift for the girlfriend. 
22567 The pictures are clear and accurate per the subject being filmed! Only wish the pictures were larger, but I ll still order more. Really like having an &#34;instant&#34; photo in seconds! 
22568 Works great in my Panasonic FZ150. Have used the same one in the FZ150 for a year now and have no issues. It sees the charge level, etc. 
22569 A little flimsy and no markings on the filters, but creates fantastic photos! 
22570 Grate 
22571 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
22572 This is the simplest thing. It straps on very easily. It s easy to put on and take off. It s one of those million dollar ideas, and it comes at a great prices. 
22573 Some of the accessories I didn t need. And the gorilla tripod cracked almost instantly. Other than that, I felt it was a great deal. 
22574 Works just as advertised. Got it quickly and it works great! 
22575 The batteries don t last quite as long as the factory original, but the price sure is right. 
22576 bien 
22577 Live this lens!!! It s perfect for the everyday lens to sporting events. The package was secure and the shopping was fast. I definitely digest this lens. 
22578 As I needed for my project 
22579 Great 
22580 This is my 2nd Syma X5C. This is one tough drone! It has crashed several times and keeps going strong. 
22581 love it 
22582 Awesome quad, have had several weeks and no crashes or flyaways. Really nice product for the cost. Someone forgot to put manual in box before shipping but found everything on line. 
22583 Great on time 
22584 the camera mount is a bit stiff and hard to aim. 
22585 Love it ! Bought it from here at a perfect price I was a little doubtful but it s definitely worth it. Love it perfect for my hands and love the flip screen 
22586 Exactly what I needed to use the ! Most Excellent ! camera as a video tool. Probably got one with the original purchase, but did not know what it was for. 
22587 These are awesome, I love the different designs!! 
22588 I have always wanted a gopro and not that I have one I love it! A great buy! 
22589 I got into collecting old cameras to shoot film in and part of the fun for me is doing some restoration. I have used this lens sucker for picking up tiny lenses out of assemblies and works as it is supposed to. Very handy tool to have. 
22590 Located a Sony digital camera in a flea market. Did not wish to keep camera plugged in all the time to charge the battery. Works great! 
22591 My camera constantly stay off line. I file a complaint to the company and they did sent a replacement cord for free, but I still having problems. I paid too much for this camera for it not to work properly. I brought this camera to watch my property. 
22592 Easy to install compared to other IP cameras I have owned, comes much better software. Very wide angle lens, picture is sharp with excellent color. Excellent night vision. Would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend. 
22593 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
22594 Love the quick release function. High quality 
22595 Important when you need more juice 
22596 Good price and an absolute must have on your camera. 
22597 The film arrived on time. Great price! I am really enjoying my Instax Printer! My family & friends get a kick out of these tiny pictures, also. 
22598 It s a very neat design. A little better instruction would have been nice. But I like the double use of the tripod and converting it to monopod so easily ! 
22599 Item is NOT white as listed in description, the cable is NOT RG59 as listed in the description. It is Siamese and 25 foot as described. 
22600 Setup and use is SUPER simple! Love it! You will too! Anybody can enjoy this camera and you can set it to go on when you leave the house 
22601 Great product and shipped fast. 
22602 Works good 
22603 I always loved this camera. I got another one to replace one that had broken. Despite its small pixel size, it takes great pictures. 
22604 Love it! Perfect tripod for me and my point and shoot camera. 
22605 Not good. The camera appeared to be repacked and it did not perform correctly. The POE feature did not work and had to returned it. 
22606 Really great camera for the price. Fast shipping. 
22607 Excellent unit optically and mechanically, not what you would expect at the price point. Highly recommended! 
22608 Good lens. 
22609 Exactly what I paid for. Love it 
22610 Excellent I love it 
22611 works great 
22612 ok 
22613 Works great. Allows for better sound. Not for use in foul weather or where waterproof case is required. 
22614 Excelent. Like the original battery for my Alpha 77 II !!!! 
22615 took great shots ove them 
22616 I love my selfie stick, I use it all the time,wherever.Same exact quality as the name brand at half the price.Highly and affordable.Very satisfied! 
22617 Great quality and build! I have used it a lot and it feels OEM! Fit and finish are top notch. For the money its a great buy! 
22618 Great Product 
22619 This tripod is very small and lightweight, however, also very flimsy. I tried to fix it in position but it barely holds. The weight of my compact camera makes it shift and slowly collapse, certainly not what I expected. this is not a quality product. 
22620 Fit camera perfect and just like new. Super 
22621 A great price on a great case. Fits a 1911 well. Very strong plastic, just like the whole Pelican line. 
22622 Was great when it worked.... only ever sat in my bag and the light inside blew out after only using it 7 times (if that). Owning it for alittle over a month, Dealer said &#34;nothing he can do...&#34; Buy a 400x scope from someone else... 
22623 :) 
22624 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
22625 I could never peal off the film just broke 
22626 Great props, they are an original DJI product. Exactly the same as the ones that come originally with the phantom 3. Each pair arrived in a black fabric bag same as the one that comes with the phantom. 
22627 Perfect! 
22628 Work perfectly Thanks! 
22629 Good addition to the 800TVL camera installation. 
22630 Not only does it protect my gopro and accessories, but it keeps them organised and ready to go. Its great not only for traveling, but also is a great storage solution in general. 
22631 Great results. Well designed. But the instructions are poor. For example, the black coil that is seen in the view of the receiver. I assume it is the antenna, but no information is included. Can I lift it vertically and extend it? Duh. 
22632 Perfect quality product! 
22633 Great Deal. 
22634 It s okay but not the best.... 
22635 Excellent product 
22636 Nice upgrade to my system 
22637 I m really liking these AmazonBasics items. Very cheap and quality-made. I will continue to buy from Amazon. 
22638 One of the greatest digital camera Sony has to offer. It has good specs and the image quality is good too. 
22639 Great case. Perfect fit. Like the pocket that I can use for a spare battery. 
22640 This is the cord I couldn t find so I got another. It s working great. Love it. 
22641 Great product, great service. Works perfectly. 
22642 The UV lens sometimes shows circle crystals in the picture when its too sunny 
22643 a 
22644 Worked for a couple of months. Then stopped wortking. Company would not honor worrenty 
22645 This camera is very easy to operate and works extremely well. I would recommend it. 
22646 A great piece of gear if you shoot in bright light. Use this on my Nikkor 70-300mm VR zoom lens on the beach and at sporting events and it really eliminates that &#34;washed out&#34; look. 
22647 LOVE this cute little camera & I ve owned several Canons, but they keep adding features & I love the wide-angle on this one!!! 
22648 Good battery that last three times as long as the factory battery, defiantly worth the buy!!! 
22649 Thank you 
22650 Good value. The case does not have a pocket for the extra battery and memory cards. 
22651 Exactly what I have been needing, highly portable, has own case. I love using this product. 
22652 It s not rock solid, and there is a few degrees of play in the head with the large Canon 100-400L lens attached, but it works and for the price it s very much better than the alternatives. Light and compact when folded. 
22653 Not as easy to focus as I thought it would be 
22654 So far this is my favorite lens for the micro four thirds system. 
22655 Excellent!,,Thank you 
22656 This unit if the fundamental starter for anyone who likes video &#34;on the go&#34;. It works well, takes clear images and sound. I haven t tested it underwater yet, but the tightly sealed case seems well built and solid; likely to work fine in wet/underwater conditions. 
22657 good and is very good in travel 
22658 good 
22659 Just right 
22660 Tough as a tank, plenty of space for my gear. 
22661 great 
22662 A wonderful piece of equipment. Still learning how to use it; much to learn. 
22663 very good price 
22664 Love the car adapter as many times we forget to charge the battery before we leave for something. Works perfectly with our cannon battery. No problems with it and it was a good price. 
22665 Excelente 
22666 A++++++++Highly Recommend 
22667 Holds the camera firmly in place 
22668 Very good product 
22669 Very nice to use 
22670 Great Camera! 
22671 Cool thing! 
22672 Works really fine on my Canon 6D love it!!! 
22673 no complaints just wish it had an external mic jack 
22674 Good 
22675 I had a ND filter stuck on my 18-55 for months and this got it off in 5 seconds. Takes a little patience to align properly but it will take the filter right off. 
22676 As expected.. but not real detail on how to use. One of the items came broken. 
22677 Great 
22678 Works great and fits the Canon Camera. 
22679 This product is not worth the time. It came blurry a waste of money and I can t retrieve back because it came from out of the country. Please please please please don t waste your money. Sign Disappointed.!!!!! 
22680 Has lights to indicate power or surge(helpful during installation) 
22681 LEDs started burning up shortly after first use on my Nikon digital camera 
22682 Awesome assortment of tec stuff for the one who is starting! 
22683 Great pics,great packet value 
22684 Good 
22685 ok 
22686 thank you ever so much! 
22687 You can only stream video to your phone if you re on the same wifi. 
22688 NO SOUND ,NO BUY 
22689 Well worth the small investment to protect a large investment in camera and lens equipment. I hope I never need it but it s there when I really do. 
22690 looks great and takes great pictures 
22691 I actually took the foam insert out and use it to store fragile items (eg. Micro 4/3 lens) and it s really great for that. 
22692 Loved the attachments hated the ion air pro. Returned the action cam and kept the kit to use with another action cam. I hope I m making sense, but yeah. Good, really good. 
22693 Charger works good. Only issue I have is that it hardly holds the battery in place which can be a problem if you re charging in the car/on the go. 
22694 Fits like a glove. 
22695 It fits all my stuff. And it I don t carry my laptop then I put other papers in it. The memory card holder is secure. It s comfortable to wear. 
22696 Crashed each time I tried to install my SD cards. Uses a lot of broadband. Requires Flash in browsers. The picture was pretty good, but I couldn t deal with the other problems. Returning. 
22697 Excellent 
22698 Great price for legit equipment. It s amazing how much more you get in a shot with a 10mm versus 18mm. I m loving this lens and all of the extra goodies for not much extra are worth the small investment. 
22699 But this Light meter, Great for perfect flash! 
22700 It is a very profesional look article that helps a lot, for the price, I don t regret it at all, 
22701 Not user friendly, but I love a challenge. All the parts work fine. Hopefully I won t lose them. 
22702 Love this bag! Fits my Manfrotto with pistol grip no problem! Thanks! 
22703 Item arrived without mounting hardware or instructions. 
22704 Love this! So fun! 
22705 It works great with my ADT Safewatch Pro 3000. However setting the thing up with it was an absolute bear. Not the fault of the device. A fault with a ridiculously complex system for pairing it with the ADT equipment. 
22706 Way too much $$$ for this s***. 
22707 they work great!! very easy to work and set up!! Thanks Dan!! 
22708 A nice case but had to return because I returned the camera. 
22709 Love this camera and the telephoto lens. The lighter weight makes it perfect. I had a Canon years ago so the learning curve has been pretty easy. 
22710 This item allows me not only to see pictures on a bigger screen but also make me look like i spent a lot of cash to make my dslr different. 
22711 It was perfect just what I had expected. 
22712 Sony 28-2 is bright and clear for general purpose photography. But the images it produce, is nothing magical like the Leica Q with Summilux 28-1.7. Even at A7R2 s 42 megapixel, the images aren t as detailed as the Leica Q. 
22713 excelente producto recomendado 
22714 Had to place it on a stationary camera, it moves to much when trying to adjust the dim switch. 
22715 The issue is, that some of the screws that come with the prop guard don t fit. They aren t long enough and I can t get them to tighten the guard. So, I left the guard off the Phantom, which is not what I wanted. 
22716 excellent buy 
22717 Pictures did not develope well. Waste of money 
22718 good for what it is 
22719 bought it for my husband; he loves it; he s a bit taller than 6 feet so he prefer a very tall tripod and this is one I found on Amazon and very good price 
22720 Horrible! This is a gray market market (which means it s not from the U.S.) Nikon refuses to fix these camera if anything happens to them. I am very disappointed. 
22721 Good product.... 
22722 Love my GoPro. Made some great YouTube videos at beach and water park. 
22723 ok 
22724 Works and good price 
22725 Bought this for my Nikon 1 J4. It fits everything and then some! My camera, extra lens, battery charger, cables, extra memory cards all fit and I still have more space for other things. 
22726 Henry was very helpful in setting up my camera. I would recommend the Foscam cameras ! 
22727 This product was awful. Directions in English were poorly translated. Had to watch a you tube video and it looks like the guy could only make it work after he took it apart and jerry-rigged it. I threw mine away. 
22728 Cheap for all the pictures I got:) came in fast love them!!:) 
22729 Good carrying case that fits my Olympus SH-2 well. The extra pocket is useful for the tripod shoe, but not much else. Smaller items like spare SD cards or batteries would likely fall out. 
22730 Well-designed product. Fit perfectly and excellent quality 
22731 Horrible item. Broke within 2 weeks of occasional light use. Lost the $70 digital camera I just purchased in the river because this did not hold up at all. Very disappointing! Do not buy. 
22732 Worked well. 
22733 Good item and good price for it. 
22734 A good cheap wireless remote for the DSLRs. I used it for Canon 7D m2 and works very well. 
22735 The selfie stick works great. I even used it in the pool. The straps are great and I never have to worry about losing the camera. 
22736 Horrible. It worked 2 times. I went to use it again today, and it quit working. What a waste of money!!! 
22737 Junk---didn t work very long... 
22738 Great kit and great service :) 
22739 Great tripod! Thanks. 
22740 Yes, this is a great arm to attach my digital recorder to my video tripod, nice and solid. 
22741 This will not work for swann security system like advertised. I bought eight of these and they are junk. 4 didn t work at all. And 4 worked for a couple minutes. So I have 8 cords that I can t use. Do not buy. 
22742 A must for this camera !!! to make it truly bomb prof, not the prettiest thing but does the job. 
22743 Works great, no problems what so ever. Exactly like the battery that came with my camera. 
22744 Works absolutely amazing I have no complaints 
22745 Works very goodl. Delivers one time. 
22746 loved the different colors. so cute 
22747 very pleased! Good price on a great item! 
22748 I use the GoPole almost every time I use my GoPro. It is definitely a great accessory to have if you enjoy traveling and doing action sports. 
22749 Meets my expectations. A perfect size for days when. Don t need all my equipment. 
22750 Good to take along an extra eyecup when traveling since the Olympus eye cup tends to come off and disappear easily. 
22751 Nicely padded. Keeps my lenses safe! 
22752 The Lens was fairly OK but the out of body was more used than indicated. (faded) 
22753 It s a great camera, but the instructions are very básic 
22754 a 
22755 it to cool 
22756 Great camera and great value with the bundle. 
22757 Henry was very professional and gave great tech support. Thank you Henry !!!! 
22758 Works great on my canon 70d. So much better than a neck strap. No issues so far. Does not block the flip out screen. 
22759 Awesome Camera .... We love it. We own 2 other Sony Alpha that we use in our family photography business. The results are superb even with the kit lens. But with the ability to use FE and adapted lenses, you can get some mind blowing results from this camera. 
22760 found it to be too small to be very useful I bought and exclusively use the backpack from amazon: [[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black]] 
22761 Very happy with this purchase, interesting design 
22762 Worked perfectly! 
22763 Literally fits like a GLOVE, very nice! 
22764 No comments 
22765 works as advertized and cheap 
22766 Literally no complaints. better than I expected! 
22767 dont work 
22768 This worked out great for my cannon. It s wasn t the exact charger I got for my cannon but it does the job. 
22769 Great lens for the money! Takes sharp pics over entire focal length. 
22770 Excellent for carrying my phantom 3 proffesional 
22771 Works great compact size fits on my backpack perfect 
22772 I love my vivitar battery and charger kit for my Sony NEX 5R camera. It works great and I received the items promptly. 
22773 The package arrived in time for my granddaughter s birthday. It was her birthday gift. She loved it.She took photos of her birthday party with it and everyone enjoyed the camera. 
22774 I Love It! Great Camera! 
22775 For the price, it is a very interesting lens. Personally, I don t have a lot of use for it, but it does have a very nice open aperture. 
22776 Very nice, the price was well worth it, in fact if bought separately I would have paid more than triple the price. Everything was nicely packed and I feel it was one of my best purchases I made for myself in awhile. 
22777 It s just what I wanted, pictures are sharp, it s easy to operate and its lightweight! 
22778 Excellent quality recommended seller 
22779 they work great 
22780 Worked on my Eviant 7&#34; TV - very happy. 
22781 it will do but it comes all folded up and looks completely fake. I will see how it photographs but doesn t look real at all. Very digital. 
22782 Love it 
22783 excellent! 
22784 Keeps the full batteries coming I love this tool. 
22785 Amazing item, delivered earlier than expected. The clap and goose neck are ver sturdy and made with good material, worth the buy to any one who wants to get great static vids with their gopro. 
22786 Definitely great for the price and gets the job done. Straps look pretty durable and I am sure with time and being out in the sun they will eventually break, but for the price I d replace them again in a heartbeat.Tested on variable length and prime lenses. 
22787 This is a very nice and comfortable wrist strap for those who do not like to use their neck straps! 
22788 May not be the most expensive glass out there, but this I ve never been disappointed in any HOYA product. True, I m not a professional, but I take care of my stuff ant HOYA works for me! 
22789 FAST DELIVERY&#62;&#62; wow! 
22790 Installed in minutes to replace an old sony system in my Monaco RV. Works good. 
22791 It does exactly what it needs to do. after hours of searching for cameras I found this one. it was very easy to install and the picture is very clear. If your making a decision, MUST BUY THESE CAMERAS. 
22792 resolution is not adjustable. remote didnot work OTB. 
22793 Works great. 
22794 ok 
22795 After several trys I finally found what I wanted. 
22796 Camera bag is very small. Everything else is about what you d expect for the price. 
22797 Love this camera but rather intimidated by all it can do. Not a beginner s camera! Will have to buy a book D3200 dummies book to be able to use it. 
22798 Exactly the same as the one I lost but easier to obtain and cheaper. 
22799 works good 
22800 Good camera. Clear picture. 
22801 Great value. 
22802 Great buy on good film! 
22803 LensPen always delivers! This one is much smaller than the previous model. Although I don t really like new curved design (I am a straight lines guy), but it does the job perfectly, as always! 
22804 Works great. 
22805 Works a treat. 
22806 Excellent, sturdy base. This thing is a rock. All the machining is beautifully precise. The head is very nice for still photography but too stiff for video. I mounted an inexpensive fluid head on the base and I m very happy. 
22807 Have taken some pretty awesome photos with this film it never fails me! 
22808 Works Great. 
22809 Kind of delicate. 
22810 I only needed one of these in my GoPro camera cases on my dive trip for 16 dives. I am careful with my cameras and this was extra insurance. I had no fogging at all. I inserted them just below the camera after i placed the camera in the case. 
22811 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
22812 not real eos bag,smelling too much and too small to hold dslr 
22813 Great price 
22814 Amazing quality 
22815 Item as described 
22816 Love this camera. I m still trying to figure out the basics of photography. Once I get those down pat, I m going to really love it! 
22817 I ran a mud run with this and it stayed very secure. I think the top strap helps keep the camera from flopping around as much but I wasn t able to tighten it as much as I would have liked. Great product for the price though. 
22818 works great; timely and well padded shipping; would buy again 
22819 it exceeded my expectations. Great light, easy to use and very economical. Already suggested it to few artists friends of mine. 
22820 Lightweight and thus does not hold to the windshield very well. I love the picture and clarity=-colors are terrific. 
22821 Quality is what you d expect from this price point and size, and is acceptable. But the battery lasted for only two short uses before it wouldn t hold a charge. 
22822 High quality and will buy again. This was able to fit all my DSLR and GoPro items in one place. Now I just need to grab the pack and go. 
22823 I love it I use in my strobe lite and my speedlite. 
22824 LOOKS LIKE THE REAL CAMERAS , GOOD VALUE 
22825 A+++++ fast shipping product as described. 
22826 wooks 
22827 Very pleased with this! Would have given 5 stars if it came with instructions on unfolding and refolding tent. 
22828 Not bad for that money. 
22829 The are really high quality accessories for your camera. I have purchased several and am quite happy with them. 
22830 Worked great on our family vacation to Hawaii. My husband recorded our entire trip from start to finish with his fancy usie stick and Go Pro. We ended up with a really cool video of our trip. Great little pole mount. 
22831 I ve lost several microfiber cloths in the past so this 6-pack is great for having extras when needed. I like that they come individually wrapped and it cleans my glasses perfectly. I m very happy with it. 
22832 Great camera case! Lots of storage spaces. 
22833 perfect student camera! 
22834 Very nice gear. Part of the collection of accessories to have if you are a photographer. Loved the price, weight and features, hard to beat for the money. 
22835 No good n o good takes to long 
22836 small footprint and strong love this thing 
22837 Not too big. Everything in one place with easy access. 
22838 I favor Tiffen s quality. 
22839 It s very nice, works really well 
22840 Great product, super cute designs 
22841 You get what you pay for, cheap quality, feels like 
22842 I like it a lot -- great zoom, and easy to work. 
22843 Shipping rather slow, but i am extremely happy with purchase. 
22844 Great product. 
22845 Did its job! 
22846 Me and my husband bought this as our birthday gift to our 11yr old daughter, Our daughter is very happy. This bundle includes everything that you need to make memorable pictures. Worth the price. Awesome product. 
22847 Great 
22848 Recommend!!!!!!!! 
22849 Item as described and arrived quickly. 
22850 The oversize version of the eyecup works exceptionally well with eyeglass wearers. Shuts out distracting light, esp. on sunny days. 
22851 This is the 1st tripod I ve ever bought. I am very happy with it - easy to carry around easy to get the camera on easy to change the height. 
22852 High quality. 
22853 Lost the original cord to my Sony and this came super fast and was exactly what I needed! 
22854 I just bought this bag for my DSLR and initially it looks great, feels comfortable, is light weight etc. The only thing that is missing is the bottom pocket for a monopod and an integrated rain cover. That s why I m giving it 4 stars. 
22855 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
22856 Such great quality picture on this thing. Love it!!! 
22857 Kenneth, my customer service technician was terrific. He got my up and running in 5 minutes and the camera is working great now. 
22858 Like it hope it lasts as long as my last one did 
22859 Zippers are really cheap and 1 out of 2 broke. Still worth using with 1 zipper. 
22860 Not compatible with Genie garage door motor. 
22861 Very satisfied 
22862 Works as it should. 
22863 nice 
22864 Not usable due to its a new product and not recognized by softwear...since only support is in JAPAN it is impossible to get help. Do not buy!! 
22865 This camera is perfect for our young photographer 
22866 It is what it is. Used it for GoPro 4 black and my Shoei RF-1200. Works. 
22867 The camera is a good fit for our need and I like the recording quality of the footage. 
22868 enjoy the way it develops picture 
22869 It is a good product, and not expensive. 
22870 I ordered just the bar mount and it is huge. I don t even know what bar it would go around. It is definitely not what is pictured. 
22871 Excellent range; easy to install and the inside alarm is loud enough to hear over dogs, children and TV! 
22872 My son gets so much use out of it. Makes me wonder how I got by as a kid with the crappy technology we had. 
22873 work great got to me fast! 
22874 Works great and doesn t cost nearly what the Canon branded product did. 
22875 As shown! Met my expectations. An all-around good buy! 
22876 These work great. Have had fun playing with the macro. 
22877 Daughter enjoying this gift! 
22878 My camera case was exactly as described in the ads; arrived on time; makes shopping a lot easier with this kind of service 
22879 Works okay.
