[BEGIN] Has short depth of field.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far it works well. My only complaint is that the cord is shorter than the original.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a gift. She liked it  [END]
[BEGIN] display went broken, purchase was quickly reimbursed, so I bought Nikon 610P  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well enough, but it s a huge rip-off that this item doesn t include the velcro strap that holds it to your speedlite. It includes sticky velcro bits, but these would be stuck to your speedlite permanently and wouldn t allow for other, similar attachments (like a diffuser box).  [END]
[BEGIN] it s okay  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well. Doesn t last as long as the Nikon batteries, but far cheaper.  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesnâ€™t hold a charge as well as the Panasonic battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometimes the camera will just fall off. So now we double check the tightness of the connection often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t hesitate to call customer service for help setting this up if you are having trouble. I fried one and called customer service and learned all kinds of goodies not mention in the instructions.  [END]
[BEGIN] could be made more user friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] it s fine  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is not for high shutter speed. its working fine only till 250/second S.speed. But SLRs usually have S.speed range of 4000 - 6000 per second. Thus this flash dismissed  [END]
[BEGIN] This was really hard to figure out on which buttons to push. The instructions said the light would be one color and it was different on the pen. Not very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still playing with it. some time is works and other times it does not. Once I know more I will make a more informed comment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to focus for pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] The case is a little small. I bought it for a Nikon S3000, which is a very small camera, but the case is a verrry tight fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is nice, but the battery really doesn t hold a charge for more than a day or so.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t let adding network cameras, unless they are directly connected to NVR. Doesn t let you conveniently display just two feeds where the display is positioned vertically (1x2 grid).  [END]
[BEGIN] Initial shipments got lost... otherwise the replacement or second shipment arrived as Espected. Thank you..  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent lenses to start off with, definetely had a lot of dust. The zoom ring is rather sticky. The focus ring is amazing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap. Plastic  [END]
[BEGIN] haven t tried it yet, its on the bike but haven t put my cam on it and went for a ride yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good clock for telling time, but not for spying.  [END]
[BEGIN] Filter has a factory blemish in the glass. Just a small speck but who wants another speck in the picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for the price. However it came with no instrustions  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a little small no extra doom in the bag  [END]
[BEGIN] Great zoom, average quality, good for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Note: this does NOT work with the DMC-TS6 camera. DMW-BCF10PP --&#62; this battery DMW-BCF13PP --&#62; what the TS5 and TS6 need (I can t erase my review, so I figured this is the least I can do to make it useful!)  [END]
[BEGIN] Works OK, great power, but it overheats too quickly  [END]
[BEGIN] first one arrived broken, unable to shoot pictures, sent it back and quickly received another one. Works fine so far! My daughter loves it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had issues trying to update firmware. Also found it not staying completely leveled when transitioning from option 2 to option 1. Had to re-calibrate often by turning on and off.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this light .. however where is the diffuser cloth that it said it came with????  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok camera for the money. Had problems with the battery door. If you drop the camera you blow up the door hinge.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to replace it after one month.  [END]
[BEGIN] I believe this is the same mic from Teelec for $17. It s ok but poor isolation means it picks up everything. If you don t need stereo the Tackstar is cheaper, has better isolation, sounds better, and uses aa batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Plastic is a bit cheap, but it works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] It Works......  [END]
[BEGIN] This Newtonian reflector telescope itself was quite good, unfortunately the geared adjustment assembly mounted below the scope never did quite right; making it very frustrating. Once the reflector is in position however, this reflector provides outstanding images of our earths moon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Minimal use so far but seems to work as needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was supposed to be a product that when you put it on there d be no air bubbles. Not so. I tried several times. Air pockets formed every time. At least the LCD is protected.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok for the price,not a great camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Info says the battery meter will recognize this pack, but it doesn t. It s fine for a spare.  [END]
[BEGIN] That s ok  [END]
[BEGIN] The video quality is acceptable  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good so far, but very expensive compared to others  [END]
[BEGIN] The button doesn t click easy and there for it takes a long time to take a picture. Then it is hard to not have a blurry picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok for very short distance  [END]
[BEGIN] As advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Faulty dial for the shutter button, just within a couple weeks of ordering this new camera the dial just fell off.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Be careful - reviews of this plug said &#34;Loved it for my QFlash&#34; = well, I didn t look closely enough, and it only has two prongs, my Quantum T5D needs three.  [END]
[BEGIN] Affordable mount for gopro camera BUT the screw does not keepmyour camera in th angle you want  [END]
[BEGIN] it is ok Does not activate far enough away and does not stay on long enough Ten feet to activate motion  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped working after a few times in the pool. It was fun whenever it worked, though!  [END]
[BEGIN] ive had the phantom 3 pro for 4 weeks and the camera gimble is broke they don t have replacement parts and wont return after 30 days .. don t waste your money  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the camera, however, the carrying case could fit tha smaller pieces of accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lack of bottom opening access to battery and SD card is an issue. Nicely made and fits well. Binds a bit where case and strap come together.  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for....  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought it to put it in my Mav 88, It s ok..  [END]
[BEGIN] These work well but they don t look very appealing. I was able to take pictures and video with ease. However, it doesn t record for long.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s neat but I wish it didn t save only to .MOV files.  [END]
[BEGIN] So so...  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens cap is functional and works just fine but the hood lens doesn t quite fit properly. It has fallen off already.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its alright,as first camera. I needed it for YouTube videos. But audio not so great. I have to talk loud for recording. Video quality is great though.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does what it is designed to do. It s not very portable as you have to disassemble it every time. Once you figure out how to do it it s ok. You could easily put your eye out if one of the rods slip out of your hand.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera worked fine...until I updated to Windows 10 then it didn t work. Disappointing  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Lesson learned; look at the length of the stick. This one is a little short which I was a little disappointed. Yet Ive learned to play with it and captured a good shot.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite frankly, I m a little disappointed in the picture quality of this camera based on the price I paid for the camera. Plus the video has to be transferred into a different format before it can be edited.  [END]
[BEGIN] No instructions. Camera must be in manual mode with you making all the adjustment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works okay. Could be better  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to work fine, but instructions are not clear for setting up features. Box and sales brochures said the camera did NOT not include an SD disk so I purchased a separate one; but there was one in the unit when I received it. Other than that, seems okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Oki  [END]
[BEGIN] need more room. side pockets are small.  [END]
[BEGIN] It functions well enough but it is too short. When I use it I get a sore neck.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery life is short.  [END]
[BEGIN] the selfie stick is horrible. lots of the screws dont fit easily. The clamps dont fit easily. but you do get what you pay for. every thing works, i just had to brake it in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Consumes batteries too much  [END]
[BEGIN] The tripod would be great for a small camera. This doesn t hold my DSLR camera real well. The legs want to slide out from underneath the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s alright  [END]
[BEGIN] Smaller then expected but not to bad wish I got a bigger once... Not bad for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] The fit is a bit clunky compared to the original -- but it does work.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Targus version works better, but this one s OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok. A bit awkward.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product has lower quality material and workmanship  [END]
[BEGIN] I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s OK, I was hoping it was a little smaller but it works fine functionally.  [END]
[BEGIN] pictures aren t as clear as I thought they would be but could be my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheaply made....the light itself is great but the actual piece feels like a toy. And the piece that connects to camera or hand device is very very difficult to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice kit but it would have been better if it came with cleaning solvent also.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great but did not realize it can be harmful to the human eye. This should not be used as a baby cam, IR light has been reported to cause eye damage even with closed eyes.  [END]
[BEGIN] The color of the camera is nice but the overall build is a bit poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s okay for the price, though I ve found lighter battery mounts since buying this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] When these units work, they do the job fine. The fly in the ointment that I have found is they seem to be finicky about working properly on a regular basis.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t look as good as the real ones. Putting batteries and seeing the blinking red light is stupid. I have never seen a dome camera have a red blinking light? It should do the job though until I can afford real cameras.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything fits but as soon as you modify your P3 (gimbal guard, etc) you start to have problems ...  [END]
[BEGIN] video is excellent , but audio is really bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good idea. Easy to install, can control some camera functions from phone. App disconnects from camera often, wish I could set the receiving folder on my phone, would like to be able to delete photos on camera using app.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value - it is what I expected for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Works but has issues.  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger is just like the 1$ on china, does the job. The battery isn t lasting like Canon genuine after 1 year use.  [END]
[BEGIN] the one-step NFC does not work. playback for any recordings or pictures after having done any 4k recording often requires restart of unit due to choppy of freezing of playback  [END]
[BEGIN] The product was as I ordered the only thing that it didn t come with were pouches. I had to purchase the pouches seperately to accomidate the 19 filters. They come in 2 boxes and are individually wrapped. Other than that I am very pleased with the product.  [END]
[BEGIN] The adapter for the battery is delicate and i have t &#34;force&#34; a little the battery to make it take charge. It was very cheap and i guess it does its job but the quality of the materials of the adapter are not the best.  [END]
[BEGIN] This item didn t come with a glass protective screen. It would have been nice, if it did.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had hoped this was bigger. Not enough room for all the pieces. I will keep...but I will keep looking for a larger case, for everything to fit in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] wrong bad page book  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked well for a good few months,but then it just suddenly stopped working.  [END]
[BEGIN] no one said get yourself some infrared Night lamps to get it to work  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived fast, but not any louder then a normal mic  [END]
[BEGIN] Good, but there s no manual  [END]
[BEGIN] I want to give this 5 stars. The price wasn t bad, and well thought out. Unfortunately started ripping near one of the internal zippers shortly after I got it (one of the mesh pockets inside).  [END]
[BEGIN] Works ok, cheap plastic. I ordered two, I already broke one. Handle them with care.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad quality. Extending handle not long enough. Other regular handle already broke off after one season of weddings. A reasonable price but just falls short.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thinking being very well all together. Got a lot of photo-graphic objects, like film, battery and air cable release & lens cleaning tissue, Quotes Gregg a. Thompson  [END]
[BEGIN] UPDATE____ They worked great for about 8-9 months, maybe a little more. I am buying another set because I didn t have any problems until they suddenly stopped charging.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s strong, secure, and distributes the weight comfortably. However the cameras have to held when walking so they don t swing into people or things that you may pass close by.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small for the Nikon COOLPIX S9900 digital camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a good buy for the price but not as good at holding a charge as original manufacturers battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] works as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] OK, made it work  [END]
[BEGIN] Still trying to figure out the side scope alignment, not very sturdy on the tripod.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love my new camera. It is so easy to take great pictures now.  [END]
[BEGIN] it is good but you to up date the software  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice flash, but the unusual battery type makes it hard to use. They are expensive, and not available everywhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not great for i phones- only good for moon pics or maybe jupiter  [END]
[BEGIN] Dome scratches too easily and water does not bead off easily. At $300, should have come with the optional dome cover.  [END]
[BEGIN] it works ok. made from very cheap plastic  [END]
[BEGIN] too expansive !!!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a good camera. Takes good stills and can video record. But for the same money I like the Canon SL1 better. It s small and have auto focus in video where the T3i does not making it not very users friendly for videos.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed that a piece of plastic is missing off of it!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It s an ok strap, but it s gets really uncomfortable when used for more than 4 hours. Save your money and get the wider strap offered by BlackRapid.  [END]
[BEGIN] works as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens scratches very easy, be careful. Cool for pictures though.  [END]
[BEGIN] packed with information  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks pretty cheap but real looking enough. Loved the little keychain though!  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera shakes a lot even holding the straps tight to the helmet. I think the contour long shape makes is shake too much, I get a lot of shaking with the frame mount as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] good product  [END]
[BEGIN] Basically, this is a big &#34;meh.&#34; Yes, it diffuses light. Yes, it collapses, though awkwardly. But even after considerable experimentation, I was unable to duplicate the rather eye-popping results that Gary Fong demonstrates in his promotional videos.  [END]
[BEGIN] The release plate is pretty loose when locked in. That bothers me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well made, not cheap, but telephoto is not impressive with Blu phone. Macros work well though. The photos done with telephoto have poor clarity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still not pleased with the shots after upgrading to this model.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered this in error [simply forgot a previous order for another brand]. It is tiny and seemed cheaply made, but I never took it out of the package. Its appearance and the lack of heft of the package were decisive in my returning this one,  [END]
[BEGIN] 2 work good, but one has dim IR LEDS  [END]
[BEGIN] I haven t used this near as much as I d thought I would. I usually just plug the camera straight into a normal USB plug and swap the batteries through the camera. The spares are nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great little light for the price. It has a battery level indicator, dimmer knob and color temp selector and is quite bright even in daylight. The included battery and charger were a nice bonus and its quite slim which makes it easy to pack and carry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Legit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lens is great. Perfect for long shots. Filters are not great. They came scratched and one had a bubble defect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera, good quality video. My biggest complaint is that when you are reviewing what has been recorded you cant fast forward. That s very frustrating.  [END]
[BEGIN] When it works, it s what I expected, but this disconnects very frequently which is frustrating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent optics, great at its primary function but not enough thread to properly secure my hood lead to it being lost.  [END]
[BEGIN] very blocky when at max magnification.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty disappointing. I want a 15-in + frame to display professional quality photos and so far have found nothing that seems to please other discriminating viewers. Surely someone must make a quality frame. Cost is not a major factor but quality is top priority. Anyone have suggestions?  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what I need, but &#34;pole&#34; which comes in sections is pretty flimsy. I wouldn t last long outdoors. Luckily, we need it in the garage.  [END]
[BEGIN] as predicted.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just testing it out I found that the Wi-Fi did not work despite the phone or laptop and the battery life is poor. Still waiting to take it to the sea and see if it is really &#34;water proof&#34; to up to 90 feet.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has slipped off a couple times. But in fairness, I may not have put it entirely on. It doesn t fit over the lens filters I purchased.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works but would not work with Chrome. Contacted support and got no reply. I don t think I would by another one.  [END]
[BEGIN] works pretty good, not great a night...really bummed that it doesnt have extra ports for more cameras-4 doesnt even cover my exterior. you would think they would have extra ports so you could add on if necessary  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not notice there was no way to take the picture with the stick  [END]
[BEGIN] kind of flimsy.  [END]
[BEGIN] It couldve been better but for the price what do you really expect? I dont really use it as much as I hoped I would because of its quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] An OK lens but not for advanced photographers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product was as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Gift  [END]
[BEGIN] Not exatly what I needed, but will do.  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for in terms of battery life. One of these lasts about half as long as a single Cannon brand battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have a large tripod. The triangle slot that is used to set the tray on the tripod is too small, meaning the tray is too high off the ground, or I have to reduce the spread on the tripod.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good as backups. Do not last anywhere near as long as canon but still a good deal at this price.  [END]
[BEGIN] works ok sometimes the alarm goes off without any motion in its area have used the reset button several times  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit smaller than i imagend but works well,instruction manual not verry helpful  [END]
[BEGIN] I have seen better that cost less more and perform constantly better.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s kind of small for what I needed, but it s fine  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a good camera....However very difficult to setup through your mobile phone or see on a PC not connected to your wifi. You have to be an expert geek to do that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pros: Well made, Good price Cons: Wrong size (5.5 x 2.1 mm not 4.0 x 1.7)  [END]
[BEGIN] It worked as we have hoped- waterproof. You need to stay still a little longer when you take the picture..., the flash light takes a little longer than other cameras if you need it for picture taking.  [END]
[BEGIN] This Drone isn t even a beginner drone. This drone is the worst I ve ever bought. Don t get fooled. Peace  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal, the only issue I have is there s a glare when you use it so it s very hard to see the screen when it s applied ðŸ˜” Other than that good product!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not easy to use. I have only been able to see the moon and across the lake where I live. Stars and planets are too hard to find and the auto finder has not yet found one.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s okay. Not a great product  [END]
[BEGIN] It is OK for a quick camera  [END]
[BEGIN] The eyepieces are good quality. iTs a nice set. BUT THE CASE THAT YOU GET IS NOT THE ONE DISPLAYED. You get a black case instead of the brushed aluminum. AMAZON, PLEASE SHOW THE CORRECT CASE!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] The edges of the material started to fray after two months.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well, no problems with the mounting brackets or anything. Does get uncomfortable after a little while, but if you re wearing anything more than a t-shirt you do not feel it. Enjoy the flexibility in size.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty average camera, but it works  [END]
[BEGIN] They re nice but they re slightly bigger than the Instax Mini 8 films.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wish I would have gotten one that can take photos with a button at the stem  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality of leather was below my expectation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t quite work, stick withy thame original  [END]
[BEGIN] Drone worked great, but had a problem with the camera. Various lines and snow. Otherwise no problems.  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t have a motion sensor as it said so it is useless for what I needed it for. Otherwise it s fun to play with.  [END]
[BEGIN] not bad, good protection  [END]
[BEGIN] Good and solid quality but too big for my small EOS Rebel SL1. Not an appropriate size for people to carry, in my opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] They work very well but the seT up is confusing. I still am having trouble understanding the logging and replay of the history you need to be a very savvy tech person and a couple of hrs to set it up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to configure, two way audio not very good, motion detection not good excellent for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] It came with some defects.. the housing that is covering the transformer it took off and I had to use adhesive to attach it again..  [END]
[BEGIN] At times it does look a a bit cheap, but it has the style I was going for and has proven relaible  [END]
[BEGIN] it works  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera does not take very good pictures but it s not an expensive camera either. Pictures are grainy and the further away you are from the subject the more grainy they are.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok in a pinch if you didn t have lens cleaner and tissue, however, it still leaves some residual smudges. If I had both, my preference would be the cleaner and tissue.  [END]
[BEGIN] I feel cheated, I did not get all of what I should be able to, the lens is only one, should the two  [END]
[BEGIN] that plastic is so weak,keep tearing apart  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to return it because it doesn t fit my T5i with the standard lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] The filters are of good quality and easy to use. I only wish that I did n t have to buy all the different size adap. rings each time I buy more filters. I use 62 and 72mm only. The others are a waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] did not order this camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Pain in the ass.... The recording is complicating and the wires gets all over.. Going wireless next time  [END]
[BEGIN] can t seem to get it to work right  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this for my husband for christmas and he likes it. For the price, you would expect it to take a little bit better pictures but its ok. Only other con is that it goes through batteries very quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] For a basic green screen setup this is ok, I only gave it 3 stars because the price is WAY too high. Also, there is no way to hang it long ways.  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality of picture not that clear  [END]
[BEGIN] A bit too big for my day to day needs, but still a good set.  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Not in love with the color. Feel like it washes out the color in your image. They re fair. But not high quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent item, solved my problem  [END]
[BEGIN] It brings life to my camera but it needs some upgrades. It needs to mark the buttons better. I like it a lot. It s not easy to use the camera at first. It definetly protects the body.  [END]
[BEGIN] This one seems to have a very hard time staying connected to the wifi without being power cycled every day. The version below or before this one seems to need a power cycle once a month if that.  [END]
[BEGIN] only records 20 min and stops and starts again...not able torecord a full event  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is great but lenses are crap, cheap and don t work on auto focus. Buy body and lenses separately.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works quite OK as it s price.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does not support 960H  [END]
[BEGIN] Brilliant lens - wish it were cheaper. Will give 5 stars if it cost ~220$. I do repent buying the olympus camera - very expensive lenses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good video for small cam. Not mac friendly, had to download a converter. SOUND SUCKS, very low fidelity sound. Ya get whatcha pay for. It s worth something, not much though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not really very happy with this product. It s difficult to use and doesn t give a very good charge to the battery. I rarely leave a bad review about a product, but this one warrants it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have this on the Olympus 45mm f.18 and it doesn t really look good attached to the lens. It does do it s job of protecting my lens from debris and lens flare but I ll most likely end up replacing it with a higher qualit yone soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well enough, but it came with a hole on the edge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brushes are nice but the bulb is quite useless. Too dinky and as you squeeze the nozzle is moving in all directions. Get the biggest Bulb you can find.  [END]
[BEGIN] Decent  [END]
[BEGIN] It won t fit my camera, but I think it should be okay to use for other camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s not so accuracy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Floppy  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for lightweight cameras but not good for heavier models.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are ok antistatic bags but please note that 10x15 are the exterior dimensions, not interior dimensions (typically interior dimensions are used for other antistatic bags I ve gotten). The interior dimensions on these bags are 9x13cm  [END]
[BEGIN] I need a manual, it only records a minute at a time then skips a lot. and is there software to make play list, edit, add music? I hope someone can help me? I d like to give a better review .... I just think I never got the instructions.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was okay but I wasn t happy with some of functionality. So I returned it. I wanted something a little bit more high-end. However for the price it will do the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Packaging bent it where I don t know if crease will come out. BUMMER!!! otherwise this should be a great item!  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to apply  [END]
[BEGIN] The cord doesn t support I-TTL for my D7200 and any of my flashes however it triggers the flash just fine in manual mode. Will make a good back up for my radio triggers just in case.  [END]
[BEGIN] the app is killing the quality of this product. it slows down the video as i move it. Sometimes the cam will stop.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well it works, but ive noticed that most of the time its a bit blurry. Depends on what your looking at i guess.  [END]
[BEGIN] OK --but tight  [END]
[BEGIN] dont hold a charge for long.  [END]
[BEGIN] these are a nice addition I would tell a friend  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sturdy enough to move around, however it did the trick for the occasion... Good for the value and prime shipping was a bonus  [END]
[BEGIN] Needs much brighter lights.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked well for over a year, but recently we lost 2 ports on the DVR, followed by another 2 - cannot be used and do not offer a signal  [END]
[BEGIN] The focus does not seem to always be in focus once you zoom the lens. Otherwise small, compact and easy to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] not very stable... loose between clicks, but it does the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] fair case with cutouts for separate compartments. not very padded for protection on the bottom,otherwise nice storage case that fits all go pro and other small pov cameras!  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t live up to it s billing. I returned the lens in question  [END]
[BEGIN] All camera functions work, battery indicator always blinks as low battery; perhaps it needs just a little more power  [END]
[BEGIN] good backdrop lights are okay--- wish I would have got the LED- screwing 5 bulbs into 3 bases makes them NOT really portable--- GO LED  [END]
[BEGIN] Had I realized about the vector effect, would have purchased a round rubber flexible hood which is what I had before  [END]
[BEGIN] I had this one month, everything was great, then the tilt stop working, I hope they will make it good without me having to ship it back to China. Otherwise I would of rated it 5 stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] this bag was a really nice bag... lots of pockets.. just not big enough for what I needed  [END]
[BEGIN] CHEAP quality.. almost a toy. buy something better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Received it and found all these white marks on it. Looks like chalk  [END]
[BEGIN] These are okay. Only really get tood shots from exactly head on :/  [END]
[BEGIN] This thing works, easy to setup but not great. The sensor was too sensitive even at the lowest setting that the reflection of the beam on my car did not trip the sensor causing the gate to continue opening slamming into the side of my car.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t like typing  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a tripod - does everything I expected it to do  [END]
[BEGIN] Not really satisfied. I m not recommend this product to anyone. Usable, but not even good made, especially all bolts what you use to keep your go pro firmly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its good but it tend to turn off my screen on Nikon d5500 when I use it. There is a feature on my camera when something cover certain spot, I can t view my viewfinder at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not for heavy cameras. It will work perfect with light DSLR cameras and point and shoot cameras.  [END]
[BEGIN] really if you look closely it looks like false but if you install it on the roof or in a faraway place the camera seem real  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery does not communicate with Nikon charger so you don t know whether it is fully charged. Disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Film in pack didn t always result in good picture. Not sure if it was user error and we exposed film because first picture turned out great.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product met advertised specifications and was promptly shipped. However I would recommend spending additional money for brass rings to prevent sticking threads.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the bulbs was not working.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use but battery died on me pretty quickly although I hardly used it. Also never learned all its features, my God, why do they put so many features on it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just fits the front of the SB600 but don t stay on..must tape it to keep it from falling off  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool  [END]
[BEGIN] Needs handle bars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for home  [END]
[BEGIN] two details of this tripod that I do not like: the minimum length is too long, the 2 release handles (for the quick release plate) are a little too stiff.  [END]
[BEGIN] At full optical zoom the image starts to get blurrier.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only helpfull if you use them. But reading them they are full of good info.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tried to revive my flip ultra that won t charge...still won t charge. Not the battery s fault..I guess. Too bad, it took great pictures, but too expensive to replace. Will go back to using my camera phone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice strapt but without enough flotation for maintain coolpix AW130 on the water level, you need to add an small flotation block  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice Point and Shoot Digital Camera, but the battery runs out pretty quickly!  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a cool grip but the camera feels a little unbalanced when it s on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes alright pictures...just takes what feels like &#34;a few seconds&#34; between each shot. So, can t take rapid pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] has very short sensing range  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine. Not enlarge enough and not bright enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t meet my expectations, couldn t charge battery 100%,mostly 85% to 90% only.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine I like it  [END]
[BEGIN] First one fell apart So far the replacement is fine Easy return process, with no problems  [END]
[BEGIN] It s okay, but nothing to write home about.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as described but the remote control switch felt cheap and felt like it would not hold up over time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only worked for 7 months.  [END]
[BEGIN] my daughter loves this- was her Bithday gift. my only concern is it will be outdated in no time .too expensive for what is about to come to market  [END]
[BEGIN] came in black, but i like that better than the grey. no sealed pockets for memory cards and spare batteries though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] very clear, you need a tripod for steady viewing  [END]
[BEGIN] I m not pleased with the color of the pictures it takes.  [END]
[BEGIN] compared to what plastic components for the GoPro are going for, the price on this item seemed steep. my suggestion is that if you have this component, don t lose it. otherwise, it does what it s supposed to do.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this camera, nice size to fit into your pocket. Got some amazing photos at a concert. The zoom made it seem like we were right up front.  [END]
[BEGIN] I couldn t find all his potential use yet. I m trying to find special situations to use it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Memory Card not included in the box. You need to buy one separately or the camera will not work. Also, the &#34;Must Have&#34; accessory kit is not needed. Other than the camera case, all other items come with camera or are superfluous.  [END]
[BEGIN] works ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Could be more helpful for setting them up. No help at all from anyone..  [END]
[BEGIN] The cables were not long enough and my mouse was cracked once received, which made me have to purchase a new mouse and longer cables. Also the instructions were not very detailed and very limited. Picture quality is good.  [END]
[BEGIN] product was not one continuous printed sheet which would have been fine, except there is a very noticeable seam that wasn t properly aligned. Print quality is great, and the material is of good quality, but would have been a much higher rating if the workmanship was better  [END]
[BEGIN] it s ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the quality I expected from Sony. Doesn t grip very firmly for an *action* camera. For my use (hiking) I much prefer the no-name camera mounts with spring clips that are much more secure.  [END]
[BEGIN] took it out of box and tried to update firmware,now its in repair shop for 8 weeks  [END]
[BEGIN] sorry not much to say it only worked for a couple days,not very well built,the company was very promt.  [END]
[BEGIN] decent system for a decent price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger works well. Batteries have a very short life (50%) compared to original.  [END]
[BEGIN] The price is right. Doesn t work with my Odin TTL flash trigger, but it works as advertised when it is on camera. That s what happens when you try to save money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item works as expected, arrived ahead of time. I bit small for what i had in mind but it woks.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m indifferent about this. I thought it would have a little more blowing force but it does its job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely not as expected, much smaller than I anticipated. I will re-order a larger one & send this back.  [END]
[BEGIN] The cd would not load and the instructions were not in English. I figured out mostly how to use the camera but I have not tried to print out any pictures yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s definitely not super great in quality, but does the job in terms of capturing a wider angle as a macro lens. Definitely had fun using it, but would not use for professional grade photos!  [END]
[BEGIN] Email motion alerts are crapped !  [END]
[BEGIN] Would have liked the cases to be a bit more sturdy but worked as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] its works pretty well  [END]
[BEGIN] No Complains on the Hood, but unfortunately, I have vignetting issues on my 10-18mm lens so if you are looking for wide angle not recommended, else its good.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good bag other that it really needs a little more support in the back to keep your items from beating you up when you have it on.  [END]
[BEGIN] European  [END]
[BEGIN] wish the remote came with a cord. The tripod is a lil flimsy but it s a quick fix  [END]
[BEGIN] It s okay. Lots of good information, but I still find myself googling and youtubing things to find out more simplified versions of this information. I ll keep it, but it s still a bit above my beginner s level.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t used it yet bought it to replace one I broke that belonged to someone else. The one I broke has problem fitting in the holder and s tr staying steady.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Macro lens is pretty amazing. The fish eye isn t as good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got this case for my Raspberry Red camera and the colors don t match. The case is darker than the camera. I think this is a great protective case, the only problem is that the camera is hard to take out sometimes but overall this is great  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, but you get what you pay  [END]
[BEGIN] My camera did not fit on the tripod and it was a Instax camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] It will fit the a7rii, but you will have to fit it upside down. The borders are thinner on the left side. Right side-up and it will cover a very small part of the screen. Otherwise, the size of the entire screen protector is the correct dimensions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good cap wrong size.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked once for me, doesn t stick on the dashboard, it dropped my camera not too happy about that but it s very disappointing cause I really wanted one guess I will have to just do without.  [END]
[BEGIN] The build quality is good, but I found that I had to really torque the knobs to hold the camera. That said, it met my needs for a stable mount for my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bag didn t even come close to holding the camera. Very disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] While not a disaster, it s nothing sensational. Basically, the 3 stars is the middle of the ratings and this set is pretty much middle of the pack for digital backgrounds. Draped Muslin is probably the worst collection in the batch.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a gift to my boyfriend!!  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a good product for biggner who just started but I think there are much better ones to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as advertised. However wished they were not so flimisy. However they work if the glue sticky parts stay to the lens cap  [END]
[BEGIN] Product is good but i wish it had come with some camera tips video for newbies  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought it would be a great gift for myself but find that it gets extremely hot. Battery life is less that a hour. I get great video at 4k but anything above is halting. I hope that they fix the heat problem and short battery life.  [END]
[BEGIN] You have to switch mounts everytime you use a phone or a gopro. Very time consuming.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t like how the case has an embroidery of the name &#34;Katia&#34; on the side.  [END]
[BEGIN] The image quality is great and it was easy to set up. Very easy to use too. My only complaint is the sound quality. We use it with our iphones and it sounds like you are talking through a tin can. Doesn t bother me enough to return it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality image fair  [END]
[BEGIN] After period of time batteries slipped out of slot while charging.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good! It is as described. I ve used it a few times and it s very comfortable to hold. You do get what you pay for so keep in mind this is not a high end grip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good case  [END]
[BEGIN] Good but too small  [END]
[BEGIN] I believe that this lens will get a high rating once I begin using. Had rotator cuff shoulder surgery and have not used as of yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] 0ne battery was dead and charger holding pin broke at the first try and can t hold battery uprigth. But Amazon Emailed me asking of it and I tell them about the battery and they had it replaced for free. Amazon takes care.  [END]
[BEGIN] Inexpensive, but the image quality is lacking for a 3MP. It is laggish no matter the network and comes in grainy. I have it on a GB network.  [END]
[BEGIN] Within expectation.  [END]
[BEGIN] not verry usefull  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as clear as hoped  [END]
[BEGIN] die too quick  [END]
[BEGIN] awkward to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not to bad, looks almost like my very expensoive real ones which are near to these, J R  [END]
[BEGIN] very cheap material compared to original but works fine  [END]
[BEGIN] I needed to file my helmet mount to make this fit. Once it fit, it was loose inside the mount and rattles slightly. Not a big deal, but not as expected. I plan on eventually buying the brain explodercreations.com version. Looks more thought out.  [END]
[BEGIN] It meets my needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] not bad for used cameras did not want to upgrade as I have of these  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera. It has worked well after my lady figured out the many functions. Stars were withheld because no product manual was provided with camera. The online manual effort was completely frustrating.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery life is marginal. Was hoping for much better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometimes it goes off for no reason at all and other times it doesn t go off at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t take good pictures when it s sunny outside, kinda a waste of a money in my opinion  [END]
[BEGIN] The piece attached to lens cap separated. Almost lost my lens cap.  [END]
[BEGIN] so so~  [END]
[BEGIN] The hook came off within few days of use.  [END]
[BEGIN] some of the balls keep coming off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheesy but works and at low price. Works for the few times a year for crowd control or people mover.  [END]
[BEGIN] Makes DJI phantom professional very unstable...  [END]
[BEGIN] Goes through batteries pretty quick  [END]
[BEGIN] Good scope for bird watching and the like. My Kids love playing with it and learning how to focus and find stuff in the wild. Does what it says- a spotting scope.  [END]
[BEGIN] This did the job for my SJ4000. After a while, the center piece to mount it started breaking, but it still works well. I use it often.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality not so good  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice lense  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not come with any instructions on the parts.  [END]
[BEGIN] lens is to small  [END]
[BEGIN] The first Phottix had a great wired cord that lasted several years, Today no matter where I buy them including Phottix they fail after a couple times.  [END]
[BEGIN] The first set I purchase were nice but the 2nd set I got wasn t so nice... will add a picture of it to show what I mean  [END]
[BEGIN] We have installed the security system, it will meet our need. The only disappointment is I thought the system did not require a land line, but it does.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens is great, but the tripod fell apart on my first trip and would recommend a new product be included in this package. Great price for everything though, but would ve just bought the lens outright if I could go back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to setup and works great. Picture quality is not as great as I would ve hoped for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks bulky but enough room to store camera, charger and extra battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cable a little longer than expected. Otherwise, product is great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I took this camera to the water park for some reason when it went off it was hard to get it back on I had to take it out of the case and take the battery other than that it took great video  [END]
[BEGIN] could not get it to work  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometimes, it s better to save.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to return mike because it was faulty, was unable to connect to it. I was going to use it as a baby monitor. I was too afraid to get another one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can I just set the cams up without DVR or an computer? Can I just drill them to the walls and turn them on?  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a good deal but the quality could be better, but then you get what you paid for!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered same day but did not make the delivery on time... Now I m out of film for my vacation. Nothing against the product. Love my Fujifilm..lesson learned from ordering last minute.....BUT IT SAID SAME DAY!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have issues with the zoom sticking. I have had it in the repair shop three times. I am not sure if anything will fix it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera takes great pictures. Good weight. Camera needs better gripping to hold the camera. I think the flash should be located in the middle of the camera not at the end. If holding the top of the camera and the flash pops up, my finger is in the way.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item did not come in original Nikon box, as described. All other items are included as described  [END]
[BEGIN] Was much larger and clumsy to work with than anticipated. Seems to be well built, good quality. I ended up buying a selfie which my teen daughter has now taken ownership of.  [END]
[BEGIN] didn t fit but the people worked with me and got me the right one..  [END]
[BEGIN] The best  [END]
[BEGIN] So I guess I thought this would focus up close with this lens but it is literally just a mirror attached to a clear lens. Kinda not what I thought. Its a little dissapointing  [END]
[BEGIN] Very tight for my Galaxy 6 with the Otter Box case.  [END]
[BEGIN] The item is not worth the price paid.  [END]
[BEGIN] The measures are good, and you can move it easy, the materials are well for the price. But the head make noise when you paning or tilt. And the legs loose the high easy.  [END]
[BEGIN] its good  [END]
[BEGIN] I rate 3 star because the tightness adjust screw can t keep on my set. once its set on tight, and loose after few times rotate monopod.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the camera, but very dissatisfied with the battery life of each charge. My previous cannon had a different battery pack a lasted almost twice as long.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was able to fit an 808 hq30 camera. I have not tested it underwater yet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to drain quite quickly compared to batteries with similar MAH  [END]
[BEGIN] really works for me, especially on the streets of europe. wished it was less expensive though. the rain cover at the base really works. the padding which comes in contact with your back though will suffocate & make your back sweaty  [END]
[BEGIN] Difficult to operate. The toggle area is very small and hard to manipulate. Wouldn t buy again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very Good  [END]
[BEGIN] 3 1/2 some pieces are hard to fit  [END]
[BEGIN] hard to find additional quick release plate mounts :( all the plate mounts that do fit come from overseas and takes mount or more to arrive  [END]
[BEGIN] works good but under articulation you can crack the joints rendering it useless  [END]
[BEGIN] I have the older style: single position bulb for 60X and slide out 8X. The 8x is useless, but the 30X has very sharp magnification and the focus wheel is very helpful. An annoying aspect is that it has a backward reversed image.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does it job, rubber caps are ok, back and side doors quality feels low but you definitely get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Acceptable quality for the cost, but have reasonable expectations on visual quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess as long as you get a smatree pole you should be alright. Was hoping there was a kind of &#34;standard size&#34; pole. There isn t. It didn t fit my pole  [END]
[BEGIN] No holes in side. I knew this might be the case based on other review, but for $15 I can drill some holes in it. Still cheaper then name brand gopro skeleton housing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Photos show beautifully. Music does not work and instruction manual does not explain how to correct it.  [END]
[BEGIN] the tool doesn t fit  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty good lights. Except that I don t like that the bulbs stick out past the &#34;cone&#34;. The lights have dropped to the floor and it breaks the bulb. That s annoying.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was nicely made but soon came off the camera I had put it on. It was an experiment that failed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, but functional. The threaded ring came too easily out of the rubber piece. Collapses well, but I don t expect it to last too long without the rubber cracking.  [END]
[BEGIN] As advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] The set up is super difficult. If you can get past that, it is a good camera. I still haven t figured out how to recordâ€¦I can only watch live  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Missing pieces. No batteries, no lens cover. Did not know the item was refurbished. Very disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked as advertised. Did get water droplets on the filter during the dive that were not visible till watching the video. Then again, the gopro was mask mounted, so got lots of bubbles. Dove to 90 feet, visibility was great, colors were accurate at depth.  [END]
[BEGIN] They work well once you get the right angle, but I think they could use a bit more eye relief than the twist-up eye caps offer. I sometimes find it difficult to acquire a view unless I play with the angle.  [END]
[BEGIN] It does what is should, but it is not a huge angle widening. I used it on my 50mm lens and it turned it into maybe a 45mm? The biggest downside is that you lose a bit of focus control since now you have an extra lens to distort through.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] cool camera, impossible software. I spent like 3 hours trying to get it setup on WiFi and could not figure it out, even with the special support files provided by hoo too. not recommended for quick install.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m a cheap butt, and this gizmo got me the shots that I wanted....  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Remote doesn t work. HDMI-out doesn t work. No instructions on how to view/setup online(the &#34;instructions&#34; for DDNS are incredibly vague and not helpful at all). Other than that, pleasantly surprised at the quality of picture and that the HDD was included with the DVR unit for under $200.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as powerful as I had hoped.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nothing fancy, gets the job done for light activity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t try to take dry pics after taking underwater pics, water droplets will remain on the camera making all the pics you take look warped. Its really quite annoying when trying to take selfies with my head above water.  [END]
[BEGIN] I went into this knowing it wasn t a high-end technological marvel. I use it to view printed samples under pretty high magnification and it works OK. Not great, not worthless. Right smack dab in the middle for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine; fair quality. Better if had shutter activation button, available for same price in stores or online.  [END]
[BEGIN] cheaply made, does the job but you have to be careful with the case or it will break  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of wimpy and cheap style  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger works great, but rating the Smatree Batteries at 1200mah is disingenuous. Neither last as long as an original GoPro battery rated at much less.  [END]
[BEGIN] works but screams cheap. my MOVO motorized head is infinitely better for not much more money and also can be controlled as to transit and duration.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a good little fanny pack, my guess is you pay a lot for the name. Also, despite the photo it does not come with a water bottle holder.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Value!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great, but it s literally just a 60minute egg timer. You can easily make one yourself for just a few bucks and a little ingenuity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to set up, stable won t tip over. mine had no carry case if it did it would get another star. Works get for product pictures on a white back ground, not so goof for clothing site. Room will not warm up much.  [END]
[BEGIN] It has a nice feel, but with the weight distribution it was hard to keep from spinning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery works well in Nikon camera. I have had them for a few months now and under moderate use the batteries do now not hold a charge as long as they did initially.  [END]
[BEGIN] The color is great but it requires a lot of editing to smooth out the background. This is my only seamless that shows up as wrinkled/dented in photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] bad focus  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything went fine  [END]
[BEGIN] it works  [END]
[BEGIN] The zipper is hard and bendibg didnt think a higer tier pro bag will be that hard to close zipper my canon 6d fits inside even with a battery grip with a tiny bit of pressure and kit lens 24-105 attached gave it 3* only because of the bending zipper  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh. The tripod broke almost right away, so don t buy it for that. The rest was OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buyer beware! It is O K for the price. Sometimes it does not work.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am sure that it will be fine when I finally receive the Adapter/Charger which has been delayed twice already!  [END]
[BEGIN] Not interactive window. Otherwise nice case  [END]
[BEGIN] Almost completely satisfied but one of the lens did not fit my camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works good with camera and is fun to use  [END]
[BEGIN] Good!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had issues with the battery! would not take full charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good charger Worthless batteries  [END]
[BEGIN] Light and junky but gets the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] I ve yet to be able to get it to work correctly...but I m hopeful  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked fine until she took it and got it stolen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not come with the two rubber inserts.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lot s of light for the buck. Still not as user friendly as LED light panels. The green screen is thinner than what i expected and it doesn t all fit into the bag. Give your self lots of time to set up for interview and you should be good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good tripod for studio work, but too bulky to carry in the field.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Software for remote viewing frequently stops streaming regardless of signal strength or connection method. Disappointing.  [END]
[BEGIN] it makes good pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as a recorder and video. Hard to tell if it s on or off and no way to tell &#34;what&#34; part of the item being video d is being recorded - for example if you want to record someones face, there s no way to tell if you are.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok  [END]
[BEGIN] It s so nice to have this and it works pretty good. My only complaint is that the range isn t very far so it defeats the purpose of using it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Far too overpriced  [END]
[BEGIN] Got this as a present for a friend! She said the pictures may come out dark in too much sunlight  [END]
[BEGIN] *** Star  [END]
[BEGIN] no tan bueno  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor optical quality. Lot of purple fringing and image softness. Heavy and prone to lot of image shake due to high magnification.Returned and would not buy again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Use it only a few times.Hands should be steady to get clear pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job but you have to tighten really hard so it does not come out and wiggle loose.. Good grip and cheap for the cost. Shipping came in whenever it wanted. It said 3-4 weeks but it came in 1.5 weeks without warning. Just showed up... haha China, man...  [END]
[BEGIN] Works but did not impress me too much...makes hardly a change in the picture  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Camera  [END]
[BEGIN] I didn t go through all of it s features. My Samsung phone takes less grainy photos. The zoom was the only advantage, and wasn t worth the extra expense. If I want zoom, I ll buy a film camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great with my Flash unit and is very adaptable to my needs: However, After only two uses the tension in the umbrella caused two of the prongs to bend. Though the everything works, the umbrella is slightly off and is no longer symmetric.  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] I ll prefer regular foam over this stuff next time. But, overall this is pretty decent foam far as quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] ITS OK  [END]
[BEGIN] As long as you re on a flat surface it works perfectly. I wouldn t recommend usage on carpet or any rough terrain.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the item but when I received it and tried putting it together, the stick will not screw into the part that holds the phone. I cannot use this item.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits well, Looks good, Camera resolution NOT crisp. Prying out the old led bar and installing it in the camera unit was a little challenging. It gets the job done, and I like the position of the camera. If the image was more crisp it would be 4 stars easy.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you re looking for a cheap tripod- well. here it is. Construction is a little flimsy, all plastic. It s alright but I d suggest just to have light loads on this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great pictures but the video don t work good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as heavy duty as I d hoped. I think it s a nice tripod.  [END]
[BEGIN] i give three stars because the clip on the LCD screen side arrived broken. clip arrived broken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap quality build and color is off  [END]
[BEGIN] :Lens was as advertised but it was supposed to come with three filters and there weren t any. I had to buy filter to protect lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Found out it is spring operated instead of battery.I don t know how long timing spring will last. Also took almost2 months for its arrival.it also rotates west to east,wrong way for tracking the heavenly bodies.  [END]
[BEGIN] Auto focus broke after 2 months of use. Cost me 20$ to ship back to get repaired. Luckily it s a 6 year warranty. We will see how it is when I get it back, and if it holds up. Other than that it s a decent lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] First one was blurry and unusable. Had it returned. The 2nd one works just fine. Picture quality is not super, but it does the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] its small its kinda cool it works. its a small very cheap toy. really.  [END]
[BEGIN] what exactly is high resolution about these pieces of glass? I threw out the cheapo case and two of the lens... I only needed a protective lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] The WiFi receiver isn t so great. I can connect a phone, iPod, notebook to WiFi in the same place where this camera struggles to get a connection.  [END]
[BEGIN] even with warming filter it is still very cold. mounts are very fragile and loose. barndoors do help and the stands are decent. you only get three filters.for the price they work but don t expect them to hold up to a lot of abuse.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheaply made but gets the job done. Works well with an iPhone 6  [END]
[BEGIN] I learned the hard way that this camera is not good at action shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Couldn t use them. my camera died.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok. The quality is not great but I didnt pay as much as other cameras. The battery did run out a bit quickly, had to switch batteries twice in our 5 day vacation.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just ok  [END]
[BEGIN] worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good image quality, battery life is short so I bought rechargeable batteries  [END]
[BEGIN] VERY short range!!  [END]
[BEGIN] the size is suitable for small jobs but I would like the power of the lamps was better.  [END]
[BEGIN] As ordered. On time. A bit awkward to use. Not as useful as I had hoped.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great photos but there is a long lag in video recording.  [END]
[BEGIN] The case it self was very nice but there was lots of delays  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Value!  [END]
[BEGIN] I think the Note about no hard drive should be up at the top. I know this is intentional to sell a system cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Isnt last as long as the Sony battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] I gave it as a gift. It s OK.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the two I used broke on the prongs  [END]
[BEGIN] flash is great, remote not so much. go with the flash only kit.  [END]
[BEGIN] its good for protection but its restrict the movement of screen for selfie etc  [END]
[BEGIN] I was very disappointed the case will not hold the camera. I would like to contact the seller.I am satisfied with the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] After a few months, it doesn t satisfyingly click into place. And when you put it on backwards it doesn t stay in place really well. Overall, does it s job well.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little on the big side got to use at an angle but does get the job done  [END]
[BEGIN] For the cost I expected either an aluminum lense hood or one of the fouls back rubber types. What I got was a thin plastic hood that looks like it could break easily. I ll have to be careful.  [END]
[BEGIN] I liked all the attachments but only a few of the fit my gopro 4  [END]
[BEGIN] it s alright  [END]
[BEGIN] It seemed to be a fine product at a great price. However I returned it because it wouldn t work with my intended lens. Great service by the seller. Was not his fault.  [END]
[BEGIN] Small one isn t as small as I hoped and the large ones are huge. Well enough made and will protect the lenses.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Value!  [END]
[BEGIN] This didn t last very long. I purchased it in mid Feb 2015 and had to replace it by August because i it was very dim. It started out ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cute unit, PA crap, NO WHERE CLOSE TO 100 watt power  [END]
[BEGIN] The concept of great, but after receiving the holders, I discovered I have to remove the lens cap first, if I want to add or remove the lens hood.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was late but that s my only real issue with it. I would have liked it if it came with a fur more extra screws but for the price it s okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger works, but it is very difficult to attach it to the battery. The first time I tried, I broke off the little plastic part that is intended to hold it in place.  [END]
[BEGIN] huhh, it s alright tiny!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works ... its just a battery ....... Not prime rib dinner !  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality just wasnt there, Returned it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works, but I m not blown away. I like the form factor. GREAT size and VERY convenient that it folds away.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too thin  [END]
[BEGIN] The motion sensor doesn t work at night, so it won t record until ur literally waving your arms Update: 6 months later The recording device crapped out. It no longer records or functions. New rating would be 1 star  [END]
[BEGIN] works fine if you want to carry that much weight. the housing where you place the batteries though looks & feels cheap like it can break any minute.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am still trying to figure out why I bought this. It has all kinds of fancy programs that I will never use and some of my outdoor picks haven t captured the detail correctly. Personally I don t leave a camera outside all night to take star pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tripod is very very cheap. The monopod is fairly good quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] The one I received was not silver like the picture but part black and part silver. Was not really happy about that. Should have been all black or all silver. Not a mix  [END]
[BEGIN] its a basic bag, replaced it shortly after I got it with a pelican case, this is okay for a cheap camera when you need to save space.  [END]
[BEGIN] Delivery on times, it worked on my Cannon Camcorder !  [END]
[BEGIN] not to shabby, i know this was stupid but if you want this to last please don t take this stick underwater especially salt water  [END]
[BEGIN] Received shipment missing the wall charger. However, the batteries came fully charged and worked well. Returned item.  [END]
[BEGIN] Could never get it to work with SmartThings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice build up .value for money.unfotunately its not combatablr with my canon eos100  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok  [END]
[BEGIN] it is ok, nothing special. it looks used, was not as new  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well as a trainer for a better quadcopter. Its very fun to use but the camera stopped working after about 2 flights. Looks like it was supposed to take OK video but it broke after an hour of owning it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not ok you can see black parts on the videos and pictures due to wide angke  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the adapter ring come with this kit, if not this is impossible to assemble without it ref; Es-470 lite and soft box kit, I need help Very nice kit  [END]
[BEGIN] It is well constructed.. If you carry a camera and one lens or flash, it would work great. I normally carry two lenses and a flash. The bag is to small for that.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s not universal if the platform is too small to fit even the smallest DSLR.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely tight fit. Had to force it on the flash unit. It works otherwise.  [END]
[BEGIN] Picture quality not so good unable to view objects when digital zoom, picture real grainy at Nite  [END]
[BEGIN] The program sent with this scanner does not work very well. I have to keep opening and closing it to get it to copy the pictures into my computer.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s good enough to give the original battery time to fully charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s great for the price but I ordered black and got a white backdrop. I don t even have time to exchange it so thanks, I guess I need to find another option quick. At least I have a white back drop for future use.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t know how I m suppose to rate something if I haven t took it out it s box yet.this why I gave 3 stars  [END]
[BEGIN] They are huge-- listed as compact binoculars, they are anything but compact.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not well made and it take long time to charge.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just want a listing of whats inside and how to use each item  [END]
[BEGIN] sometimes glitches and shows door open when closed, have to open and shut to reset.  [END]
[BEGIN] Need to be an expert to use it. Still working on it. Positive. Gives unexpected result.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked well for the first couple uses and then the calibration got messed up. I suggest getting a small wagon for moving it around, as it is a bit too heavy for my back.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the lights will not turn on, I was also missing the camera stand from my delivery. The quality of the product is on point, besides these few hasseles I would buy the product again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The controls are pretty slow, and I can t get any videos to work, not even .mp4. It s supposed to play .mpeg4, which I think is the same? But since it wasn t super expensive, not bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] Some of the things are a little hard to tighten down and will need to get an allen wrench to get it tight. The follow focus is also REALLY bad and doesn t work at all. Overall, it s really heavy but is pretty good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Securely holds the camera and it won t slide off your head, but it hurts your forehead after awhile of wearing it.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s nice off a 3 days ! after oleo phobic Coating start disappear - and all screen cover by smudges ! it s not first time - it s always happens :(  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service and timely delivery. Tape color matches photo. The tape is not as effective in sticking and holding down cabeles as other gaffers type tape I have used in the past, across differnt products and brands. It does not leave any sticky residue, just as they promised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used it a couple times. Sometimes it takes a few clicks to get it to work even if just connected a few moments earlier. Overall though its nice for group and night sky shots when I can t/shouldn t mangling hit the button.  [END]
[BEGIN] OK  [END]
[BEGIN] I put one of these on my Polar on Saturday. I was already lifting and peeling at the corners a couple of days later. Good thing it came with 6 of them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to put on  [END]
[BEGIN] AC Adapter died after 1 year  [END]
[BEGIN] Sits by the back door of our cottage. Great for keeping an eye on the dogs,  [END]
[BEGIN] Should be able to trigger video recording  [END]
[BEGIN] Powerful but very inconsistent performance, ttl will at some times tend to over/under expose, not very reliable but good third-party flash for the money  [END]
[BEGIN] AmazonBasics  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a bit deceptive in size, I m 6 1&#34; and I have to bend over to adjust the Camera. Works ok, but I would need a taller Tri-pod.  [END]
[BEGIN] just ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not blink after installing new batteries. Tried another set of batteries, same problem. I looked at the camera during the day and night several times  [END]
[BEGIN] Lot Heavier then expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] doesn t fit if you have the lens hood in place unlike original  [END]
[BEGIN] its ok  [END]
[BEGIN] There s nothing really special about it but it will get the job done. I wish there were cuter, more stylish options for DSLR sleeves but it is what it is.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] i have other cheaper ones that works as good  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok for price  [END]
[BEGIN] Requires a VERY high internet speed. My DSL was maxed out and it still did not function.  [END]
[BEGIN] I will do the job.. not the best tripod but for the money it s good enough for my purposeâ€™s.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera looks just like the picture, but I am a bit disappointed in the way it does not focus well when zoomed in from a distance. Also find the transfer of pics to phone a little cumbersome and slow usually.  [END]
[BEGIN] With every shot from a 12 gauge the camera would move completely out of the way or at one point even managed to fly off. But good for fishing and other random projects.  [END]
[BEGIN] nothing to write. It comes with hardly no instructions or service manual. camera have a narrow scan width & it will not take a sata hard drive smaller than 500 GB. Sorry but I would not purchase another one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Way too many features to remember how to use them. As a point-and-shoot camera it isn t ideal.  [END]
[BEGIN] This will only fit an iPhone without a case. Too small to hold iPhone with case.  [END]
[BEGIN] The fact this doesn t turn off is my only score against it. It s also a bit confusing to use, but not difficult to learn. Works great. Would prefer a wireless version. works with my D7100  [END]
[BEGIN] It works pretty well, but the reels seem like they re a little to narrow for 35mm. The film was getting jammed a lot, and rounding the lead edges of the film with scissors seemed to help, but I ve hard to re-start rolls several times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tripod itself is great, but the adapter isn t. I had to buy a replacement adaptor in a few weeks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks nice but it s not the most efficient. So if ur going for the looks, then go for it, but it s annoying when u want to take pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera seemed to work fine but it offered little adjustment possibilities, resulting in inconsistent and almost temperamental results. I supposed it might also have to do with the film available.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked as advertised for about a year or so....then the charge starts getting less and less.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok, you can t take a pic with it and it lets the phone tilt if you don t balance it perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] one of the lights does not fit right.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad for the price! Feel like the lens could be clearer!! But all and all good deal!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Generally good product and easy to set up and configure. Main problem was that the unit I got was returned by another purchaser and the seller did not erase previous phone numbers from the memory, so alarms kept calling him!  [END]
[BEGIN] Received two different styles, one style was durable and easy to attach directions to for a wedding reception, the other one was like a cardboard box. Still waiting to see if pictures turned out. Fingers crossed!  [END]
[BEGIN] Device works fine, I just couldn t make the USB attachment work...  [END]
[BEGIN] hard to operate.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this for my small DSLR. It s much much smaller than I thought it would be. It s works fine for small cameras but if you have any type of DSLR, this absolutely will not work for you.  [END]
[BEGIN] smaller than I thought and it doesn t hold a lot. I have put the camera in a bigger bag and use this a protective case.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a great camera for the price hands down. Only down side is that it ll record only 10-12 min videos....  [END]
[BEGIN] It does what it say, and it awesome that its directional. The Gopro mount can actually pop out of the housing pretty easily. My buddy wiped out wake boarding and the gopro popped off. If you re going to use this for water sports MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FLOAT!  [END]
[BEGIN] The threads of the screw that attach the plate to the camera all mess up. Thus, unable to use. Other than that, it s ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything appears to be good quality products however some documentation would be nice. There was nothing at all and since there are a lot of individual parts I m really not sure what everything is for and how it fits together.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product but not the best quality, the head strap was loose which I cant fix my camera on.  [END]
[BEGIN] It wasn t strong enough for my use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. thanks red giant.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is ok, although I had big troubles using AAA batteries it is really annoying because they donÂ´t fit perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not made to accept the qd 1.5 loops......the sling is a closed unit.........you can not add them on  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything fits and works as it should :) A bunch of extra unnecessary things are included in order to increase the appeal but It beats paying for the original GoPro pieces and they work just as well!  [END]
[BEGIN] It looks fake. I did find these at Best Buy cheaper.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product for the money. Display software needs work. You cannott zoom or clip areas for motion detection. You cannot delere individual pictures. You must reformat the whole memory stick. Good quality video,say or night.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is well built and takes excellent photos and videos. Not user friendly to transfer photos. Pain in the neck for this part.  [END]
[BEGIN] Canon has a 1 year warranty that they have honored for me numerous times. I buy Nikon now. Either way, you don t really need this.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice cheap alternative to big dollar GOPRO mount does what it is supposed to do  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good quality. Was impressed until i saw a big dot on my recorded videos. It is stuck inside the lense and not outside the lense. We ll see when i get my replacement item.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s worth what I paid for it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think bean bag filler works best with a mixture of these beads for light weight and heavier material like sunflower seeds.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thought it was rubber material. It s actually plastic. I m assuming it ll still float okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] AC adapter died a few weeks after the warranty expired but besides that; its a great camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] LVR is fine for my hero 4, but cannot charge while your recording with case, I prefer the non lcd vesion  [END]
[BEGIN] No comments  [END]
[BEGIN] Yes they work, but the adhesive is horrible and does not stick. Ended up having to use 3M double sided tape to attach one mount to my daughters helmet.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is okay for a basic camera and for the price. Day shots are good, night not so good. Poor quality build. It s good for travel.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded.  [END]
[BEGIN] t I don t like the instruction book being online. Haven t figured out how to view photos online.  [END]
[BEGIN] Is a nice product, nicely build. The only problem is the foot holder, It doesnt stay up. At the end I removed from the Monopod.  [END]
[BEGIN] These batteries do work, but don t fit into the slots as easily as the originals. The batteries don t seem to hold as long either.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awkward to use. Takes three hands to align the hood properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera, but returned it as there is no real flash. It comes with a little toy one that looks like an after thought. Great pictures in good light, but there are better options for a little more money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its OK the battery doesn t fit all the way in the charger  [END]
[BEGIN] instructions not very good, could not get the audio to work properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well but kinda stiff, I like my backpack style better. Larger and bulkier than expected. I find I use the inside case more than the whole thing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t take great out of water photos, but hints why it s an underwater camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] good product.  [END]
[BEGIN] This item does what it is designed for. It does feel flimsy and make you worried that your flash will fall but it holds up. It works.  [END]
[BEGIN] These have a tendency to unscrew as you use it. I m thinking about taking it off  [END]
[BEGIN] I feel like this product is a little half-baked, they rushed it to market and it isn t great. The shogun is great, but I m considering finding a third-party sun-hood.  [END]
[BEGIN] not always focused, not enough zoom for me  [END]
[BEGIN] This works if you bounce it off the ceiling  [END]
[BEGIN] Shutter button would have been nice...  [END]
[BEGIN] Product works as advertised. However, like other reviewers have said, it is very hard to remove the lens. I have resorted to using a flat blade screwdriver to get in there to unlock the pin so I can remove the lens from the adapter.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok  [END]
[BEGIN] They do the job of an extension tube, but feel very cheap. My lenses have also become stuck every now and then, but still easy to remove.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works! but probably would not withstand rough handling. JC  [END]
[BEGIN] What can I say, it works......got tired of fooling with this and just put velcro on the speed light.....  [END]
[BEGIN] A few times after using my GoPro with this case for a while in the water, the lens on the case begins to fog up a bit. From time to time I have to disassemble the case in order to wipe the inside which becomes a bit inconvenient.  [END]
[BEGIN] sometimes the control of the lens through this extension not work but still good addition to my gear.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this device from this seller based on the reviews. The device is not the one pictured, but is identical to the cheapest looking, lower rated models. Don t make the mistake I made. Don t pay extra for looks and reviews.  [END]
[BEGIN] It worked great until the attenna broke off. It is touchy, will try again and be more careful. Otherwise it worked as it is supposed to.  [END]
[BEGIN] at my second month it broke  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a great tripod for beginners who haven t used one before. I noticed that when I tried to adjust it some washers and bolts actually fell off of it. But besides that, it works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] works ok but to small and to heavy  [END]
[BEGIN] its ok but now with more gear the bag is to small need bigger one  [END]
[BEGIN] Leather? No it is not. But, not too bad  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor performance out of box. Need to be collimated. Celestron may charge you extra to do it. Once collimated, works fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] My daughter received it OK. However, I apparently ordered the wrong one because it didn t charge her camera. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] The further zoom the more blurry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works pretty well. Sometimes difficult to keep it out of the picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as thick as I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] When this camera works, it s fantastic. I purchased it to take photos of the animals in our local animal shelter. The Sports mode and burst functions work very well for this application. The problem is that the camera is unreliable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good mount but the screws that come with it strip easily - do not use the screws that come with the product -only good for sheetrock if that  [END]
[BEGIN] I should have measured my camera s screen first !  [END]
[BEGIN] was unable to attach the arm to the stand as it doesn t fit at all, not even the mid section...  [END]
[BEGIN] I loaded 10 pictures onto a flash drive to plug into the USB. It will only display 4 of them. I have no idea why that would be. It s a basic frame so I can t seem to find much information on it. Very, very annoying.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m not really sure if this works or doesn t work, or make a difference. But one thing I learned is to be careful how far I insert the cord tip into the conditioner. It can, and has, pulled out the cord tip, rendering the cord useless.  [END]
[BEGIN] battery drains quickly but it works if used immediately.  [END]
[BEGIN] This case works well, but after swimming, the lens fogged up, ON THE INSIDE  [END]
[BEGIN] OK ... it s supposedly a NIKON-made shutter release but the price (almost $40) is ridiculous ! It s well-made but NOT worth that much money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool  [END]
[BEGIN] Knew it was vintage, actually looked used. Came with European wiring and plug. Had to replace plug, which took up the cost of the lamp.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for the most part. Wish the case was better quality though, especially the inside padding  [END]
[BEGIN] Can t use auto focus but these little lens adapters are pretty neat  [END]
[BEGIN] Wasn t quite as heavy duty as I thought it would be but it worked for the low price.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am not really sure if it did cleaning job. I have not noticed any difference either in playing a tape or recording.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lack of instructions with the piece means you need to do a little research, but works as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product. Wish the seller could give some different recommendations on how it could be used. I searched YouTube for all kinds of ways you can use the straps. I was able to put it on my ski boot while snow skiing. It was awesome shots!  [END]
[BEGIN] The lenses are awesome, but the way they attach to the phone is really annoying and can crack your screen if you re not careful. Good lenses though.  [END]
[BEGIN] for me, the price is equivalent with its quality. it is ok to shoot not quickly moving subjects. for better shoot, you need .... a tripod. a very very good tripod  [END]
[BEGIN] I used this to mount a Baby Monitor near my baby s crib. It is just okay. It doesn t grip that well and caused it to slide down all the time. I also bought another one with a better grip (cushion instead of plastic) and it s WAY better.  [END]
[BEGIN] Feels cheap  [END]
[BEGIN] Great quality images but super awkward to hold. I think that s ultimately why this body was discontinued.  [END]
[BEGIN] doesn t hold much  [END]
[BEGIN] Not quite what I expected  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Dont buy this unless you have a warehouse size studio. Too many pieces to assemble. I wish I had saved my money because I never use it. In fact, I ve never used it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t come with the memory card as of Aug 2015.  [END]
[BEGIN] The strap is comfortable but not without problems. Most importantly, the metal buckle reaches around to the fragile camera LCD screen so it can potentially damage it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was hoping it would be a bit smaller, but its super loud and great otherwise. Definitely makes me feel safer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sharp at all. I use this for skateboarding  [END]
[BEGIN] I would not describe as pro-grade but probably comparable to other tripods for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as described although as many people have said and I can attest to it that the IR extender receiver doesn t work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works but battery doesn t fit 100% straight away. Gotta jiggle it to snap on.  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Its just good  [END]
[BEGIN] This is great looks almost faded though. Not real bright.  [END]
[BEGIN] items are ok to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not nearly as roomy as I thought it would be.  [END]
[BEGIN] Handle with care! First time I mounted it, I got it stuck on my lens. Second time it got stuck in the body of my D7100. I would highly recommend getting a filter wrench at the same time you purchase the ring.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent purchase. Very fast shipping. The flash kit comes as described and fitted perfectly on my Nikon D7000. It worked wonderful. I really loved the difusser.  [END]
[BEGIN] Falls off camera too easily, already lost this viewfinder  [END]
[BEGIN] came with missing screw  [END]
[BEGIN] ok for the money, but not what i wanted so i returned it for a higher quality and more expensice tripod  [END]
[BEGIN] The product was OK. Would not fit my Camera. I think it s the Camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too much noise. Any suggestions on how to reduce the noise? (AIR)  [END]
[BEGIN] Worth the money, filters add more creativity, but are hard to focus with them on.  [END]
[BEGIN] not what I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] I very much like the camera, but there was no lens cover or instruction Manuel  [END]
[BEGIN] It has a lot of use and think it is really reliable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just fine  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far so good. Only time will tell if this is a product worth more stars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is OK for the price. A little slow on focusing and pictures are not spectacular, but it is a decent enough point-and-shoot for brightly lit scenes.  [END]
[BEGIN] The die quickly. But you get what you pay. Cheap price=cheap quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item is what it says it is and arrived as such. Just didn t do much to take out jello. On increasing height I would still get the wobble. Only reason for three stars as it just wasn t what I needed. Item was flawless in description and delivery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely built bag that actually protects your camera but I hated how bulky this was. I brought this with me while I was vacationing and it was a pain having to lug this thing around.  [END]
[BEGIN] Super hard to get pictures under water as you can t see anything on the screen but it s okay. I got a couple good pics and it s decent price/quality ration. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Pictures are O.K.,but deleting is a pain.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are ok but not great.  [END]
[BEGIN] The item works fine but the housing was dinged up. It looked used.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works for light camera bodies/lenses. A bit difficult to hold still when attatch a medium telephoto prime lens with a DSLR.  [END]
[BEGIN] The bottom does not work. Just de remote control  [END]
[BEGIN] It feels pretty cheap. One came damaged but they sent a replacement. You have to be extremely delicate when adjusting camera if not you can mess up the threading in the screws.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not record video from my quad copter cam.  [END]
[BEGIN] not working great. hard to set up. returned and bought other camera  [END]
[BEGIN] nice product, quick delivered, good description  [END]
[BEGIN] Screws keeps coming loose and the Gopro adapter correctly. Otherwise it is ok for a starter clamp.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool  [END]
[BEGIN] Rough machining; not smooth when adjusting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used a light meter, this doesn t put out nearly as much as it claims too. False advertisement.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera. The fact that you can control it with your phone is amazing. It s just the quality of the image that is a bit disaponting. But other than that it s a great camera  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is strong, but the shoulder pad constantly slides out of position.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little bit small  [END]
[BEGIN] Not really practical for shirt pocket, but picture is decent and battery life is as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works great, takes awesome picutres and is very easy to get to record when mounted. However, the user interface with the phone app is really not intuitive and sometimes Finding harnesses and acessories are harder than other more popular cameras.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery discharges extremely fast and overheats the camera causing it to shut down way to easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seals well but buttons very hard to push, unlike original. would not buy again  [END]
[BEGIN] It s okay should have done more homework before purchase. Do not like paddle flipping to one side. I find it difficult following anything I want to capture with paddle to one side. Just okay. Thank you  [END]
[BEGIN] I have no experience with a proper wide angle lens but this one was a fantastic low budget solution to my dilemma  [END]
[BEGIN] it did work for alittle bit,,you get what u pay for..lol  [END]
[BEGIN] It works, but charger is a pain. It is an adjustable , universal charger. You will have to look up the positive and negative contact with the battery manufacturer (there are many contacts on these batteries!) just to see how to setup the charger.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great bag, just needs a little more room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Construction/materials seems kind of cheap. I d pay more for something a little sturdier.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worthwhile if you find a bargain. Batteries hold up well. Motion sensors delay causes people to be out of the frame before recording. About a 1-2 sec delay. Numerous false alarms and yet has hard time recognizing people in vicinity.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product works however you gotta watch the pin to make sure it doesn t come out. By pin I m talking about when you will see that I m pointing towards in the product picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] Neither great nor bad. Mounting hardware is cheap and flimsy. Camera works okay.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad. You probably don t want this if you take it places as it ll get banged up quick. But fine for a stable studio environment, and fine for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Records really dope but Idk if it s my phone or the camera. But when i download the video too my phone I have no sound.  [END]
[BEGIN] Case is soft not a hard case..price is right  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad for a small camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] not as good of quality as I would like, but for the price it s alright.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not always reliable but can usually get it operable after a bit of fussing. Serves its purpose for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] It would be a better product if the batteries came in plastic carrying cases, such as Lumix batteries. This allows storage in camera bag without the contacts getting dirty.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product functions as designed and is definitely small and light but I d recommend getting the Jellyfish tripod instead. You ll be happier if you do.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the leds doesn t work. Even thought the battery is fully charged (I ve charged them and switched them) One of the leds nevers turns on green. Besides that minor inconvenience the product works as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] No instructions or HDMI cable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had trouble with this product. It ended up not being compatible with my camera(Sony HDR-SR11) as advertised. However, the company I bought it from provided excellent customer service. I was able to return it.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a little too compact for the Lumix FX100 basic camera, and replacement battery. I need a larger case but the case is built great.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the one before the session came out and the selfie stick sucks and the car mount broke once i touched it  [END]
[BEGIN] worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] The card makes it worthwhile but probably won t use most of the items.  [END]
[BEGIN] The package arrived much earlier than promised. Excellent! The buckle s quality has room for improvement. The hook got pulled sideways by 2 MM after a week s use.  [END]
[BEGIN] The graduated filter works but isn t really dark enough in my opinion to make a huge difference. The build quality is very cheap and dust sticks to the glass like crazy. Not even close to being a high end grad filter, but will work kinda-sorta-ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] The tripod itself is great for the price. It does the job that I need it to do. The carrying case on the other hand is terrible. I have had it just under two months and the strap has already come apart.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as good as some other mini tripods, but it gets the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] was a good value for a full frame sensor but returned for the D750 which is well worth the the price difference for the added features and low light performance. Wi-fi, flip screen, and higher usable iso made it a not brainer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Descent midrange price flash. Nothing special. Use for times when a flash is required additional lighting. Not good for doing creative lighting.  [END]
[BEGIN] cheap  [END]
[BEGIN] Good kit. A couple of additional ways to attach the camera that didn t rely on an enclosure for the camera to be purchased would make it a great kit.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice case. Just WAY TOO BIG for our needs. Return was no problem. It seemed much bigger than the dimensions (they were correct, just seemed bigger). Had to go a different route.  [END]
[BEGIN] Dual zipper close -- one zipper broke off within the first week. Velcro &#34;separator panels&#34; are less effective than expect. However, OTHER than that, sturdily constructed -- size\design supports ease of use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera takes good quality video. The waterproof case makes the sound not so great. The mounts are decent but DO NOT over tighten them.  [END]
[BEGIN] It served it purpose...  [END]
[BEGIN] A little thinner than I expected it to be. If working remotely, be sure nothing reflective like a tv, photograph is behind it as it will reflect the light and give you hot spots.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Will definitely not fit a 70-200mm lens. Lengthwise or width wise.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a Holga Lense. You don t expect low-light performance, or high quality feel ( it s all plastic) or pixel perfect reproduction. It s a nice cheap lense for experimenting with stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is easy to use. Just follow the instruction, I get the video appear in my Android app. The night vision of this camera is poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good buy  [END]
[BEGIN] It fit the camera but did not work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very unreliable. When it works, it s great. But I cannot tell you how many times live view simply does not work and I cannot tell you how many times when I try to respond to an alert it simple says &#34;cannot connect right now&#34;. And forget it working wirelessly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Still learning to use them but I like it a lot.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well!  [END]
[BEGIN] really not that impressed.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had problems with CD because it arrived broken. I do not know where get a new one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] The price is too much for too little  [END]
[BEGIN] Not bad for price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent camera; cheap goodies.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera worked great for two years. I used it in the Caribbean once and then the next day, the screen went black. It lasted almost exactly until the two year warranty wore off. :-(  [END]
[BEGIN] The extension clasps are very hard to work especially if your hands are wet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does what it s supposed to. A bit pricey to be made of paper.  [END]
[BEGIN] Images have a strong magenta cast difficult to control even indoors.  [END]
[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] so so~  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not really fit my Samsung NX mini which is the smallest nx camera samsung has for its mirrorless camera. The case did not leak at all. The case is meant for smaller point n shoot and not mirror less cameras which are slightly bigger.  [END]
[BEGIN] loose range quickly  [END]
[BEGIN] It s made fairly well, but I expected a much higher level of quality if it was originally 79 dollars as stated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great but very difficult to setup. Took two people 3 1/2 hrs. to finish setup, could not connect to my Apple MacBook Pro.  [END]
[BEGIN] No comments  [END]
[BEGIN] as expected...hated the short and non-microusb cable for charging  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok for a gift!  [END]
[BEGIN] It s just personal preference...nothing really against the product.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s ok....the screw is crap it won t screw in anymore it s a good thing the go pro came with extras...if you want to use it for the outside of a car I recommend the actual gopro suction cup...  [END]
[BEGIN] Not very durable didn t work very long  [END]
[BEGIN] Just not loud enough!  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to fuss with it for quite awile to get it paired with my SmartThings hub. No complaints once getting through the pairing process.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered several. Wide angle lenses are great and worth the $7.95 each alone. However, the fish-eye lenses are blurry, not because of foreign matter or scratches (lenses are clear and smooth), but just the way they were made (they were all the same)  [END]
[BEGIN] After moderate use, the belt attachment is tearing from the case. Otherwise, it s a very good case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty sure I could come up with a smarter design. It s so oddly designed. I ll be losing the brass fittings sooner or later guaranteed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger didn t work. Plus it didn t come with a lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] is ok but not really impressing that much. i was hoping for more changes in the picture.....  [END]
[BEGIN] too much flexible, dificult to remove the bubbles  [END]
[BEGIN] works with my Nikon D200.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item is made out of plastic, it arrived broken. Should be made of something sturdier or shipped better. Nice idea though.  [END]
[BEGIN] I could not use it with my camera, but the product was as advertised. Returned with no problem.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera did not wow me built quality ok video quality not great very user friendly one of the easiest I have set up over all good for basic around the house surveillance not great on detail pixels  [END]
[BEGIN] Work fine Gets the job done  [END]
[BEGIN] Photos are not clear otherwise it is fun  [END]
[BEGIN] Soft at f3.5, more sharp around f8. Still the best APSC fish eye out there.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got the first version.. Great but magnets fall out and it s annoying.. Can t seem to find a way to fix it  [END]
[BEGIN] This cam works pretty well. The video quality is average but the price is right for a decent outdoor cam. Unfortunately I had 2 of these fail. They just stopped working completely. Pyle customer service was great and got me a new camera within a week.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice colors -- thick substantial float  [END]
[BEGIN] Expensive but decent lens. Good for beginner.  [END]
[BEGIN] Flies well, but so light that wind will take it as it goes above the trees. Easy to control unless windy  [END]
[BEGIN] The octopus stand broke upon unpacking. I recommend sanding down the parts so they have better grip/friction.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s not bad for the price, however, this was purchased before I fully conceded to the fact that in order to get a good solid tripod you ve got to spend some money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Work good, easy to set up. The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of cheaply built but will do the trick and priced right  [END]
[BEGIN] The release lever has troubles and the aperture ring isn t so smooth, but it s workable.  [END]
[BEGIN] I do like the size of this camera very much but it just doesn t perform nearly as well as my other Nikon but then my other Nikon is in a whole another category price wise. Over all it s an okay camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] The umbrella has a very weak metal. it only lasted a few sessions. Somehow the metal twisted in a way I could never untwist again. Broken now.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product isn t the best quality but it works.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quite obsolete now, better get a GoPro  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t think they last that long.  [END]
[BEGIN] not as good as I expect.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was able to get the moisture spots off the sensor, but the dust and lint was a problem. I used the product as directed, but still saw dust on the sensor even after repeating the cleaning several times.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really need one of these, but I am not smart enough for this particular one. It is not simply plug and play, so to speak. I was in above my head. So, unfortunately, I had to return it. Best of luck to you if you decide to try it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera sucks but flies great. No ability to attach different camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] It uses your phone s hotspot, and big pictures take a long time. Couldn t keep the connection long enough for it to work.  [END]
[BEGIN] One charging port does not work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap  [END]
[BEGIN] works for what i eeded for a sall price  [END]
[BEGIN] Would have been better if it didn t come broken!  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] No grippy Handel just hard plastic feels cheap but gets job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] needs second pocket. inside pocket of the one opening is too shallow. Discs fall out. Had to buy another to hold my camera. Fortunately the camera was better than the case! Don t buy it unless you are need to have only one thing in it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Instructions are horrible  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok, but a bit stiff and hard to close.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item was shipped fast but the zoom lens is loose and when holding camera down the lens will slide out and it shouldn t move. Not the seller s fault but a factory problem. Takes good pictures but mechanical flawed.  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for here. Works, but not 100%.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m really impressed with the camera itself the range of motion is great, and the picture quality is amazing for such and inexpensive camera. Where the product fails is the app it crashes constantly it seems to have a really hard time staying connected to the unit.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a tripod. It s a pretty decent inexpensive tripod, and if that s what you need, I say order it. But if you need a light stand ... this won t do.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this last minute for a cruise. Takes pretty good pictures, zoom feature is excellent, but the time needed between pics is inconvenient. However, as a basic camera it does the job.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the two soft buttons (the black) has some &#34;other&#34; additional mark on the surface....which I don t like....the quality is much better in the photograph...  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, you d think you would get more fly time. Oh technology limitations. It s a battery. It works.  [END]
[BEGIN] The 2 way audio works...the setup was not very easy. IPCam Viewer App does not have this model IP Camera for the smart phone.  [END]
[BEGIN] clunky interface  [END]
[BEGIN] It works but the red tip is hard to put on and I wish it was smaller. I know there is a smaller one but the smaller one did not get good reviews.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does the job but it shakes a lot and can get uncomfortable against your ear. Hence the 3 star  [END]
[BEGIN] It does what is expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Gift  [END]
[BEGIN] Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret?  [END]
[BEGIN] The plastic sheet protectors seemed loose before use. Decided to return.  [END]
[BEGIN] i used it with my phone and it s works ok  [END]
[BEGIN] It s okay, some pictures came out great. Others looked like webcam quality. Sucks up batteries though. Bring lots of batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted to return this because the sound quality is so poor that there is constant background noise even in complete silent rooms. Other then that it s great but with sound so terrible I felt as if the device was broken.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came on time, battery however does not sit in it correctly but seems to be charging.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a little on the cheap side but it has some nice compartments which seem a little flimsy though. Not bad for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Okay quality, batteries last about 50-75% as long as OEM.  [END]
[BEGIN] The batteries were not the 1450 mAh brand pictured, but 1200 mAh Bower batteries. Both are good batteries, and both last longer than the Canon OEM 1000 mAh battery that came with the PowerShot S95.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like that it s manual focus with built in hood. Seems sharp for the price. I just don t like the limited aperture stops.  [END]
[BEGIN] The cords for the lights are very short. The lights are top heavy and one fell over and broke the bulb on the 2nd use :-(.  [END]
[BEGIN] Scanner was fine. I thought in reading the description it was an upgraded version. I already had one like the one I ordered.  [END]
[BEGIN] It fits my hybrid bike bar, and it holds OK. However, it doesnt t fir my road bike bar.  [END]
[BEGIN] the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade.  [END]
[BEGIN] VERY LARGE The camera is incredibly conspicuous, although pretty to look at â€“ if it doesn t need to be subtle are hidden in anyway it should work well â€“ my bad for ordering without considering that issue. Two large to hide amongst bric-a-brac at Cetera as I had hoped  [END]
[BEGIN] The clip is good. Some angles are funky. It doesnt bend the whole 180 degrees so you cant get all the angles. Slips off of hard serfaces. Best use is on a backpack strap  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine but more instructions needed, like how to clear info. On chip. Does send out a lot of false alarms. Still trying to figure out why.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger is fine but disappointed by the size of the batteries. Movie Cameras need bigger batteries and this was advertised for movie cameras. Better to buy the charger and batteries separately.  [END]
