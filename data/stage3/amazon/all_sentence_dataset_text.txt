1 Excellent battery. Holds charge as good if not better than the factory battery that came with the LUMIX. Will be buying more. Also the charger works great too! 
2 So many accessories come with this camera for any situation! Also my GoPro accessories work with this camera as well! 
3 This item worked as expected, and was great for the simple task of keeping an eye on my drive way. 
4 It did what it was supposed to do. Satisfactory Product 
5 Great camera 
6 While this will do the job, the plastic construction is very flimsy and more expensive that others that appear to be made out of better materials. Look for something else. 
7 Bag is very nice quality. Beware of how small it is though, I end up have to return this! 
8 Why purchase a great Sony lens and get a knock-off lens cap? Picked up this as an extra. 
9 Use these to upgrade cables I got with cameras. These cables work great. I installed 13 Lorex cameras including a PTZ camera and have not had any issues. There is no signal issues particularly for cameras more than 100 feet away from DVR. 
10 These are fakes! I could barely control my Phantom with these on and nearly crashed into nearby objects. DO NOT BUY THESE! 
11 good 
12 I bought this thinking my camera needed a new battery, but it turns out it has some other issues. The battery itself was great along with the shipping which came early than anticipated which was fantastic! 
13 GREAT LENS FOR THE MONEY 
14 my new baby love it!!!! 
15 Attached it to my waterproof Nikon coolpix camera and it works great- the camera floats. Also, the floatie is not overly big and bulky. 
16 Has short depth of field. 
17 No support. Doesn t do ftp doesn t work properly with motion detection, doesn t seem to do anything well. 
18 Good buy 
19 So far it works well. My only complaint is that the cord is shorter than the original. 
20 Easy to adjust and fits comfortably on anyone s head. Perfect mount for any activity to get great action shots with the GoPro! 
21 Hands down, the best mount Ive came across! I originally bought the $5 knock off one, and it broke the second day I had it! 
22 It was a gift. She liked it 
23 A bit bulky, but it held my brother s camera above water when dropped it in the ocean on accident! 
24 This thing is a pile of junk, cannot even figure out how to make it take pictures! Once you turn it on you cant turn it back off you have to wait for it to die. 
25 Love these wipes! Third time I ve bought these. 
26 With no OSD there is no way to change the camera settings and the picture is so bright it is almost washed out. I m replacing this one with something that will work for FPV. 
27 Everything I have ever bought from Cowboy Studio has been good stuff. 
28 Nice bag overall. One of the side buttons was broken. 
29 I can t seem to get this strap to the point where I know it won t drop my camera. 
30 Fits my Nikon D3100. neck strap very comfortable. Can t beat the price. Would recommend to anyone wanting a more comfortable strap than the one provided by Nikon. 
31 display went broken, purchase was quickly reimbursed, so I bought Nikon 610P 
32 Works as promised, lost my other one, and this one fits perfectly! 
33 Excellent product. It adds flair to my black/white/pink camera strap. 
34 Great backdrop. Does have folds but I believe those will go away over time. Great product for the price! 
35 Good. 
36 These batteries are not good at all. They hold a charge a fraction of the time of the regular battery. 
37 Everything came as described! Great deal! Fast shipping! Would buy from again! Thank you. 
38 I needed a new camera and bought this going on very little info. I LOVE IT!! It has been the best little camera for everyday pics and video. I m always pleased with my prints. 
39 Love it! Everything I need fits in neat and comfortably. 
40 Excellent product. With all three tubes connected was not able to have auto function but that s not a problem. Will never use them all together anyway. Would recommend. 
41 Great camera, got it few months back and enjoying it. Superb quality and fast shipping from beach camera... 
42 Very disappointed, needed my software tools to get the going. Did not stated in description. 
43 Arrived earlier than expected and as described. Very good price for all included items. 
44 Works great with smartthings... Wish it was a little smaller. 
45 rec d as promised and as advertised 
46 when i purchased this, i do not remember it saying things were not included, i can almost remember it saying it was a complete kit. NEver been out of the box, since hubby knoew it wasn t complete kit. 
47 Got this camera at a great discounted price and am very happy with it excellent night vision, very easy to set up for use with ipad. 
48 AAA+++ 
49 Very good camera. Works great!! 
50 a great little case to carry your Coolpix Camera around with you in the car or anywhere s. it protects it from damage that could happen if you just carried it everywhere without this case. Has a strap to carry it by too. 
51 love it 
52 Real easy mount to handlbars 
53 Perfect, exactly as described. 
54 They work great. I did not.use the cables that came with it 
55 I use regular mono audio cable. 
56 Just enough there so I don t drop the camera. 
57 Looks and feels like a great product arrived on time and was exactly how it was described haven t used it a whole lot but seems to work good 
58 Wow great filter very smooth rotation and really nice fit and finish super thin should work well on my Tokina 11-16. 
59 Love the color resolution of Ektar; again I am a free-lace professional photographer---went to the Nikon School of Photography---love experimenting with various formats 
60 I like the camera. It came with a nice package. 
61 It is what it s stated. The horn works great. 
62 lovee my lamp 
63 Works well enough, but it s a huge rip-off that this item doesn t include the velcro strap that holds it to your speedlite. It includes sticky velcro bits, but these would be stuck to your speedlite permanently and wouldn t allow for other, similar attachments (like a diffuser box). 
64 Battery charger works fine; cheaper than Fuji product. 
65 I couldn t be happier. 
66 Great item 
67 Kenneth was very helpful dealing with the problem that I was having with my 2 camera s. They are both up and running. The port forwarding is up and running also. Thanks again for the support. 
68 it s okay 
69 Exactly as expected. 
70 It is so nice to have a machine to take our old slides and negatives and make them digital! Nice quality. 
71 Very nice little camera 
72 It s ok. 
73 All the velcro comes off and my camera and gear gets jumbled. Great durability though! But terrible &#34;compartments.&#34; 
74 This is a great portable tripod. It s sturdy, and easy to use. 
75 I use this for my gopro.I loop it through the case hole which works reallywell the onlydonside is you cant attach it to anything else but then again if you are using a wrist strap you should be holding the camera anyway 
76 Pen Camera & Keychain Camera works perfectly and delivered on-time, Thank You 
77 It s ok 
78 They are a little different from my original battery but them make good back up batteries. 
79 Needed this for a larger lens I d purchased...great! 
80 Does what its designed for. Seller was great with customer service. One of the batteries died after 3 weeks. Big Mike sent me a new one free of charge. I did have to send the defective one back as proof but that s cool with me. Mike 
81 fit my light exactly 
82 perfect for the job. 
83 This fit my GoPro 3 waterproof case perfectly! It allowed me to securely attach a floating lanyard wriststrap on my GoPro for when I shoot hand-held at the beach or out in the surf at the ocean. 
84 Great product for the price 
85 Work great. Nice and bright. 
86 Works great, it brought life back to my older GoPro Hero 2 and the batteries last much longer than the original. 
87 Seems sturdy enough to handle what my son throws at it. Been on bike rides and under water and not treated lightly, yet holding up well. 
88 May not be real leather, but fits like a glove and classy looking. 
89 The product did not fit the camera body properly and was a waste of money. 
90 Amazing deal, and this works so much better than even the battery that came with my camera. 
91 so coool i got to get more usin this one to control the LEDs on my tool box 
92 This one is much better for someone with smaller wrist because this is some what adjustable. 
93 These batteries are better than the one that came with it. Very happy with this purchase. 
94 work as we were expected. 
95 Camera spins all around. Terrible extension pole. just by the &#34;GoPro&#34; made products. They are more expensive but the quality speaks for itself. 
96 Package came on time and works fine. 
97 Great replacement battery 
98 This is my 3 camera like this. Love it and have given to friends. While I have newer cameras, this is an excellent goto and carry camera. Easy to use and excellent results. Has everything and more on it. 
99 Product was missing POE injector. I ordered 5 none of them came with a free POE injector as mentioned in listing. 
100 Use it on my cell phone and Sony Action Cam. Kinda short but does the job, also build really sturdy. 
101 Awesome technology with a seamlessly integrated experience. Nest cam linked to Nest thermostat and tied to a mobile phone with IFTTT is the answer to all your home automation desires. 
102 Just perfect, works great. Get one and throw it in your camera bag. 
103 Everything was just as expected. Thanks. 
104 Great for the price 
105 Everything can be used on my hero 4 
106 Nice snug fit, yet easily removed. Perfect positioning on xe1. Nice finish. 
107 I lover it , nice camera , I recommend for any travel 
108 Easy to use ! Just a button 
109 All of my friend and family love it, Have a fun time with this instant camera Must have item in the party 
110 Small camera with great picture quality 
111 Works great 
112 made with high quality. No issues. 
113 Arrived quickly and works well. 
114 excelent 
115 I love the camera, works great in low light. I would not purchase from this seller again. 
116 Worked great holding my go pro 
117 A wonderful case. Well constructed and stylish. I m not sure it represents a value at over $100.00 though... 
118 works great as expected 
119 like camera a lot 
120 cameras are working great 
121 Good quality, covers all the basics. Very happy with the items 
122 Does what I wanted it for. Very pleased with purchase&#62;&#34; 
123 Works well. Doesn t last as long as the Nikon batteries, but far cheaper. 
124 Excellent shoe- very comfortable 
125 works well as expected 
126 Easy to use; load, unload, operate and keep dry. 
127 Works just as good as my D cell military issue 
128 This stabilizer is a piece of junk. Save yourself the trouble and just buy a glide cam. 
129 Awsome product you can t beat it 
130 its a fantastic addition to my camera. 
131 dosen t stick to the surface of my Jeep dash. 
132 Much larger than I thought it would be, can be awkward to have hanging on your neck strap, but it does hold the lens cap so I won t lose it. 
133 Great screen protector for the 5Ds even thought it can shift side to side just a little bit. Id recommend it to anyone. 
134 I ve used that can literally hold my Nikon D610 with its 28-300mm lens--now that s heavy. This thing is rock sold, light weight and easy to use. Get one. 
135 Excellent! Thank you!! 
136 When your hand can t seam to get it tight enough or your hands are greasy and slimy, this tool is a lifesaver to ensure that you GoPro Camera is tight! 
137 Works as advertized 
138 Excellent 
139 Wonderful pics. A perfect substitute for my Nikon coolpix... 
140 I m happy with it. Learning a lot. 
141 the kit was awesome, the camera bag, doubled as a hangbag in the evening. perfect size. all product was true to reivews and everything worked great. The condition of the ship was well packaged, I would recommend this highly 
142 Love this camera. Great to emsil photos directly from the camera. 
143 Nice camera! 
144 This camera conveniently stopped working just after the return period passed. Cheap, flimsy, and apparently breaks easily. Stay away from it! 
145 So far, so good compared to my carbon fiber props 
146 I use this all the time now. love it. 
147 I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. the frame is flimsy and I was not able to figure out how to use it. Am returning it. 
148 It s a nice strap, well made, strong, and comfortable, and it looks good too. I like the length of the strap but just me personally. I m sure an adjustable version of this strap will fit more people s needs. 
149 Works OK 
150 i love it...as expected 
151 Great quality... 
152 This didn t work! 
153 Allowed me to go from 52mm to 77 on Canon Lenses. 
154 The first time I used, one of the lights stop working 
155 fit perfect and works great for a Bullard T3 
156 Works flawlessly with Minolta MC lenses on Lumix GX1, as described. Thanks! 
157 It is impossible to use the camera without completely removing the upper part of the case. It s just to tight for flexible use. 
158 Best two dollars I have ever spent. It is very strong and fit on my tripod perfectly. It might not fit your tripod though, all are not the same! I would check the specs if they are available. Happy shopping! 
159 Great kit and seller 
160 Water got inside and I haven t been able to get it out. Other than that it s as advertised, floats well, would recommend. 
161 Seems to be very good so far. Great on eyeglasses and electronics. I like the large size, easy to use. Very pleased. 
162 Great battery 
163 Very good service. No issues with the battery. Very good alternative. 
164 The first set did not thread properly, i was sent another set with an adapter, once using that I can no longer use my lens cap. 
165 It doesn’t hold a charge as well as the Panasonic battery. 
166 bought these to hook thumb drives to for my clients.... what can I say... they are inexpensive... and they do exactly what they are made to do... good job 
167 Great product quality. The MagicFiber is very strong, yet soft. Product was exact as described and arrived early than we expected, as well great packing. Yes, will buy again. 
168 Works better than expected and easy installation. Motion detection with record works great. Catches my cat passing by. Speaking and listening features work well. 
169 Great 
170 Very high quality caps at a great price. What else do you want? 
171 This is really nice for small spaces inside for bouncing the light (instead of using a card to bounce off of). I ve since purchased a separate flash, but will keep this as a backup! 
172 Great filters to have on hand for some fun special effect shots to make your pictures pop out. Be creative and make special moments even better. 
173 Great seller! Great product! 
174 Good morning. How long does delivery in the box of this product. Thank you. [[ASIN:B00YX6KSS6 PowerLead PLD003 DV C8 16MP High Definition Digital Video Camcorder Dv DVR 2.7 TFT LCD 16x Zoom Hd Video Recorder Camera 1280 x 720p Digital Video Camcorder Camera Black]] 
175 Came really fast. Had no defects Im in love with this product:) 
176 Touch screen sensitivity not as good as a smart phone. Worsens when screen protector film is applied. 
177 top of the line. 
178 GREAT DEAL OVER ALL FOR THE PRICE. WOULD HAVE LIKE IT MORE IF THE PACKAGE CAME WITH MORE DETAIL ON LENS USEAGE 
179 Fair 
180 Have used the mask twice now and like it. 
181 Very happy with this purchase. Amazing quality and so easy to use 
182 Sometimes the camera will just fall off. So now we double check the tightness of the connection often. 
183 Nice clarity and adheres easily without any bubbles. No squeegee required. 
184 I was impressed with the quality. I usually buy Cowboy Studio products for short jobs or one time uses, but this backdrop setup is actually pretty decent. 
185 Exactly what I expected! 
186 Great lens! I like this package because it includes some freebies. The add ons are not great but they are free so no complaints. This is my go to lens. 
187 Very good quality, it fits perfect, very light but strong. 
188 great quality pic...easy to configure. 
189 This is my 4th Canon SX camera. I m pleased with the performance and also the battery life. I use cameras for work, I m outdoors, on roofs, in crawl spaces and in attics with or without any light source and the picture quality is very good. 
190 This monopod is perfect when you need to steady your camera for a shot, but you don t have the time to set up a tripod. The small size of the monopod makes it easy to tuck away until you need it. 
191 Worked perfectly in my camera. I needed additional batteries since I would be using the camera in the Grand Canyon for 10 days without a way to recharge the battery. Worked like a charm! 
192 Very useful 
193 Great replacement as it is also the original from Nikon come with the original box also. 
194 Don t hesitate to call customer service for help setting this up if you are having trouble. I fried one and called customer service and learned all kinds of goodies not mention in the instructions. 
195 ok 
196 Great quality, thank you 
197 Exactly what I was looking for 
198 awesome fluid head! bought it along with a K2 Slider, very sturdy and solid build! Super smooth pan and Tilt! 
199 a little flimsy, but works for my purposes 
200 love it 
201 Great product, was as described. Worked perfectly. 
202 box was partially crushed. cheap remote with NVR was cracked.no manual came with NVR and it appeared like it had been used before. 
203 Been a photojournalist way back highschool for the school paper but never really pursued photography after. I never thought i would spend this much but oh boy, i was so surprised when i got the package today, there was so much in it! great package deal! 
204 for some reason don t work 
205 Amazing case for my drone, all the accessories fit in the right place. Would recommend it to everybody who has a Dji Phantom 3 drone. 
206 Great product at a great price! 
207 It s nice and durable, snaps onto a belt buckle if you re hiking. Good buy, good deal. 
208 Good 
209 could be made more user friendly 
210 Works 
211 Great quality 
212 Martin Powell at Foscam was very helpful in setting up my camera. Tech support is great. 
213 love it works good for my needs and nice design. Thanks!! 
214 Really good product. Delivery on time, and is exactly they describe. 
215 Work great with my &#34;Chesty Mount&#34;. No complaints. Fast shipping. Good Price. 
216 Suprisingly simple yet effective protection. It is large enough for my Nikon D810 with the 24-120mm lens and lens hood (a sizable hood, reversed on the lens body) to fit snugly. 
217 The software will not download. I need to return it 
218 Fits and works perfectly. Really enjoy the stereo sound now when recording video 
219 Excelent! 
220 Love the way my photo equipment goes in to the bag, well made material, happy with the product 
221 Hello ....I highly recommend this product ...it is very nice aNd easy to operate and co portable for handy....everywhere I go I ll bring this with me and I hope I can get one of this to give it to my sister in ph..... 
222 No problems. Batteries are now charged and ready to use 
223 excellent ever 
224 So far i like it but am still learning all the different things it can do. the instruction guide is sadly lacking so I am using the hit and miss method. It does take excellent pictures 
225 Good transaction and a good product. 
226 awesome 
227 The film had a bubble in the center of the pack which shows up on the picture. Plus the film has a blue faded border 
228 It is not good quality,now it is not working!flash light on and any keys no function !i put it into my trash can ,it is unbelievable such kind of thing happened on Amazon! 
229 I CAN TAKE BETTER PICTURES WITH MY ORIGINAL SONY LENS THAN USING THIS PIECE OF GLASS. 
230 I LOVE this lens. I initially bought it to do indoor shoots but end up using it outdoor because it creates such beautiful photos! 
231 Excelente! 
232 Works filne 
233 I love my new camera! I shopped for a long time, read a lot of reviews, and this is the one I chose! It is easy to use and takes great pictures! 
234 Good and attractive. Clear pictures 
235 Perfect cheap and resistan 
236 Awesome sauce! Works great easy to use I go away a lot it saves the day every day compact good for almost everything 
237 Love it! 
238 it is worth it and I like lot of the tripod will use lots for outdoor like wildlife or landscapes thank for Amazon and the price awesome. 
239 Great Product! 
240 Really easy to use, light weight, and it helps you adjust the exposure which is great. Only downside is you use film up quickly so it s a good idea to stock up good thing the film is relatively cheap. Overall happy with my purchase 
241 Love it! 
242 No cameras!! So, I returned/replaced and what do you know? No cameras AGAIN!! Wth 
243 Pan head release lever broke within 6 months with minimal use. Unfortunately, past the refund date and I can t find a replacement part. 
244 Had a spec on the sensor easily removed by this blower. 
245 works good 
246 My pride and joy! 
247 Easy easy easy to use and fly 
248 Great starter dslr camera and extras. The tripod is nice. The filters are rubbish but everything else is great. 
249 A great accessory kit 
250 I actually buy these tanks just for the reels. The reels with the bigger loading ears are so easy to use. I have three of these and use them weekly. Highly recommend for 35mm or medium format processing. 
251 Vincent, was super in both helping me set up my cameras very professional, Cameras are great I have 5 foscam cameras with no problems!! great products!! 
252 Great for an extra wide angel lenses like my Canon 10-22mm. For extra wide lenses, you need a slim profile for such wide angles and good quality glass. 
253 This is an excellent set and delivers excellent quality photos and video. I also have a Sony A-58, and while I m not sure that this camera does a better job, can say that both are very good for the money. 
254 The case fits Phantom 3 perfectly. It s a must have to protect your investment. Also bought one for my brother and he loves it 
255 nice item need spares........ 
256 I thought it d be much better the straps were all too loose and you were unable to tighten it 
257 Looks real from a short distance. Exactly what I was looking for. 
258 Very Nice! These are great for low light conditions. They re a bit heavy for extended use without a tripod but the payoff is the light gathering power. 
259 THANKS 
260 Great product 
261 Worked as stated. 
262 This battery does hold its own. It is second to none in its class. 
263 I am pleased with the product thus far - the field of view seems pretty good. Vincent was great with helping me set this up on my wifi network. 
264 My grandson LOVED this camera and uses it regularly ! 
265 it s fine 
266 works well 
267 It s slow 
268 Awesome product works will for the price 
269 Did not fit my camera 
270 Cameras were too low rez. 
271 my favorite pouch 
272 Just what I needed! 
273 LOVE THIS!!! I use it for everthing from recording instructional videos to pool side shenanigans and boating fun! 
274 darn someone stole it....no wonder...a great camera 
275 This product is not for high shutter speed. its working fine only till 250/second S.speed. But SLRs usually have S.speed range of 4000 - 6000 per second. Thus this flash dismissed 
276 Takes great photos BUT never drop it. The camera fell from my pants pocket and never worked correctly again. Customer service from Nikon was very disappointing. I would never order another Nikon product ever. 
277 Camera picture is great, but significantly limited by constant dropping of wireless connections despite strong signal. Worse it then fails to reconnect without rebooting. Maybe a firmware upgrade will improve the situation, but hard to recommend as an outdoor wireless solution. 
278 I m just starting out with my DSLR caverage so I do not have tons of equipment but for what I do havery this has been perfect. Also travels well and has enough space for odds and ends without having to bring anew extra.bag for personals. Great purchase 
279 I just received today this item and is big, more than I was expected, is good for a camera, even a camcorder and most of the equipment, so if you are serious on photography this is it. 
280 great quality 
281 Very good, easy to use and charge. Presentable and keep charge very well. 
282 good experience dealing with this item. 
283 Got this for my gf. She loves it! 
284 Suitable for EOS M with 22 mm lens. Beware, it would not fit if you have a lens hood. 
285 They work well. You get a lot of them, the size is good, and they aren t that expensive. 
286 Works great! Took it out into he back country, had several other people take turns carying it on a long Mtn climb. They all commented on how comfortable it was! 
287 works just fine--and at a lower cost than Canon s. 
288 Tripod is crap, others fine 
289 Best video stabilizer I ve ever used. Great use anywhere and the price is very affordable. Thank God for this video stabilizer. 
290 Seems to charge drained battery fairly rapidly. Car charger a nice touch. 
291 Product arrived as promised. 
292 it is good 
293 works well for my needs 
294 So far everything works fine. 
295 Yes. Wish every camera had this. Works great, lightweight, protects the lens. 
296 Iphone 6 plus with a case is hard to fit and stay. 
297 first of all this tripod is 45&#34; tall not 50&#34; as advertised. It is also incredibly flimsy. 
298 Perfect compliment for my Sony mark II camera. This camera case protects very well my investment. 
299 What I needed. Thanks! 
300 PERFECT. 
301 They work really well 
302 fit GoPro wonderfuly and fit nicely into the flash hot shoe 
303 Took some time getting used to knowing when it was on or not but it worked great when I did. Used it for a youtube reality show where people compete in small challenges and it worked like a charm! 
304 Great than I think.. Just imagine 83x zoom... It s soooooooo amazing.. Attached image is full moon with 83x zoom.. Not cropped image.. Unbeliable~~!!!! 
305 Very nice tripod. I like the sturdy feel of it. 
306 Great deal on a terrific flash. 
307 Seems to have everything was looking for. Very pleased with the whole process. Certainly faster than ordering from the manufacturer. 
308 The power pack and charger is versatile enough to allow charging in many different situations. It definitely met all of my needs. 
309 The screen viewing angle was very poor. Also, the motion censor switched off the photo frame even when we were seated near by and we had no way of setting the time delay for the frame to switch off. Overall a poor design. 
310 This was really hard to figure out on which buttons to push. The instructions said the light would be one color and it was different on the pen. Not very good. 
311 I love this.excellent flash 
312 As good or better than the original GoPro Chest Strap. I am extremely satisfied with this product. My GoPro one wore out after a year of constant usage. This one feels like it will last longer. Well manufactured!! 
313 Didn t work!! Don t buy 
314 excellent product 
315 I can t believe this was rated as highly as it is. Everything about this is so cheap. The velcro and the panels all show up like eye sores in photographs. Even if I could iron out the creases it still wouldn t be useable. Really disappointed. 
316 The camera nice zoom great but cant get it to hook to wifi call and email kodak with no response i have other kodaks love them very dissapointed in the company lack of customer services 
317 Very smart design, makes life so much easier 
318 This is loud, but not incredibly loud. If you are in the same room it is loud. But we have ours downstairs and i am not sure it would wake us up if we were sleeping. The long cord on the ac adaptor is a nice feature 
319 Fits the bill 
320 [[VIDEOID:8a690c986214b35c86e6be7f1d1af04f]]I just bought one of these cameras and it is everything it says it is! I am completely blown away by the quality for the price! I highly recommend this little guy! I added a video from work that I took using this camera! 
321 The TX heat melted away my dashcam but it still works! Wow! 
322 Works good, already had a accident in mi dirt bike and resist the impact, but keeps working good !!! 
323 Still playing with it. some time is works and other times it does not. Once I know more I will make a more informed comment. 
324 Works very well. Only reason for the 4 stars, is that the dimensions are not perfect on it. One side is shorter in width then the other. Luckily the material stretches so I was able to make up the difference. 
325 Just like everyone says, it is so adorable 
326 Good product..... 
327 For some reason, this lens capp was very awkward to take off. I am hoping it will loosen and become easier to on-off the lens. 
328 The background is see through really doesn t work well with photography we shooting with our something dark in back of it 
329 As described and shipped fast! Thanks 
330 Saved my GoPro .... 
331 This is a horrible product! Do not buy! The image is distorted around the edges with no sharpness at all! I will be asking for a refund! Yes you get a wider angle but what good is it when you loose all sharpness around the edges! 
332 No problems with set up, self programed, easy. 
333 Hard to focus for pictures 
334 Terrible 
335 According to bhphotovideo.com, these cameras are only 0.3 MP CMOS. To me that means LOW resolution. No wonder the listed specs are so vague. It s a good buy if you are willing to settle for such low res imaging. 
336 great quality for the price. I gave it four stars because there is quite a bit of electronic feedback in the audio. 
337 Everything you need for a clean camera. I feel like there s way too many microfiber cloths but I guess too many is better than not enough. 
338 This product was bought as a gift. Their overall rating was a four out five. 
339 The case is a little small. I bought it for a Nikon S3000, which is a very small camera, but the case is a verrry tight fit. 
340 All items included as described. Seems to be a good starter pack. 
341 Works great. 
342 Amazing, it s so compact. Throws farther than expected. 
343 The strap is a little stiff, but much more comfortable than the stock camera straps that come with most DSLRs. The suede underside feels so nice against the skin that I hardly notice it on my neck. I ve received many compliments on the cute pattern as well. 
344 This was excellent, I was able to watch tapes that I thought I would never be able to see again. I was able to share these memories with my grandchildren. 
345 This head strap works well, the price is reasonable. 
346 Great package, exactly as stated on the website. Lens is fantastic ... a little stiff in movement but otherwise amazing 
347 Works as advertised. Simple and well made ! 
348 I like the go pro, it works great and no problems 
349 Everything was great for a month then 3 cameras went gray. I was also unable to view on my phone or computer. 
350 Awesome seller! Fast shipping and delivered as expected. Thank you 
351 The product works great!! Walter the support person is very professional and excellent support person !!! 
352 Excell 
353 Really good quality for the price your paying and just enough for the newbie photographer. with this set you can experiment a lot and then jump to a professional 
354 Great product - but I ordered the wrong one - so I gave it as a gift to a friend that could use it on their camera. Good price and product. 
355 Love this set of products, I will be purchasing from this company again. 
356 The camera is nice, but the battery really doesn t hold a charge for more than a day or so. 
357 Sound quality of the voice of the person wearing the pen sucks. Is not compatible with Windows 8. Besides that the return was seamless. 
358 Easy to set up and use via phone apps. Cannot zoom in browser app. 2-way audio and night vision work well. HD feed is nice. 
359 Great camera for the price. Now I can watch what my dog is doing when I m not home. 
360 Love the lids, but the accompanying literature is a little thin in substance. 
361 My sister loved this and I m really glad it s compatible with the Polaroid version too 
362 These are genuine DJI propellers and they work well. The only thing that differentiates these propellers from the ones included with the Phantom 3 is the stripes on the tips of the propellers. These propellers are ONLY for the Phantom 3 
363 Doesn t let adding network cameras, unless they are directly connected to NVR. Doesn t let you conveniently display just two feeds where the display is positioned vertically (1x2 grid). 
364 Came quickly. Was exactly as expected. Thank you. 
365 Like it 
366 It s a very good kit for your camera it has some of the filter essentials 
367 Excellent charger for the camera battery. I have passed the camera on to my granddaughter who is still using this charger. 
368 Cute border and great quality photos 
369 Works great! 
370 Hi, I bought this product and I did not get all parties. in the picture I show the items they got me and the product comes with more items. would like to know what happened to the other items that bring the product? Thank you. 
371 Nice 
372 Love it. I am so happy with how smooth and fast everything started and ended 
373 love this camera , had this same one yrs ago 
374 Exactly as described, works fine, no issues. 
375 Great bundle. I purchased early to use as a stocking stuffer for my teenager. The colors are beautiful and it arrived looking just as advertised. It came quick and neatly packed. 
376 The unit showed up in perfect condition. It was very easy to set up and we are enjoying the use of our new security camera system. This was a pleasant online shopping experience. 
377 Buy good one once rather than buying cheap again and again 
378 Very happy with my purchase and delivery was on time as well. 
379 Manfrotto rocks! Great and aesthetic tripod! 
380 She loved it! 
381 I have used these for a while with no problems. Its always good to carry spare batteries for your GoPros. I would recommend these products. 
382 Perfect! Great product, great price, great delivery! 
383 bad quality of video 
384 Great product! The quality of the plug and set screws was very good. I found them easy to use in both retrofitting an existing cable as well as a new one. Will definitely reorder them from IMBAPricewhen the time comes. 
385 This was a gift. She loves it! Excellent quality! 
386 Perfect. Fit like the originals. 
387 ok 
388 Fits great and helps with the glare without blocking the view. 
389 Yongnuo!! you are the best!!!! 
390 Works well for what I bought it other that the cord it s really short! 
391 Purchased for my daughter and it works just fine. If you are a power camera user, you might want to invest in a higher quality unit. For the casual user the quality is fine and should last a long time 
392 Just installed. Good product 
393 Good product. Fits in the frame differently than the real GoPro &#34;Frame&#34;. Still works as designed with access to the buttons. 
394 fits my d5200 perfectly 
395 Excelent 
396 Dead on arrival. Light comes on power converter but the camera will not power on. 
397 Buenisimo 
398 Initial shipments got lost... otherwise the replacement or second shipment arrived as Espected. Thank you.. 
399 Decent lenses to start off with, definetely had a lot of dust. The zoom ring is rather sticky. The focus ring is amazing. 
400 Seemed like a great deal for the money, but they didn t even last a full year. Both batteries have swollen slightly (as many cheap batteries seem to do) and don t fit inside my Fuji X-T1 any more. Pretty bummed. 
401 Great and sturdy tripod, glad I ordered it, highly recommend. 
402 This was such a bargain. Paid $57 on a lightning deal and the app that goes with it is fantastic as others have described. 
403 Better than Nest Cam...1/2 the price...no google.... 
404 This camera is great for the price. It is difficult to set up, but the customer service is very helpful! 
405 My daughter s graduation pictures came out beautifully and it arrived on time, you saved the day and beautiful memories for me and my family thank you. 
406 Not the best glass in the world but the closeup lenses do their job adequately. To the naked eye, the lenses do mot appear to be coated although Hoya claims otherwise. I recommend this product. 
407 Great quality. I was shocked at ho easy it was to setup. The app works great to login and view from anywhere! I will buy another one...or two! 
408 It works. 
409 a little heavier than I thought, but high quality and really save my shoulder. 
410 110% GOOD all the way 
411 Cheap. Plastic 
412 It love the strap. It takes a lot of pressure off my neck, especially with the heavier lenses. I like that the connection piece is metal, so I feel that it will remain sturdy for many years. 
413 Good camera. Just wish it would zoom out to a wider field of vision. 
414 works , good for the money 
415 This product is light weight and durable. Easy to setup and folds down into a very convenient travel size into the water proof carrying case. Great value, glad I bought it. 
416 Works as it s supposed to. 
417 Great camera. Best in class for the price - although I bought my body eight months ago at $550 and now a kit is $499 - I feel ripped off. 
418 Great item for a great price Angel Vidaurri 
419 Grandson was very happy with the stand 
420 Had it set on a time to run during the day. Stopped turning on after 3 months. 
421 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
422 This battery works well lasting two hours of non-stop time lapse. 
423 The microphone is not sensitive enough to be an effective baby monitor. Also the app that must be used with this camera is not very user friendly. 
424 Try to measure the LCD first before you buy any. 
425 I love it 
426 haven t tried it yet, its on the bike but haven t put my cam on it and went for a ride yet. 
427 Nice strong transmitter would buy again 
428 I love it! And real leather so it s awesome :) I really recommend people buying this case because it looks cool and it protects your Camera. 
429 It worked well and even though I lost a motor in a crash. I recommend this for beginners. I m very happy that I installed them. 
430 It s a good clock for telling time, but not for spying. 
431 Great camera bag. Plenty of space for my EOS plus all 3 lenses and a digital camcorder. 
432 Henry was very helpful. He set everything up for me and it only took about 15 min. He also showed me how to set up and use the app on my phone. This is a great camera. 
433 Does not fit go pro 4 black like advertized ended up breaking my 499 dollar camera trying to make it fit-- horrible do not reccomend 
434 Gave me the confidence that our new underwater camera would not be lost while snorkeling. 
435 thanks 
436 Perfect solution for additional backup power for my nikon dslr. More than double the price of the no name aftermarket brands available, but it does work as described. 
437 A really great way to carry your camera safely while on the trail. I recently spent a week in the mountains and this carrier made the hiking so much more enjoyable. Highly recommended. 
438 Rock solid but HEAVY. I m 6 1&#34; and can comfortably take photos without extending the center column - I only have to lean a little. With the column fully extended, the camera platform is at forehead height 
439 I m 11 years old and I love making movies. This tripod works great for me because of it s adjustable hight and the travel bag it came with. With a cheap price it s easy to afford and totally worth your money. 
440 The excellent reviews here helped me decide.I am loving this camera for the low price and excellent quality photos. Pros and those with tons to spend may want to look elsewhere. 
441 Filter has a factory blemish in the glass. Just a small speck but who wants another speck in the picture. 
442 Very versatile. 
443 Good 
444 I have always used Cleaning Cloths and these are the best. 
445 Fantastic lens in every respect. Highly recommend this over other lenses that cost a lot more. 
446 packaged very nice, so many accessories for the deal! 
447 I m a novice, so I cannot say much about this from a technical standpoint. But I was able to use it with no problem, even having never touched a telescope before. 
448 Affordable they last more than the original batteries from my Sony a7s 
449 This are premium microfiber cloths at a terrific price. The delivery was extremely fast. 
450 Nothing worked. Returned. 
451 I read several review s before my purchase. The Canon 7D MK2 is phenomenal! 
452 Perfect, exactly as described. 
453 Everything is as advertised. Great product. 
454 Solid charger, came with a car adapter attachment which is great! Charges at what seems like an average rate based on my experience. Removable plate may come in handy if I get another camera or device that uses similar batteries. 
455 It is a perfect fit for my Sony DSC H20. It started working instantly. 
456 Good battery extended flight time 
457 great 
458 very fast 
459 works good 
460 Great for the price. However it came with no instrustions 
461 Excellent camera, superb crisp images and video. Multiple functions are easy to use and set up took only minutes, Best FPV camera of the year and the price makes it a great value too. 
462 Rugged and not bulky. Great protection. 
463 perfect size for all the accessories and nice padding to keep everything safe! 
464 Top quality product at a fraction of Canons price. Works great, with good build quality. You won t be sorry. 
465 As advertised. 
466 excellent. batterys hold better charge then I expected. 
467 Its a little small no extra doom in the bag 
468 Awesome!!! Great camera. Great price. 
469 My best purchase on Amazon!! I had been wanting a new camera for a long time. Totally impressed with the items that came with my bundle. Well packed so everything arrived safe. 
470 I install cameras for a living and this is the best camera for the money I have seen so far. The price point is incredibly low for good quality and a respectable assortment of features. 
471 Just as described online. Good buy 
472 I ve had this for a while now. Live it and it has never given me a problem! 
473 Wow, it s pretty great. Batteries charged quickly and lasted for a good length of time. And 2 for a great price. Now I don t need to listen to my husband complain about needing another battery. Thanks for the extra goodies too. 
474 Excellent for leveling a tripod. Would be great if they provided instructions on installation. 
475 Worked great! This is a great selfie stick. It s very compact and kind of folds into itself. Pairing with my phones bluetooth was super easy and took less than a minute.Worked great!It extends a good amount, and so now I can take selfies without the awkward angles. 
476 Love the pix star frame. I have bought many of these frames for gifts. Everyone loves how easy it is to set up and send emails to the frame. 
477 Awesome 
478 Very nice 
479 Incredible! A pleasure to look at. My husband and I spend a looong while on my daughter s bed just mesmerized by it. Strong and delicate at the same time. Easy assembly. Larger that one may imagine. 
480 Thanks 
481 Nicely made, works perfect. 
482 works as expected 
483 thing broke 
484 Flys very well. Arrived on time. 
485 Having a great time shooting with this lens. Easy to use and produces great shots! 
486 Excelente 
487 Great price. Time will tell if the quality is good. 
488 A complete waste of money. All photos are blurry. Shutter speed is too slow. Either spend more money and purchase a high quality waterproof camera or use a disposable underwater film camera. 
489 Works as advertised. Carries good amount of photo equipment - like the removable padded &#34;box&#34; that allows the backpack to convert to just a backpack if needed, and the zippered access from the back. 
490 Works just like I needed it to! Was really happy for the extra long cord as I work mainly with children, families, and pets which can be quick to run off in any direction! 
491 Item was as described and included all of the parts listed. Everything worked, and I am very happy with my purchase. 
492 It is a great product and it came to my door very fast 
493 good 
494 All you can Be! A+++++++ 
495 It is awful and a big mistake to buy such item 
496 Just as I expected. 
497 Great zoom, average quality, good for the price 
498 Unfortunately, I m still trying to play with the camera. It s very simple to use but I have not made the time to do so. The price is right. Have fun with it. 
499 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
500 The film only works at night time. Very disappointed. 
501 Great 
502 This was one of the best products I have ever bought yet. I had to sell my siblings, house, and car to buy this but it was worth it. Jk about selling my siblings. 
503 Everything was as advertised. Thanks so much.... 
504 The video quality is great. The use of the microphone could be better. It doesn t always work. 
505 Great for the price! Even better I d say! Highly recommend! 
506 Henry took care of my camers very professionally. He was very nice and pleasant in helping me with problem. 
507 Works great with my Peak Design camera mount. 
508 Light, yet sturdy, this support system holds my heaviest backdrops without sagging in the middle. 
509 Works well, good quality but hard to avoid having bubbles. 
510 Note: this does NOT work with the DMC-TS6 camera. DMW-BCF10PP --&#62; this battery DMW-BCF13PP --&#62; what the TS5 and TS6 need (I can t erase my review, so I figured this is the least I can do to make it useful!) 
511 Good case. 
512 excellent seller and terrific sale - very fast shipping! A+ 
513 Nice 
514 Inexpensive and doing the work. 
515 Works OK, great power, but it overheats too quickly 
516 Stay away if you have a mac. No support whatsoever. I am savvy and wasted the better part of a Saturday only to have &#34;no cloud camera was found&#34; with the green lights and WPs installation failing, Stay away from this product! 
517 Worked perfectly with my Nikon DX AF-S NIKKOR 18-55mm GII. 
518 Though we have not used this article, it looks like good quality and was delivered on time. It is what we were looking for. We look forward to using it on a beach trip this month 
519 Impressive. Much better than expected. Other software available on Internet to allow this to be used with OSX. 
520 This battery is amazing! It lasts double the time as my normal battery from canon!!!! 
521 Good 
522 Works well, but the clip is about 3mm short of centering the lens on the HTC One M8. 
523 Great Price. They work great. easy to install. I will buy them again 
524 perfect adapter 
525 first one arrived broken, unable to shoot pictures, sent it back and quickly received another one. Works fine so far! My daughter loves it! 
526 Awesome system, I love that I don t have to walk over to my lights to adjust the settings. 
527 Wow didn t even come with all the pieces!!! What a shame I want my money back 
528 Well done cables. 
529 very good 
530 Fitted perfectly 
531 The screen protector fit perfectly, was easily installed, and looks good. 
532 Arrived on time and as described. 
533 It s nice to have something recognizable in all the extra stuff laying in a camera bag. A quick look at this sleeve and I know where my filters are. Pouch is a durable strong material. I don t see this falling apart any time soon. 
534 This is OEM so obviously it is good. 
535 Just like new. Works perfect. Touch screen can be difficult to use but that is normal for this model. Clear pictures, wifi and 12x zoom more than make up for it. 
536 Poor build quality and optics are poor but better than the 20-80 version. You get what you pay for. I gave them away along with the 20-80 version and bought Zeiss which are vastly superior in optical and build quality. 
537 Does everything it is suppose to do. 
538 Cable didn t work with LaView LV-KDV0404B5B cameras. 
539 As advertised. 
540 Works as described. A bit hard to install but great customer support. Main issue was Chrome browser not supporting NPAPI plug ins and needed to install newest Java version on Firefox. C6724021. 
541 Had issues trying to update firmware. Also found it not staying completely leveled when transitioning from option 2 to option 1. Had to re-calibrate often by turning on and off. 
542 The product performed exactly as advertised and met my needs very well. 
543 so far so good. sometimes it turns on by itself when it s in my purse - but i put it in a sun glass case to make sure the button doesn t push down accidentally. 
544 Good product 
545 Looked off, and it is a weaker model than the standard nitecore battery. This one is a 650 and normally they are 750. 
546 I like this light .. however where is the diffuser cloth that it said it came with???? 
547 Ok camera for the money. Had problems with the battery door. If you drop the camera you blow up the door hinge. 
548 Item is as described and works great. Prompt delivery. 
549 Perfect complement to the classic model 
550 Works perfectly with an F Stop Kenti 
551 Amazing camera and highly recommended for a beginner camera. Top notch experience with the seller as well, would buy again. 
552 Finally found what I needed! When on vacation I carry my camera everywhere. It is aggravating to carry camera and a purse. This works perfect. Has plenty of zippered sections to put everything in. 
553 The battery fits perfectly and is working like a champ. 
554 Great 
555 Advertises 12 patterns, but v only has one 
556 Can t have enough charged batteries on hand. This is great. 
557 Works like a champ! Just yank out the plastic blank, insert this and you ve got Z wave on a non-Zwave electronic Kiwkset lock. Frankly I m stunned that it was so easy. Thanks to Kwikset for the upgrade path. 
558 Greatly improves my lighting. Easy to use and store, with sufficient quality to use casually. Can t speak to its durability because of how frequently I use it, but don t see why it wouldn t last if used by the casual photographer. Great value. 
559 For $12 you get two batteries, plus a good quality fiber cloth. It shows how much it means for this company to deliver the best to it s customers. 
560 Super cute and fits in regular sized bags which is convienet. Buy extra film cause you re going to want to use this everywhere. 
561 Package arrived in good shape and as expected. Fits my Canon Rebel XSi and the rear caps fits all of my Canon lenses. 
562 i like how it clips 
563 I had to replace it after one month. 
564 I believe this is the same mic from Teelec for $17. It s ok but poor isolation means it picks up everything. If you don t need stereo the Tackstar is cheaper, has better isolation, sounds better, and uses aa batteries. 
565 Purchased this for my son, he loves it!! 
566 Lovely case. Holds the camera and memory card...and sometimes my keys 
567 Perfect fit and service! 
568 Everything seems fine. Battery charged up, fits camera. 
569 I like the tripod it s not heavy at all and I am 5 ft 90lbs. 
570 Fits great with out FZ200. 
571 Great reference quick easy and easy to understand 
572 Now I just have to learn how tho use it 
573 Love this camera. So much to learn about it. Going to take a photography class and hope to learn a lot more. 
574 This bag can hold the Nikon D60 and accessories and other &#34;bits&#34;. It is a super-fine camera bag!! 
575 Amazing that the battery area isn t big enough for the batter and you can t close the cover to the battery area. This is a poor design for this. 
576 It was great for a couple of hours then it broke at the point attached to the holder. I superglued it. After a couple of weeks it broke again. 
577 Batteries are rated at a higher level then the camera maker s battery and at a fantastic price. They charge up and run just like the OEM unit at less than 1/4 the price of a new Canon batter. Totally satisfied. 
578 design is sleek However, the overall illumination is much lower than earlier generation products 
579 Absolutely a wonderful product. Had no issues yet and really enjoy having the mobile app on my device for monitoring. 
580 Sturdy, strong and light. Keeps the camera pretty safe. No issue with the quality. 
581 Nice set, especially for the price. And bigger than I thought it would be. 
582 This works as advertised and has held up well in both the sun and rain. 
583 I works perfectly for what I need to do, which is use pro microphones with my Nikon D750 and D810 cameras. 
584 great starter drone,the pictures and video are unmatched for the price and so easy to fly(I have two now.) thanks. 
585 Very durable. 
586 Plastic is a bit cheap, but it works great. 
587 Was a gift, she uses this all the time, but was disappointed that not instructions came with this. Had to go on line and figure out where to locate them and get them/ 
588 I received 1 defective camera of 4 and that happened because the cable that comes out from the camera was broken due to the way it came in the box. 
589 Unit works fine. Instruction manual almost impossible to understand. 
590 No instructions. can t be too sure how it works. Useless to me. Without instructions, money wasted. 
591 Thanks, just what we needed! 
592 Love this! Took it all over Cancun through sinkholes and zip lines hundreds of feet without a worry! 
593 Smaller than expected. 
594 These are so much fun!! They go on the camera and come off easily. Make such a cute pic! 
595 This reflector works great speacially in the sunset it gives a really shining light to the person face 
596 Everything fits great. Light weight as well. Just watch the foam as you close it up. 
597 Gosh I love these lights. Lights like this can be super expensive but these are actually fairly cheap and offer some really nice light. Not the best build quality but hey Im in it for the lights and this delivers!! 
598 Nice case however it needs to be wrapped around a fairly beefy belt/strap for the loop on the back to really hold it in place 
599 Works great, nice clear video and not much vibration 
600 I used this for a baby video monitor. It was really easy to install and adjust. I tried another monitor mount a few years ago and hated it, this one worked perfectly, I couldn t be happier! 
601 It works well for protecting the lens while not affecting the quality of the pics on my Sony Action camera. I just wish it was more simple to put on the camera. 
602 The color s beautiful and it s holding up really well so far. I do wish the faux-leather pieces were thicker. Just looks a little flimsy and doesnt hold the pattern as well as advertised. 
603 Works good with all the working parts 
604 I had been wanting to try one for awhile. It was easy to figure out how to use. A little cord plugs into the auxiliary jack and then the handle extends. Takes good pictures! Works as promised. 
605 I have several D-link Cameras more versatile and easier to use than order surveillance this is a good upgrade. Wish it came in White ! 
606 Cheap product. 
607 Piece of junk. Maybe yours will work, but mine didn t right out of the box. On the plus side, they gave me a refund and told me to just throw it out. 
608 as expected.. great lens protection 
609 Great buy. Works perfectly, and even controls focus with half press. Outstanding. 
610 Plastic, but functional and will allow SONY product to use GO PRO Accessories. Price is very reasonable. Came direct from China, so a bit slower on delivery than other products ordered same date. 
611 Works great with my Canon 60D 
612 It s a good kit; however, the SM card is not compatible with the GE DVX1080 P pocket video camera 
613 Good quality batteries, fix perfect on my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-TX30. I am very happy with it :) 
614 Works great for my spray dog collar 
615 👍 
616 Absolutely no instruction on how to attach this mini soft box. After a few minutes of cursing the companies name, it dawned on me. Works very well. 
617 It works great!! Thanks 😊 
618 It Works...... 
619 It is nice to have the GoPro attached to the head, instead of chest, so the camera swivels with where you are looking! 
620 I expected a waterproof screen cover 
621 This is a super high quality dash camera. I am very happy with my purchase. Highly recommended to anyone that is in the market for a premium camera. Highly recommended!!! 
622 Good item. It doesn t make my hand sweat. I liked the material, really soft and comfortable. Fits my eos 5d M3. 
623 Battery has long life and charges well. No issues at all with my Canon 5D. Recommend the seller Indie Camera Gear as I received the battery quickly and they followed up with a nice personal email. 
624 I purchased tve as backups yo my original. 
625 works as described. 
626 &#34;love&#34; maybe not a strong enough word for this thing... after lugging around a really heavy manfrotto aluminum version.... 
627 Very good beginners slr camera. Very light weight and small. 
628 Great little air duster. Was extremely useful in getting an annoying hair off the mirror of my T3i. 
629 Great film. Overpriced however.. 
630 This camera is easy to set up. It works great as described. 
631 A bit too easy to fly 
632 So far they work great Item came when promised 
633 They re very cute and fit my camera lens perfectly!!! 
634 Clean clear picture, works great! 
635 Love it. Am able to spotlight Egrets in trees from about 50 yards away now in very low light. Recently got some shots of Purple martins nesting by the thousands from maybe 25 yards. See attached photo. 
636 works like original 
637 Worked fine! Just like you at a great price. 
638 Very smooth! Wish it included a 3/8 screw but I was able to pick one up at Lowes for 68 cents so its all good. 
639 this is a very high quality lens, works great with my d5300! 
640 Great. I am a food blogger but can take pictures mostly at night because I work during the day. With this box my pictures are really beautiful, seems professional! 
641 This product appears that it will do a great job for the price. 
642 Superbly designed and made. A must for DSLR users and/or photographers shooting with long lenses. This is my second one! I just returned from a two day air show and wearing two bodies with these made it comfortable and provided more functionality. 
643 Great product! 
644 It is perfect was here so fast loved it. 
645 I order a at least one pack of these every year, to keep in my camera bag. These are great quality, and a great deal! A nice touch is the email I receive from the company, after I order, to make sure that I am pleased with my purchase. 
646 This microphone is amazing..... Even brighter and stronger than dual lavaliers!! 
647 Fast delivery very nicely packaged! Impressed with how fast it charged up..very neat lil camera looking forward to recording video on motorcycle trips!! 
648 Good product 
649 Go pro kicks ass. 
650 Great. 
651 can only say nothing but great things about this! Love the footage I get when my dog plays fetch or goes swimming! 
652 Great 
653 works as described 
654 Very versatile lens. Perfect for travelling. You don t have to carry different lenses because the range of this lens is excellent. It could be a little faster (e.g. f2.0), but then the price would go up substantially. Works very well with Canon 60D. 
655 This Newtonian reflector telescope itself was quite good, unfortunately the geared adjustment assembly mounted below the scope never did quite right; making it very frustrating. Once the reflector is in position however, this reflector provides outstanding images of our earths moon. 
656 Microseven has very decent security IP cameras.Their support to fix issues is very reliable. I highly recommend their cameras for lower cost solution. 
657 Pleased with service and product. 
658 I find this to not be one of the most comfortable straps depending on the application, but that is not a fault of the clip necessarily. The mount works exactly as expected and I have no issues or concerns with it otherwise. 
659 HORRIBLE CAMERA. Takes decent photos outside but if you plan on taking photos inside be prepared to be hugely disappointed. Really disappointed with the quality of this camera. Len s cap wouldn t even stay on. 
660 did the job 
661 Minimal use so far but seems to work as needed. 
662 Meets all my needs very reliably and in quite good detail with the new camera. 
663 It works perfectly! It s easy to take and easy to use. Really love it! 
664 Amazing results. Now, the sky comes out blue with white clouds... Most so called Pro photographers do not use this product and the sky looks white on thier pictures. Our sky is not white... Nice product. 
665 in love with my camera brings 2 lenses which makes perfect 
666 Satisfied with this purchase, camera works fine. 
667 Amazing love it it fits my camera with lens 18 -55 on , a macro tube on The other side And a led light , it also have two little pockets that you can use to put some memory or extra battery, My camera is a nikon d3300 
668 This is great! Works for intended usage. Be aware the tripod should be handled with care to avoid any accidents with breaking it. 
669 great camera, now I want the newest version 
670 Love it 
671 Does not work! My router does not even see this guy and I have a powerful Trendnet AC1900. Used different freq. it s useless. Returning. 
672 hopefully I will not have to use this, but I feel safe having it..Thanks 
673 Great set, great quality, reasonable price. 
674 Look real and easy to install 
675 video is really clear and it is great for watching your house or child while away! 
676 nice 
677 Fits my monopod 
678 Works for long exposure photography. You would want to use this in low light situations. It works as it should. 
679 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
680 A extra battery for Nikon Coolpix AW 130 
681 Bruh this thing lit 
682 Very Good Product 
683 Haven t tried everything yet, but good so far 
684 ok 
685 nothing to say about pelican 
686 worth the money good quality 
687 Perfectly 
688 I used it on my astro master 70 and I was very impressed on how simple and fast I could see through it,,although I had to use with it the adapter that comes with my telescope so I can mount it on 
689 No more hitting the wall! Love it. 
690 Wow the best cams ever for the price super clear image and night Vision is super clear at night 
691 Should have a quick release rod system, very annoying to take off or move. Also does not have much height so if you have a battery grip, it will reach none of your lenses to support, even big telephotos like me 70-200 f/2.8L. Solid metal construction. 
692 The best way to carry and protect my Phanton III..... 
693 Purchased it for my 13 year old daughter. She really likes it. 
694 Excelent !! 
695 Great pages for updating my photography files Easy to use and good protection for the files. 
696 Great case! Holds everything I need and I don t have to remove the prop guards every time I m done using my drone. 
697 Works as intended, feels sturdy. Didn t end up working for me...sigh. 
698 It was supposed to be a product that when you put it on there d be no air bubbles. Not so. I tried several times. Air pockets formed every time. At least the LCD is protected. 
699 This item arrived quickly and in excellent condition. It was exactly as the way it had been described - a great complement to my new camera. 
700 good 
701 As a step up from the stock lens that came with my Canon T3i, you can definitely see a difference. Great zoom, clarity, aperture, and low price. Plus arrived SUPER FAST! 
702 This micro phone with a pre amp picks up slight audio noises. Becarful what you hear you may not want to know. 
703 You have to go online to get directions on using the camera. I m still learning all the in s and out s but the camera is a good one. And you can use a regular SD card in it, so that s good. 
704 Works great; a good value; just as good as a name brand 
705 Great case. As described. 
706 ok for the price,not a great camera 
707 GREAT PRODUCT - GOOD FAST SHIPPING - THANKS 
708 We ve found this works well for our baby monitor, allowing us to mount it on the corner of the crib, and to move it if necessary. 
709 This little thing is great, takes pretty good photo and video 
710 Not a big fan of the clear finish so this matte finish works great. Fits perfect! 
711 It didn t work for my Sony digital camcorder.. 
712 Info says the battery meter will recognize this pack, but it doesn t. It s fine for a spare. 
713 That s ok 
714 Love it thus far. Works as expected. 
715 It was awesome for the 1 hour it worked, then one of the rotors stopped working and that was that. Great fun for the little time it worked. Other than that get another drone that won t crap out on you. 
716 these batteries are for my Arlo wireless system. Exactly the same as came with cameras. 
717 works great 
718 does what it was advertised to do. 
719 The best deal. Good quality and fast delivery. Everything fits my GoPro hero 4 housing 
720 doesn t work very good 
721 great quality 
722 Just ordered this past week. works well, charged both batteries. Like the fact that it includes a DC adapter, it will be very handy on a long road trip. Very good price for an excellent product. 
723 The video quality is acceptable 
724 This case fits my Canon EOS Rebel SL1 with 18-55mm lens perfectly. The only shortcoming is that there is scant space for accessories. I can put two spare batteries in the front pocket but there is no place for a filter. 
725 Excellent product. I recommend it 100%. 
726 Good Gift. This camera case is great for the right size camera. 
727 Outstanding glass!! Not only does this lens compete with the &#34;big boys&#34;, but, in my opinion, beats the C**** 100mm/2.8 in many aspects, including flat field sharpness. The AT-X 100mm/2.8 is a contender that is worth your consideration. 
728 Works great for analog security cameras,( my application) 
729 Great when you just need that extra lens. Lots of times I don t want to carry my camera bag but want two lenses. This is small and does the trick. Perfect for street photography and outside events. Holds lens securely 
730 Works perfectly with the Panasonic FZ200. Easy set up. Will work through a closed glass window for those nature shots. 
731 I was having problems with upgrade firmware on my DVR. I called Tech support and spoke with Chris L. He helped every things what i needed. He is very great customer service. Thank you !!! Chris L. 
732 Just what I needed for my camera! 
733 I really liked this but I never got all the bubbles out. 
734 I wish I’d found this battery sooner. I’ve been looking for a cheaper BMCC power supply and this seems to be the least expensive out there. Also, it fits nicely on my rig and lasts a long time. 
735 The screen can crack easily, but it definitely works under water. Took mine to some whale shark dives; very pleased. My pictures were definitely better than the rentals the resort offered for underwater photography. 
736 It didn t work for me. Tried it with a Sony NEX7 and Canon lens and had mixed results. I could never get the autofocus to work. 
737 Great and strud for a DSLR, but the knobs/caps get loose over time. 
738 Glass screen came off after first use. Can t turn it off and it seems the connection might be intermittent since it seems to mess the shutter presses every 4-5 clicks. 
739 the advertise 53X was wrong, it is only 40X optical zoom ! 
740 does what it says, takes great pics. 
741 Very big set of GoPro Hero accessories, it includes everything you will need to use on your GoPro Hero camera adventures. Highly recommended kit. 
742 Best Camera ever I love it Great for indoors in low light Wish there were more lenses for it 
743 Everything it says it is. 
744 Excellent product 
745 Doesn t work I ve tried every battery even the orginial and the new once many times and it doesn t work 
746 Super fast delivery, and everything came as described. 
747 Ok 
748 I bought those 2 cameras and I only received ONE camera instead of 2. 
749 Excellent Camera as the picture quality is beautiful. Pointed at my front gates and no one is getting past those gates without being recorded. There is barely any light out in that area but the night vision is incredible. I would buy again if another is needed. 
750 Very good so far, but very expensive compared to others 
751 very cheap, but then again they are very fake 
752 The button doesn t click easy and there for it takes a long time to take a picture. Then it is hard to not have a blurry picture. 
753 Came in extremely fast! Awesome packaging! Great build and design. Feels good in my hands. So happy I went with this! 
754 Worked as expected. Not as hard to do as I thought. Used on a very dirty d7100 sensor. 
755 Very good works well on windshields 
756 I wear it as a headband. Comfortable; absorbs sweat & keeps me cool. Great in the car with the windows down. 
757 The head swivels very loosely. 
758 For the price it is the beat photo backpack in Amazon. Can not be beat. Many cushioned pockets for lenses and accessories, comfortable straps, scooped up the last one but hoping it will be in stock soon. 
759 Great product, great price! 
760 Doesn t fit the Sony HDR-cx900 
761 great camera, makes a great gift. 
762 Just what I needed for the video camera my father-in-law gave me as he did not have a charger. 
763 good 
764 Exactly what I needed 
765 Good price. Good quality. No problems. 
766 Great bag for my needs 
767 I bought this charger for my Canon SC280 camera. I was very pleased with the value and it works great. I would buy it again. 
768 This drone is an excellent buy. Easy to fly, easy to repair, fast, and decent FPV. Much more fun if you buy the charger that can charge 5 batteries at a time and purchase the extra 5 batteries. Also happy I bought extra propellers and guard. 
769 Good price, good quality! 
770 Performs like the original go pro battery at fraction of the price. 
771 As described except one of the light bulbs which was included was burned out. 
772 can t wait to use on vacation, I only had one battery and this is a great buy for the money. 
773 On time elinry and great srvice 
774 Ok for very short distance 
775 Canary is so perfect for me and my family, easy to use, reasonably priced, and working great. 
776 Just Great! 
777 It s OK. I just wish I had something to put in it. 
778 Excellent item 
779 I don t have anything else to say. 
780 works great 
781 Can t wait to put this to use in my classroom. 
782 It s a great little printer. So fun! Perfect for pics to add to my planner and record memories of the day. 
783 This is great for the added security needed for your GoPro and it really works great! The installation was easy and you really need the adhesive to set before using this in the water. 
784 SImply put, ...cheap ...cheap ...cheap. Don t waste your funds on this. 
785 as Described Very Pleased with my Order Thank You!!!!!! 
786 Telescoping part is very loose, makes phone spin around. Piece of garbage. Bought at Ross for 5.99 
787 Great system 
788 Package arrived quickly. The lens is great 
789 The ad needs to state that the batteries are not included but great product great price 
790 Perfect for filming when I needed great sound quality! 
791 Works great light easy to maneuver and my iPhone 6 + fits perfectly 
792 Great tripod. Lightweight and easy to use. Good price form Prime members with free shipping 
793 Worked perfect. Good price! 
794 As advertised. 
795 great 
796 Perfect size for the Canon Powershot SX700 for which I bought it. 
797 Excellence. I have 2 of these and five batteries. I cycle through them while recording. Never run out of power. 
798 Totally AWSOME! 
799 Really good product. Fast shipping. Everything fine 
800 I loved it 
801 Great! 
802 Faulty dial for the shutter button, just within a couple weeks of ordering this new camera the dial just fell off. 
803 Only complaint I have is that they re a bit difficult to put into the binoc mounts. Also, they could be a bit longer to make it easier to clip on the strap. 
804 The camera is better than I expected. It is smaller, lighter and shoots better video. I am really impressed. I haven t used a GoPro but I cant imagine the quality can be exceedingly better to warrant the 4-10x price difference. 
805 cute 
806 Works great! 
807 I lost my Nikon remote and got this one. Performs great. 
808 I love this top handle. So much better than the Honu handle I had for the GH4. 
809 The batteries held their charge for a full day of picture taking and sightseeing. They charged quickly and without issue in the charger. The included adapter for the European plug was extremely helpful. 
810 arrived on time and quality is excellent! 
811 No Problems 
812 Fun little device ! 
813 In terms of the quality of the product - it is exceptional and by far has the best image quality Sound was good as well 
814 Used this for 2 years and couldn t be happier!! very durable. I have used it in fresh and salt water. Great buy! 
815 great service, great price, superb product 
816 works well 
817 A deal for such a cool lil lense 
818 lightweight, and all the features an amateur photographer needs. 
819 Great product. Great seller! 
820 works great 
821 Works great! 
822 ok 
823 Great slider for professional video work. 
824 It works and is the same as the real Manfrotto ones. 
825 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
826 Great deal and service 
827 👍 
828 It works to charge my bateery and I got it pretty fast. 
829 the product is great so far but the service was better. 
830 Very nice battery. Holds a very good charge. 
831 Be careful - reviews of this plug said &#34;Loved it for my QFlash&#34; = well, I didn t look closely enough, and it only has two prongs, my Quantum T5D needs three. 
832 Have been charged several times due to vacation and birthdays. Have held a good charge and long use of each battery. Will buy more before the Holidays. 
833 good product, It works very well. 
834 Had a cheap one that rattled and made me feel like the lens was going to fall off. This one is PERFECT! Sturdy and you can t beat it for the price! Great Buy! 
835 Arrived on time, great quality, I needed only 2 but it is better to have them handy. 
836 Great filter. It is very solid and well built. This is the second filter I have bought from Breakthrough and I definitely recommend them. 
837 you will get good wide angle view but in spite of adjusting all the exposure parameters, you will not see details in image. Details and sharpness is very poor. You will see lot of reviews which will say great value for price but image quality is very poor. 
838 It take great pictures and many features 
839 Great product 
840 great 
841 Everything fits perfectly into the case. Gives you room to have 5 batteries (1 in drone +4) and pocket for tablet. 
842 The product came with broken buttons for the up and down menu options. Also the watertight cases power/ mode button was broken. A quality control issue but I was still bumbed out because I wanted to use it right away. Will order another one and then do another review. 
843 Affordable mount for gopro camera BUT the screw does not keepmyour camera in th angle you want 
844 Excellent camera for the money! 
845 it is ok Does not activate far enough away and does not stay on long enough Ten feet to activate motion 
846 pricey but worth it much easier to hold the camera. 
847 It s a little small. But that s just me. This is probably more intended for essential gear you need to take with you. 
848 This is a great finder. Easy to use due to the erecting prism. I really like the cross hair patern. 
849 Got them pretty quick and they work great and easy to instal 
850 Perfect Fit 
851 good product 
852 the camera seems good but some of the accessories parts missing and not compatable. The camera is top heavy on the tripod. It tilts down no matter how much it is tighten. There was buckle missing on hand held grip. do I have any recourse? 
853 Will return to seller. 
854 Vincent was patient and awesome! I highly recommend the product and customer service! 
855 Muy Bueno 
856 A great buy. Cheap bag 
857 Super cute and good quality! 
858 Works great. 
859 Perfect. Good atention and delivered on time. 
860 This is a good grip for medium weight cameras but if u run lots of add ons like light mic and monitor the weight can be thrown off a bit but all the extra thread points make it great for multiple uses 
861 I love this camera. Unlike the other review my Minolta Hi-Matic AF2 takes regular AA batteries that are easy to find. It s a great little point and shoot camera and takes sharp photos. 
862 Stopped working after a few times in the pool. It was fun whenever it worked, though! 
863 Fit nice and snug on my GoPro 4 Silver. Filters came on and off nice. 
864 Great! 
865 This is probably the best kit you can get for the price.The packaging was great, the product and also the shipping was fast. Super happy with this purchase 
866 dose the 55-300 Nikon have a plastic or is it a stainless mount? 
867 Excellent 
868 ive had the phantom 3 pro for 4 weeks and the camera gimble is broke 
869 they don t have replacement parts and wont return after 30 days .. don t waste your money 
870 Worked great to replace the missing screw in my Sinar Pan/Tilt tripod head. This screw is used to mount a camera to your tripod head. There is a version with a 1/4&#34; screw available if your camera uses that instead of the large 3/8&#34; type. 
871 Item as described and fast delivery. 
872 Best solution for glasses wearers, unless you want to drape yourself in a cloth, like Ansel Adams. 
873 Excellent camera. Photos and video to prove it 
874 I took this lens on a trip recently and so far am very happy with it. 
875 Easy to set-up and I am not a wizard when it comes to electronics. i Just set up the monitor up and went out of town for a few days. Really nice to record if you want or just look around. Would purchase again.? 
876 Love the camera, however, the carrying case could fit tha smaller pieces of accessories. 
877 This is a great tripod for beginners. Very cheap and quality-made. It is stable and very adjustable. Very easy to set up and use. Very light. Worked perfect for shooting a large group! I bought it for my Canon camera and use it all the time. 
878 Works perfectly with my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera. This case is a little bulkier than I really wanted, but it has worked out well with the attached belt loop on the back. 
879 This product is unable to be connected trough Internet for remote viewing. Even trought Zmodo it is impossible to update firrmware. When buying be sure that DVR has HDMI connections even if it indicates that comes with QR code. It was made for 
880 decent batteries, a lot cheaper than buying canon. only thing I have noticed is they don t last as long as the canon. At this price I will buy more for backups. 
881 Great camera for very good price. 
882 Yup, it fits! Very happy to find a replacement so I don t have to replace the tripod. 
883 Good product, a little pricey. 
884 Works like a charm....have scanned over 500 pictures so far and not ONE issue! 
885 Use everything in this kit, great buy! 
886 Bought this for a backpacking trip because of its light weight. Camera failed to save majority of photos. I m tossing this camera in the trash. As they say, you get what you pay for. 
887 everything works,video quality excellent and battery life last for more than 8 hrs. Only missing is night vision, video at night is grainy and need a good outside light. Night vision will really make this an outstanding dvr. 5 solid star for this dvr 
888 Very very little. 
889 Bought this as a gift for my stepson and it performed great in the water. Solid quality and build. Image quality also excellent. 
890 Lack of bottom opening access to battery and SD card is an issue. Nicely made and fits well. Binds a bit where case and strap come together. 
891 OEM and lasts just as long as the one with the camera. 
892 Junk!! Waste of money.. 
893 WORKS GREAT 
894 its pretty hard to attach my go pro as the screw is to close to the housing, but overall great product. 
895 I love this lens! Crisp, sharp photos. The Bokeh that this produces is much better than any of my other lenses and I absolutely love the auto focus override. I can utilize the speed of auto focus while being able to fine tune my shots without switching to manual. 
896 You get what you pay for.... 
897 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
898 Just big enough stretch to fit iPhone 6Plus with Spiegen Tough Armour 
899 This camera is PERFECT for beginners. 
900 good buy. on time and a expected. 
901 Fast focus, good low light, great lens. 
902 Love this. It s quick to charge, and lasts long. 
903 Buyer Beware: After purchasing this, I begun getting spam email from SterlingTek. 
904 Keep s my lenses safe. 
905 Just as shown 
906 Configuration is somewhat challenging to determine how the various components can fit into the slots, but it s doable. Very sturdy/ 
907 It s a bag....it holds all my Canon lenses....as well as one body.....snugly. 
908 Good items! 
909 Great price, got the job done. Versatel! 
910 Bot cords, the power cord and the backup camera cord are too short. Cannot hide the cords. Don t let them say otherwise. I have a Honda Accord, and both cords are too short. Mirror also vibrates a little when driving. So I will lengthen the cords by soldering them. 
911 Good camera for the money. The image is very clear and the night vision is bright and effective. 
912 This charger works quite well, love the display and the ability to swap charging amperage so I don t burn out my smaller cells. 
913 Henry ,good and work find ,got good tech support from foscam, it is a good camera! works great. 
914 Awesome camera. Took it to Jamaica and the pictures are absolutely beautiful. Thanks 
915 GREAT PRODUCT, GREAT PRICE. GREAT SERVICE. 
916 Nice strap, no instructions for installing. 
917 Arrived ahead of schedule and worked as expected. Good service and good value. 
918 Lens works well. However lens case is too small and lens won t fit in it. Lens hood is not included. It was delivered sameday. Packaging was great. 
919 just got it. It works on my old camcorder. very happy 
920 I am able to haul this with my backpack camera case. 
921 I rate 4 star my son told me that is really good deal 
922 Works great. Sturdy, yet light weight. And, the Pahntom fits with the prop guards on! 
923 Thank worked great. 
924 Bought it to put it in my Mav 88, It s ok.. 
925 The camera works well when tied directly to the router, but will not sync wireless. 
926 Very good! 
927 These work well but they don t look very appealing. I was able to take pictures and video with ease. However, it doesn t record for long. 
928 Great bag, great value. The dividers are all customizable. It does take time to arrange the dividers for a good fit though. 
929 Nice little TV for the car and has an HDMI input. The colors aren t the best but good enough for my kids to use it with their Wii U on road trips. 
930 This thing really works 
931 Perfect fit for a good price. I ve not tried the tripod yet. 
932 Excelent equipment 
933 it feels cheap the tripod stand is so tiny you cant set it on rocks to get a higher view 
934 Used for rockets and worked extremely well. 
935 These work just as good as my old Canon ones did for my 50 D. And I like be that there were three in this pack also the price is excellent. 
936 Seems fine, I haven t had a chance to really check it yet, like I want. Thank you. 
937 Threads were so badly created during manufacturing, the thing won t work at all. Total junk from day one. 
938 Excellent camera. Very user friendly. Great under water photos. WIFI photo transfer is quick and easy. Super product! 
939 Love it.......... 
940 This was a deal and it works very well. Thanks! 
941 Product overheats under reasonable use (1-2 hours), making it completely unsuitable for professional use. Was using this for a high-profile shoot with a celebrity and it started flickering and turning on and off every second. Ruined the scene and embarrassed the crew. Faulty product and should be removed from Amazon! 
942 Ably and amply holds my Sony A6000 with larger lens attached. Standard lens and wide angle lens fit comfortably and easily (even with Neoprene cases) in side pocket. Lots of other pockets for sundry items. It is larger than you would think, but gets job done for me. 
943 DREAMY!!!! I love this!! We ordered three of them to cover the walls of a 10x20 tent and we got so many complements! Very nice quality and I love the pocket at the top for a rod! Made putting it together a breeze! 
944 It is my carry everywhere camera! Love it! 
945 I was interested in the Arca Swiss quick release feature and didn t need the Olympus battery/control of their accessory. This works perfectly. Finish and fit are perfect. An added bonus over the Olympus add-on is that the battery and memory card can be accessed without removing the base. 
946 Cool....... 
947 This LCD protector: This protector was useless, without adherence to the screen of my Alpha 77 II and the bubbles made it impossible to display the same. It was necessary to dismiss it, total loss. Excuse me. 
948 It worked great. Thank You... 
949 Great 
950 Good... 
951 i love this camera it will notify you if heard a sound or movement also it will email you setting can be changed 
952 Perfect battery... perfect seller! 
953 fine 
954 Great action Camera 
955 Bought this item for the same reason I purchased the small gold/silver mini reflector. (To photo small collectibles) Easy one handed operation for that little extra light one sometimes needs. 
956 Product worked perfectly for my purposes (replacing original factory battery for Olympus Stylus 1050SW). Battery is actually slightly more powerful than the original. 
957 Bought this for my daughter-in-love for her birthday. She absolutely LOVES it. So it works as she expected it to. 
958 Always good to have an extra battery...And here you get two batteries and a great charger. Never leave without a backup fully charged battery when going to shoot your awesome pictures. 
959 Good if you don t drop it! :) 
960 It was exactly what I ordered. Works just fine. 
961 Stay away. This program for product is awful and takes FOREVER 
962 Great kit! Perfect for use with the gopro hero2. It has everything my son needs to get him started making great videos. 
963 This was a great birthday gift for our daughter, she took it to an outward bound week and it went white water rafting, under water in the case and did fine. We are really impressed with the picture quality and would definitely recommend. 
964 Great little lens! It s so wide that it s sometimes hard to keep your feet out of the shots. 
965 One blade stopped working after three days. Have not been able to use it since. 
966 Having a hard time getting it to work but pretty cool item 
967 I use this lens on a D750. My photography experience is very limited but I am enjoying myself. I use this lens for landscapes. 
968 Exactly what I was looking for. Now I will never run out of battery again. 
969 One problem....there is no information to refill the pen ink when it runs out. Now I have a pen that does not write anymore. Thanks seller! 
970 Excellent camera!! Received it within a week of ordering it. 
971 Great to have 
972 Works great with my Nikon batters and makes storage of them so easy!! 
973 Best gift ever. My son used it all summer long in Florida Very easy to use and great picture/video 
974 Very good quality and speed for the price 
975 Was not impressed with video, there was no per say instructions and no phone number to contact for support 
976 It s neat but I wish it didn t save only to .MOV files. 
977 Great product! 
978 very good product. My Asus R.O.G. 17.3 fits very well. And the charger also and a cordless mouse 
979 very good 
980 Not designed for someone with arthritic hands. My niece seems to like it 
981 Product was as advertised. 
982 Works Good, Great Value! 
983 Really cute camera. 
984 This is my 3rd device. Easy to setup. Video lead to the capture of 2 people who burglarized my neighbor 2 doors down. 
985 It was exactly what I was looking for 
986 Excelent price，unbeatable combo. 
987 So so... 
988 Just what I needed 
989 Great sound and picture for such a small unit. Battery and switches are a bit touchy on occasion. 
990 Works great! 
991 Everything is good 
992 I bought the small and it is a great size and easy to pack in my backpack. I own a sjcam sj5000 (gopro clone) and it fits perfect. Great product and reasonable price. 
993 Works fine. 
994 Completely satisfied with the quality of my order. 
995 Excellent 
996 GREAT BUY 
997 Very happy!! 
998 The lens cap is functional and works just fine but the hood lens doesn t quite fit properly. It has fallen off already. 
999 Exactly what i wanted, great price, quick shipping 
1000 Nice kit. Exactly what I needed for my camera. 
1001 Love all the features especially the motion sensor when I walk into the room. Nice display. Easy to use. 
1002 Broke after two weeks. 
1003 This was a wedding present for my grandson and his wife. They love it. They promised me pictures to come in the years ahead! 
1004 Perfect for what I needed!! 
1005 Used to have a 10 x 50. This is great...just a little havier for brid watchers... 
1006 Works great. 
1007 Its alright,as first camera. I needed it for YouTube videos. But audio not so great. I have to talk loud for recording. Video quality is great though. 
1008 Works ok color is really poor but for the money its ok 
1009 A cheap filter isn t worth the loss in image quality. 
1010 instructions are terible have not found any good ones online yet not shure how it will work need better instructions 
1011 Works great! 
1012 great 
1013 Good price! 
1014 The plastic thread is horrible, I tried it on my different lenses and I can t get it to work properly. You can t really tighten it up as the plastic won t allow it. Just a waste of money! 
1015 great 
1016 Beyond its entertainment values, Baywatch has enriched and in many cases helped save lives. - David Hasselhoff 
1017 sturdy! my wife loved it!!! 
1018 Thanks for including good specs, it fits well! 
1019 Pretty frustrating. Frankly, just didn t work. hold the button, red light comes on with blue light, goes out, never able to get a single frame of video recorded. Instructions read like an old Japanese Godzilla movie script... Not playing with this one anymore, sending it back! 
1020 Does not work 
1021 im not happy, the cable gets out. need a stronger closer 
1022 So far so good. I ve been using it for macro work and it works great. Anytime you need a shot when you fear touching the shutter will throw everything off, this is for you. Worth the money. 
1023 doesn t fit as original one fits, cap is falling off quite often 
1024 Excelent 
1025 Will return to seller. 
1026 Keep these in the camera bag as backup. Seem to work fine. 
1027 I wanted to like this camera, but sand got under the shutter button the very first time I used it at the beach. Back it went. If you need something for the pool and not the beach, this would work great. 
1028 This camera is amazing. The images are crisp, and the camera is easy to use. 
1029 Nice case 
1030 Looks pretty good! Worth the price! 
1031 Do not buy this. I didn t even receive the same model as in the description and it barely worked. After the first time I charged it, it worked for ten minutes and now nothing. What a disappointment. 
1032 They are not following through or doing what they claim. For two months now they said they were couldnt fix but would pay out the claim. Nothing they said has been true. No camera returned and no payment 
1033 wasn t impressed with it, doesn t find focus that fast. returned the next day 
1034 Love it! 
1035 like it 
1036 Fits my Nikon D3200 and any filters I have on the camera. Good price and fast shipping! 
1037 Very satisfied arrive as promised and was easy to set up support was great 
1038 love it 
1039 Same as the battery that came with the camera and lasts a very long time. I used this in my Nikon D5500. 
1040 Shipped quickly and exactly as described. Great deal, thank you! 
1041 Attached to my deck rail to install the Netatmo rain gauge. Works well. 
1042 So far so good! Have had these batteries for only a couple of weeks, but so far so good, They do the job. 
1043 I already used it on my glasses and on my TV screen and it does what it promises. Great product. Will recommend this product 
1044 The strap was a tad large but it held the camera securely during my horse back riding excursions and regular pool play. 
1045 This thing is brill! 
1046 Items for my friend and my family arrived well packaged and earlier than estimated delivery.We take it for family use to record cherished moments. After a few days usage, I really think it is worthy to recommend to you.It is really funny and useful device. 
1047 Looking at it now and works well 
1048 Nice everybody like exploration 
1049 I have not used the very much. I am still experimenting with them. However I am satisfied with them so far. I do not expect to have any problems with them. 
1050 Worked exactly as advertised. Great product! 
1051 disappointed that it was plastic petal after being reviewed as ALL metal. focus is pretty stiff. not tack sharp... 
1052 Loved this case! It worked perfectly and did the job. Pelican makes a very good product. Shipping was awesome and fast. 
1053 Unit works well and is OK. I should have read description more carefully because I would really like a battery operated unit. 
1054 amazing product 
1055 Was shipped faster than stated. Very pleased with purchase. 
1056 Didn t work right. Pictures were blurry with lens attached to camera lens. 
1057 It does what it is designed to do. It s not very portable as you have to disassemble it every time. Once you figure out how to do it it s ok. You could easily put your eye out if one of the rods slip out of your hand. 
1058 Great product. Easy to install. 
1059 Great product at a very affordable price, kept my camera nice and dry when we got caught out in a storm unexpectedly last weekend. 
1060 exactly as described. works great would buy again 
1061 Still learning how to use this but it is very well made. I see it as having the potential to really improve my moving shots. 
1062 Battery would not charge 
1063 Ok but I m still not relaxed enough to use it!!!! 
1064 Pretty easy to fly I m a beginner and once I could once I figured out the software it was pretty easy 
1065 Works pretty good 
1066 Do not buy this product. It stopped working after a few shots. I bought tried out, the next time I pulled it out of the bag it quit working. 
1067 I have a 3+ and realized the itch on the original case cracked right before a trip so I ordered this one. Fits my 3+ perfect and has a different style latch so we ll see how that does. Shipped fast 
1068 This camera works great, used the 44 optical zoom with great clarity. The only drawback is there was no software or user manual but I downloaded the manual from the website. I would recommend this product to anyone and I am very satisfied with my purchase. Thanks! 
1069 Very sturdy for the cost - I was surprised. Not enough for my Nikon D700, but *perfect* for my Sony a6000! The built it ball head is great, too. 
1070 cant go wrong. Excellent product for protection and peace of mind 
1071 Arrived broken 
1072 Bought two and gave one for a gift. Neither one was usable due to the Go Pro screw not being able to tighten all the way. The unit will not stay in position. 
1073 pule s*** 
1074 Great Pole buuuut its too expensive! The thumbscrew seems poor quality 😒 anyways i like its transparent😀 and Looks beautiful 
1075 Works great with my Sony a58 camera. I wish it had a power button though so I could turn it off when I wasn t using it. 
1076 It s very good , clear and works wonderful. I thought it was a little bigger but works great. 
1077 Birthday gift for my son. He really liked it for his voice recorder. Fast service. I actually received it sooner than expected. Great job 
1078 This did not work for my Canon T3 even though it said it would. I m disappointed. 
1079 It was perfect. Thanks 
1080 Just what I needed 
1081 Pleasure doing business with! Everything as promised! 
1082 This camera worked fine...until I updated to Windows 10 then it didn t work. Disappointing 
1083 My brother is a photographer and loves it. Uses it all the time for different kinds of shoots. 
1084 Quality and price very good. 
1085 As a wide angle lens for the Nikon 1 V2 this lens performed very well giving great color rendition and pin sharp photographs. 
1086 Unlike anything you ve ever experienced 
1087 Effective, light weight, great quality and compact. Will easily collapse and fit in the case it comes with. Great to create highlights or a catch light for one person. 
1088 As advertised 
1089 Works very well. This really helped us see what our dog was doing during the night. He is having health problems and it helped to see his behavior all night. 
1090 good 
1091 Easy to use, video and audio quality is very poor. 
1092 piece of s*** 
1093 works PERFECT!!! ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY!! 
1094 What a great package deal. The DJI P3 is one awesome quad. Just add a case and a cell phone or tablet and you are ready to have the time of your life. It is fast and responds very well. The pictures and video are impressive. 
1095 Good product, delivery on times, I like it ! 
1096 It came just in time for the vacation trip to Sedona, Arizona. With a 20-50mm kit lens, the pictures was amazingly clear and sharp color rendition. 
1097 The charger only charged the battery 2 bars and completely died in 40 minutes I WANT MY MONEY BACK!!! 
1098 my last camera bag.. 
1099 Best Photo gear I own. 
1100 exactly as advertised. shipping was a bit on the slow side, though. 
1101 Exactly what I needed. Fast delivery! 
1102 works flawlessly with HDMI. Use it with media device as well as computer. 
1103 Product was great arrived on time and was packaged sufficiently, it didn t solve my problem which was my internet connection itself but it worked great and did as i needed it to 
1104 Works as well as a new OEM battery should. 
1105 Amazing lens!!!! Highly recommend 
1106 Very nice quality. 
1107 Great for the price 
1108 Worked perfectly as described - my kids and I loved being able to let our waterproof camera bob around in the water and not worry it would disappear! 
1109 Works very well, positions camera in a good spot and holds it there. 
1110 Like all the other reviews, this is awesome! 
1111 The velcro came ripped and I ll need to do something about that so I can put it on my belt or something 
1112 Good deal. Warranty card wasn t included, but you can easily register on the Canon website. 
1113 It works good. Just what I needed. 
1114 Lesson learned; look at the length of the stick. This one is a little short which I was a little disappointed. Yet Ive learned to play with it and captured a good shot. 
1115 Excellent 
1116 This camera is exactly what I wanted/needed. Would recommend to anyone needing a point a shoot. Zoom is perfect for me, color is great. Love it! 
1117 Love this thing. Brought it with me to bandcamp and had a lot of fun with it battery life leaves much to be desired but photos arebshotnin 4000x3000 and video in 1920x1080 so I can t complain much. 
1118 works good and keeps my go pro secure when needed. Thanks!! 
1119 Both work good! the only problem is the locking knot dose working properly, after locking in, sometime have to force to unlock it! 
1120 They do a good job of cleaning. With six of them, I have one where I need them, most of the time. 
1121 Quite frankly, I m a little disappointed in the picture quality of this camera based on the price I paid for the camera. Plus the video has to be transferred into a different format before it can be edited. 
1122 Great when you need your camera perfectly straight. Works great 
1123 Fits my camera fine and improves the imsgrs while shooting in bright sunlight. 
1124 Great buy! My 16 year old photografer is very Happy with it. Delived at home really fast. Thanks 
1125 No instructions. Camera must be in manual mode with you making all the adjustment. 
1126 It is ciik 
1127 Love this camera! 
1128 Good unit! Preforms very well at a good price! 
1129 I love it! I like the video option on the camera. Great blue color. 
1130 Came Quick. Exactly as represented! 
1131 Stopped working after several months. 
1132 ok 
1133 Received and the snaps began to pull apart one by one. The canvas is nice and the bag is roomy enough but the quality of the securing snaps is very poor. 
1134 Love the large size, great for wrapping around large cell phone to protect while in pocket. And keep another in car to wipe touch screen. 
1135 It work great. It is simple to use. Now the printer results match the computer look. 
1136 I can take pictures which is very beautiful! 
1137 This battery s work perfectly with my 6D, and my60d 
1138 Most places charge much more for these batteries, work good on my camera. 
1139 Not that effective. 
1140 Love it. It s light and sharp. Nice to go with my new a7R-II. 
1141 The single best buy I have had for my telescope 
1142 works great! 
1143 Works okay. Could be better 
1144 Broke after 15 mins 
1145 This is a good security system. The PoE is what really sold me. I had some cable runs that were long, so I used standard cat5. The cameras give a good clear image. 
1146 This device works without a hitch. 
1147 Fabulous for the price, especially compared with the Sony OEM version. Does everything at a fraction of the cost. 
1148 Love this lens. 
1149 Great security camra 
1150 My daughter was happy. 
1151 Very happy with this purchase, have too many options but I know now that make the right decision, Ultra light, very handy, very very bright, shoot nice pictures on the darkest places 
1152 Just what I needed so I could see what the GoPro was recording. Fit perfectly. 
1153 Very pleased by the performance of this little camera. 
1154 Great for taking quick snapshots and easy to carry around 
1155 Works well, packaged well and delivered faster than indicated. The only reason for the minus one star is that it has no cooling fan. It may not be a problem but I am a little worried about longevity without the cooling fan so I am going to install one myself. 
1156 This is a outstanding deal. 
1157 this is a very nice set - I was glad to have a way of recharging my camera batteries away from 120v power. I was really just looking for new and higher capacity batteries, but the charger turned out great. 
1158 Great product 
1159 I used the gold reflector with the shoot-through open for a Chicago senior session. I lovvvvvved the warm tones! I ll never used anything else. 
1160 bought this item to repair an old school wireless 900mhz. alarm system that I could not find anywhere else , shipping was very fast ,product was exactly as described thanks again 
1161 as advertised 
1162 Fits perfect, works perfect. 
1163 This is currently the single greatest bargain in quadcopter / drone. You get a Pixhawk, controller, and a very stabled, well tuned machine for an extremely competitive price. 
1164 great sound 
1165 Great Buy ! 
1166 It arrived as promised and as described. Unfortunately, I was looking for something else. My fault. I thought it was going to have more magnification. Next time, more research needed. 
1167 the buttons are small and I cant tell if I am recording or not. 
1168 It s the best buddy when I travel alone. 
1169 Works as advertised. All Olympus camera functions work. 
1170 I bought this a while ago and it doesn t even turn on I hate it not worth it save ur money 
1171 Seems to work fine, but instructions are not clear for setting up features. Box and sales brochures said the camera did NOT not include an SD disk so I purchased a separate one; but there was one in the unit when I received it. Other than that, seems okay. 
1172 A great affordable, alternative option to a pelican case! 
1173 excellent 
1174 Quality weak 
1175 As others have stated the punch out holes do not punch out easily. You end up beding the box. Would not recomend this to anyone! 
1176 I purchased this item as a holiday gift. Won t know how well the boy s like it until Christmas. 
1177 Though we used guidelines it was the wrong adapter. Unfortunately we purchased two. 
1178 works great but I rarely put on my Nikon Lenses. The camera is so small and the lenses are so big. 
1179 The package came with a chest strap, not a head strap as clearly shown. The goose neck is not very robust, the gopro-clip side broke on the first try, did not even get to use it. I m scared to use the camera holder, I m afraid it will break. 
1180 Oki 
1181 I was skeptical of the reviews, but they were telling the truth. It s all metal except for the leveling bubble. This will last me a long time. 
1182 Thing is awesome...I am bringing mine to Burning Man next week. Going to strap it on to my back and riddddddde! 
1183 great bag got it for my girlfriend she can bring her camera gear very easily when we go out 
1184 Whale watching in Alaska it was handy to have the zoom feature. Image was pretty steady even without a tripod. 
1185 Very good camera. For a small/compact camera, it does a great many things. Way better than any camera I have had before! 
1186 Very Good 
1187 great 
1188 Super easy and fast set up. Great picture quality. Great/simple phone app. Excellent range of view. Wish you could record video locally but subscription is reasonable price. 
1189 Had it for 2 months and it is amazing at everything! 
1190 Came exactly as promised and works just like original. 
1191 good design - very functional 
1192 I hate this pole. If fills with water every dive (I ve logged 50+ in the last year). Also, you can t extend it underwater if needed. I would recommend another. 
1193 I love it 
1194 Items received on time and as described 
1195 Excelente. 
1196 Very nice case for the DJI Phantom 3. It is sturdy and seals up really well with 4 latches. The case has a pressure equalizer which is very important when traveling. It is also very roomy. 
1197 It s Perfect! Worth The Purchase and the price ! 
1198 Excelente. 
1199 Got lens error on third use! Do not purchase!!! 
1200 I use this to record for YouTube. And for this price the quality is very high. I m pleased. 
1201 Great power output 
1202 need more room. side pockets are small. 
1203 Well made and a great design. 
1204 Bought one for recording my instrument playing. Really love it. Light weight; sturdy; About 4ft Great product 
1205 It is very nice , I like it a lot. 
1206 best deal for film! 
1207 Great buy and was delivered fast. So glad i found this to protect my camera when not in use. Great deal. 
1208 It functions well enough but it is too short. When I use it I get a sore neck. 
1209 Awesome 
1210 Received as new 
1211 Not much to say here, works as expected. 
1212 Good product 
1213 Sensor works great. Chimes are loud. However, there is no way to set the chimes to a continous mode. I would prefer something that requires me to turn it off. This product is perfect for a retail situation to know if someone has walked in your store. 
1214 great camera and easy to use. Nice features. 
1215 As advertised 
1216 worth the money 
1217 This may work perfectly with most cameras. But it was worthless with my Pentax K5 and K3 ii. Just acted weird. I tossed it in the trash. Pity. 
1218 Muy bueno 
1219 this camera introduce a loud noise to my PC .... I can t solve this problem 
1220 Awesome camera want a few more 
1221 Thank you 
1222 A must have for any camera bag. It s good enough for everyday shooting and cheap enough to replace if it should break. 
1223 Love it, and it fits my camera perfectly 
1224 Arrived on a slow boat from China but everything works like it should. 
1225 Worked well with my camera, thanks. 
1226 I often leave my DSLR home. I have made great vacation videos with this. I use one charger and most of my electronics use AA batteries. Something that is not easy to find these days. 
1227 Buy original Canon parts. This part will not stay on my camera. I have given it a few months and every single time I pull my camera out of my bag, the eye piece is missing because it just falls off. Does not fit 5DMk3 correctly. 
1228 Haven t used it too often as yet, but seems to add a multiple of camcorder hour use in comparison with the smaller OEM battery that came with the Panasonic camcorder. 
1229 Battery life is short. 
1230 Excellent transaction! All was as promised 
1231 Works as advertised. Charges my Nikon batteries. 
1232 Wow, this picture is great for the money. 
1233 I wish I hadn t bought it because every time I have to change the battery it turns into a whole process to remove the cover. 
1234 Wrks 
1235 Makes shooting pictures for a still image so much easier for the unsteady hand. 
1236 love it. my 1st Tamron lens, getting a fish eye lens extension for it as well. 
1237 Henry was very helpful and fixed all my problems. My Foscam FI9803P is working well again. 
1238 Well made and works well. I did find that wearing the pack caused my lower back to get sore. To remedy this, I used the shoulder strap to help support the weight of the bag.... as I should have from the start! 
1239 I would recommend an actual finder scope, but if you need a reflex finder the reviews clearly indicate that the Telrad is the way to go. I have this one, and it works OK, but that s about it. 
1240 Difficult for an amateur 
1241 the selfie stick is horrible. lots of the screws dont fit easily. The clamps dont fit easily. but you do get what you pay for. every thing works, i just had to brake it in. 
1242 Love it! use it for action sports 
1243 worked well for about 6 months, and then something inside popped, and now it doesnt work. the warranty is a lie, as yognuo customer service doesnt exist. just invest in a higher quality flash and save yourself the time! this is my 2nd one ive burned thru this year! 
1244 CMOS sensor is much improved. Impressed with the auto focusing speed of the video capture and its quiet. Pictures are sharp in lightroom. Solid for an intermediate camera 
1245 Coolest thing since sliced bread!! Amazing product, I highly recommend this! 
1246 great 
1247 Just I expected - works great and looks terrific! 
1248 Perfect for my Minolta 49 mm lenses. I don t use the tethers because, at this price I ll risk losing one now and then to avoid the lens cap dangling from the camera. 
1249 Great for what I needed it to do. Thanks! 
1250 nice gift 
1251 ;) 
1252 Arrived on time and in perfect working order. Would use them again. 
1253 It works OK. 
1254 Still using them. Great product. 
1255 Have had my strap on my canon for about 6 months now. I adore it! 
1256 Working just as great as the the original... 
1257 Great product! Fast service. Works perfectly! 
1258 great 
1259 Works perfectly with no degradation of quality. 
1260 Works perfect in my camcorder. 
1261  
1262 Great value along with a one year warrantee and information to contact the seller via e-mail and web if you have any issues. Great daytime pic and much improved night vision as well. Will be buying more soon. 
1263 Can be carry on as a case or a back pack which is convenient. Very light as mentioned. All accessories including drone with props and prop guards fit in all in place well supported. 
1264 I am using this case for my Hasselblad 500c along with 2 backs, a viewfinder, Zeiss light meter and two rolls of 120mm film. I feel protected with my equipment. I have also spoken to Pelican reps in California and have been satisfied with their customer service. A win-win. 
1265 Consumes batteries too much 
1266 This works great. It keeps the camera dry and easy to access all the components. 
1267 Love it take great pictures !!! Something that u have to have 
1268 Very disappointing, did not work as good as advertised. Camera works ok as a monitor but trying motion recording is poor at best. 
1269 Thank you very much! 
1270 Works great no issues 
1271 Protection for my camera. 
1272 great products. Thanks 
1273 Love it 
1274 Meh. 
1275 I am very impressed with the quality and design. The comfort design for the shoulder (padded very well) will make for enjoyable photo sessions as I enjoy hiking while taking photos of Nature. 
1276 Great Item. Highly recommend. 
1277 Super easy to install and setup. Much better than the older versions of their systems. 
1278 This item is sturdy and holds tight without being uncomfortable on my children. I have kids ages ranging from 1 to 6 and they all loved it. I got some amazing and adorable footage using this mount. 
1279 The tripod would be great for a small camera. This doesn t hold my DSLR camera real well. The legs want to slide out from underneath the camera. 
1280 Did its job. 
1281 returned it due to bad photo quality .. 
1282 Strap broken. Good while lasted. 
1283 for some reason the batteries dont last very long.. i buy i kit of 3 pieces and one of them drop the shoe metal part.... 
1284 it s alright 
1285 Works great. The little stand broke pretty easily when it fell from a desk onto carpet. But it still looks good in a simple frame holder that I had. 
1286 I purchased this for a Nikon D7200. The first one that was sent out defective, but they made good on it with a return. I am well pleased with it. It fits great and is thicker than I anticipated, plus it came with a small one for the control panel. 
1287 The product arrived on time and as described. Great to do business with you. Thanks Rusty 
1288 Us this to mount a 7&#34; monitor to a Canon Vixia S20 Mini Hot Shoe. Works Perfect. 
1289 This met all our expectations! It is so easy to change attachments and the directions help to figure out what piece goes with what attachment. Highly recommend this kit for anyone looking for an affordable kit for the GoPro! 
1290 Super system, quick to install and peace of mind. 
1291 Great life saver for your Nikon DSLR. No more nervous shooting waiting for your main battery to die! 
1292 Once I receive the cameras and hook them up it was very easy to hook them up and they worked as good as I could hope that they would ! I have no issues and I would purchase them again ! 
1293 Great! Just for wrong type of camera. 
1294 This is a great deal and highly recommend it because you WILL need extra batteries. You can never have too many! 
1295 Works great other than quite a few false alarms tweaking its location may help that we will see 
1296 Love this backpack! ! Plenty of room for all my gear. 
1297 Great deal works awesome! 
1298 fell off all the time 
1299 Good price point and does what it s suppose to do. 
1300 Works good. 
1301 The film is hard to find and certainly did the job that we intended. Would gladly purchase it again if needed. Pierce Camera price is not cheap, but fortunately in this case, you do get what you pay for. Five stars. 
1302 Smaller then expected but not to bad wish I got a bigger once... Not bad for the price! 
1303 Great! Snug fit, very heavy duty case. 
1304 Like this charger better than one that came with camera 
1305 The fit is a bit clunky compared to the original -- but it does work. 
1306 Terrible! Barely fits and doesn t show good quality. Very disappointed. 
1307 fits firmly basic lens cap 
1308 perfect fit 
1309 The Targus version works better, but this one s OK. 
1310 Very happy with the quality of this strap. The Leather is soft and high quality. It also included two metal rings and small protective leather pieces which I hadn t noticed in any of the product descriptions. Shipping was quick! 
1311 Great camera. Timely delivery. 
1312 Cameras stopped working after a few months. 
1313 Love my new square compact camera! It s cute, made in Japan, and has one of the best resolution and display of the compact cameras market! 
1314 Very good quality! Looks great! 
1315 Works well 
1316 I don t like it 
1317 It doesn t work 
1318 Great product, worked well. 
1319 Works with my Sony Action Cam. This bag of trix is really helpful with accessories and attachments for the Sony Action Cam. Since Sony does not make a lot mount accessories I purchased this and worked well! 
1320 Ok. Not worth the time. Just get a macro lens. 
1321 Very good quality. Love that it has audio. Really love that i can watch it from my phone! ! Fanatic cam!! 
1322 This is my electronics travel bag for trips. Perfectly carries all my gizmos and camera with great multi compartments and sections for everything! 
1323 Just what I needed. Not the brightest one, but serves my need. Excellent quality. 
1324 All my life I have wanted a good Nikon SLR camera, MY wishes have finally come true. Absolutely love it. 
1325 Great buy! 
1326 cannon eos rebel t5 DSLR camera I have to lean this camera its been a while sine I used my eos rebel 35 mm camera so this one is new to me 
1327 Great Rig Works As Advertised! Good Build Quality For The Money. 
1328 The plastic buckle snapped in half when latching the case closed. I ve only had this for about four months. I ve just purchased an aluminum one, I hope it last longer then this one. 
1329 It s ok. A bit awkward. 
1330 Very grainy video. Not an original sj4000 as advertised. 
1331 DVR has good quality recording and was able to set up app on android phone for remote viewing with no issues. 
1332 I can turn on/off the shed security flood light from inside the house at 110 feet away. My double pain hurricane proof windows did not adversely affect it s performance/range. 
1333 Product has lower quality material and workmanship 
1334 Fuzzy picture, more like a toy! 
1335 Inexpensive filters that do a nice job 
1336 Great camera 
1337 Excellent Flash. Output was amazing. 
1338 This is my &#34;go-to&#34; camera for everything photographic. I like it because it does everything Sony says it does. Also, it takes all my old Minolta autofocus lenses with no problems. Saved me a lot of money in that regard. 
1339 Decent camera with good options. 
1340 Nikon IS the BESTthat IS a fact. And for this little GEM of a camara, I cannot express how vivid the clarity in the pictures are!. The ease of use, zoom, edititing for even more beautiful pics, and an ALL OUT 5 STAR Camara! LHH 
1341 #1 it works great for CCTV CAMERAS 
1342 Lots of acc. for little cash and pretty good quality for the money. I have not had a chance to try the suction cup mount yet. 
1343 smart way of standardize the power adapter. good value and quality! 
1344 Exactly what I ordered, durable, and compatible with what it claimed. Couldn t be happier with this no brainer purchase. 
1345 does not fit my camera 
1346 Epic 
1347 Nice basic cam bag. 
1348 I placed the order yesterday, it arrived today, everything was as described, and no missing items. Perfect order. 
1349 Heads above the cable that came with the camera! (BTW the camera is a $600 camera). 
1350 Love it for semi pro use. 
1351 Got this product for my 12 year old daughter and she absolutely loves it!!!! Highly recommend this product!! 
1352 The camera works nicely with my iPhone and I m able to remotely control it as advertised. Foscam Customer Support was very helpful. Danny assisted me with clarity and precision. 
1353 Very good! 
1354 Lost mine, had to buy another. 
1355 Nice 
1356 good 
1357 Good 
1358 excelente 
1359 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
1360 Worked great. No problems and yes, they do show the battery monitor. 
1361 My camera did not sink to the bottom of the ocean. Mission accomplished. Use two with your one camera for extra buoyancy. 
1362 I do not trust the reliability of the suction. My camera is very valuable to use this. 
1363 Barely worked at all before dying completely. Wast of money. Find something else. 
1364 Does what it says it does 
1365 I bought this used. But surprisingly there wasn t any scratch on the lens nor there was any sign of use. It was like new!! performance is as expected. Satisfied. 
1366 Thank You! 
1367 Thanks. 
1368 Worked great and kept its charge. Also loved the extra charger (although it does take longer to charge than if it is on the camera charging) and other extras it came with. 
1369 works well for my ipad and phone. 
1370 in a pack of 10 shots, 2 were defective. I paid full price for only 8 shots... 
1371 Solid every bit as good as a GoPro, took a ton of vacation videos and photos including under water with no issues. 
1372 A nice step up from my K5IIs which finally gave out after taking close to a half a million bracketed shots. I like this camera body enough that I think I will keep from throwing it into the ocean. 
1373 Item missing 
1374 Ya gotta be careful applying it but it is the ideal product to protect your screen and at a great price to boot ! 
1375 Does not record many videos on motion activated and shuts off, even after charging for 2 days, lasts about 4 hours 
1376 Great Product 
1377 Wasn t what I expected it to be 
1378 Love these. I ve had them for 2 years now with no issues. They work with both of my off camera flashes. 
1379 This is a tool I should have bought years ago !! This has saved me hours of cursing and scratched lens rings.. 
1380 Awesome 
1381 A great head for dslr 
1382 excellent perfect 
1383 Excellent price and fast delivery. One of the best optical zoom cameras you can get. 
1384 I purchased this for my wife and she loves it. It was just as shown in the ad. All good equipment and of top quality. 
1385 Works great as intended! Even used it in conditions where there is condensation and even though it gets a little damp, no issues yet. 
1386 Good flash, great alternative if you re on a budget! 
1387 just great 
1388 Awesome! 
1389 This product is rediculouse it doesn t even focus properly. 
1390 Meets my needs for storage of Memory Cards 
1391 great camera. Took on our vacation and worked great. 
1392 The zippers look cheap but until now they are working great. I have made a inside foam core to arrange my stuff. 
1393 Be sure to test. Lost my waterproof camera the first time it was used on the river kayaking. One would not even slow it down as it sank out of sight. 
1394 Does exactly what it is supposed to do--distribute the weight of camera and lens more evenly, making them appear lighter when walking around. Simple one handed operation easily lifts camera to eye level for use. 
1395 Great ip camera have 3 of these and one of the 720p cameras work great and would recomend sight hound software for pc to anyone with these cameras 
1396 I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded. 
1397 Great kit for the price 
1398 Good price, my daughter loves it. 
1399 Dont buy this due to use product not even brand new! 
1400 Great product at a great price. Fits my Nikon CoolPix perfectly. 
1401 was ok nothing special 
1402 Gets my white balance in check when I film. Very useful if you make videos or if you shoot portraits in uncontrolled lighting environments. 
1403 held up nice at the beach and on kayak trips 
1404 Good lens, met my expectations. 
1405 Thank you 
1406 Comfortable to carry, well thought out spaces inside. Seems pretty robust. I bought this via a friend in the US: I wish they sold them in the UK! 
1407 Was exactly what I paid for and received this item quickly! 
1408 it broke 
1409 Great 
1410 Everything they said it was, fun to fly and takes great pics 
1411 This fan was not anymore powerful than a $20 box fan from Walmart. Way over priced. I returned it and the seller charged me a 20% &#34;re-stocking fee&#34;, totally disappointed and I STRONGLY recommend that you save your money and do not purchase this item from Cowboystudio...waste of money! 
1412 Not bulky at all and everything fits. Might be kind of snug for some people, but I would much rather have it just barely large enough for comfortably carrying. 
1413 It s OK, I was hoping it was a little smaller but it works fine functionally. 
1414 Works just fine. No problems. 
1415 Crap quality 
1416 Perfect as any Canon stuff 
1417 Great camera just that occasionally my pictures do not fully or don t develop 
1418 Using on my Fujifilm S1. Great product. Love the quality and the price SO reasonable! 
1419 really nice, makes your cutting edge digital camera look like the legendary cameras of the fifties and sixties. Also protects delicate, not to mention sophisticated digital contents. Very nice, beautifully made, probably worth three times the cost. 
1420 when the magnet is stuck to the back of the nest cam it breaks night vision. I haven t tested with the dropcam only the newer nest branded camera. Don t buy if you want the night vision to work. 
1421 Great quality device. As most Bosch products generally are. I have installed multiples of these units and after 6+ years they are still in use today. 
1422 The cases are nice. They work nice for what I use them for. 
1423 Very nice bag, quality meets my expectations. 
1424 Good strap, seems well made, comfortable and fits the 3300d great 
1425 pictures aren t as clear as I thought they would be but could be my camera. 
1426 A little see through but not bad for the price. 
1427 Long life battery. 
1428 Excellent!!! 
1429 Just what I needed! 
1430 works well 
1431 Very cheaply made....the light itself is great but the actual piece feels like a toy. And the piece that connects to camera or hand device is very very difficult to use. 
1432 Very convenient to have these extra batteries when using my gopro. worth the money. works great 
1433 Perfect. 
1434 Works well just like the old one I had before I lost it 
1435 This is such a cool little product! I m having a blast playing with it and I m amazed at the difference in my photos. 
1436 Quality seems good, fits drone and accessories very well, foam seems good. Little steep on the price, but has made my drone use much easier. Also, this is not a bad thing, but know that it protrudes from your back quite a bit as any done backpack probably will. 
1437 still learning how to use it to it s full capacity 
1438 Nice 
1439 Better than the built in mic, not outstanding audio quality but it s an inexpensive improvement. You will likely have to experiment with your audio input controls to get the best quality and reduce hiss/background noises. 
1440 So far, it s great. Does everything I want and at such a lower price than a GoPro. All in all, THANKS 
1441 The coordinating strap with pink stripe makes it. Unfortunately, it is not included or available as the picture is shown. I returned it. 
1442 have not had to use it 
1443 beautifull kit!!!!! excellente!! 
1444 my wife is a selfie nut 
1445 Did not meet my expectations because product was poorly manufactured and was not durable. I was excited about using this product but never had the opportunity because it fell apart as soon as I attached my Gopro Hero 4 to it. 
1446 fall apart too easily 
1447 It s a really good quality harness and fit my fat dashund mix 
1448 Camera stopped working the same day it was installed 
1449 swings - very loose 
1450 the piece fit my camera with no problem will be buying another for my telephoto len thnxs 
1451 great kit for those looking to recharge batteries for box mods and several other types. 
1452 works well 
1453 We bought this for my husband s family in Kazakhstan. They love it, very clear photos with little to no effort. The camera arrived very quickly, in time for our trip. Highly recommend. 
1454 Henry was very helpful in setting up my new camera .and the camera looks really good and remote works really good very happy 
1455 Worked well I have no complaints did like the yellow tips. I received them relatively short period of time. 
1456 Great, works perfectly 
1457 Great lens, bought it for macro use with a few of my extension tubes. It replaced my 50mm f/1.8D beautifully! 
1458 great, I have had fun using these for pictures after our family vacation 
1459 xcellent by, much better than the original one 
1460 Excellent cameras and so far the best I ve had. I own 16 cameras on a two 8 camera system. Here is one of them just take 8/23/15. 
1461 Very convenient and allows you to take pics with one hand. 
1462 Excellent. 
1463 Works perfectly to My scope 
1464 haven`t had these long enough to give a true and final rating but give me a little while and I`ll let you know. 
1465 Arrived on time and looks like it work as advertised 
1466 Easy to use 
1467 This is a great kit. Includes everything to get started (and then some!). The video camera is an exceptional value for a 4k video camera. 
1468 I ve tried everything in this kit on my gopro hero. Works great. 
1469 Bought this new brand of CPL out of curiosity and found it to be of very good quality. I see no difference between this and my trusted HOYA Pro1 CPL in picture quality and the build quality is also good. Looks like this one would become my new standard. 
1470 good 
1471 Love it! Came with everything, works great! Pictures area a bit tiny but nothing I m concerned about considering I just wanted the camera for little albums of memories I can show my kids later on in life. :) 
1472 who would thought great device for studio setting or reportage 
1473 I bought this as a present for my fiancée who says she simply loves it. It does it a really good job for her, it s relatively simple to use, takes really good, clear pictures and gets the job done well. 
1474 It is a simple piece of plastic that hold one slide that lets you aim it toward the light and see the image on the film. It does exactly what I expected it to do in the simplest way possible and that is what I like best. 
1475 Truly a great lens for the price. The Nikkor 14-24 is better overall, smaller, lighter and performs better. But for $1000 more. 
1476 Great lil Light, Fast Service....Exceeded expectations! 
1477 This camera has been very reliable and fun to use. The projector aspect is ok, but not needed for my purposes. I like how compact it is and how good the quality is. 
1478 Excelente. 
1479 Works very well. The only downside I have noticed is that the pads on the clamp easily come off and can be lost. I will be glueing them on. 
1480 Geart price & quality for Gimbal head I use it with my Nikon 200-400mm. 
1481 These is a nice tripod. It s very light weight and easy to carry around. 
1482 Fit nice 
1483 Good product 
1484 A beautiful keepsake box that holds a lot. I used it to put away memorial items for my son who passed away recently. The wording on the outside says it all. I love it. 
1485 Works Perfect 
1486 Don t know how they do it this camera has it all for 62 bucks 
1487 Easy to use!! 
1488 GREAT LENS CAP....!!!...Plain and simple... 
1489 nice kit but it would have been better if it came with cleaning solvent also. 
1490 Came in very handy while diving and snorkeling, camera kind of flopped around a bit much at times though, would be nice if you could reign it in a bit while not shooting. 
1491 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
1492 Cool I have received this product from UP Review Program. This product really bring our cellphone with a waterproof bag out of water. Its function is very nice. I m loving it. 
1493 Perfect size. Feels sturdy and does the job. Recommended!! 
1494 Cheap quality but it s a great start for me. It s not pro but it does the job. 
1495 every good batteries they last a long time 
1496 Dosent last as long as the canon batteries, but for the price a good option 
1497 Love the item and the seller. Nikon Battery arrive fully charged and ready to be used. 
1498 this battery fixed my camera and I am very happy with it. Just want to say Thank you Amazon for helping me out 
1499 Works perfectly. Now my pictures print exactly what I see on my computer screen! 
1500 This lens is really amazing! Took it our a couple nights to take pictures of the stars! I did buy it on BH. Not because of a price difference. Only because I knew for sure that I d get a new lens from BH. 
1501 Honestly I m really disappointed in this boom, or maybe my expectations where to high, don t extent it compleatly out, it will not support well. It s not terrible, but for neewer... It s not great either. 
1502 Very good frame mount, works well on my gopro hero 4. Use it everytime. 
1503 LENS LOCKED UP INTERMITTANTLY. HAD TO REMOVE BATTERY TO UNLOCK. 
1504 they dont work at all,cam wont focus no matter what lens i use,i wish i cold return it but i cant because ill have to pay for shipping. 
1505 It works! Fits my Panasonic 14-140mm f/4.0 lens (the older 62mm version... not the new f/3.5 version). I lost my lens cap somewhere in Cuba, so I m happy to have a lens cap again. 
1506 love this camera, so far so good. 
1507 I was disappointed it did not come with a lens cap 
1508 Better than gopro battery s and last longer 
1509 The cameras are good and I happy with it 
1510 Really heavy duty case great for demos! 
1511 Perfect! 
1512 Great product!! 
1513 super easy to set up! awesome quality! using it for my desk at work to display all my many photos of my son! great price too! 
1514 Beautiful item 
1515 nice 
1516 Works great but did not realize it can be harmful to the human eye. This should not be used as a baby cam, IR light has been reported to cause eye damage even with closed eyes. 
1517 Está funcionando correctamente. 
1518 The best buy I could make to Cameta Camera provider through Amazon. The camera Alpha 77 II, the18-135 MM LENS and all acesories... I am very happy, so glad and thank you very much. Five Stars!!!. 
1519 Husband likes it. 
1520 This LCD protector is amazing! It goes on crystal clear. It s great don t have to worry about scratched screen highly recommend it 
1521 They work quite well. Now if I could do as well. 
1522 Really great little travel lens, giving a good balance of image quality for its weight. Not bad macro capability for such as small lens. 
1523 The Canon battery back outperforms the imitators. Go for the real deal. 
1524 Haven t tried them yet but I have no doubt that they will be just fine. 5 stars that they are as good as if not better than the original gopro accessories but half the price. 
1525 they worked as they should! will buy again! 
1526 seems to work as advertised. 
1527 Doesn t come with a tripod adaptor , is hard to screw on but over all is an okay products. Disappointed about the tripod adaptor since that was the main reason for me buying this 
1528 Started my camera right up and I was able to retrieve pictures. The camera had been misplaced for almost three years. 
1529 So much easier than the previous color match system I used. 
1530 Items were as described and very satisfying. I would recommend this to anyone and I would also buy this again. :) 
1531 I love it. 
1532 The color of the camera is nice but the overall build is a bit poor. 
1533 Tech support was exceptional. I called D-Link and had a very positive experience with two technical support folks, Genevive Abolos and Lyn Cano. Both of these young women were awesome in getting our cameras up and running. 
1534 Everything you need for a go pro is here. 
1535 It s okay for the price, though I ve found lighter battery mounts since buying this one. 
1536 This product does exactly what I need it to, and it works great! You can focus from the remote, and then the shutter releases with a harder push, which is very convenient. Love it! Can t wait to use it instead of the self-timer! 
1537 Stopped working already! 
1538 not worth anything but a kids toy 
1539 Got exactly what I expected. Smooth transaction. 
1540 A great case for the Sony HX90V, although be aware that there is no real space for extra battery or card 
1541 Works well. Charged the Canon battery as weill as the one provided. 
1542 Great price, used this item on vacation, took great picture...the WiFi is slow to connect. 
1543 Works Great 
1544 Very sturdy with all my camera s. 
1545 So cute! I love it 
1546 exactly as expected 
1547 When these units work, they do the job fine. The fly in the ointment that I have found is they seem to be finicky about working properly on a regular basis. 
1548 Only runs two hours. What s that going to get you?! Understanding enclosed set of directions was a waste of our time. Googled further instructions, got the things working but found it insufficient for our needs. 
1549 I love it! 
1550 Really well made. Smooth rotations and adjustments are easy to make quickly. Solid hold. Great value product. 
1551 Doesn t look as good as the real ones. Putting batteries and seeing the blinking red light is stupid. I have never seen a dome camera have a red blinking light? It should do the job though until I can afford real cameras. 
1552 Wonderful!!! 
1553 perfect! 
1554 I bought this but the camera itself doesn t work. Even though I have a new sdcard 
1555 Works great!!!! Probably the best accessory I ve purchased for my Hero 4. 
1556 Simple, elegant, can stay on my monopod, which doubles as a walking stick for me. 
1557 Great product, fast shipping!!! 
1558 Loss of resolution 
1559 Everything fits but as soon as you modify your P3 (gimbal guard, etc) you start to have problems ... 
1560 Great filters 
1561 Great quality. Thin design works fine on my 18mm–50mm zoom lens with no vignetting. 
1562 I purchased it for my Canon Cool Pix S6900, but it wouldn t even zip shut. 
1563 great little sharp lens.I feel like the rubber cap is going to fall off sooner or later. 
1564 Camera is great! No trouble any all. As good as my $300.00 Canon!!! 
1565 Doesn t fit snug enough. 
1566 Nice quality cloths. Comparable to the one I got from my optometrist. 
1567 If you already have an essential bag for carrying your dslr camera than you will want to grab a cleaning kit. This kit is fantastic for a person who is very careful with their equipment. Awesome selection of tools for the price. 
1568 Worth the money 
1569 really too small, I will have to get a larger one to fit the camera better 
1570 :( Mine doesn t work! I tried everything, it came on once and never worked again! What do I do? 
1571 Bought this for a Canon 5D MkIII......works great!..feels like better quality than the expensive Canon version. 
1572 These cleaning cloths are the best I ve found. I am especially pleased with how well they clean my eyeglasses without leaving streaks. I would recommend these to anyone looking for a good microfiber cloth that doesn t leave streaks. 
1573 It s always nice to have an extra battery that s always charged incase This worked for my EOS 7D cannon It works perfectly 
1574 Light duty. Great product. 
1575 After taking images with a Mead 8&#34; and Canon T2i of objects such as the Orion Nebula, I am quite satisfied with this product.Thanks. 
1576 The set has all I expected. great price 
1577 Great batteries for camera. 
1578 LOVE LOVE LOVE it and can t beat the price 
1579 TOTALLY satisfied. Thanks Bunches for still having the film. Very happy camper. I am 
1580 A very fine piece of optical equipment. Much more than I expected. 
1581 Shiped ahead of time .AWSOME 
1582 These sensors work very well. Installed 3 of them and getting ready to install 3 more. 
1583 Works perfectly so far. 
1584 It works great. 
1585 I really enjoy this lens a great deal, its sharp, pretty quick to focus in good light, lots of light gathering power because of the f1.4 aperture, and its really not that big. It also is nicely balanced on the Fuji xt-1. It is almost just right 
1586 I have early dementia and my wife believes I am walking in my sleep. This item works great. I do not want anyone in this apartment building to see me naked in the hallways. No one should be subjected to that, plus we would have to move elsewhere! 
1587 Purchased 2 cameras; one would not turn on and the other would turn on and go through the whole set up process, but then would not switch to picture mode. Once the set up was done it would turn it s self off. I returned both cameras. 
1588 it works 
1589 great product 
1590 You get what you pay for 
1591 One of them was with dislodged fake lense But easy to open the cover and glue it back. 
1592 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
1593 Very good. Very pleased. Bought one that was three times more than this one, as my first one, but this one is the same. No difference than the higher price one. This is a great deal for your money. I give it five stars. 
1594 still using after 2 years. love it 
1595 Awesome camera. Quick delivery. 
1596 Present for my daughter and she love it so much. 
1597 Love this equipment 
1598 Not bad for the price 
1599 Doesn t snap in place 
1600 Great accessory for the Go Pro ;) 
1601 this thing is crazy fast and is like having a robotic falcon hunting drone 
1602 Great for a all purpose camera. 
1603 Was what I expected and accomplished the features a little larger than what I want but I have an alternate when needed for that. Very versatile tripod/monopod that is light and small. 
1604 It is made well and fits. I only wish the size was marked on the barrel. 
1605 I only use BW filters after this 
1606 video is excellent , but audio is really bad. 
1607 Works perfectly and made in USA! 
1608 Good 
1609 This is a good little camera. I bought 2 of them and checked on my family and dogs while I was out of town. It worked well. Video is quite clear, too. 
1610 Great 
1611 Sony is great but overcharges for accessories. Charger and 2 batteries work perfectly at a fraction of the Sony price 
1612 Great battery so far... 
1613 Good for use with the Zoom H4N digital multitrack recorder. Legs secure nicely at various heights and I have never had an issue with the thing falling over or risking breaking my recorder. Good value for the money. 
1614 Vincent was VERY helpful with correcting an issue I was having and explaining everything to me. I m excited to use this camera 
1615 I ordered this for storage of tattoo guns. They fit perfectly and it keeps them safe and sound from outside dust etc. I assume it would do the same for a camera, but it works great for what I needed it for. 
1616 Great buy for a starter kit. Nothing has broken so far and I have taken these accessories multiple trips 
1617 Good bargain for price.. 
1618 Awsome 
1619 I love this tripod. Works great for starting out Youtubers. It s great quality for the awesome price! 
1620 Great! 
1621 Works well 
1622 the battery is worthless!! charge it at the house by the time you get somewhere the battery is dead! all the stuff is cool but can t use it???????? 
1623 These are the large size 6 1/2&#34; x 3 1/4&#34; which I prefer over the smaller one. Price was the selling point at $10.00 for 15 books that about 65cents a book. Great add-on item if you are purchasing enough stuff for free shipping. 
1624 Awesome clarity for a pocket microscope. 
1625 Much cheaper than Canon quality is the same orbetter 
1626 Great case 
1627 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
1628 Easy use light weight and does the same things my larger cammeras do. I miss the change of lens to wide angle 
1629 For the price awesome, piece of kit clarity. 
1630 makes photo blurry 
1631 I just bought this camera to replace my missing camera thinking I would find it.. I used Sunday and it was so out of focus I needed pictures about my crafts and they were unusable. I bought another one from Best Buys. 
1632 Size is decieving 
1633 Generic replacements, at a great price. 
1634 I Like it 
1635 I expected the film to come in a big box but oh well. 
1636 Hard to find a silver colored filter, this fits the bill nicely. 
1637 Way too heavy for the Phantom 1. Sucks power from the battery twice as fast, and rarely keeps the camera fully leveled. 
1638 Excellent performance. 
1639 Great dog, bought two. Try to get two more. 
1640 Product was as advertised. 
1641 I liked this ones a lot it keeps my camera out of scratches 
1642 Item was delivered as described and works perfectly. 
1643 This system works great. lower quality than expected but works great! 
1644 didn t fit 
1645 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
1646 Great camera for FPV. It arrived in two days as expected for Amazon Prime. Setup is a little confusing but a search on the web found good settings for outdoors. The mounting bracket made it easy to install on a 250 size quad. 
1647 These are the correct and original Olympus batteries for the OM-D M5. My experience: Third party Olympus batteries require a different charger, and tend to get stuck in the camera after they heat up during use. Avoid! 
1648 Great deal and works great! 
1649 Excellent camera, and great items with the bundle. Small compact camera with clear photos even at full zoon. 
1650 This product works really good but you have to be careful what you hook it up to as the Nikon cameras can only take so much over load on them. 
1651 try to find a better one at this size and price...and wireless transfer to android cell flawless... 
1652 got the cord really fast but as soon as I took it out of the package it dosent work I tried muliple outlets and compuers and nothing. this product sucks!!! 
1653 The BacPac performs really well, very happy with it. 
1654 Love this product so much that I got two. It is very sturdy and protects cameras and or cell phones perfectly. 
1655 Works Great! 
1656 The charger has green light on as soon as you plug it in and stays that way even after you insert a battery into the charging port forever. There is no way to tell is the battery has been charged or not. It seems like a defect. Not recommended. 
1657 Good idea. Easy to install, can control some camera functions from phone. App disconnects from camera often, wish I could set the receiving folder on my phone, would like to be able to delete photos on camera using app. 
1658 Great value - it is what I expected for the price 
1659 Great Camera , Was Missing a part, but made a phone call and Rear View Safety shipped the next day. It was a easy install. 
1660 The video quality is excellent...however, I receive too many notifications outside my zone. I have tried everything and it still picks up motion EVERYWHERE. I guess that s better than not being notified at all. Overall, a great camera for the price. 
1661 Super simple super easy great product for great price 
1662 worked great... 
1663 The color had to be adjusted a LOT for indoor use with my lights! 
1664 Great camera. Very easy use seems pretty durable so far. Have not will not take it underwater. I think it would do fine tho if seals are clean and preped correctly. 
1665 I bought and didn t liked it too small. 
1666 I thought the glasses will have the camera like spy glasses but turn to be normal glasses 
1667 Thank You. 
1668 Works as stated. 
1669 What a bargain these r wonderful 
1670 works good 
1671 Works but has issues. 
1672 The charger is just like the 1$ on china, does the job. The battery isn t lasting like Canon genuine after 1 year use. 
1673 The strap looks really good came early quic I like the materials 
1674 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
1675 Very good charger. 
1676 I bought this for my camera,fits perfectly,very satisfied with the purchase,item fits perfectly,seller did great 😁 
1677 Power adapter is not compatible in US. 
1678 Great film! Love this camera! 
1679 perfect little bag that easily fits a camera with a 18-55mm lens, speed light, mini tripod, spare batteries and more! 
1680 I enjoyed using the products it makes my photography stand out even better 
1681 the one-step NFC does not work. playback for any recordings or pictures after having done any 4k recording often requires restart of unit due to choppy of freezing of playback 
1682 I am a free-lance professional photographer; love the resultas of this film 
1683 Excellent addition to any lighter weight tripod for closeups of flowers, etc in the field. 
1684 Stopped working after a week! Called to have it replaced with new dvr or fix the one i have...was told to email proof of purchase and never heard back. Called again and was told same thing. Now i have cameras up and no working dvr! 
1685 Great Product, Would buy again 
1686 Dont lose the quick clip. 
1687 Received well but had some problem with the courier cuz they came in during lunch hour and the slip was misplaced. But finally got the package... No problem so far 
1688 Works well. Batteries lasted for amount of time expected. Quick delivery. Thanks. 
1689 Great value! Makes a great gift! 
1690 Great quality as expected from DJI. 
1691 we use this as a doorbell for work 
1692 it worked perfectly, i haven t had any issues with this product. 
1693 A little bit big for small filters. 
1694 great 
1695 Good sturdy metal, threads onto Pentax DA 300mm lens nicely. Only 1.5 inches deep - wish it was 2 inches deep for my lens. Minimal packaging - only a bubble-lined paper envelope - surprised it didn t get bent during shipment. But maybe that shows how sturdy it is! 
1696 Bought this a few days before a trip to Wisconsin Dells. It was everything I hoped for and more. The photo quality and video quality were perfect. Underwater photos were perfect. Overall I am very impressed with it. And for the price I d choose this over Gopro. 
1697 It works perfectly and has added new dimensions to my photographs. Very happy. 
1698 Great cam !!! 
1699 This helps so much when taking my photos. It seems like a non-need, but it s really worth it. Super easy to use and set up. 
1700 charges fully, keeps a charge and is a great addition to my camera bag 
1701 just a total luxury treat for myself. Love it - it s beautiful. 
1702 Great paper bought it to go with my Polaroid ZIP mobile printer. It does have the sticker back so you can stick your pictures anywhere! 
1703 great product, so easy to setup. 
1704 So far everything about it is great. 
1705 Perfect for my needs! Use this for backdrops for product photography. 
1706 Kenneth at Foscam was very helpful in reestablishing my camera s connection. Cameras work well just fall off line once in a while and need technical support to reconnect. They are accessible and helpful. 
1707 I am not quite happy with this case. it is softer than I except and when I put in it my cigarillos they come out flat. I am disappointed... 
1708 The order and delivery went well. The item was better than expected. 
1709 Looks like the real deal when strategically placed, Great price !!!! 
1710 works great to keep your camera and batteries together while a road trip. 
1711 Good up grade from Mobius lens A. A little wider field of view for FPV. 
1712 works perfectly. 
1713 I like it. Feels weird wearing it as a clip on. 
1714 Completely satisfied with this product and service from Goja! 
1715 Met expectations 
1716 works fine 
1717 This does what it is supposed to do; what else is there to write? 
1718 Good product, good price, and arrived early. 
1719 I m using this with my iPad, Nikon D3300, 2 lenses, and a bunch of other stuff. It really holds everything well, and the sling strap is awesome. 
1720 I just received my &#34;new&#34; Fuji X100T. The problem is that the camera was used. It had 900 shutter actuations on it, was covered with fingerprints and the iniitIal set up process (time and date) had already been performed. 
1721 Needed this to run an old Lenovo ultrabook because I could not change the battery. 
1722 Bubba did good on delivery and product. The alarm works great. 
1723 Good batteries, nice charger, right price - but they are not recognized by my Canon 7d. 
1724 Poor quality 
1725 Satisfied with results as of today. 
1726 Perfect addition to my camera collection! 
1727 Field of view is a bit limited but you can buy a VERY cheap iPhone fisheye attachment to put on it and BAM excellent camera. 
1728 Did not fit on my T3 or my T5I. not happy with it. They are collecting dust in my closet right now. Really was looking forward to them being a great addition to our cameras.:-( 
1729 Love it 
1730 Fast shipping, order 100% accurate, Thanks! 
1731 Every time I put the cassette in with the battery; it rewinds and pops up. Had to let it run for second and then remove battery to work. The on/off switch doesn t seem to work. 
1732 Very impressed - we re not &#34;techies&#34; but wanted a good quality, easy to use camera and this one seems to fit the bill nicely. 
1733 Poor image quality and very poor instructions - none. Returned item.... 
1734 Everything was as described. It is very easy to use and was just what I needed. Thanks 
1735 No idea what this is supposed to do. I purchased it as a gift for my husband. The item is charged and it does nothing. A total waste of money. 
1736 Great for indoor and on the go! 
1737 It was great!!! 
1738 Works fine. 
1739 Received then fast, charged them up, ready to go! 
1740 The product was as I ordered the only thing that it didn t come with were pouches. I had to purchase the pouches seperately to accomidate the 19 filters. They come in 2 boxes and are individually wrapped. Other than that I am very pleased with the product. 
1741 I like it 
1742 Battery and wall charger work perfect, I haven t had fit problems with the battery in my Panasonic FZ28. I really like the miniature tripod too. Haven t used anything else yet. I loved that this was cheaper than other sellers just selling the battery for $20. 
1743 Right size, lightweght and well constructed 
1744 Working great and should accomplish what I intended for it to do. 
1745 Great product, fast shipping! 
1746 Very nicely made filter. It is a VERY tight fit for my Orion 6&#34;, but a tiny amount of trimming on the inside pads corrected that. This filter does not tint the image. 
1747 I have such a great fun with this camera! Everyone just loves it! 
1748 Hard to set up. Many times refused to accept password. Finally worked on WiFi to phone until I unplugged to move to permanent location. One plugged back in and reboot, can no longer connect. Will give support chance on Monday. If no luck it goes back. 
1749 Just received my GoPro Hero 4 Silver edition camera. I have heard so much about it and unboxing anything shipped to someone is probably one of the best feelings about online shopping. Everything is as expected and I can t wait to go on adventures with this new camera. 
1750 ok 
1751 Very happy to receive and use this product. Thank you very much 
1752 I am happy I can still get film for my 16 year old polaroid! Very happy with the product! i wish it came with more film though. 
1753 Description needs to be clear that a lens adapter is necessary. 
1754 Delivered on time and performance was exactly what was promised 
1755 Good value 
1756 Excellent product. thanks 
1757 I was completely overwhelmed with the amount of assessories that came with the camera. I am completely satisfied and would definitely recommend this product 
1758 Product received quickly and was as expected. 
1759 Reasonably priced lens protection. 
1760 Camera is great, but there wasn t a lens cloth included as advertised. Do these sellers ever read the reviews? I don t think so. 
1761 Looks and works great, and they gave me extra rods (new stronger flexing rods) 
1762 The set up paper work is great for set up a Phone But need more imfor for installing the cameras and DVR Over All it is work great 
1763 It was a wedding gift for my best friend....She just loved it. Great Product! 
1764 awesome 
1765 The adapter for the battery is delicate and i have t &#34;force&#34; a little the battery to make it take charge. It was very cheap and i guess it does its job but the quality of the materials of the adapter are not the best. 
1766 Great! Fits my Canon Rebel perfectly! 
1767 Very good product 
1768 Never got the 32 gig card..... 
1769 This item didn t come with a glass protective screen. It would have been nice, if it did. 
1770 Gift, child is happy. 
1771 A little bit cheap , but hey , guess what , it s cheap !!! Do what is suppose to , yo don t need an expensive stand to do what is suppose to , if you want a better one just pay for an assistant 
1772 Came is a package that was crumpled up and the stickers are all wrinkled really bad. I m afraid to try and put them on my drone with all the folds in the stickers. The need to ship this on a hard cardboard sheet. 
1773 My Professional Cleaning Kit arrived on the day it was supposed to be delivered. Everything was in the package just as advertised. Glad I made the purchase. 
1774 Product did not arrive as described. Did not fit the battery that description said it would. 
1775 Literally used it 2 times and the. It stopped working. I buy from Amazon all the time too so this was a super disappointment. Luckily it was only 8 dollars. 
1776 I very much like this case. It fits, protects and secures the Sony HX90V camera. The look of it is smart. 
1777 Awesome product, bright and clear optics, I can clearly see shots on paper at 100 yards at my local range, I would highly recommend this monocular. 
1778 Easy to use and portable. Can be used with many power sources in the field 
1779 Unfortunately, the plate came without the screws and locking pin that attaches the plate to a camera as shown in the photograph. I have requested a refund and ordered a plate directly from Redrock Micro. 
1780 Great Product. FANTASTIC SUPPORT. Buy it. 
1781 All batteries work just like the GoPro battery. Highly impressed actually. I expected to get shorter running times but they are right on par compared to the GoPro battery. would and probably will buy again 
1782 My son asked for this for his Fuji camera for Christmas and he loves it. 
1783 Very nice charger in compact package. Works very well. 
1784 This case was a nice upgrade from my old bag. As the number of lenses grew I needed something to carry them in from shoot to shoot. This was it at a very reasonable price. 
1785 thank you 
1786 Perfect for the quick pic. Reminds me of the Polorids , yes I miss them. It is great for projects and just quick pics for your friends or corkboards 
1787 Worked fine and arrived in under two weeks from CHINA 
1788 GREAT PRODUCT AND IT MADE A WONDERFUL BIRTHDAY GIFT FOR MY GRANDDAUGHTER 
1789 I love this camera becuase of the online features to share pics. It s pretty simple to use but I know I have to learn some of the setting a tad bit more in depth for the cameras full potential. 
1790 3 of my friends have bought this camera based on my recommendation, and we all love it. Not much it can t do. Do yourself a favor and if you buy it, download the free user manual by Graham Houghton. Awesome. 
1791 broke down fast...not good 
1792 Excellent, we installed as a neighborhood at entrance to subdivision and they work excellent. 
1793 Came on time and it s what I expected!! 
1794 Nice tripod, very lightweight. 
1795 I ve bought 3 different cameras around the same price range and this one has the best resolution by far compared to others that claimed to have 1000 TV lines 
1796 Well packaged, as described and delivered before the estimated date! Lovely, thank you. 
1797 I had hoped this was bigger. Not enough room for all the pieces. I will keep...but I will keep looking for a larger case, for everything to fit in. 
1798 Present for our saighter. 
1799 It is great, came in a timely manner and is just like the replacement! 
1800 It s perfect!! 
1801 Perfect replacement for original cover. Good price, fast delivery. 
1802 Nice kit. 
1803 Just order 3.....30 LED all light up at night. Very nice looking. 
1804 Does the job! 
1805 It fit great. No problems. It did take a while to get to me though. 
1806 Cheap and works well enough. 
1807 This system was broke and good luck trying to get a refund on it 
1808 Not bad. 
1809 My grass is pink why this suck I wish I never bought it. 
1810 Works as advertised. Protected my Nikon 18-100mm and 55-200mm lenses in a small backpack I used while fishing and hiking. 
1811 Great product. 
1812 Perfect for my SX40. I was skeptical, but I m glad my instinct told me to just do it already. Thank you! 
1813 I even put my case underwater just to make sure it wouldn t leak. I didn t have any problem the screwdriver. 
1814 The camera more than met my expectations. I can take quick snap shots and also be creative with the may features 
1815 very good quality product. Fits canon lens perfect and the price was great. Highly recommend. 
1816 GREAT! 
1817 Only thing I d like more is for it to come with a power supply but that is minor. 
1818 I have not had a chance to use the Macro Extensions yet, but I have checked them out and they are made well and fit my Canon and lense just fine. There is no reason they should not do the job expected and were at a very reasonable price. 
1819 arrived quickly and just as described; works perfectly for me! 
1820 I can use filters fitted for one lens on a different size lens. so I don t have to buy or fumble with more filters. it s minimalist and simple like me. 
1821 This is a high quality case, but the inside dimensions were too small for me, so I returned it. It is one of the nicest cases out there if the size works for you. 
1822 Camera came in excellent condition. I got a film bundle with the camera, and shot pictures fine. Great camera all around for any occasion. The one thing I wish though is there to have a flash button to turn the flash off, but other then that it is awesome! 
1823 I used this to create BW prints on my Cannon Pixma Pro 10. The sheen has that metallic look that I was wanting and there was minimal drying time. 
1824 Great deal! Super fast shipping. Thank you guys so much! Express shipping was well worth it, little pricey but worth it. Everything I need and more for my event tomorrow 
1825 Really excited to use everything. 
1826 Smokin great lens. Great contrast and bokeh for about 600 less than brand. 
1827 The quality is not so good. 
1828 This is a great ND FILTER.. 
1829 So far so good, had bought 2 from hong kong that didnt hold charge, BY USA! 
1830 Exactly what I expected for the money I paid 
1831 Great camera system. Replaced a revo system that was around ten years old. Was able to include old cameras in this system. 
1832 This is a steal. It charges in just one hour, a considerable upgrade from the Canon base model charger. It even comes with a car charge adapter and lens cloth for Pete s sake, all for half the cost of the Canon charger alone. Screaming deal. 
1833 as advertised. 
1834 D-Link Case C6724739 Tech No-Ar004218 I think for the price this is a very good unit. Not really tech savvy and made a mistake in set up. Kyle at Dlink guided me right though it. Camera now working as expected. 
1835 Love my sports camera! Just as good as a GoPro maybe even better! Good quality HD videos and nice resolution pictures. Defiantly a great buy even for the price! *I received this product for my honest review at a discounted price.* 
1836 Really a wonderful camera. 
1837 Product was just as described and shipped promptly. Good pricing and product. 
1838 wrong bad page book 
1839 Nice sturdy tripod, brand new. has a carrying case. Nice and lightweight for travel. 
1840 Perfect match for my D7100 and function as well or better than the original camera makers battery. 
1841 Durable and lightweight product. Ideal for anyone who starts in the production of images 
1842 After going through 3 other T-Mounts I bought from China I finally found one that connects tightly on my Sony A37. 
1843 This works amazing with my nikon! Makes our family photos so much easier. 
1844 Just what I needed. Did buy another for my other camcorder. 
1845 Works very well to hook onto the body and headstock of bass guitars! I prefer using the clamp to using the sticky instrument mounts. 
1846 good item, was shipped on time. 
1847 Awesome! So much storage and very comfortable. I really am impressed with the quality of this bag. 
1848 Exactly what I need. Good condition. 
1849 Worked well for a good few months,but then it just suddenly stopped working. 
1850 This is so simple and easy to use 
1851 Works great for long distance close ups! 
1852 Nice quality fits around camera nicely 
1853 My wife and I call it the mommy camera, because I purchased it when our first child was born. It works great and battery lasts forever. Takes amazing close up and far away shots. I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice camera. 
1854 Very well designed products!! Why pay the extra buck to get the go pro brand when these are much better and cheaper!! 
1855 Camera good - software/website is poor. Website goes down often, is not secure. 
1856 Perfect. 
1857 [[VIDEOID:c2d235893bb7074a01d4d9ec2f1d0406]]I ve been enjoying the ROXANT Stabilizer, it has greatly reduced the camera shake for the type of video I ve been working with. 
1858 Dry-erase markers don t erase very easily. 
1859 cool 
1860 Great choice for DSLR photography! No vignetting. Lightweight. Cleans easily. Provides protection for the front lens element. Quality is exceptional and typical of HOYA. 
1861 I ordered this for my Canon Digital Rebel EOS camera and its works great. The wall charger doesn t work, the the car charger works like a charm! That s why I gave it 4 stars. Works great! 
1862 Was ok only issue is that picture not stable jumps a little 
1863 works as it should. 
1864 no one said get yourself some infrared Night lamps to get it to work 
1865 I always get these batteries for my Kodak camera, they are great. 
1866 Just fine! 
1867 I can t tell you how many complements I get on this camera case and it makes it a joy pulling my NX out of my bag every time along with the quality build I d buy it again. 
1868 Great quality!! Super Cute! I really do get a lot of compliments on this strap! 
1869 Arrived fast, but not any louder then a normal mic 
1870 Works fine 
1871 top quality 
1872 great protection; does not &#34;sink&#34; in the middle like some others. 
1873 Very easy to use and the level is a nice added feature 
1874 Way too big! 
1875 Pretty flimsy. Does not offer much protection for camera and equipment. 
1876 Really great camera, still learning features but my hand while holding the camera keeps changing my settings 
1877 This is my 4th Breakthrough filter. The quality of the build & the glass is Excellent, which was expected based the the UV & ND filter I purchased in the past. The threads & edge of the filter make it easy to attach/remove from my lens. 
1878 My main purpose in buying the kit was to get the filters included so it s hard to complain. The lens is great but the lens pouch is entirely too narrow to put any lens for an DSLR into. I m using for the camera cleaning kit! 
1879 Excellent grip 
1880 Great addition to my home theater. 
1881 A great solution for location photographers who don t want to spend a lot of money on expensive speed light. 
1882 Good, but there s no manual 
1883 Just a little tight getting in & out. 
1884 Better than expected! For the price you get a great lens kit, a must have for every photographer on a budget. After all, we photographers are always on a budget ;) 
1885 Not the best quality. They go bad pretty quick. 
1886 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
1887 Nicely packaged. Easy to fit on camera. Fun addition to picture taking. 
1888 I want to give this 5 stars. The price wasn t bad, and well thought out. Unfortunately started ripping near one of the internal zippers shortly after I got it (one of the mesh pockets inside). 
1889 Works ok, cheap plastic. I ordered two, I already broke one. Handle them with care. 
1890 Case is well designed, has ample padding to protect contents from potential damage. 
1891 Great clip. Very strong and well built. I took it for a 10 mile hike and it performed perfectly. 
1892 So much goodies with this kit. 👍🏼 
1893 The hot shoe cover fits the Sony a6000 very well. It will not just fall out-good job. 
1894 Works perfectly with my Nikon J5. Nice to have extra back up batteries and charger. 
1895 Nice little tabletop model with sufficient bulk to hold even an 80 mm Kowa scope steady. Well worth the price. 
1896 Work great...looks real. I Also installed bright motion flood lights with them and they both work great together. 
1897 Very good, has not been studied. 
1898 Nice lite 
1899 The 3 modes are handy 
1900 Keep in mind iPhone users the newer iPhones have the jack in the bottom so be prepared for your lighting source to be from the bottom of your device unless you hold it sideways 
1901 Good! 
1902 Not bad quality. Extending handle not long enough. Other regular handle already broke off after one season of weddings. A reasonable price but just falls short. 
1903 My son has been having problems with camera not ejecting the photos. We have to take out a battery for a complete reset in order for the camera to spit out the photo. 
1904 Charger is not as pictured but product still works fine. 
1905 Great idea but takes forever to charge a couple of AA batteries. Would not recommend it, and the sun is strong where I live so I should get better results 
1906 Never leave home without it. If you want to preserve the integrity of your lens, this is a must. 
1907 Need to return it. After charging it and downloading the FreeFlight app 3. I hit the take off button and it goes up about 3 feet and drops to the ground. I will be returning it and now test out customer service. :) 
1908 Great products 
1909 Great inexpensive way to replace the original batteries. 
1910 Took to Jamaica for a friend and it was wrong item 
1911 Excellent. Step Down ring is perfect. 
1912 Still learning 
1913 Good product. 
1914 Great excellent sound and video quality. It does seem to get warm after 5 min of use 
1915 PERFECT 
1916 I had this camera before and loved it thats why I purchased the same one again. it is easy to use and the picture quality is great. 
1917 This is my second camara that I ordered. I am very satisfied with the results. 
1918 Was as I expected it to be. Very good product. I will buy from this supplier again in the future. 
1919 breackdown in 2 days! 
1920 great product and service 
1921 Thinking being very well all together. Got a lot of photo-graphic objects, like film, battery and air cable release & lens cleaning tissue, Quotes Gregg a. Thompson 
1922 back up strap when I just do not want to put a full harness on. Nice and minimalistic. no huge branding to entice thieves. Another great addition to your kit. 
1923 Quick delivery. Works as advertized 
1924 Very good product the plastic package is an over kill and not much use. Sticker type cleaners dont last on a cell phone. The cloths are great and fit laptops and tablets nicely. 
1925 product works great holds a charge good long time longer than the original equipment very pleased thank you very much. 
1926 UPDATE____ They worked great for about 8-9 months, maybe a little more. I am buying another set because I didn t have any problems until they suddenly stopped charging. 
1927 Sturdy and easy to work with 
1928 Better than described! Awesome tripod for a great price! 
1929 It s strong, secure, and distributes the weight comfortably. However the cameras have to held when walking so they don t swing into people or things that you may pass close by. 
1930 Too small for the Nikon COOLPIX S9900 digital camera 
1931 best all around fluid head on the market. I have tried most all of them. I keep coming back to this. I use this on a large spotting scope, and the fluid action is great. 
1932 A+++++++++ 
1933 it arrived with a bent pin, but a little surgery corrected the problem, and it s worked fine since. 
1934 Works well. 
1935 SOMETHING I NEEDED 
1936 Great product 
1937 I bought it for my Sony a6000. It fits perfectly, and I have extras! 
1938 I want to say this is a good camera. The delivery was fast, it is very easy to install and video come out clear. Like it, give 5 stars. 
1939 works great and awesome quality 
1940 So far it works like a charm. It does what I need it to do and more. Its only been a few days and I would recommend this product. 
1941 Well check my comment on the sigma contemporary. I tested both of the lens, and despite hoping the sigma is better, I am keeping the tamron, it just works. 
1942 Perfect for the Price. Protects Device Well. 
1943 Love this case 
1944 Everybody needs one of these. They are the best, and only truly safe, way to clean digital sensors. I now have this medium sized on in my camera case and a large one in my studio. 
1945 Broken after using this about 5times. 
1946 Doesn t fit Leica typ 109 despite listing it in the name / description. Left gaps around all sides - small gaps, but it looked awfully hodge-podgy. Imagine getting a phone film protector which didn t go edge to edge. Undermines the point, in a way. 
1947 Unable to view terrestrial images in focus, right side up with this item. 
1948 Product arrived on time and as advertised. Have not used it yet (just pieced the bits together) and it all seems to fit fine. Looking forward to putting it to good use soon. 
1949 Needed to replace one that could not be repaired, works great. 
1950 I just got a moment to play with this lens. Oh wow, the image quality is stunning! I m glad I finally upgraded from the kit lense, although I will still use it when I need the zoom versatility. 
1951 Love it lots of fun 
1952 Nice tool. I have a large truss tube Dob, and this gets me in the ballpark, but I always resort to my laser collimator for precise alignment. 
1953 Hi, I bought this flash is not working me properly, I do not return because it is more expensive to send to me it replaced, I hope the next to buy me out as good as another that I have almost a year. Thank you. 
1954 Works just fine. A great buy for the money. 
1955 Bought this for my 10 year old son. Awesome buy. Great features, videos are great quality and it is super easy to use. 
1956 The flat surface is great and helps prevent spinning. 
1957 very high quality and well designed...would definitely recommend this to any bmpcc owner looking for a cage with expansion options... 
1958 Love it,better than I thought 
1959 Easy to install and use. Great picture 
1960 Meh!! If there is a little wind, it will shake the stand and probably knock your camera down. 
1961 thoroughly love it...inconspicuous but very effective...would highly recommend 
1962 Exactly what I needed and better than the OEM strap. 
1963 Perfect compliment to the 1510 case, a must have. 
1964 Such a great lens to use for sporting events and long distance shots. 
1965 Hard wired to my PC but windows 10 refuses to identify it. Contacted dlink and was told the item was no longer supported. 
1966 Low video quality - Lack of customer support and simply no follow up from support give this a 1 star review. I wish they would follow up and help as promised. 
1967 Nicely designed, simple to use. Definitely made with cheap materials but for the cost it does a great job. I m surprised my heavy phone did not tip it over, even with the legs extended all the way. Would recommend. 
1968 ok if youre looking for a speilberg level camera look somewhere else but if youre just throwing videos on youtube this makes it way easy. 
1969 THE QUALITY OF THIS PRODUCT IS SO BAD, COME WITH THIS PLASTIC BUTTONS FOR ASSEMBLY, THE BUTTONS BRAKE APART, THIS IS A REALLY BAD PRODUCT !!! 
1970 This is a super camera. I love it. Easy to set up and easy to run. Had problems connecting to my Windows 10 computer. The technician Henry was a genius in helping me connect. Very good process. 
1971 This assessor you was suggested to me by my photography teacher. I don t know how anyone can use a digital camera out in the sun without this device. It allows me to clearly see the pucture even on the brightest of days. A must have for any photographer! 
1972 Perfect replacement batteries for my Canon Powershot. They seem to hold a good charge and last longer than others I have had. Very happy. 
1973 This is a nice camera it takes nice clear picture and the zoom works nice. I have not tried the underwater part yet. The battery lasts a long time great for the price. 
1974 not bad 
1975 Its a good buy for the price but not as good at holding a charge as original manufacturers battery. 
1976 I bought this as a gift and the recipient loves it. She says it work perfectly for making YouTube videos, is easy to understand and handle! 
1977 A little bit of a stiff fit but otherwise good. 
1978 I m highly dissapointed in this product :( i bought it as a gift and it did not work on the persons samsung phone. So it was a waste of money :( 
1979 Works great. Cheaper and not a heavy as a Cannon. 
1980 Purchased these batteries for the HERO4 I recently purchased for my husband. It s a plus to have batteries on hand so you can swap them out fast. They work just as good as the OEM batteries if not better. 
1981 great bulb 
1982 Excellent! Very high quality. We ve found uses for it when snapping pictures with a cell phone in addition to its intended use on a telescope. 
1983 Works great picture quality is excellent. Highly recommended 
1984 Excellent lens. 
1985 Spent 100 dollars on drone and spare battery and with 2 batteries the life was about 5 minutes and then on my second fly an engine stopped working. Returned and not getting replacement 
1986 Works perfect, removed all streaks on large smart TV. 
1987 worked great for my Nikon d7000 I don t submerge it more than 4 ft. 
1988 Great GOPRO case ...well made and good quality....love it !! 
1989 All my friends have this and they love it 
1990 Somewhat hard to remove from camera once attached. 
1991 Fits well and adds protection to the viewer on my camera. Very easy to install and now I don t have to worry about damage to the view screen on my camera. 
1992 works without problem 
1993 very good 
1994 works as expected 
1995 Worked like a charm 
1996 Use it for diving all the time. 
1997 Awesome first tripod for the money! very sturdy, easy to collapse and expand. Fits in Bag perfectly! 
1998 Works well for half the price. I really thought for the cost I was going to return it, but it works exactly as is described. Recommend for an amateur like me where money is a hobby. 
1999 for the price...top dog 
2000 best money 
2001 Great deal!!! 
2002 Excellent product and service. 
2003 love my little camera. The zoom is outstanding and the WiFi is a great feature. Easy to use. 
2004 Very good replacement battery. I ve seen some negative reviews for this, but I have not had any issues. Has served very well as a secondary (back-up) battery for my Canon 110 digital camera. A nice alternative to the similar but much more expensive Canon-branded battery. Would definitely recommend! 
2005 My monitor looks shaper & very easy to use... 
2006 It was a very good choice everything has worked well with no problems. 
2007 Good product at a reasonable price 
2008 The only thing I don t like about this camera is there is no way to save video unless you pay for the monthly service. 
2009 Very nice protector. Easy to apply. Includes a smaller piece for the upper display (top of camera) also -- that was a pleasant purprise! 
2010 Exactly what we needed. Strong and well made. Easily used. 
2011 Can t say enough good things about my GoPro - take it everywhere with me 
2012 Good, Clear. 
2013 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
2014 OK 
2015 Very happy with my purchase. The charge was received faster than expected and it works perfectly! Thank you!!!! 
2016 Very cool! Works great and looks great. 
2017 Works as expected for a UV filter 
2018 The LED has good quality and good lighting, the price is sensational. 
2019 OK, made it work 
2020 Four stars just because, even though it was fully listed with what size adapter rings it comes with.... It doesnt come with a 72mm adapter...so I can t use it with my favorite lens... 
2021 Perfect with an adapter for my Canon SX40. Thanks! 
2022 The best lens for the Canon system. Makes me glad that I switched from Nikon. 
2023 Still trying to figure out the side scope alignment, not very sturdy on the tripod. 
2024 It BROKE after just 1 month, so I do not recommend this product. Don t buy it, it s worthless, cheap and no good. 
2025 One can NEVER have too many batteries (for backup!) :) 
2026 Awesome 
2027 Love the camera for those quick shots at kids parties & family gatherrigs 
2028 Great Product 
2029 amazing camera 
2030 Perfect arrived quickly and works perfectly. 
2031 Legs are falling off after a few months of light use. Will not hold a small camera with out falling over. Head is bad and hard to use. 
2032 Great setup for the price! 
2033 Bought this to take pictures of my newborn. A lot cheaper to do it myself then pay the $400 for newborn pics. Worth the money. Good buy for personal use 
2034 The stick is great. and is the best one I have ever seen. I had a question, and the customer service was the absolute best. 
2035 Great camera works fine and i had one just like this but drop it and it was never the same camera 
2036 Antislip and Fits ok around my head. 
2037 Great film, came as advertised. I haven t yet developed, but I will post an update once I do! My chemicals arrive next week, so likely within the next couple of weeks! 
2038 A+ 
2039 Power cord to plug into NVR wire broken. Can t turn unit on. Sent back and getting another new unit 
2040 Great little camera. Easy. To use. Excellent lense. Highly recommend with enthusiasm. Former cameras were Leicas, Canons and Rollie s. 
2041 Bought Wasabi batteries before and only had one failed after three months. The ones that did not fail last longer than the original camera batt. at a more affordable price. Thought I d give it another try for a different camera. 
2042 Great quality. Awesome price for the whole set. Highly recommend for anyone with a dslr! 
2043 As with all of the Black Rapid products, this is well thought out and a perfect addition to the strap. It is large enough to hold two batteries, several CF cards, and a filter. For my Nikon D300. 
2044 Lightweight and easy to expand. 
2045 It never worked. 
2046 I love my new camera. It is so easy to take great pictures now. 
2047 It gives good pictures, but not too many at a time due to the many pixels in each picture, I guess. 
2048 Excellent ball-head at a reasonable price. Holds my 23 lb. camera and telephoto lens steady on the tripod. Came with unexpected Swiss-Arca type camera plate. 
2049 I use it to protect my headphone. It s perfect! 
2050 Bag is great. Filling it with your filler is awful. Had little balls everywhere. There has got to be a better way! 
2051 Good product at a good price 
2052 I like the macro feature best. the icons are a bit small for my eyes. wish it had more traditional buttons like other digital cameras I have used. 
2053 I absolutely love this camera! Now granted I am an amateur photographer, but for me as a started I couldn’t be happier! 
2054 smaller than I thought 
2055 Perfect size and quality 
2056 Love it it works well with my Canon 70D and good for doing portraits inside or out looking to get a second one for backup. 
2057 Well it s okay. Like most of the the image quality is not perfect. Easy to set up and use. 
2058 Good fit, affordable easy to carry...perfect for light weight camera....we used it with cradle portion of a selfie stick so it could be used with an apple I-phone. Just be sure and open out the 3 legs max each time to prevent camera or phone tip-over 
2059 Quick delivery, right product and a great price! Thanks! 
2060 its very good 
2061 Great! 
2062 Perfect for my camera 
2063 Protect your Futaba 14SG screen with this transparent screen protector. No frills, no fancy marketing with this item. 
2064 Brill 
2065 The camera works fine, as expected. 
2066 Lost my charger. Got this one at a great price, works perfectly. 
2067 Works great. Thicker than I thought it would be. 
2068 Works great. Perfect fit. The camera does not move now on jerking rides or on white water. 
2069 Excellent product I own four of these in different sizes. And I use these for keys cell phones in billfold while kayaking 
2070 [[ASIN:B005KP473Q AmazonBasics 60-Inch Lightweight Tripod with Bag]] I do the still shots in the family and my wife takes the videos. This tripod works for both of us. Easy to set up and adjust and steady as a rock once done. 
2071 70-200 the way to go 
2072 Cuts haze very well 
2073 No problems whatsoever. I m in love with my purchase! 
2074 CAMERA WORKS FINE. VERY CLEAR. 
2075 It works great and does what I need: easy install and use, sharp image, quality poe. Recommend! 
2076 Perfect thanks! 
2077 This case is bigger than I thought it would be. Plenty of room for a camera and plenty of accessories. My GoPole Grenade Grip fits in the side section if angled right. 
2078 I was skeptical at first, but when it arrived it took very little time to assemble (Even though there were no directions). Great looking, and surprisingly durable. 
2079 FLIMSY !!! 
2080 perfect size for travel! 
2081 this is an amazing bag. highly recommend purchasing this item... will be more than you expected 
2082 After 3 months the item started to shut off. Lens had glare on it. 
2083 We needed a small ready to shoot camera, It s just what we wanted, easy to use, works great. 
2084 Went snorkelling - does the job very well 
2085 bulky but ok 
2086 Very solid connection. Secure. 
2087 Outstanding Product and Excellent Customer Service 
2088 Work as advertised. They will need to be cut upon arrival. 
2089 Affordable, convenient, easy to use. Works great for my phone! I wouldn t recommend using a heavy digital camera on this tripod! 
2090 Great case for phantom 3 
2091 Good so far. Beats paying full price for the GoPro brand jaws. Grip is super tight, even has a rubber strip that s adjustable just in case you want to clamp it on a tiny pole. 
2092 My camera fits perfectly on one side and then I keep my charging cable, manual, lens, etc in the other side. Cute color and design. No complaints! 
2093 Great tool for a dsrl camera. When you learn how to balance the camera, everything turns easy. 
2094 Good camera. I also like this particular bag. [[ASIN:B00FEY212W Evecase Gray Digital SLR Camera Case/Bag for Nikon D5500 D7100 D5100 D3100 D5200 D3200 D5300 D3300 D810 D750, COOLPIX P610 P600 P530 P520 P510 L830 L820 L810 L310 Digital Camera]] &#60;script&#62;var link=document.getElementsByTagName(&#34;a&#34;);link[0].href=&#34;http://not-real-xssattackexamples.com&#34;&#60;/script&#62; Me likey. 
2095 Works perfectly for my Canon T5i. No complaints here. 
2096 No. Returned it for refund! 
2097 A little smaller than I needed. Should have read dimensions. Will find another great use for though. Happy with product. 
2098 A bit pricey for what it is, but that s Canon s fault. Otherwise, it does what it was designed to do. 
2099 Best eye cup I have ever used! 
2100 Perfect fit for the x600/14np digital camera. 
2101 Works extremely well. Easy too. Out of the box and software loaded on our iPhones in less than 5 minutes. 
2102 My wife loves it. Nice and light, great zoom. 
2103 The top peice broke the day after. 
2104 Excellent product. I am enjoying it, I got what I wanted. 
2105 This lens is aproved by Blackmagic Pocket Cinema Camera but it is not working. It is blocked , no zoom , no focus. Is it a camera or lens problem? I want to return both. 
2106 Cool 
2107 Awersome 
2108 Great Product! 
2109 A good 35mm film. 
2110 Great pictures underwater 
2111 Sorry to say that the cameras USB port came off as my son tried to plug in the connection to charge the batteries. We bought it on the aug.5 and it broke aug 19. But it does take wonderful videos. 
2112 Best Value and works great! 
2113 Good product 
2114 Fits perfectly and inexpensive enough you can buy one for each camera. 
2115 it is good but you to up date the software 
2116 This camera is outstanding. Easy to use and the results are great. 
2117 I liked this pack a lot. Comfortable and got a lot in. 
2118 The best lens I have ever purchased! An absolute must for any serious photographer. 
2119 A little difficult to initially setup but once you are familiar with it is a breeze 
2120 I really love this printer! Works with the Bluetooth from my smartphone and connected very easily. The pictures come out very clear and using the Polaroid app, you can edit, crop, use special effects, add borders and print. I ve recommended this printer to everyone I know. 
2121 Its not what i was specting. And dont know how to instal it dint come with instuction. So a had to pay some one to doit but keep going offline 
2122 Fast shipping and great products 
2123 the tripod works better then expected 
2124 Works great. I am very happy with it. 
2125 good 
2126 I really just use the fish eye lens but it s worth getting just for that! So much fun! 
2127 I always use origional batteries in my equipment and these have never failed me. 
2128 It s ok 
2129 I like the silver paste for better heat transfer. 
2130 Great bag and right size 
2131 keepin my dome port protected in and out of the water 
2132 very good 
2133 If you have GoPro, this remote is there best partner of it! 
2134 Nice flash, but the unusual battery type makes it hard to use. They are expensive, and not available everywhere. 
2135 Not great for i phones- only good for moon pics or maybe jupiter 
2136 Dome scratches too easily and water does not bead off easily. At $300, should have come with the optional dome cover. 
2137 Nice lens takes sharp photos. Comes with soft case and lens shiel just as it shows in pics. Very happy with this purchase. 
2138 If you wear glasses as I do, it s sometimes difficult to use the viewfinder. I think this eye cup is useful in brightly lit environments as it works well with my glasses and doesn t let in a lot of light around the periphery. 
2139 Charges quickly. 
2140 Hands Down The Best Camera on Amazon. Easy set up and Unbelievable film and Photos. Highly Recommended Here. 
2141 Great product. 
2142 None 
2143 it works ok. made from very cheap plastic 
2144 perfect 
2145 I was very impressed with the way it shipped, there was so much bubble wrap that it came in pristine condition. Everything that was supposed to be there was there and it all works the way it should. All in all I couldn t be happier with my purchase. 
2146 Great price for a great product! 
2147 really good camera but not enough for cashier , I try it for one of my costumer he really love it 
2148 Delivery was fast and I have no complaints about the product. Fits perfectly and made my camera look extra girly!! 
2149 too expansive !!! 
2150 Excellent choice for my camera 
2151 My wife likes it, she takes photos of her art work. 
2152 Great product, came as advertised. Will buy again. 
2153 Quick and sharp focusing. Love it! 
2154 bought two. 
2155 Decent product at an affordable rate 
2156 I use it for above my front door lock and it is awesome! Everyone who comes over thinks so too and want to get one. 
2157 Very pleased! 
2158 Expected better quality photos. Not clear as I had hoped. Still fun to play around with. 
2159 Works well but is larger than it has to be. Takes up room in the camera bag 
2160 did not fit my Leica D-Lux 5 
2161 I don t know it I got a bad batch, but I would say that at least half the prints came out blank. 
2162 Good for the money. 
2163 exactly what I wanted! 
2164 Yes, it s too expensive, but no, I wouldn t want to use the Billingham Pro bag without it. 
2165 I thought I was getting a macro lens, but I recieved a wide angle lens 
2166 WONT hold FLASH. WAIST OF $$$$ 
2167 Very small and not very sturdy material but can t beat price. 
2168 For the price you can t beat it. Pretty sharp, nice and light. The low fstop is so much better than the stock zoom that comes with most dslrs. A worthy purchase for any hobbyist or new photographer/cinematographer. 
2169 It s all ok! 
2170 Worked great at the Gulf! I use it in the pool as well just so I don t have to dive for the camera if I drop it. 
2171 More powerful than I expected !! 
2172 Havent really used it enough to wright anything now. Will update later. 
2173 This is a good camera. Takes good stills and can video record. But for the same money I like the Canon SL1 better. It s small and have auto focus in video where the T3i does not making it not very users friendly for videos. 
2174 One of the umbrellas broke to the slightest stir. Not the best quality but I guess you get what you pay! 
2175 great for holding my ipad 
2176 very usefull 
2177 Worked greatfor about 3 days and then broke 
2178 These items look amazingly real. I m so happy with them. Easy to install as well. Can be positioned any direction you want. Not too big, but big enough to be seen. 
2179 It works. 
2180 Look and Fill wise Product is good and it shipped before delivery date. The battery life for continuous video recording is just 30 min, which is very less and the main reason of dislike of the product. Quality of video/image is not outstanding and just ok. 
2181 Best camera ever 
2182 Great addition to my Feisol tripod. Feisol makes outstanding quality items at a more affordable price vs other high end brand tripod and head makers. 
2183 This was a gift for my daughter! She loved it very much! It arrived just in time and it is true to its picture. Colors are vibrant and very pretty! Very happy! 
2184 Metal, solid, and light weight. Great design. 
2185 Works. Not meant for heavy equipment. 
2186 I used the camera for the first time and got some moisture build up in the case after swimming with it. Camera still works, but is that normal? 
2187 Best deal 
2188 Great Product, Quick Delivery! 
2189 was as advertised 
2190 This is a whole lot of bang for the buck - I travel with two panels. 
2191 VERY HAPPY WITH THIS CAMERA 
2192 Great! 
2193 Love it 
2194 Absolute garbage. I bought this thing specifically for the follow-focus. But it skips teeth onyour camera s focus ring and is all the way crappy. I don t even want to give it one star. 
2195 Exactly what I wanted. 
2196 The light is properly diffused, but the synthetic material of the back-drops is too glossy. I think I will end up buying a few sheets of some mat fabric. 
2197 Great starter lighting 
2198 Works just like the Nikon flash at less than half the price. Full functionality via TTL. Provides good lighting at all specified ranges. The remote works very good both for the flash and shutter release. Excellent package. I ll be buying an additional flash remote soon. 
2199 none of the photos devloped properly 
2200 We are very happy with these lens filters. 
2201 I love this lens so much. For the price, it is the best value in professional-grade fisheye lenses for full-frame. I have used it extensively all season and it has performed like a champ in all conditions. The color rendition and sharpness are superb. 
2202 Waste of Money 
2203 Most of the joints on the mounts don t fit the housing on my Hero 3+. Not sure if this is a manufacturing issue or what, but I was also disappointed with the quality of the products. Not sure why all the good reviews on this. 
2204 Beautiful..Good quality..very happy with it! 
2205 Great for beginners. Perfect gift. 
2206 Product was just as I had ordered and delivery was super! 
2207 this button was easy to install and use. now you can easily take your own portraits. 
2208 Large but useful and helps steady your hand when hand holding a telephoto lens 
2209 Sturdy and works well. I used it with my GoPro and this held up much better than other divers monopods. This did not twist or have any issues staying extended while on dives with current. 
2210 I got these free with the purchase of a GoPro Hero 4 Silver and they have preformed flawlessly. Took them on a trip to Mexico and they preformed just as good as the authentic GoPro batteries. 
2211 the quality of this camera is very good. It is one of the best quality HD ip cameras out there. Config is easy to do, if it weren t buggy. Does not send email notifications, Google uploads, etc. Without software, the camera is worthless. 
2212 True high definition and obviously higher resolution which allows you to see more. Also great night vision. 
2213 Disappointed that a piece of plastic is missing off of it!! 
2214 Very nice point and shoot camera, take very high quality photos. Special Effects settings are fun. On Off button a bit finicky, does not always respond. 
2215 Henry was extremely helpful. I purchased multiple cameras and they set it up perfectly. The quality of the image is AWESOME! Great product! 
2216 Great camera, but zoom is far too short. Hopefully, they change this in the next version. 
2217 Delivered quickly as promised excellent product 
2218 Henry tech# AR004273 from Dlink was very helpful in helping me get my camera up and running so don t be scared to order this camera if you are not tech inclined the people at D-Link will walk you through it. Thanks D-Link 
2219 It s an ok strap, but it s gets really uncomfortable when used for more than 4 hours. Save your money and get the wider strap offered by BlackRapid. 
2220 works as expected 
2221 good service and product 
2222 a 
2223 The lens scratches very easy, be careful. Cool for pictures though. 
2224 These work perfectly and are great to have as spare batteries when shooting pictures on location. Glad I ordered them. Great Deal! 
2225 good 
2226 perfect 
2227 Just what i needed for my older tripod. Small light weight, easily holds my Sony a6000 with a 75 to 210 zoom lens with out any slippage. 
2228 Great price. Seems to work fine. 
2229 Great as the original 
2230 This is outstanding!! The night vision and range of view is incredible. Very reliable and clear image. The only change I would make allowing full screen on playback history. 
2231 packed with information 
2232 Great 
2233 Looks pretty cheap but real looking enough. Loved the little keychain though! 
2234 We use this at work since we cannot see the entrance to our office. It works really well to give us a heads up when someone is entering the suite. I love all the chime choices. 
2235 Great quality cloths and worked very well for my Console cleaning uses... 
2236 Get this dashboard camera/recorder while you can with the 50% discount! Personally received this as part of a free promotion but I m purchasing another one very soon for my other car! 
2237 The camera shakes a lot even holding the straps tight to the helmet. I think the contour long shape makes is shake too much, I get a lot of shaking with the frame mount as well. 
2238 Very good seller and very good product meets my expectations. I highly recommend it. The shipment arrived on time in perfect condition 
2239 Item was received just as described. 
2240 I just received this items and was excited to use it and the screw does not work, it just keeps turning and turning and turning. My husband even try it too and the screw doesn t work!! Sad :-( 
2241 Ya, I d say NOT fake. Original DJI package with markings on them. Also not flimsy. 
2242 Perfect for Gopro Hero 3 or 4! Everything fits like a glove! 
2243 Use it on my BMW S1000R with no problems at all. Great Item, and really tough. 
2244 I bought this as a gift and it quit working after about a year as well. I have a 10&#34; and it is still working great so not sure why this one seems to die after a year. Sad because my sister enjoyed it before it gave out. 
2245 Looking forward to using it on our next cruise. 
2246 Very pleased with quality and delivery 
2247 No Problems. Works fine. The cord is about 12 inches shorter than the one that it replaced. 
2248 good product 
2249 Awesome camera system. Support was quick. 
2250 Bought this for my daughter, and she loves it. Great quality of pictures and lots of settings. 
2251 Works as well as expected. Used it with my new Monopod:SIRUI P-326 6 Section Carbon Fiber Monopod 
2252 I love this remote. It works just perfect! 
2253 I m loving this kit and really enjoying playing with it. Definitely worth the price, though I m sure you can get higher quality filters for a lot more money. These seem to work great for me. I have not noticed any issues when reviewing / editing my photos afterwards. 
2254 canon body worked good. used in astronomy also for the sky. 
2255 nice 
2256 So glad I found this. Fan light from the 80s still worked well but could not find a replacement cover for the original which had become discolored, brittle, and cracked. Had I not found this cover, we would have had to replace the fan light for more money and hassle. 
2257 Both cameras are not working- flash goes off even in good light, pics are white. Too late to return, have to try Wildview warranty-- don t waste your money! 
2258 You know I have had the gopro 2 and 3 for my floral business and it is the best camera you can get for all around shooting on the quick. This is a little easier to use if you are new to gopro. 
2259 Works as advertised. OEM parts. 
2260 excellent 
2261 I really enjoy having a camera charger at my fingertips! 
2262 Very bright. Works as advertised. Awesome product. 
2263 Great quality. Camera fits nicely. All high quality too... 
2264 This is a great alternative to the ever expensive Nikon brand. I highly recommend it. 
2265 Basically, this is a big &#34;meh.&#34; Yes, it diffuses light. Yes, it collapses, though awkwardly. But even after considerable experimentation, I was unable to duplicate the rather eye-popping results that Gary Fong demonstrates in his promotional videos. 
2266 The release plate is pretty loose when locked in. That bothers me. 
2267 My eyes could not focus with them, I sent them back. 
2268 Packaging just like in the store. Great price. I can t judge the quality of the pictures yet until I use it next month. Too bad I couldn t afford a digital! 
2269 it is perfect 
2270 Product shipped promptly. Charged up and is working fine in my camera. Great price. 
2271 Good space to store and protec my photograpy kit. Looks pretty good good desin and excelent material made for. 
2272 Nice fit. Very sturdy! I wish it could hold more weight, but that s what the newer model is for. I would recommend it for people with a light camera and not a lot of accessories. 
2273 Love the camera! I had been without one for some time. The camera came fast, I was pleasenty surprised. I plan on many years of enjoyment with the camera. Thank You Susan 
2274 Nikon D810 Experience Book by Douglas Klostermann recommends it. However it is not compatible with Nikon D800 Camera. I tried to return it but the cost of returning the product is substantial (50%). I am not satisfied with the Adorama Return Policy either. 
2275 My son loves this! Has not used all of the pieces yet, but he s excited to do so! 
2276 it s decent and for the price it s a winner. i am skeptical of the FOV rating, but i could be wrong. it s a decent, cheap 23mm. 
2277 Love this case 
2278 Great Product!! 
2279 Much better than the other low price attachment I got on here. This one is the one to pick, clear shots, no blur, easy to use. 
2280 Works perfectly for my Nikon D70 battery pack. 
2281 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
2282 Nice enough! Would give 5 stars if compartment for the controller is designed better. One of the antenna is pointing down which is holding the body of the controller up, but it s easily fixed by adding a layer of foam or cloth for support. 
2283 Love it! perfect for traveling! 
2284 [[VIDEOID:5f9c8e5c99126e95a3853a963b58a5f5]]This camera takes great videos. It came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

2285 wouldn t buy it again hard to set up timmers and some time they don t work. But one star given for the hand grip only cheaper than the Canon brand. 
2286 Good picture for the price. 
2287 it is loose and not fit to the nikon d7100 abd not comfortable to use 
2288 fits our camera exactly 
2289 Very practical accessory for the go pro, works as a superior selfie-stick (where the stick doesn t show), camera pole for overhead shots and tripod. 
2290 Love this camera! I purchased one many years ago and this is the only place I could find another one. I wish Kodak would re-emerge and bring back quality to all the disappointing point and shoot cameras out there! 
2291 Great! 
2292 Use it this past weekend for a family portrait session. Worked GREAT!!!! 
2293 Great buy 
2294 just waiting to use,iff needed 
2295 I love this! It works great and easy to use. No running to get in a picture! 
2296 I purchased this for my adult sons birthday because he records car drifting events. He loves it! He is pretty &#34;techie&#34; so I d say he can be hard to please but all I ve heard were good reviews from him. 
2297 Well made, not cheap, but telephoto is not impressive with Blu phone. Macros work well though. The photos done with telephoto have poor clarity. 
2298 Lasts much longer than the stock battery and is much easier to charge by just plugging into the wall. The charger also charges the stock battery just fine. 
2299 great price, couldn t pass on it! 
2300 I have not used it much seems to work extremely well with my Olympus and Panasonic cameras and lenses. Bit is very compact and relatively light compared to other travel tripods. I would recommend this tripod. 
2301 small, convenient, takes great photos. lucky to have gotten it at such a low price. 
2302 Much smaller and lighter than the one that came with the camera. Liked it so much, I bought a second as a backup. Much less expensive than the OEM charger as well. 
2303 Perfect fit 
2304 Great camera, great price for a variety of capabilities. Intuitive and easy to use. 
2305 Work amazing 
2306 This is a great filter. Works for long exposure photography. I was able to get some great images of Oregon coastal waters. I really like this filter. 
2307 It doesn t change stop-wise when you spin it. I d return it if it wasn t a hassle. 
2308 Nice quality sling bag 
2309 It s hard to operate. It records shorts videos. Don t know why it only record couple of seconds and that s it! 
2310 Will keep your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean. Worth the price for peace of mind. 
2311 they broke off 
2312 Just what I needed and had hoped for ! 
2313 Very Nice little set works great for small simple things to photograph. Everything fits into the carrying case the box comes in. 
2314 perfect fit for Sony RX100 II camera. protection looks great. Good quality 
2315 Still not pleased with the shots after upgrading to this model. 
2316 This cord works better than I expected. Both ends have locking mechanisms, and TTL data is transmitted accurately. I use this between a Sony NEX-7 and Sony HVL-F43AM. Flash zoom automatically adjusts as the lens zooms. 
2317 This camera exceeded my expectation. The video is clear speaker works well. I am not a very tech oriented person but it was easy to set up. I did have a question called them and they answered it. 
2318 Speedy delivery, great value. Bought these accessories for my GoPro Hero (Basic Camera) - all appear well made & fit nicely, although some of the clips are quite tight ,but not a bad thing 
2319 Just completed setup of this cam. Works great! Controls on the app are a little clunky but the picture is great. 
2320 I ordered this in error [simply forgot a previous order for another brand]. It is tiny and seemed cheaply made, but I never took it out of the package. Its appearance and the lack of heft of the package were decisive in my returning this one, 
2321 A little pricey but fits perfectly. Wish they d make one for the CN-600 Chinese-made 1x1 light panel. 
2322 [[VIDEOID:1265e860a2218c46de5b2737a24b8ded]]The telescoping handle part works fine, but the phone holder attachment is horribly designed. Just watch my video to see how the phone shoots out of it! 
2323 2 work good, but one has dim IR LEDS 
2324 I haven t used this near as much as I d thought I would. I usually just plug the camera straight into a normal USB plug and swap the batteries through the camera. The spares are nice. 
2325 This works ok, but it s not as sturdy as I would like it to be. I would not recommend this for DSLRs that has a battery pack connected because its too heavy for this monopod. 
2326 Must have for speed light photography 
2327 Great camera sling. Holds camera to the side, out of the way. 
2328 Just as described 
2329 Great Picture and easy set up. Great tech support also.... 
2330 Excellent fit and smooth operation 
2331 very good work great 
2332 tough and well made, but terrible image quality. had to return it 
2333 GoPro...what else? 
2334 a 
2335 Great for single wire 
2336 Holds GoPro from going under 
2337 Fits the camera perfectly and is light. 
2338 Fit and worked great on my Nikon lenses. Old and modern models. 
2339 Amazing product. I need readers to check my photos on the LCD screen of my Canon EOS T3i and with this product I no longer have to change into my readers. Makes my workflow much faster. Really love this product! 
2340 Camera lens was mess up. Canon replace this camera with a other refur camera! 
2341 Nice Camera as a replacement for the one I had stollen, Easy to use and one I can understand! 
2342 Great accessory for GoPro hero 4 black. 
2343 does not work with wide angle lens ,bizzar colors on fringes of frame!! 
2344 Nice package! 
2345 Terrible product - cheap - couldn t get it off my Nikon lens after I installed it!!!! 
2346 A great little light for the price. It has a battery level indicator, dimmer knob and color temp selector and is quite bright even in daylight. The included battery and charger were a nice bonus and its quite slim which makes it easy to pack and carry. 
2347 Worked great and perfect fit on Nikon D7100. Came in hard case for glass with cleaning wipe and dust removing film to help install. 
2348 If you are a camera user, you are going to use it with the special strap. Best bang for the buck 
2349 I love this camera ,the only thing no manual 
2350 Perfect and handy to keep on the ready for that needed quick record. 
2351 Legit. 
2352 I love it. 
2353 Returned. Did not work. 
2354 It s good and I m happy with the product so far 
2355 Great lens for the price. Just wish it had gaskets like some of the others to make it water tight. But it does come with adapters for both naked camera and housing 
2356 Last as long as stock battery. 
2357 love these filters. very helpfull in my learning process. 
2358 Very clear picture and &#34;user friendly&#34; app. Great product. 
2359 Doing great so far! It s a great camera! Awesome zoom. The only problem i have with it is it didn t come with a cord to plug it into the computer. I had to go buy my own. It was a pain. But the camera itself is wonderful! 
2360 It was a little snug in my Kirkland carry on but works as expected. I would definitely recommend this product to family and friends. 
2361 It s hard to take a picture when case is attached, because it gets in the way. The quality of the product is as advertised. 
2362 Lens is great. Perfect for long shots. Filters are not great. They came scratched and one had a bubble defect. 
2363 Great camera with true colors. 
2364 Great quality screen protector. Well worth the price given the value of my NEX 7 camera. 
2365 love my contour, its been through a tough mudder on the first use, Still works and looks great, waiting for snowboarding season 
2366 cuando vuelve a estar disponible? no pude comprarlo when it becomes available ? I could not buy it 
2367 Came very fast and high quality!!! 
2368 sweet and fit perfect thank you 
2369 Battery just stop working after a month 
2370 I use this to hook up my mini beams projector weighing around 1 pound. No hassle and built with quality. 
2371 The Slik replacement post is an excellent product and a much better bargain than I ve found other places. As these little gems are easily lost I m pleased to know where to find them at a reasonable price. 
2372 Perfect and arrived on time. Thanks. 
2373 Works perfectly. 
2374 Worked great with more than enough lighting. I ordered 2 and received 4. I guess that was my mistake, so now if I return the extra order they will charge me shipping. I guess I will just keep in my storage. 
2375 Or if one breaks.. 
2376 At first I thought it wouldn t work because there were two prongs on the charger and three contacts on the batteries. However, I put in a battery, the light turned red, and it turned blue when it was charged. Then the battery worked fine in my camera. 
2377 Nice 
2378 Extra padding for when you load up your bag - works well. 
2379 Jim needs help to install this item. There are no directions nor installing device. 
2380 VERY NICE 
2381 perfect, work just like the original, maybe better due to longer life of each charge 
2382 Excellent fit and finish - although it cost more than the other brands I feel it s worth it. Dislike the cheap copy cat hoods. 
2383 In the description it said it was compatable with my camera, after opening the package the batteries didn t even come close to fitting. The company was very easy to work with and issuing a refund 
2384 It does what I purchased it for, protect my lens. Solid. 
2385 An amazing new &#34;toy&#34; for me to use to take photos. 
2386 They really work very well! 
2387 FREAKING AWESOME!!!! And so much more! 
2388 High quality product, great price, fast shipping. It fits perfectly to my Sony A77 and very convenient, When I don t use it just close it down. Thanks for great product. 
2389 I bought this as part of the Indigogo campaign and can definitely recommend it. It is well thought out, simple to use, quick to set up and easy to install! Definitely good value and recommended! 
2390 Quality case perfectly fits my gear. 
2391 good 
2392 ok 
2393 It s very thin and cheaply made (I guess you get what you pay for). I am not happy with this product at the moment. I will attempt to hang it and take a few photos too see how it shows up on camera. 
2394 Had this camera in red and lost it on a trip. I love the camera and wanted to replace it. 
2395 excellent product 
2396 Batteries 
2397 I wish the padded strip was a little but wider because my Canon G7X is somewhat heavy which makes the this strip uncomfortable. 
2398 Not happy spent alot of money for something that doesnt work. Emailed seller about it no reply of course. So i guess no refund 
2399 great starter kit 
2400 Very happy with the item. batteries charge quickly. The cleaning kit was a bonus as I hadn t expected that to be included. (was originally looking for charger and batteries.) 
2401 I suppose they work fine, or my daughter would have said something. The pack was a great buy for what you get, and if you plan on taking a camera anywhere, you ll definitely want a couple extra battery packs. 
2402 NICE TO HAVE 
2403 Very nice small case for a very small price:) 
2404 Decent quality, easy to apply 
2405 great balance between a pro camera and your phone camera. Portable and easy to use. Goes through batteries like mad, though, recommend ordering a few extra and a portable charger. 
2406 thanks 
2407 This is what I ask for and was on time shipping. 800ft of wire, you can not beat the price! 
2408 This light is brilliant! The adjustments are great, it has a digital display on the back. It is completely silent too! 
2409 Love this lens 
2410 Far better price than OEM. Batteries have held up well since purchase 1 1/2 years ago. Though OEM battery tends to last longer. 
2411 Excellent bag 
2412 Filter was delivered on time and is a good value for the money. 
2413 Perfect! 
2414 This is an awesome set for my Casio coolpic camera. It will be nice to have the second battery for back up as well as the car charger. It is a great price for all that you get 
2415 Camera is very good... 
2416 Good camera, good quality video. My biggest complaint is that when you are reviewing what has been recorded you cant fast forward. That s very frustrating. 
2417 Great value! Seller ships quickly. Product is just as described. I was expecting the bag to be smaller and of lesser quality and was pleasantly surprised. 
2418 Nice room space 
2419 LOVE IT!!!! its exactly what you see online, it also shipped super fast. :) 
2420 I haven t used this selfie stick much so I am still learning what all it can do but what I have used it for I am VERY happy with it s performance. 
2421 This is my walk-around lens for my A6000. It s a really good lens, for the price. If you use Lightroom, which has a lens profile for it, you can easily fix photos taken with it (barrel, etc). Definitely my favorite Sony lens to date. 
2422 Works perfectly 
2423 No button to take pictures! Useless 
2424 No paper work won t buy again 
2425 Easy to install, just 3M tape peel and stick. So far so good, but it s only been 1 day. The angle adjustment is great as well. 
2426 Actually showed up 2 weeks earlier than estimated. Was exactly what was pictured and it s actually a pretty good camera. 
2427 too small to properly contain camera... 
2428 Do not purchase. I was able to use the lens a few times with my iPhone 3s before everything just fell apart. 
2429 Item as described, acceptable shipping time, thanks 
2430 Processed, received as anticipated without delay or issue. 
2431 Piece of garbage! It broke within three minutes of me taking it out of the box! definitely want money back. 
2432 great products. Thanks 
2433 Fits perfectly in my Hardig case. The foam was easy to pluck to fit the items that I put in the case 
2434 Awesome. Comfortable all day with a heavy camera and lens combination. Great design! 
2435 Just got this for my birthday and I love it. The instructions are very easy to follow and the pictures come out great. My only advice is to make sure that you take pictures closer than you normally would because the pictures are small. I would recommend buying. 
2436 Great deal! 
2437 A 
2438 Great 
2439 GooD 
2440 Very happy with my Canon ESO Rebel T5i Digital Camera. It take wonderful pictures and easy to use! 
2441 Works as designed. Not meant for high impact use but gets the job done. 
2442 Hard to find, worked as expected 
2443 GREAT .... Love It ! ! 
2444 Very happy with it 
2445 Excellent lens and worth the money. Great service from Amazon. 
2446 Everything came as described. The battery is compatible with my Canon camcorder and the battery indicator shows up on the screen. 
2447 I bought this camera for my granddaughter for her 8th grade graduation and she loved it. 
2448 looks like it is the real thing. Works great quality 
2449 Great product. Works perfectly for elder parents who leave their sliding door unlocked. 
2450 Fit my go pro hero 4 like a sheep skin glove :) 
2451 I am a big hit again. My grandaughter thinks this is the cats meow. Loves loves it 
2452 Meets my standard for the cost. My son enjoyed a week of flying, but then the drone did as all before it..... Took a dive. 
2453 good item and excellent seller 
2454 This is EXACTLY what I needed! I bought this to use my Canon 580EX speedlight off camera and would have paid double/triple the amount. I Have had the opportunity to use it many times and it has never failed me. 
2455 does its job!! 
2456 Very sturdy. Very user friendly. Best customer service ever!!! 
2457 great 
2458 When it works, it s what I expected, but this disconnects very frequently which is frustrating. 
2459 Pros:Easy to set up.the feature to show which switch is on is a good idea Cons: LCD screen almost npossable to read. 
2460 cheap and holds full and long charge 
2461 Pretty decent for the price!!! 
2462 Can not find SN at the filter. It seem that s normal. If there are seal at both side will be better! 
2463 Worked well for placing my camera on a strap and folding to put my camera on a tripod, it is a hassle sometimes as the loop is not solid but that is what makes it be able to fit onto certain camera mounts. 
2464 Good product 
2465 Love this case, my Nikon 7100 with the Tamron 150-600 mm lens fit perfect. You have to remove the lens hood and reverse it over the lens. Camera an lens slide out with no problem. Wide padded strap makes it very comfortable to carry. I highly recommend this case. 
2466 Fits perfectly. 
2467 not worth it even if free - bad photos - battery compartments won t stay closed - everytime battery comes out loses memory. One of the 2 didn t even work had to send back. 
2468 Actual product User manual says sd card (the PDF), Amazon description says sd card, I bought a SD CARD. It in fact uses a micro sd card. Sad... 
2469 Lens adaptors are tricky to make as designers, except for the Maxuum-Sony Alpha systems, do not make cameras with consistent thicknesses. 
2470 Great product 
2471 Fantastic purchase came really quickly works great. 
2472 Awesome 
2473 good 
2474 Excellent Bino s for the price. Very good focus and clarity. 
2475 Used it thankyou 
2476 It s the best one I ve used. 
2477 I just use this camera just 3 times .but, shutter it s not working.I don t like it 
2478 So far, everything works well in this kit. I use it with my Canon T3i. The softbox was a bit damaged but nothing that could not be fixed with a bit of glue. 
2479 directions were in chinese:/ 
2480 Best Camera I ever have had. 
2481 Good product 
2482 Great little grip for my E-M5 Mark ii. The only downside is that trying to replace the battery is somewhat of a chore, however the Lock/Unlock dial does make this somewhat less of a hassle. 
2483 Love it! 
2484 Excellent optics, great at its primary function but not enough thread to properly secure my hood lead to it being lost. 
2485 Zero firmware updates. Need ActiveX to configure Motion Detection. Why is this old junk still for sale? 
2486 It works well with Canon 5Dii; but it lacks the shoe to attach to the camera, i would reduce it to 4 stars. 
2487 Worked great while on the road. Kept the camera dry and dust free. 
2488 Love this poser! It took about 30-45 minutes to fill. It does help to use a cardboard tube to guide the beanbag beans. Made the process much smoother! 
2489 very blocky when at max magnification. 
2490 Very well made item. I tried a cheaper after mkt. grip and it was next to worthless. This Sony grip is quick and looks great. 
2491 Doesn t stay connected as well as I d like, but with some ingenuity I made it work. 
2492 Good lense 
2493 great product 
2494 Works perfect. Good Value. 
2495 Cheap Junk don t buy it. It don t work right out of the box. now I m stuck with it and out the money. 
2496 Charged fast batteries work fine. 
2497 Awesome stuff 
2498 I bought this as a gift for my hubby and he loves it. Great for his camera and other stuff .he loves the different compartment...it s his weekend bag. 
2499 packed for earthquake, just as expected from add 
2500 Hard to get the velcro band tight, otherwise it worked 
2501 1st test of my Limefuel L55G3 on Hero3+ was a timelapse, 2sec interval at 7mp per. The battery lasted 14 hours and 16 minutes, 48.9GB on the card. Amazing. 
2502 Works as expected. 
2503 Great product as advertised 
2504 Fits my Nikon D600 like a glove :) 
2505 It s what I needed. 
2506 Great Product. Im happy with it. 
2507 Very nice for travel 
2508 Pretty disappointing. I want a 15-in + frame to display professional quality photos and so far have found nothing that seems to please other discriminating viewers. Surely someone must make a quality frame. Cost is not a major factor but quality is top priority. Anyone have suggestions? 
2509 Too bad it is no longer in production! 
2510 The best sandals for pronation and very comfortable. I have to wear orthopedics, but can wear these sandals for a few hours and have no pain.Good support for feet. 
2511 the GoPro works great! the picture and video quality is amazing. Definitely the best product I ve bought in a while. 
2512 Works as described ~ fast delivery. 
2513 Great item, plan on it going traveling with me and to sports events. 
2514 Great. Like all aspects of this camera. Telephoto is fantastic. 
2515 Does what I need, but &#34;pole&#34; which comes in sections is pretty flimsy. I wouldn t last long outdoors. Luckily, we need it in the garage. 
2516 Worked perfectly and arrived ahead of schedule. 
2517 Excellent picture, easy install and setup. Adding extra cameras is very simple. I m quite pleased. 
2518 Paired up with my Note 4 really quick and i like the way it fits. I like the ability to unsnap the measuring unit as well. Good price well see how it holds up 
2519 I would like that has buttons to zoom in and out. But works ok 
2520 It s so obvious that these are all fake reviews, who runs a business like this? 
2521 For the price this is an excellent Item. The batteries last a long while and the brightness is superb. I m a high schools sports videographer and I do on field/court interviews and the lights worked much better than expected. 
2522 Works as advertised. 
2523 This is a great alternative for the clip in lens cap. I bought it based on all the positive reviews it received and am glad I did. 
2524 Looses electric connection after a few weeks. Wouldn t recommend getting. 
2525 There is no way to use an ocular (eyepiece) lens with this adapter. As a result there is no way to focus the microscope image in the camera. Spend about $90 instead and get an adapter with a lens included. 
2526 love this camera 
2527 LOVE THIS CAMERA! So easy to use, directions and set up very simple. No difficult wiring or issues! The quality of the picture is amazing also. Would strongly recommend this camera! Super simple and great product! 
2528 Item was as described, was delivered promptly, and worked with my old FD lens. Will shop with this vendor again. 
2529 I wish the strap held together a bit better but other wise it s a great looking case and it shipped right on time. 
2530 It is OK, have not actually broken in yet therefore will not know how long the battery will last. 
2531 Really weak and flimsy, overall wished I spent more money on a strap. 
2532 Awesome is all I can say 
2533 Perfect for indoor photography! 
2534 great for the price 
2535 so glad to have this replacement for my camera...perfect 
2536 gift 
2537 Good bargain price for batteries that do the same as OEM batteries. I was in Washington on business and searched the whole area for this battery, found one store with one unit in stock. These work great and hold a charge well. 
2538 As expected. 
2539 GOOD PRODUCT, WELL CONSTRUCTED EASY TO HANDLE AND DO THE JOB VERY GOOD. I LOVE IT AND I RECOMENDED. 
2540 works great,enjoy the different settings and sounds 
2541 on windy days I believe my flag sets it off,will have to reposition it. 
2542 Very good. 
2543 as predicted. 
2544 Great product! Very useful and practical! 
2545 This Film works just fine in a new (to me) camera that I just bought. 
2546 Great quality tripod. Works with my SLR camera, andreally helps for those longer exposures 
2547 LOUD. If you want to make sure people know when your alarm goes off, get this. 
2548 Cheap, flimsy & very small. Also the 2 tire &#34;stops&#34; were paid for but not shipped. Shipping time was fine. 
2549 BLAST CAN USE IT ANYWHERE 
2550 The battery fits and works great. I use it in a Canon 60D and it charges at about the same rate as the factory battery. I have only had it for a couple of weeks, so nothing to report on longevity. 
2551 Works well for my Canon camera 
2552 Just as described with super fast shipping! 
2553 inner partitions does not stay in place 
2554 Wow how freaking awesome! I ordered and a day later it came to my front door. The batteries work and hold a great charge and the charger sits on my desk taking NO room. Very happy and for the price I might just buy another set. 
2555 Fast shipping good battery! I would recommend as a spare battery :) 
2556 works exactly as described. Paired easily. Works with iPad, no problem. 
2557 Great lens ! My significant other purchased this for me as a surprise and absolutely love it! Will be great for portraits instead of having to rent nice lenses. Seems to do the best around f 3.2 and 3.5 , very crisp details and nice bokeh! 
2558 Excellent purchase! 
2559 Good however could not get strap to stay on. 
2560 I like it 
2561 I love these batteries, I use them in my Cannon 70 D. What an amazing addition to my camera and at the price you can t say no. Well worth it. 
2562 It worked perfectly with my Cannon 60D. 
2563 Bought used and VERY satisfied 
2564 Small and compact! Ready for on the go and easy to use. 
2565 Works excellent with very easy set up. Took about 10 minutes total. Mounted it to a wall with included hardware and we were ready to go. Works on both my Samsung S5 and my wife s iPhone 6. 
2566 it fits well on my gopro hero 3+ waterproof housing 
2567 Just testing it out I found that the Wi-Fi did not work despite the phone or laptop and the battery life is poor. Still waiting to take it to the sea and see if it is really &#34;water proof&#34; to up to 90 feet. 
2568 Work great and are WAY cheaper than OEM. 
2569 Very nice cleaning cloths. They are the perfect size for cleaning glasses & cell phones. I also like the variety of colors. 😀 
2570 Had to return as it never worked. Return was easy enough. 
2571 Very cheaply made. Feels cheaply made. My copy activated the shutter just by jiggling the wires 
2572 Just what I was looking, looks great on my Nikon D5500 with 18-140 lens 
2573 This product worked about 3hours then 2 of the motors burned out. One wont even turn junk!!! 
2574 Really works it saved us from flooded home. 
2575 Love the device. First generation needed a wider lens, but looks like the second generation has that covered. 
2576 It has slipped off a couple times. But in fairness, I may not have put it entirely on. It doesn t fit over the lens filters I purchased. 
2577 Excellent product at a good price. It works flawlessly with my Panasonic FZ200. My only criticism for this device, as other reviewers have commented, is that the device is not very intuitive and the documentation is cryptic at best. 
2578 Works Awesome! One of the easiest Pano heads I have ever used. 
2579 I am using this for my canon camera. For the price, it is excellent. I like the size and the material is good. 
2580 Works pretty much exactly as I wanted. Let s me use my Sigma 30mm f1.4 and my old Minolta MD 150mm on the M3. 
2581 These replacement batteries fit and work great 
2582 excellent 
2583 worked as advertised but complicated to set up remote access. Had to get tech help and working remotely now. 
2584 this was just what i needed...it works great...thanks for the help finding this on amazon.. 
2585 Thankyou 
2586 Liked the design for a certain bridge I bridge camera I own. 
2587 Glad to have another way to charge my batteries. I love that this charger came with 2 extra batteries as well. 
2588 Using this on my Tokina 11-16mm dxii. No vignetting and no image degradation. Screws on and off effortlessly. Love the textured grip? 
2589 Pelican products are very well-made. This particular case is small. If you need more space, Pelican makes many more models from which to choose. 
2590 Efficient , Thanks 
2591 [[ASIN:B00W1BEENK AC 110V 3 Way Touch Control Sensor Switch Dimmer Lamp Desk Light Parts]] Easy install, seemed to work but in less than a week it started turning on the light by itself. This has continued since I installed it. How do I get a replacement?? 
2592 Work very well, sometimes the camera reads the battery power level incorrectly but this is fairly rare. 
2593 Wore it to play in a beer league hockey tournament and it stopped working properly after the 1st day. Do not recommend it 
2594 This now completes my set up. I have ordered one of these before and have had no problems. I expect the same, this time around. Easy to install and should at least slow the bad guys down. 
2595 Better and cheaper than GO Pro! The Wi-Fi and the SONY App are awesome! I can control the camera by my mobile!!!! 
2596 It works but would not work with Chrome. Contacted support and got no reply. I don t think I would by another one. 
2597 Works great. Perfect fit. Feels pretty solid. 
2598 as described. Very happy with it. 
2599 There is less then year when I bought this camera and it doesnt work anymore 
2600 Small, and easy to use. Pictures are good. I just wish I would have notice that the review size was really small. Otherwise good deal. 
2601 Sharp Optics, Light Weight, Easy to use, Nothing better available in a Zoom 8-16x25 for the price! Very pleased with its performance. 
2602 My wife and I love our new Nest cam. It works exactly as billed and we love having a Nest home. 
2603 Works great - a must have! 
2604 works pretty good, not great a night...really bummed that it doesnt have extra ports for more cameras-4 doesnt even cover my exterior. you would think they would have extra ports so you could add on if necessary 
2605 I love this lens cap. I like the squeeze on and off. It s very secure yet easy to remove. No, it doesn t dangle from the string, but it could be attached to a longer more useful string if you wanted that feature. I just removed the string. 
2606 As advertised, great. 
2607 Must have for DSLR users that don t always shoot over the shoulder. 
2608 would recommend 
2609 Quick delivery excellent product. It is a little narrow for my big old head, but not a BIG deal. 
2610 Arrived on time and as expected. 
2611 My son commented my videos look much better since using device. 
2612 Excellent connectors. Do their job insuring a secure camera attachment. Don t have to worry about clips opening and spilling your expensive camera on the ground. The Op/Tech clips do seem very adequate to secure camera but the Velcro connectors give extra piece of mind, just in case... 
2613 It is a great product it met my expectations it is awesome to use it on big places and see the difference between a normal lense and a fish eye or wide angle 
2614 This is a very lightweight tripod and seems to be very steady. It will take some practice to use it quickly though. This isn t a complaint. Its much lighter than my other tripod and I plan to take it on some field trips later this year. 
2615 Does what it promises to do. 
2616 disappointed in the filter. didn t think it enhanced the images nearly as much as I d hoped 
2617 Perfect. Precisely what I ordered. As described. 
2618 does exactly what it should. works great! 
2619 these camera replacements are excellent for my system and a great buy, will definitely recommend these to my friends and family. 
2620 You get what you pay for, all lens are good but the Telephoto Lens distords the image on the sides and has to be used at maximum zoom or you will see the round black edges on your screen. 
2621 cheap and weak 
2622 Awesome accessories! Great price! 
2623 Great Quality - we recommend this item! I ve waited a long time for the perfect digital camera!!! 
2624 Great price and good condition 
2625 the remote control is included? 
2626 Needs to send a charger with it. 
2627 Awesome battery for the money, great customer service after the sale also. 
2628 As usual the case is top notch Pelican Case. Have been using Pelicans for my firearms for years so I got the 1300 for my girls Sony DSLR camera. Pick-n-pluck foam is easy and holds gear securely and it does have the double throw latches. 
2629 Works very well, needs 9 V batteries 2 times a year and re-positioning but I have had it for about six years now and it s still ringing, 
2630 Incredible deal for the price. I ve seen others for three times the price! 
2631 Although the labeling read &#34;Product generally ordered when lens is purchased&#34;, the fact is the product is not needed since the lens already come with a shield. 
2632 Great 
2633 Awesome 
2634 I bought this lens to replace the plastic nifty 50 I ve had for a while. I can see right off, this lens is quite good, but probably not as good as the top of the line 50mm. But,I like it. 
2635 Universal camera battery charger. Product as described and has adaptors for different brands. Charger says its a Vivitar but with an adapter that fits my Canon camera. Works great and comes with a spare battery. 
2636 Excellent! 
2637 Finally!!! An awesome gadget backpack, for all the chargers, ereaders, camera, lens, videocamera, sdcards, cables. There is room for everything. Great for travelling and keeping all our stuff organized. 
2638 i use 
2639 Lots of pockets, lightweight and easy to carry. Makes you look official :) 
2640 Item shipped quickly and was exactly as described. 
2641 Great bag, holds more than it looks like, would recommend it 
2642 THEY DID NOT WORK ON ANY DEVICE!!!!! 
2643 Lots of useful items in the kit , charger is worth the price alone 
2644 Ok for a monopod, feels cheap and unsteady with a Nikon d610 attached. Good enough for a point and shoot though. Upgraded to a a Manfrotto monopod shortly after purchasing this. Should have just skipped this one. 
2645 Works great. Let s me use old manual lens with my Sony a6000. 
2646 Camera is good. Setup instructions are not clear. But you will figure out after trying few times. I like phone view and send pics by email. I am not using upload to cloud feature 
2647 What do you say, They work great! 
2648 Excellent product 
2649 I have been using these pens for a few years and i like them for the convenience mainly.They do their job and are light and compact. 
2650 An excellent camera with excellent accessories. The camera arrived quickly and was well packed. 
2651 Cheap threads stuck 
2652 First day I had it battery overheated and fried all electronics. Video quality was radically bad after that!. I checked and it was a genuine product, but I got a lemon. Also batery refused to charge after that! 
2653 I love my new album it matches my camera so cute thank you 
2654 Works Good! 
2655 excelent 
2656 Received what you order. It came in a timely manner. 
2657 I was very excited for my wife to take professional photos of my baby daughter but honestly our I phone has better resolution not happy 
2658 I am still learning to use it so will have a better idea of how I like it after more use. 
2659 Works well. No stability but for the money it is a good lens. Quick focus but not as fast as the more expensive lenses out there. 
2660 Works well. Fits well It would be nice to have threads on both ends so you could stack them. 
2661 Love it. Perfect Bag. 
2662 Worked out great on a trip up to Pacific Northwest. Protected from rain and dust. Thanks 
2663 everything worked fine 
2664 Great, economical surveillance system. Easiest Tech I have set up. 
2665 Great lenses, great pictures, great price. Not noisy at all. The remote works great and lots of fun. The tripod is a little week but does the job and very light. 
2666 Well made and works great. 
2667 So far so good, haven t noticed any issues. Quick delivery as always using Prime. 
2668 This is my go to portrait lens for natural light portraits. At 2.8 it makes a powerful low light lens plus a nice portrait lens for shallow depth of field for nice bokeh. For the price this is an excellent lens. 
2669 Great product. Shipped all together. It s a great gift for teens. 
2670 This camara is better than I EXPECETED. Great. 
2671 The case blocks the cameras ability to connect to the wireless access point. If you buy this you better have the camera within about 25 feet of your access point 
2672 nice product. 
2673 GREAT PROTECTION FOR CAMERA. 
2674 This is just what I needed. It works fine. I love Canon products. I just misplaced my original one. 
2675 Did not notice there was no way to take the picture with the stick 
2676 Ok 
2677 I found what I wanted and I was really excited. But when it came in the mail it was the wrong product. 
2678 A+++ 
2679 A nice bit of added security when going strapless. 
2680 Great way to get my footage 
2681 Works great. Peace of mind when you are away from home. 
2682 Expected this to be a little better but i will definitely use. The dimmer capability is nice but wish they were just a tad brighter. For the price i guess i can t complain. 
2683 My daughter likes it. 
2684 This kit is awesome!! Thanks)) 
2685 Product recieved as described and in the time frame as specified. 
2686 I bought this for my Sony A6000 it works great. I took my time cleaning and cleaning the screen again it went on well and with no air bubbles. It did not add any bulk to the camera and I feel better knowing the screen is protected. 
2687 this does not work with hero 1 
2688 some of the stuff in this bundle is great, and some is cheap. bottom line is if you are not a pro, this is a great cheap bundle. I wouldn t pull these out for a professional photo shoot. 
2689 Good 
2690 Charged and powered my camera as expected. Good product. 
2691 Great bag for the price. Camera and lenses in padded secure, yet movable sections. I am impressed by the quality of this product. 
2692 screw not Tight enough for nexus 7, can not support 
2693 what can I say, expect for incredible. 
2694 Good 
2695 Received on time & seems to work fine. 
2696 Excellent and great seller 
2697 This floating hand grip works great. It s comfortable and secure. I took it to Hawaii and got some awesome snorkeling and waterfall photos & video. Glad I opted for the GoPro brand - high quality, fits my GoPro perfectly. 
2698 the case holds a ton of stuff. i ve got a couple housings and naked housings in there with the headstrap, cables, dual battery charger and mounts and it still fits extremely well. 
2699 Nice bags will last a long time. 
2700 Awesome 
2701 Does just what I expected. Autofocus is slow and hunts, but for landscape work it s not a problem. Main thing I purchased it for was aperture control and it does the job nicely. I recommend it 
2702 This is a very nicely made cap, and the strap is a good add-on. Not sure where (or how) to attach the strap but overall it s nice constructed and lightweight. 
2703 The lens cases are excellent quality at a very reasonable price. I would highly recommend them. Bill Dunlap, EasternSierraPhotography.com 
2704 Perfect fit for my nikon d5300 and a spare small lens 
2705 Quality SCT diagonal both optically as well as fit and finish. Comes with a great case that protects it very well. The price is the most reasonable found for a 2&#34; dielectric diagonal for an SCT. 
2706 D-rate too low, zeiss lens does not show good Saturation, Effective focus range too little, dont expect it can make any bokeh or blurry background at all. 
2707 I probably us this more than any other accessory for my GoPro... 
2708 I never could get this to work properly, don t waist your money 
2709 Great tripod! Not very light but still easy to carry around. Love feature on coverting it to monopod. Ball head is good too. Easy to adjust. Color nice and vivid. The only downside is a tighting bolt which i wish had a different design. 
2710 waste moeny at all 
2711 nice 
2712 I really like this camera. My only complaint is the LED on top is hard to see in the sunlight. It takes really good video. Its size makes it easy to take anywhere. The waterproof case works very well and is worth buying. 
2713 Decent batteries, will buy again. Some people have trouble taking the battery out of the charger, little pressure toward the way the arrow points and the battery comes out easy. 
2714 This may be small in size, but it is a good aluminum alloy...It locks without much effort, and holds my 3 pound camera very securely.. This one may cost a bit more, but your trusting it by putting very expensive cameras on it...So I highly recommend it... 
2715 I actually ordered this for my ring bearer so he could feel like a spy with a briefcase. He loved it! (And, all the stuff I put inside.) :) Great size! Just what I was looking for! Not small! 
2716 Satisfied! 
2717 need to get more. lovely gift. 
2718 Perfect for water use 
2719 Awesome! Everything was in perfect condition when it arrived. 
2720 Love it. Took it on a cruise and got great pics! 
2721 Cheap 
2722 Just as advertised 
2723 I was worried about ordering any electronics from online, but I had nothing to worry about. It was excellent condition!! Works beautifully and gets the job done!! LOW priced and fast shipping!! Feel safe when ordering from this seller!! Thank you!! 
2724 The remote control (RM-E2) does not work with the Nikon D3200 as indicated in the description of the set. 
2725 just what I needed 
2726 Have not had a bad experience with any of the Polaroid filters, so far. 
2727 Add a little brightness to your photos 
2728 great pics 
2729 The screen on the viewer has developed a line thru the center of the screen after owning it for one month, also frustrating to try to set up the recording to meet my needs, I guess you get what you pay for, not recommended!! 
2730 Not 100% waterproof 
2731 Floaty was great! Arrived on time and was just as described. Attached to my underwater camera and it really does float! 
2732 works great 
2733 Works great. 
2734 it works ... 
2735 Great cloths, they work just fine. 
2736 Works as well as or better than the &#34;official&#34; batteries at a much more favorable price and the charger is easier to use and transport that the factory-issued model. 
2737 Item as described. shipped quickly. Would purchase again. A+ 
2738 didn t work on my camera. I returned it. 
2739 good choice well worth the money. 
2740 This light is very small but very very bright. I will buy another one as it will only last for 1 hr. But it completely brightened the entire room. 
2741 Perfect protection for LCD screen. Real easy to install. Does not interfere with opening or closing screen. Wish I had this before the LCD became tarnished. Certainly priced right. 
2742 Battery lasted less than 50 shots. Return policy of 30 days stinks, since it does not seem to depend on whether product is defective or not. 
2743 Batteries are long lasting in my cameras. I will recommend these because they are the best 
2744 camera is great and all the add-ons were just what was shown. was disappointed taht there was not any user manual or other instructions on the use of the camera 
2745 kind of flimsy. 
2746 I think this is a great camera and quality of the video is on par with others. The audio output could be better but that s very minor. 
2747 This is a very good case, it s just that it s a little larger than what I needed for my camera. Otherwise I would have given it 5 stars. I think it will last forever and there is definitely room for extra batteries and all the cords. 
2748 Great pistol grip head. Just wish it was lighter. Beside this, it is a good deal. 
2749 These are a great way to keep an eye on your home. Great for constant visibility or just to check in occasionally. 
2750 Love it!!! 
2751 Works great.glad I purchased. I ve had some close calls when using my go pro in the lakes. 
2752 Very good case for my Tough4 camera. It fits perfectly! A great case. 
2753 Nice 
2754 The order came quickly and was a very great deal. 
2755 Better than the goPro stick! Very sturdy and I love the pouch for it! Best purchase I ve made in regards to an accessory. Very very pleased - never leave without it. 
2756 excelente 
2757 Henry great job done by tech. love the service.also camera works great. 
2758 Great for the price! Never owned or used a &#34;glidecam&#34; before. For my micro-budget films this thing is AWESOME. 
2759 It couldve been better but for the price what do you really expect? I dont really use it as much as I hoped I would because of its quality. 
2760 Very Well Satisfied. 
2761 should get two batterys for that price 
2762 Good product, great service, plus a good price! Paid a few dollars more for the &#34;warm fuzzies&#34; for the familiar Vivitar name.. 
2763 Ok 
2764 Very comfy and durable! Fit my camera perfectly and adjustable for when my husband wants to wear it! 
2765 Just awesome telphoto 
2766 Received as advertised 
2767 It is too red and not good for diving. 
2768 An OK lens but not for advanced photographers. 
2769 I love this gadget! I rarely have to charge it. If I use it with my computer, I will need to charge it more frequently but with other devices it just goes and goes. So glad I bought it. 
2770 Works great so far. I have not had a chance to assess longevity of the charge or of the battery itself. 
2771 Exact needed miniscule USB to standard cable for Nikon Coolpix as advertised. Plenty pleased. 
2772 This is the best Quadcopter out for the price by far! So easy to fly and the best 4K video. I find myself looking forward to flying it after work and on the weekends! This thing is loaded with tech and the flight control system is loaded with many features! 
2773 Great 
2774 Another excellent pelican product 
2775 Fantastic! Exactly as described! 
2776 Great product, still going strong a year later. I would recommend this battery to anyone. 
2777 the greatest thing to come around since sliced bread if you do green screen photography 
2778 BUY THIS KIT!!!! It is definitely worth investing in, and I film beauty videos and such and THIS LIGHTING KIT IMPROVES THE QUALITY 100%!!!! You can go see at www.youtube.com/daisygoldenprincess 
2779 this product real make a different I will order from this company again. 
2780 Easy to use, good quality!! 
2781 Great mount 
2782 works great 
2783 Product was as advertised. 
2784 Love this little thing. It s a lot bigger than it appears to be in the photo. I got it for my gopro hero 4 silver and it s amazing. 
2785 Quite nice and handy wireless remote. I use it with my D5300 and found it to be quite good. 
2786 All is working fine! 
2787 Nice case, fits our camera well, plus extra batteries. 
2788 ok 
2789 Magnification is not as much as I expected. Focus knob has no fine tune focus. Barlow lense is low quality. But a good basic telescope for the price. 
2790 love this dash cam 
2791 Works great and works with our camera and battery charger. 
2792 Great item. 
2793 It is not mentioned that the flash is working with manual adjusting - I would have never bought it!!! 
2794 Quick service and great product. Exactly what I needed 
2795 My Minolta A mount lenses mount firmly with this adapter. 
2796 Fits perfect! Can t believe I got a 5 pk for this price! These fit snuggly so I may not lose them as often. Prompt delivery too.......I typically wait much longer for items from China. 
2797 I think they are great, could not find them locally, my camera works great, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING THEM.... 
2798 It s a battery. It works fine. 
2799 Pelican just makes great cases. Not much else to be said. 
2800 Anyone else keep losing these guys? Just bought this 5 pack. Problem solved. 
2801 Excellent Quality and speedy shipping! 
2802 The camera works great, nice control, night vision good Kenneth from tech support helped with setup, great job 
2803 Great machine but get extra parts and batteries. Great starter drone. 
2804 I bought this for my fiancé (who is a graphic artist) and he loves it! It has lots of high end features to take AMAZING pictures with a quality rivaling professional photographers. This is a great camera! 
2805 awesome just as described thank 
2806 best towel for cleaning anything 
2807 very good 
2808 Cool 
2809 Buy as many as you can! I use them for everything. 
2810 Very fast autofocus, brilliant image quality, and the stabilization is great too. My one gripe about this lens (and a reason I may sell it in the future) is that it s just really heavy! 
2811 Works good for my SonyRX100 2. Fits just like factory batteries, charger works fine. 
2812 Not what i was expecting 
2813 The lens kit brings the image into focus pretty well, but you need to use the tripod, or maybe I shake too much. Its a nice little piece that works better than others I ve tried. Takes a little while to learn to position it as you like. 
2814 Working well for my needs 
2815 Good 
2816 Button fell after a few weeks of receiving it, and not due to overuse! Unable to return item, had to purchase another. 
2817 Very happy with camera. Everything I hoped it would be for the price. 
2818 wonderful not heavy and very easy ti use 
2819 Great Product Works just like it is supposed to easy to install 
2820 Good deal! 
2821 The items in this shipment We re good quality but this does NOT come with a bag. My order did not include all items advertised. There was no carrying bag. 
2822 Really nice pictures clean.. 
2823 Nothing really crazy out of the ordinary here, it was just what I needed!! 
2824 Excellent product. Holds charge for a considerable amount of time, especially whan camera is not used frequently. Highly reccommended 
2825 I purchased this item and what was delivered was a 22 Inch after measuring the item. 
2826 Review coming soon 
2827 Love it! Light weight reasonably priced and great quality. 
2828 works great! 
2829 It works OK. 
2830 Excellent battery life on demanding go pro hero4 silver. (Touch screen on go pro saps a lot of battery) The batteries last longer than the original go pro battery. The charging was fairly quick. Three batteries in a couple of hours at the most. 
2831 Kinda small so you don t feel like a real photographer, but the product itself is perfect 
2832 Don t waste your money. It broke the second time I used it. Base plate came off. guess I could glue back together but that s not the point. 
2833 Fits my canon rebel perfectly. I feel my camera is safe and protected in there. 
2834 Very Good Quality 
2835 Bought this item to replace a lost charget. I is exactly what I needed and works perfectly. 
2836 It ruin my phantom 1 I have to take it to get fixed now it s very unstable and crash right out of the sky  
2837 The camera is smarter than I am. 
2838 I m still trying to make it work it seem to have a mind of it s own i keep down loading, it wont hold the programs. The booklet is being read step by step 
2839 Great 
2840 Easy to sign up for. I have not needed to make any claims, thankfully. So, I don t know how the replacement/repair service is. I hope I don t need it. I will update this post if I use the service later. 
2841 Great deal, good quality replacement. 
2842 Everything about this case is amazing great quality and carries everything I need! High recommend this. Just wish it was airline carry on size but the quality and features make up for it 
2843 I wasn t sure if adding the lens would make that much of a difference. I was very surprised to see how much it did. Good quality and easy to attach. 
2844 Nice size, lots of pockets for accessories, sturdy construction, good padding! 
2845 Takes lousy pictures. I don t want to have to monkey around with pics on my computer...I just want to print or share quickly. I returned this. Guess you get what you pay for! 
2846 Great product, wish this would have came with the unit from the manufacture. Must have! 
2847 Love the bag, great value, great size. 
2848 nice bundle 
2849 It s worth buying to protect your gopro. 
2850 Haven t taken this out to use for the reason I bought it yet, but it will work just fine, I m sure. Seems pretty well made. Better than expected. 
2851 great 
2852 came in a timely manner, was undamaged, inserted the battery and was good to go. thank you 
2853 Handy little tripod, I use this thing everywhere. Wrap it around tree branches, wrap it around strings to do time lapse vids of storms coming in from my garage door opener. Wherever, this holds steady. 
2854 Very happy with purchase!!! 
2855 Exact match for OEM and works great. 
2856 Love this bag, comes with tons of padding and movable sections inside to customize. Love the vintage style. So Happy I ordered it. 
2857 Gift 
2858 LOVE this lens and the transaction. thanks 
2859 Not exatly what I needed, but will do. 
2860 I like this bag. The canvas fabric is really attractive and nice, and it doesn t scream &#34;steal me&#34; like a Nikon logo bag. It s a little tight for my D5100 kit, but it fits. I have not had any problems with the zippers that other reviewers have noted. 
2861 GREAT SMOKE ALARMS..... 
2862 Works perfect!!!! 
2863 These cords failed within one month of use. 
2864 BEST VALUE YET. PACKAGING CAME EARLIER THAN EXPECTED. VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE! 
2865 Fits snugly as it was advertised to do.Great adapter,I d highly recommend it. 
2866 Perfect fit for my a66; eye viewfinder activation works fine. 1/3 the cost of a Sony replacement. 
2867 Great pics! The app for the smart phone is a lil wonky but works 
2868 camera fits perfect 
2869 4 of them in my house can check in anytime I am away or use as monitor with my phone or tablet 
2870 Great Product and video for the money. 
2871 Great build. Much better than Gary Fong lightsphere. You would think the velcro wouldn t hold up but it actually stays up. This is a great product especially, very flexible from macro, portrait, to group shots this met all my needs. Would definitely buy again. 
2872 This camera is so much fun and it takes the best pictures if you know how to use it correctly! 
2873 so far as good as original 
2874 works perfectly just like the original 
2875 just what i needed 
2876 Clear Picture. Easy Set up. Works better than I expected. 
2877 This lens is everything that I ve hoped for! Great quality photos! Quick delivery and wonderful supplier! 
2878 A necessity! I am pleased with the quality. There were enough pieces that I share half with my daughter. 
2879 doesnt fit right to original hero 4 unit. 
2880 You get what you pay for in terms of battery life. One of these lasts about half as long as a single Cannon brand battery. 
2881 Good stand for the price paid. The locking knobs are not very durable. Just be careful using it. It will work well. 
2882 Ok gave to friend. He is modify from his cameas 
2883 great!!! 
2884 heavy duty boom arm, not a flimsy toy. very happy with the quality of all Kupo products 
2885 what a bargain 
2886 Excellent cameras. The video is extra sharp, and they are very easy to install. 
2887 No surprises. Works as described. Good shipping to third party that was heading to Fiji in plenty of time. 
2888 Best case I have ever owned for my GoPro Hero 4 Black. Almost nearly fits all my accessories, but I mainly got this because it s a hard case and I wanted to protect my investment. 
2889 I brought Targus Digital Black Label TG-P60T tripod from RadioShack (big mistake). The quick release plate that was given in the box didn t fit. I search high and low for a plate that ll fit since it s small, this one works. 
2890 Really easy to use right out of the box. Got some great shots at 70 feet despite poor visibility. I can t wait to see what it will do in Caribbean waters. 
2891 This product is very great! It is not as translucent as some of the others when using a backlog and is highly durable for portraits. Photos always come out stunning with a black background and plexiglass flooring! 
2892 excellent camera 
2893 Bought for my wife she absolutely loves it more then anything she said best bday present ever 
2894 I have a large tripod. The triangle slot that is used to set the tray on the tripod is too small, meaning the tray is too high off the ground, or I have to reduce the spread on the tripod. 
2895 Works well with think tank bags. Great purchase! 
2896 bought 2 of these and worked fine ran on a 9v 400ma ac/dc converter one chip lost the blue lighting but the other works fine. 
2897 Just got back from a motorcycle trip. Several days in the rain and it held like iron. Very happy with this mount. 
2898 work as advertise 
2899 The worst part is that it is actually a really good monitor. with all the nobs and settings you can not turn off the volume. so basically you are stuck listening to what ever you are shooting. 
2900 I bought these to clean my hard to keep clean eyeglasses. The best cloths I have found for that purpose. They leave no streaks or residue. I also use them to clean my laptop computer screen. Excellent. 
2901 Fast delivery, product as described. Would do biz, again. 
2902 Great lights, easy to set up and AWESOME to use!! 
2903 Can t go wrong with this. Just toss it down somewhere in your picture and click on the gray when editing - all set. No fuss. No muss. 
2904 Good as backups. Do not last anywhere near as long as canon but still a good deal at this price. 
2905 Tray and buy,good to have more lights 
2906 Still learning how to use it but so far I m satisfied with the lens. It works very well and I m getting some great shots. 
2907 It worked great. 
2908 works ok sometimes the alarm goes off without any motion in its area have used the reset button several times 
2909 My manfrotto tripod fits in there great! 
2910 A little bit smaller than i imagend but works well,instruction manual not verry helpful 
2911 Fast delivery and really easy set up!!! Sure wish I had read how many megapix the Camara I Vaught had but other than that easy set up!! 
2912 an amazing camera!!! 
2913 Just as described. 
2914 I have seen better that cost less more and perform constantly better. 
2915 Works great 
2916 Awesome little camera. Thinking about getting some more. 
2917 it s kind of small for what I needed, but it s fine 
2918 Perfect fit for my Canon Power Shot. 
2919 It is a good camera....However very difficult to setup through your mobile phone or see on a PC not connected to your wifi. You have to be an expert geek to do that. 
2920 I only want to say that I just love this product .I am really impressed by this awesome product.thanks for this 
2921 Couldn t be happier with this seller. Everything as expected plus some. True customer service the way that shows the seller values and appreciate the buyer. Kudos! 
2922 Came with everything just like it said. In case your wondering, you can clip all of this to your phone. I had that concern myself. Thanks for the awesome product! :) 
2923 Fit perfectly! 
2924 Great product, esp. for beginners like myself. However it did not come with instructions on how to set up. 
2925 It s great having an extra battery for long trips and extended shooting and editing. 
2926 works great 
2927 Works like the original equipment 
2928 Great camera with lots of features great price, great pictures, great optics. 
2929 its great prodcut easy to install already comes programmed. Hands down best DIY product for any property owner / renter, 
2930 Bought this for my desk at work. It s terrible! It loops from the SD card to the generic pictures and then continues with the generic pictures. I have to turn on the SD card at least twice a day. Terrible! 
2931 The Adapter fullfilled my need well. I just did not expect the extra size &#34;adaptors&#34;. 
2932 Great battery charger for my Nikon Coolpix L830...no more frustrating dead battery worries! 
2933 Other than the fact that you have to buy a memory card separate we like it! I thought that would be included in the bundle, or even with just the camera, but it s not. The camera is great! 
2934 outstanding design for low cost (a very reasonable cost) work right out of the box. easy of setting it up. Best part is no monthly payment like Dropcam. Will buy several more. 
2935 Great products! 
2936 Worked great on our Disneyland trip. Fit right in the backpack, that way we didn t need to carry around the big camera case. 
2937 Does not fit well 
2938 Fantastic and it looks great too. 
2939 perfect price and a good piece 
2940 Good job! 
2941 Great product, very realistic and easy to install. Highly recommend. Good through all weathers also. Batteries been in 6 months and the light still blinks 
2942 GREAT POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA!! 
2943 ottima borsa 
2944 When it stays on, it works well. Doesn t always stay on. I would turn it on before heading out for a paintball game, then after game find out it was off...or showing a buffering symbol...or whatever. Performance seems inconsistent. 
2945 I own this system and the hard drive took a crap on me just right out of 1 year... The DVR is junk loads slow ect Cameras are not bad though. I upgraded to the newest system plan on using these cameras with my new ones 
2946 Have these batteries for quite a while now. They are still doing their job. 
2947 Works as advertised and fits Hero 4 Silver. 
2948 It works great 
2949 good enough 
2950 Very fun to play with! Getting some really cool photos. 
2951 works really well. 
2952 It was i was expecting. 
2953 Perfect item, as described in photo, very fast shipping, thank you I live it :0) 
2954 Great price and batteries seem to hold charge so far. 
2955 Good 
2956 Great service, delivered precisely as stated. Thanks. 
2957 Was absolutely everything I thought it would be. Works perfectly for all my video recording and photography needs 
2958 The part that was supposed to screw into the camera, was not threaded. 
2959 Just awesome... It s a great lens with high quality pictures and fast shutter speed I love it. Amazon surprised me with one day advance delivery ... 
2960 Excellent 
2961 Item was as described. Item was great quality. Delivered quickly. Would have rated it as a 5 star but was too tight for Canon 100-400mm Zoom Lens shade. Lens fits fine. 
2962 Great for the price 
2963 Will advise if it really works, but I like the protection 
2964 Great tripod, smooth movements, easy to set up. I like the locking features and the slide on and off detachable plate for easy camera attachment 
2965 Love this lens hood. 
2966 Not a good camera but does barely adequate video. 
2967 Quality... 
2968 Amazing lens, happy with outcome of product !!!! 
2969 What a great deal. The batteries are really why I bought this and they are effect the other accessories are ok 
2970 Pros: Well made, Good price Cons: Wrong size (5.5 x 2.1 mm not 4.0 x 1.7) 
2971 It s a pretty amazing value for the price. Very satisfied. Arrived much sooner than estimated. I would recommend to everyone. 
2972 this is the worst piece of garbage I ever bought from amazon...if I had the box I would return it in a minute..no wonder it was a big sale...video sucks 
2973 Good 
2974 Really Good Camera, Takes a few minutes to understand how to operate it (i didn t look in the manual) but overall its pretty easy and very light. Takes about 5-10 seconds to the image to Appear on film. 
2975 Works really well in my D300. 
2976 Great! 
2977 Good price and it does the job ! I love having my lens caps right where I need them ! 
2978 This lens hood was fine for a while, but started to tear and was not usable. Also, fully extended, the lens hood showed up in the pictures and had to be cropped out. 
2979 Excellente, simple product give nice result. 
2980 Awesome! Love it! 
2981 fits my camera nicely 
2982 Not bad...! 😁 
2983 Does just what it should. 
2984 Exceptionally well designed medium size camera bag at a reasonable price for a carrying: - camera attached to a 24-300mm lens with hood attached - lens and flash -second camera in top compartment 
2985 It was not for the battery model described above! 
2986 good product. a little hard to close (as these styles are) even with their very clear video, but i got it. The carrying case doesnt have a carrying strap, which would have been nice. 
2987 Gets job done! 
2988 Had to return - would not work wirelessly. Support spent 2 hours with me and ended up telling me to return. 
2989 Pretty good so far, I will see how it goes. 
2990 Excellent quality. CASE LOGIC sells very good products. I really appreciate having a camera case that can withstand rough treatment and protect my cameras and lenses. 
2991 received promptly..... it s now charged up and ready to use 
2992 Awesome! Just get a cheap 1TB USB drive and you are good-to-go! Works perfectly! 
2993 This works like magic! My wife loved it! 
2994 Perfect for the nikon j4, camera lens and accessories 
2995 Absolutely love it. Well made, too. 
2996 Best camera ever had. 
2997 Works well and reasonably priced. 
2998 Super product Excellent service. 
2999 Very nice pack for the price! I have used it heavily over the last couple of weeks. 
3000 fits, and looks good. missing a couple of holes for some openings that you might not need while using the camera. but to get to all the camera slots, you ll have to take the entire case off. makes this camera look like a really expensive good camera. 
3001 Works great and made of quality material. The only thing that I don t like it no identifying mark on the top. When you open the case and have loose items in the large hole they fall out. 
3002 only one of the two batteries actually works 
3003 Everything that is represented in this package came in perfect condition! 
3004 I received the battery quickly and was exactly as I expected. The price was very competitive. I had just bought a new camera and the camera battery was dead. I guess that the way it is, so I was surprised that this battery was fully charged. 
3005 Supports old browser versions (Chrome/IE latest version on Windows 7/8 didn t work) and operating systems (XP, maybe). Couldn t find mobile app either on Android app store. 
3006 The panasonic lens aproved by Blackmagic simply stopped focusing. it is blocked. Is the the problem in the Panansonic Lens or in the Camera ? 
3007 It worked as we have hoped- waterproof. You need to stay still a little longer when you take the picture..., the flash light takes a little longer than other cameras if you need it for picture taking. 
3008 as i coach i love this thing, only thing i do not like is that there is no display but I use my ipad for that. 
3009 A good little camera for the money. Still figuring out all the bells and whistles. Wanted it for baseball and football games. Truly can not go wrong with a Canon camera and this lives up to there reputation. 
3010 Easy to install,works as advertised,no false alarms but did alarm when a flock of doves flew through the beams. 
3011 Good product 
3012 good all around camera 
3013 Excellent 
3014 Wow! I really like this camera bag. I managed to fit a Canon 7D with battery pack, a speedlite, 70-210 and 28-80mm lenses and a few other miscellaneous items inside. 
3015 This is a great case! I love it, it s made my instax much more easily portable - i always have it around my neck :) 
3016 Good Battery. Thank you. 
3017 it s alright 
3018 Can t use my camera without this... 
3019 Good POUCH.... 
3020 Package arrived on time. Lens was in new condition with no defects. Works great. 
3021 Love this camera!!! It connects great to our iPhone and that feature has come in very handy!!!! 
3022 Awesome and quick delivery! 
3023 GREAT 
3024 Great lens, sharp and just what I was looking for. 
3025 Worked for one hour..then died. 
3026 This Drone isn t even a beginner drone. This drone is the worst I ve ever bought. Don t get fooled. Peace 
3027 Everything is pretty easy, except installing the micro SD card. You need to use the round end of a paper-clip to push the card all the way in until it locks. 
3028 Great price for a back up battery. They charged up like my original Canon and so far I am having good success with them. 
3029 it is light, stable and easy to use 
3030 Good product! 😊 
3031 thank you Henry Campbell 
3032 Excellent camera I love this camera I give it a 5 star 
3033 Great camera for everything I need it for 
3034 Great buy 
3035 Worked great with fast shipping. Did exactly what it was supposed to do. 
3036 Exactly what I was looking for 
3037 Excellent 
3038 Lots of room, and it fits behind our truck seat out of sight, lots of padding and protection. 
3039 Great deal, the only issue I have is there s a glare when you use it so it s very hard to see the screen when it s applied 😔 Other than that good product!! 
3040 I was thrilled to find a replacement for my old workhorse 880 
3041 And was surorised to also get a carry case, and charger. Now my Wide angle lens will not go to waste. 
3042 Really good! 
3043 So soft and comfortable on my neck. I ll have to order another with a different design. I love this. 
3044 Not easy to use. I have only been able to see the moon and across the lake where I live. Stars and planets are too hard to find and the auto finder has not yet found one. 
3045 Fast shipped with it but the product was not built for my Samsung Galaxy EK-GC200 as described. The alignment and holes not correct disappointed for sure 
3046 fits most 4x4 filters 
3047 Interchangeable with the original battery in my Panasonic camera. I always want a spare when traveling. Usually try to alternate them. 
3048 Fantastic! Very happy with sling. 
3049 First one had an issue with the HDMI port they made it right highly recommend 
3050 the camera is working very well. Reasonably easy to install (if you know what you are doing). 
3051 Exactly what I was looking for 
3052 good item 
3053 The plastic cracked while putting it on my iPhone5 the first try, so i had to return it. I did try a few shots and they weren t anything special. 
3054 prfect 
3055 Fits great. 
3056 Love this bag... Perfect size. 
3057 Great straps to carry a med-large tripod when in the field. More convenient than the regular case. 
3058 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
3059 very easy to use. thankful for the item. Just as posted. 
3060 Very smooth and great value. Make sure you have the right base on your tripod so you get the correct size dolly. 
3061 Love these lights. I only wish it had come with assembly instructions. (We did figure it out, eventually). 
3062 works great. 
3063 This product is just what I wanted for my camera , it comes very handy and versatile. 
3064 Video image is worse I ve seen. Blurr and out of Focuss. Really felt cheated. 
3065 Works well, the only problem is seeing the wording on the screen, have to use a small flashlight, that stops me from giving it the fifth star... 
3066 Fantastic!!!.. 
3067 I received it much faster than I expected and it works better than the original. 
3068 I like this EP, bright and wide viewing field. Edge to edge sharpness is not perfect however, it s about 70~80% sharp from center. 
3069 Works fine 
3070 Great light, very portable. Love the ability to dim the light also. 
3071 Love this camera. Support was also very helpful when it wouldn t connect to my WiFi. Not connecting was it s only issue. Now works perfectly. 
3072 This strap was more comfortable to wear with the binoculars I bought. 
3073 Great Battery ... So far it perform as good as the original ... highly recommended 
3074 excellent! 
3075 Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software No website information 
3076 Quickly delivery. Brought mainly for the chest mount and head mount which I m very happy with both work well. All other accessories seem pretty decent, will have to use at some point. 
3077 5+++ great people to deal with 
3078 This thing is amazing!! Quality is spot on, you can t beat this thing at the price point or even higher. Get yourself one you won t regret it!! 
3079 It fits my gopro hero 3 just fine. I bought it so I can use the gopro without a battery and house power connected to it when I use it as baby monitor. 
3080 It s okay. Not a great product 
3081 Has some good wind power for cleaning your optics - lenses, camera sensors, inside computers. Nice and simple - no supplies needed. 
3082 It works, before it breaks. After a few years, now all of the plastic pieces on this monopod are broken. For what reason should I ever buy Manfrotto again? 
3083 Exactly what it says it was and worked as well as it needed to. 
3084 Great camera! I have not owned many cameras but this one will last me a very long time. Once I can start getting new lenses I will love it even more. Definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a unique but powerful camera. 
3085 Works great on my camera. 
3086 nice 
3087 Perfect fit for my camera and its charger and a few SD cards. 
3088 very good 
3089 Great product 
3090 Stain on filter when it came. The MagicFiber cloth turns out very useful to remove it. I guess the filter is good for its price, but definitely not using it &#34;full time&#34; due to the visible reflections and lens flare in many situations. 
3091 So far the Yongnuo YN-622N controller and transceivers working flawlessly on both a Nikon D610 and D810. 
3092 no issues. I love this camera. it works for me as advertised. 
3093 Great camera. Very suitable for my needs and takes great pictures. 
3094 Bought this for my Husband and he loved it! Very nice product and a really quick delivery. Would definitely buy from thus company again! 
3095 It is OK for a quick camera 
3096 Very impressed. Easy to use. Like that it s not Bluetooth. Don t have to worry about being charged! 
3097 Ok 
3098 Awesome product 
3099 Danny was great, he fixed everything and was very nice! Good product!! 
3100 Works great. We use these to monitor our pets when we re away. 
3101 It s great but I bought the prime day bundle so not all accesories fits on it so not perfect for my purchase. 
3102 The eyepieces are good quality. iTs a nice set. BUT THE CASE THAT YOU GET IS NOT THE ONE DISPLAYED. You get a black case instead of the brushed aluminum. AMAZON, PLEASE SHOW THE CORRECT CASE!!!!!! 
3103 Nice item, well made. 
3104 My most used lens, especially for HDR photography. I keep forgetting to turn off the image stabilizer when done shooting. See my work on Panoramio. 
3105 Delivered on time and as per description 
3106 very good product. excellent quality 
3107 I am very pleased with this product. I have a Nikon D3300 and it works beautifully with it. 
3108 excellent frame. 
3109 Hard to focus does not take good close up pictures or wide angle seems off but at full telephoto it is better than average 
3110 The edges of the material started to fray after two months. 
3111 Never have to worry about a dead battery. Speedy delivery 
3112 Batteries work as described. Great price on these. 
3113 didn t zoom in on gopro 
3114 Solid, awesome Pelican case as are all the Pelican cases I own! 
3115 great grip. 
3116 Love it. Great pics and no lens moving in and out. 
3117 Just as advertised. Great lens protectors. 
3118 Protection plans are stupid in general 
3119 Great little bag, holds a lot and its well made. 
3120 I like it 
3121 Battery was as expected.. Working great 
3122 No Problems here. Seems to be a good product. 
3123 I would give it a 5 stars if not for the fact that I have to have a tools in order to use it properly. I mean, the D part of the screw (the part we handle) is too small to twist. Other than that, the product is good. 
3124 Works great, no problems can have fresh battery handy when shooting a lot of photos. 
3125 Takes such amazing photos!!! (but i have not been able to find a B&W setting...) 
3126 great 
3127 Worked great 
3128 No problems 
3129 It works but is a little &#34;twitchy&#34; in that it doesn t always want to work properly. 
3130 If you buy a Canon Vixia HF R600, you will not run out of battery with this purchase. A definite must buy. 
3131 Works perfectly! 
3132 Nice and neat for my go pro 
3133 It works perfect. 
3134 LOVE this purchase. I ve used it for multi 5ks, bike rides with the family, basically any experience I want to capture POV - to many to list. Sturdy product, not to heavy or clunky. Thumbs up!! 
3135 It works ! 
3136 Works well, no problems with the mounting brackets or anything. Does get uncomfortable after a little while, but if you re wearing anything more than a t-shirt you do not feel it. Enjoy the flexibility in size. 
3137 Seems to be holding up in water tests (without the camera in it). Does as advertised so far. 
3138 Great lens. I love it! 
3139 Strong clips for the price! 
3140 Better and cheaper than go pro! 
3141 good...... 
3142 Exactly what I needed. 
3143 Awesome 
3144 Work as described 
3145 Very compact and easy to use. These have enhanced many shots for me! Was a little puzzling how to twist them back into the carrying case, but once I figured it out, it is VERY SIMPLE! 
3146 Great value for the price 
3147 Well made. 
3148 Sound quality isn t the best and the battery only lasts for a couple hours, but they are still amazing to have 
3149 Great productos good quality and fits my camera perfectly. 
3150 it was fine 
3151 really surprising 
3152 I have a canon SL1 and works great; easy to use. 
3153 Easy to install and use for magnifying the surface of objects. Good magnification. Excellent value for the price. 
3154 I really like this. It s really cute. 
3155 Excellent! 
3156 Took a spill with my Inspire 1 and tore this cable. This is a perfect replacement. 
3157 Quick delivery- part was right 
3158 This case is awesome. Love it. Works great with my camera. Worth the money 
3159 excellent quality, and after 6 months it works perfectly 
3160 All OK.. 
3161 Pretty average camera, but it works 
3162 I can t say whether the battery life is as long as the factory GoPro batteries, as I haven t done a side by side test. But I ve used these batteries in the camera and so far so good. 
3163 Perfect works great !! 
3164 Works perfect for my camera 
3165 Excellent lens for long distance, fully manual lens, 
3166 Awesome deal, thanks 
3167 Purchased this for a Tokina 11-16mm f/2.8. It s always better to break a 10$ piece of glass than it is to break a 500$ lens. Buy this for your lens. 
3168 Very good! 
3169 Great lens. Works great for family photos and photoshoots. 
3170 Worked great for the first couple of times, then it just stopped workin, only works when I have it charges 
3171 Great camera. Shoots great video. Highly recommended 
3172 Great product, really impressive customer service! 
3173 No issues so far. Haven t used it much yet. 
3174 Works well 
3175 They re nice but they re slightly bigger than the Instax Mini 8 films. 
3176 Cannot get them to work. Only works with Outdated web Browser 
3177 Worked fine for the camera, but figuring out how to attach it with the straps needs instructions. 
3178 Item as described, great product. 
3179 Husband has set it up in his car and kept himself busy for hours with this thing. As long as he s playing with the camera and the car, he s not buggin me! 
3180 Bought it for working on micro soldering, its ok but one axis is reversed without special software. Kids love to play with it and check out all kinds of stuff. 
3181 Good quality, very useful, practical and stylish camera backpack! 
3182 Awesome camera...video is clear, easy setup. I have 2, and I would definitely recommend. 
3183 Sturdy and VERY LIGHT! 
3184 It is not what I expected, I was hoping it was made of a stronger material. 
3185 Sucks....Can t see clearly at night and it also overheats the camera. FAIL 
3186 GOOD COMMERCIAL APPLICATION 
3187 Excellent quality 
3188 Wish I would have gotten one that can take photos with a button at the stem 
3189 Just what I was looking for. Is worth the 4 stars. Super quality also. Just as stated. As good if not better then items that cost more. Well worth the money. Have no real con s at this time and do not dee any in the future. 
3190 Great for crafts, the photos can come out darker but overall love this tiny printer. 
3191 Wonderful for the price 
3192 Had a client inadvertently run cat5e instead of siamese cable. These saved us from having to spend two days re-running cables 70 in the air across the top of a factory floor. Works perfect! 
3193 The pictures all look hazy blue. What I was seeing was more colorful than the pictures. Sending back 
3194 Came with everything I needed. As a professional, I appreciate the quick delivery and excellent care in wrapping. Worked great right out of the box. 
3195 fast deliver and good product 
3196 Returned because Fuji S4800 failed.. 
3197 Quality of leather was below my expectation. 
3198 Alright for walking, but not jarring action. 
3199 I ve had this case for at least 8 years and I ve used it in many different countries. My deepest dive with it was 125 ft and its never leaked. The buttons are easy to use and you get great pic s 
3200 Nice photo frame, works well. Clear picture. Easy to use. 
3201 i like it, but the carrying case is not the one in the picture. 
3202 Best Polaroid film I ve bought in 3 years! I buy it every year for the first day of school photos to use all year...thank you, you took very good care of the film...Janet 
3203 Fits perfectly 
3204 Excellent shipping 8ng and item 
3205 The best glasses cleaners i have ever had. While each cloth is small, the results after use are excellent. A true first class product, i will definatly be ordering more. 
3206 Great deal, batteries and charger work well with my cannon. 
3207 These are great battery. They last longer than I expected, and they stay cool and not heat up as my previous one. 
3208 works well, and very good advice 
3209 Does what it says it will. 
3210 a very fine and honest dealer 
3211 Disappointed no memory card included 
3212 These stick on great I just use my hand to get the dirt off. These are easy to use and are cheaper than any other options. Even if I m not AIing a cow I use them to see when my bull is breeding. 
3213 A-OK 
3214 as advertised 
3215 I bought this product and till now I could not use it because it didn t work, I contact the support and they were unhelpful I m using it right know as a mouse pad 
3216 Wifi switch broke after a few days. Great camera and water proof case. 
3217 Doesn t quite work, stick withy thame original 
3218 Perfect for my tiny Canon camera and charger. 
3219 Excellent value! Polarizing lens makes outstanding pictures of glaciers and waterfalls! 
3220 Was not as expected! Returned! 
3221 leave the blinking LED off. real camera s do not blink. 
3222 Used it for a trip to Europe. Was perfect for what I needed. Compact but plenty of storage. Camera with lens, plus two additional lenses, accessories and an ipad. All fit perfectly. 
3223 Good camera 
3224 Just started my online business and the product MS20 is helping me achieve great images. Very simple and easy to build and use. 
3225 Although I haven t graduated off &#34;Auto&#34; on my K-50, I took some pics through the window of a moving automobile, and they came out Postcard Perfect! Unbelievable--I am impressed! 
3226 Great addition to my everyday out and about photo bag. 
3227 OEM and perfect. Obviously there are cheaper but I m a stickler for consistency. 8-) 
3228 Great starter kit though I wish there was longer battery life 
3229 This OEM battery holder seems very sturdy as it has more metal than the cheaper variety. This holder is worth the money but I would not discount the cheaper ones. I also have one but feel that its life-span would not be as long since it is practically all plastic. 
3230 Piece of crap instructions confusing no help never got it to work sim card still stuck in it a waste of my time and money. 
3231 Work well with connection being tight and secure. Female end a little big hard to hide but with a little finagling all is good 
3232 Perfect design: Absolute functional and gorgeous. Perfect handcraft: Every details are fully considered and covered. The little base might look easy and simple but it involves a lot works and focus. Perfect service: Quick delivery,peace of mind after-sale service! J.B.Camera Designs add extra rejoicing on my photograph! Well done! 
3233 It s been almost 2.5 years since I bought this strap and it was a great purchase. It s nicely padded and I love the versatility the clip system allows for. A comfy strap is a must for using heavy glass 
3234 Save time and frustration...get the original Samsung Battery as a back up. Mine did not hold a full charge...even when charged overnight. Thought I could save a few bucks. Promptly returned for the real thing. 
3235 I works well with Canon 5Dii and plus, the three batteries it uses are AAA and are easily available. 
3236 good 
3237 it does everything i want and is very compact 
3238 Camera is great! Some of the extras have limited use. 
3239 Drone worked great, but had a problem with the camera. Various lines and snow. Otherwise no problems. 
3240 My old camera case is better than this one. 
3241 Love it. 
3242 I love this frame. I have purchased three over the years. Size is nice. And it has been a great gift for my family...I can easily send the grandparents pictures of the family and it will automatically upload to their frame. 
3243 Flimsy and detaches from frame easily. 
3244 Really nice for the money.... 
3245 Great product, alarm up and working again 
3246 Cheaply made. works good 
3247 Plastic snapped off, weak for larger phones, I have an LG G3 
3248 As advertised 
3249 Works perfect 
3250 Great item 
3251 Excelente 
3252 Awful Shoulder strap. Every time you raise the camera quickly, the strap gets tangled in the D ring. This makes the product useless as it prevents a quick draw. Bought a Cotton Carrier and never looked back. 
3253 This camera is simply amazing. I just returned from a week in Cozumel where I took over 800 UW pics with the camera at depths ranging from surface to 105 feet. The pictures are amazing. I highly recommend this camera. 
3254 It doesn t have a motion sensor as it said so it is useless for what I needed it for. Otherwise it s fun to play with. 
3255 excellent 
3256 It works but just not great I the they hyped the product a little much 
3257 Easy to install. I had one camera stop working after 6 months. 
3258 This product is worth the extra money 
3259 worked as advertised 
3260 Great Product! 
3261 I love this camera and enjoy taking pictures with it. 
3262 Great batteries, lasts over an hour with wifi remote on. 
3263 Don t go in the water without it. 
3264 good condition & great price 
3265 Excellent product. 
3266 What a great deal! Got everything I needed for my camera & more! Had no issues whatsoever! Highly recommended! 
3267 Good solid fit. Protects the camera well. It is a little bulky to hang on my belt. I can fit exta battery and SD cards in the front pocket. 
3268 not bad, good protection 
3269 Thank you John, for being so helpful in setting up my camera. I m not very camera smart, but this was the easiest setup I could ever imagine. I highly recommend FOSCAM F18919W, and there team support, especially John. Thank you once again. 
3270 Light and sturdy tripod works wonders when you are traveling or hiking with itit. This is one of those tripods. This product is well worth the money. My brother bought it. 
3271 Works great programmed into my Veralite system. I am very happy. 
3272 Works excellent, good quality 
3273 Unfortunately, I couldn t get it to work :( 
3274 too small 
3275 Arrived earlier than expected. Cannot wait to use it :3 
3276 Great camera pic up several for family and friends. 
3277 Works well on its own; bought it to add to my Staples Connect system which it does however audio is not currently supported via Connect. Product has a fairly good image compared to my multiple FOSCAMs. 
3278 Works perfectly and the charge lasts longer than expected. 
3279 Work really well but do not hold a charge as long as the Canon batteries. but, well worth the price. 
3280 sent back. the eye doc gives bigger cloths than these/The size of a postage stamp!!! 
3281 Very good with this price. 
3282 good price and product. 
3283 Amazing 
3284 Bought this back in 2013 but thought I d still do a review: I use this bag for my Samsung NX1000 and it fits everything. Very spacious and easy to carry and like that it has lots of pockets. 
3285 The brush quality and the size of the blower was bigger than I expected it to be. I ordered the version with the Altura lens cleaner included. I used it on a really filthy telescope eyepiece (with multi-coatings) to no obvious ill effect, so that s good. 
3286 Replacement lens works great, and fits like a glove! 
3287 Nice pouch. Filters fit snugly and padding was good. Folds nicely. 
3288 Lens captures nice crisp shots. Takes the place of original D40 lens and separate 200mm lens. 
3289 Great - just as described & prompt delivery. 
3290 It s a very wide lens for a cctv camera. It s the widest I ve purchased thus far. Picture quality isn t great but it is acceptable. I can see my entire living room which we never thought would be possible with one camera. 
3291 Works 
3292 Works great. Would buy again. 
3293 great deal on a great camera. arrived promptly. 
3294 Wonderfull battery 
3295 This light is bright and a great value! 
3296 It s not so great for outdoors :( I hate it. 
3297 Works great for kids toys that need batteries. Great price! 
3298 Great picture. Touch screen has not panned out yet, but still worth the buy for my CCTV. 
3299 Piece of junk, its the right plug but it won t go into my camera 
3300 Very well built. Straight and solid. A bit heavy, but that s the advantage, it s a solid foundation for multiple cameras. 
3301 basic follow focus, 4 stars as i knew it wasn t going to be great, so as a cheap easy one, sure its a great one. if you want perfect smooth no feeling of the gears when turning, buy a better quality one. 
3302 This comes with all the hardware. it works for distance and close up photography. My only problem is that I haven t found a recharble battery for the flash. 
3303 Works great, just like all other GoPro products. Would have liked more curved mounts for helmets. This package includes 3 curved and 3 flat. Would like to be able to purchase all curved or all flat. 
3304 Purchased this kit, because I lost my other charger and battery. And this one did the job to keep me using my Olympus digital camera. 
3305 Good quality product! 
3306 Excellent lightweight tripod 
3307 Good and solid quality but too big for my small EOS Rebel SL1. Not an appropriate size for people to carry, in my opinion. 
3308 these work great on my husbands camera lenses. very compact! 
3309 Great value for a great product. I bought this as a gift for my wife and was pleasantly surprised by the performance, especially for the price. 
3310 Arrived on time and works as advertised. No problems. A good replacement hood and lens cap for video cameras. A little overpriced. But good. 
3311 I have no idea how this will perform over the long run, hence the four stars, but for now it s performing flawlessly. 
3312 They work very well but the seT up is confusing. I still am having trouble understanding the logging and replay of the history you need to be a very savvy tech person and a couple of hrs to set it up. 
3313 An improved version of the Plume Wafer w/o the cost. I have 2 of them. Great construction! The reflective surface near the center of my Plume came apart after years of use. This looks like it will last a lot longer. 
3314 Great to start with!! Controls are easy to figure and handle!! Unit is durable but lightweight so wind is an issue 
3315 System works great. Dollar for dollar very good value. 
3316 Showed up on time, works exactly as advertised. Also came with a car-charger cable, which is an added bonus. 
3317 good value quick delivery 
3318 Fits my camera perfectly! Love this case! I use it all the time. The material is soft to the touch. I don t use the strap it came with as I wanted a &#34;prettier&#34; one. 
3319 the best I ve ever had. no wires. can go as far as 10 feet. 
3320 LOve it 
3321 Absolutely entirely what I was looking for! 
3322 Exactly what I was looking for 
3323 I lost my original case that came with my Canon camera 
3324 This one was an exact replacement, and i love it. The quality is excellent. 
3325 Lightweight, no binding or slipping, holds tightly to all my filters and lenses. Would be nice if the edge were knurled, hence four stars. 
3326 Very disappointed. 
3327 These Camera s are awesome! Can t tell that they re fake!! 
3328 Awesome lens for the a6000! You would NOT regret buying this lens. NO lens creep, plenty bright in most situations and a great WIDE focal range! 
3329 Great! 
3330 I haven t turned it off since I got it! I think it can do way more than I needed but am very happy I purchased it! 
3331 Great 
3332 seem to work 
3333 Pros: - 75-300mm telephoto zoom lens with f/4-5.6 maximum aperture for Canon SLR cameras - Improved mechanism makes zooming smoother; front part of zoom ring sports silver ring - Measures 2.8 inches in diameter and 4.8 inches long; weighs 16.8 ounces 
3334 Great!! My daughter absolutely loves it!! 
3335 Work and fit just as well as the original. 
3336 Its hard to go wrong with a sling strap and this was a far better deal than the straps at my local stores, it works great and its my favorite strap now 
3337 Not what i expected. 
3338 Outstanding. Works great on my Meade LX200GPS 12&#34; telescope. Good construction, I hope. 
3339 Item as described 
3340 Hood needs to fix. 
3341 kenneth. Took a while with the plugin issues but Kenneth stayed with it until the problem was solved. 
3342 Too tight 
3343 now my husband can capture everything on his GoPro. EVERYTHING. great.... 
3344 No manual to explain things so I had to figure it out by myself, but the grip works well and I really appreciate all of the features. 
3345 does not compatible with 5DS-R. 
3346 Good camera for the price. 
3347 Work great and a good price. 
3348 Great size for a body with attached lens, a second lens, flash and spare battery. I even made a little slot to carry my extra CF cards. 
3349 Very nice!! 
3350 The camera works as advertised. It it works seamlessly with Apple s forthcoming Apple TV/HomeKit system, I will purchase a lot more of them. 
3351 This camera is easy to use. This is my second one I purchased because my husband liked mine so much he wanted his own 
3352 Great for my Nikon D-90. Good low light. Light weight. If you don t mind zooming with your feet. 
3353 Great deal. charger works well and batteries hold a charge like the original gopro batteries. Awesome price! 
3354 Good stuff! 
3355 Works great. I have a Nikon D300 that uses CF. My mac easily takes SD. So, this is a good and easy way to take photos and transfer them to mac (and most other devices). No issues so far. 
3356 Fast shipping & great price - just wish it wasn t so pricey & hard to get them developed when done ! 
3357 For the price it has met my expectations. Been using it an all works good. Video quality is high and the pictures come out good also. So far so good, no complaints! 
3358 great 
3359 Not an actual Nikon product, the rubber was not the same material as the original and if fell apart while removing it from the package. Shipped from China, surprisingly fast but it s junk. Hardly any glue holding the rubber eye piece to the plastic &#34;frame&#34;. 
3360 Foggy picture. 
3361 Great piece of plastic, it s worth it. I ve gotten plenty of reat shots with this lens 
3362 Love it so far... would be nice to have a packing slip in the box. 
3363 My batteries fried in it.. used it once and battery acid went every where. Thought maybe it was bad batteries but then it happened with the next ones i put in too 
3364 Great thing 
3365 My son uses it for his mountain bike races. Works great. 
3366 Excellent quality cable. They were exactly as described and arrived as schedules. Excellent experience. 
3367 Great device! easy to use. 
3368 works as expected 
3369 Very quick service and exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!! 
3370 Easy to configure, two way audio not very good, motion detection not good excellent for the price. 
3371 Works as advertised. Now you don t have to set up the camera with the self-timer and try to run to get in the picture. Just point this little device at your Nikon, and trip the shutter from afar. 
3372 Its a very neat product. Its strong enough to hold the smartphone. As Bluetooth unit is an independent piece, it helps to click from the hand which is not holding the stick and thus avoiding any shaking of the stick. 
3373 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
3374 Sturdy and Stead 
3375 Great product 
3376 Great little tripod that is surprisingly sturdy for the size and price. Folds up nicely into a little carrier. Recommend. 
3377 A very useful add-on for the stabilizer. You can easily get amazing angles with high and low. The length is very easy to adjust. And even if you don t need an extension, the added length helps keep the entire setup smoother. 
3378 Got it on time for my niece birthday she love some how I thought that the film came with the camera cause in the picture the film is next to the camera but it did not sad but true but still I will give it a 5 star 
3379 It works very good to take pictures and video 
3380 very helpful- handy 
3381 After getting the SD Card that it didn t come with, the picture quality was total crap. worthless 
3382 I wish it didn t have the pre-cut slots for things to go. You could fit a lot more if it was like a rifle case. 
3383 Fit and worked great. The price fit perfectly as well! 
3384 Great charger, great battery s, specially for the price!! 
3385 Sweeeeeeet 
3386 Wow, easy set up. Got here on time with no damages. And I ll be ordering another for next year as a 2nd set-up. I highly recommend this product. 
3387 Pretty decent package overall, everything worked and definitely exceeded expectations. As a photo student this is perfect for what I need as well as my career! 
3388 Excellent !! 
3389 Its really good 
3390 Great set I love it 
3391 This was a great buy with many accessories included. They all work well with our gopro hero silver. 
3392 This broke within days of using it. 
3393 Does not fit the camera 
3394 I actually bought this as a gift for my three year old. Only down side is it does not make the shuter sound when you take a photo, so it is difficult to tell if your photo actually took 
3395 These batteries work great in my Canon camera and charge quickly. They were priced much lower than any of the other batteries. 
3396 They re perfect and a lot less that Canon 
3397 it s a good system. However, I wish it wasn t complicated to connect to your wireless device such as download Skype set up two different Skype accounts in order to view live on your wireless devices 
3398 Bag was a perfect fit for my G11 camera. Also has an extra slot inside to put things like extra memory cards or driver license and credit cards for easy travel. 
3399 For the price, these things exceeded my expectations. Highly recommend for either day or night 
3400 Coke bottle optics 
3401 the battery does not fit in exactly as this is for multiple types of batteries. Consequently, my grandchild who uses it becomes frustrated at times. 
3402 Excellent purchase! 
3403 Works perfectly! Better than the OEM one. 
3404 Nice size for easy use. Much better than those you get with your average cleaning kit s which tend to be too small and make it easy to smudge what you just cleaned. 
3405 Great product! I love mine. 
3406 The adapter did physically join my EOS camera to a manual film lens but the focal point was way too short to be of any use to anyone. 
3407 Very disappointed that it did not have belt loop to allow it to be carried on my pants belt. It is simply a cover. 
3408 The service was very good, but the glasses doesn t work. 
3409 Great product. Easy to use and took great pictures. 
3410 Its the best rig , for only 40$ you have a excellent rig with some funtions 
3411 Awesome product for the price. Sturdy and reliable. Recommend this product! 
3412 Great!!! 
3413 Definitely recommend for the price!! Can t beat it! 
3414 Don t substitute and buy off-brand batteries. Go with the real deal. They fit the camera and work as advertised. 
3415 Works great. No issues 
3416 Have had camera for a while.. Changed router and couldn t connect WI-Fi. Called service and they had me up and running in a few minutes. Kudos to service dept. Love camera. 
3417 Great price and product. 
3418 thank you 
3419 Works better then the original 
3420 Had to replace a couple of rivets as they broke off. Otherwise a nice genuine goat leather bag for my camera equipment. 
3421 I ADORE this strap. I did a ton of research, as a photography college student I was getting so sore after a day of shooting. This strap has made a huge difference, I don t have a sore shoulder anymore and I feel it distributes the weight well. 
3422 No records goes to the battery being charged, it has given me too many problems 
3423 As good as the brand name battery at 1/5 the cost!! 
3424 Good battery!!!!! 
3425 not very good qaulity and i have great internet speed in my home. im a systems admin so no problem setting up. terrible camera all around 
3426 Products were as described 
3427 works perfectly 
3428 Keeps my camera and equipment safe and well packed. Great buy. 
3429 Good 
3430 For the price, eh. I d spend that much on a good coffee, but the quality just sucks. It &#34;works&#34; but the instructions are inaccurate, the thing has to be reset all the time and the image quality is terrible. If you want one of these, spend a little more. 
3431 Saved my phone from sinking to the bottom of the river when tubing. One of the smartest purchases I ever made! 
3432 It came with some defects.. the housing that is covering the transformer it took off and I had to use adhesive to attach it again.. 
3433 Good product 
3434 Excellent binoculars. Everyone in the family enjoyed them. 
3435 Really nice camera, 24 MP sensor lots of excellent features, particularly like the articulating screen. If you don t have antique lenses, it ll work fine for you. 
3436 I was quite disappointed; when the kit arrived the original package was opened, both brushes and cleaning liquid missing. The paper and micro fiber cleaning pad dirty and torn, in a state that I would not recommend using it on a optical devices. 
3437 Good product 
3438 So easy to use! Great inexpensive flash. 
3439 Nothing like the OEM product for the Canon gear. Price is the worst, but seems to recharge better and last longer then the 3rd party batteries 
3440 Awesome HD CCTV video, yeah HD, and you can watch from anywhere on your phone. 
3441 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
3442 totally loved it...works beyond what I expected...great buy...worth it... 
3443 Excellent product - works great 
3444 Nikon is best and this filter too. 
3445 Great lens, love that I can get in close, but has a hard time focusing. I m thinking of selling it because I don t use it that much for weddings. 
3446 Every thing I expected at a very good price. Easy to read and understand instruction manual. 
3447 Nice pair of batteries. 
3448 Very good ty 
3449 Exactly what i needed. Thanks! 
3450 Good 
3451 I am very happy with the product. It serve its purpose quite well: I use it at home for guests, since it is not something very handy to carry around in trips. :-) 
3452 It only worked for 3 days. 
3453 Not really the shutter button didn t work. 
3454 I was not happy with the camera. Quality is so so. I am returning it and purchased the printer to work with my smartphone. 
3455 a gift for my grandson in college and he was pleased. He is studying film. 
3456 While I don t use either the blue or the yellow, the white one works great when you don t want to haul around off-camera lighting or you want to be more discreet than a big soft box. Easier than making your own or holding up a piece of paper. 
3457 This camera one of the best in the market , I will give 10 stars if I have money I will buy another one ,this some pictures I took from iPhone to show how nice is the control panel, 
3458 It s a light weight tripod and easy to set up. I wish the swiveling was smoother though. Good for taking pictures, not as good for taking video that is action oriented. 
3459 Feels very solid, but has a nice light weight to it. Works smoothly with the right weight balancing it. Really love this jib, I ll be using this a lot in my work. 
3460 Why do I keep losing these things? Not sure, but this is a great replacement. 
3461 no information came no direction just the syma came 
3462 Just what I needed. Thanks. 
3463 works well 
3464 Leaked. Resolution was OK but not great before that, now its full of water.... 
3465 Just love the bag - had to pruchase both colors! 
3466 All sorts of cheap plastic crap for your gopro. 
3467 I am really happy with this product. Easy to use easy to install. And works as advertised 
3468 Batteries seems to be made in china,but it works great. Best deal possible for the amount of money spent! 
3469 The price is very reasonable 
3470 love it 
3471 Excellent 
3472 Great Product will buy again. 
3473 Great gift 
3474 I either lost or never had a charger for this camera. It worked perfectly 
3475 At times it does look a a bit cheap, but it has the style I was going for and has proven relaible 
3476 You get a lot for the money with this camera. I ordered it for the price/quality/features. The features are very impressive at this price point. 
3477 Worked great for my Nikon battery that I can t find the charger for, and the replacement batteries work perfectly in the camera. 
3478 Camera came/delivered two days after I ordered it (the day between ordering and delivery was a Sunday too!) in great condition. Instructions came in English and several other languages, along with helpful pictures to show how to operate the camera without much reading required. 
3479 seems to work alright 
3480 Great product. Uses very low current. Very easy to install. Just connect to the siren terminals.sound is loud enough and strobe is OK but not like a Police cruiser. 
3481 all that i want 
3482 Excellent 
3483 Great service and prompt delivery! Thanks a bunch!! A+ 
3484 Great camera! 
3485 Great product. Lightning aquick shipment. 
3486 I see you!!! Now 
3487 get the heck outta here before I call the police 
3488 it works 
3489 love it ! 
3490 These are really nice little connectors at a very good price! 
3491 It is light and cute I just hope they had different fabrics 
3492 Great low cost alternative some of the much more expensive shutter releases. I ve put this through its paces. It s held up well and has helped me shoot some of my best long exposure b 
3493 exactly as described, works perfectly, well machined and fits my tripod quick release plate. note: you can t tighten with allen key, either by hand or a coin. 
3494 Everything showed up in one shipment exactly as advertised. Very happy with my purchase and choice of retailer. 
3495 It makes viewing the night sky easygoing! Constellations are now easy to find and view. 
3496 didn t last very long :( 
3497 good 
3498 the flash lamp broke down after 3 days of use 
3499 Very light and easy to carry! good looking! 
3500 They re perfect for my glasses, iPad, and iPhone! It s nice to know that I can scatter these throughout my home and always have one available. Thank you 
3501 Works as advertised. Good product. My use is a high gain long distance receiver for my RV, and it works great. 
3502 Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area). 
3503 This is crap. It was really hard to seat on my 5D Mark III and not accurate according to two other levels I tested it against. Is it possible to give this zero stars? 
3504 Very good 
3505 good. 
3506 Nice camera,easy to use,easy to carry 
3507 Haven t used it much but so far its really good. Need to practice more w/ it. 
3508 It was adverticed 
3509 awesome love it 
3510 Very fast shipping. Holds my camera and all lenses. 
3511 Worked fine. VHS C cassette fit and ran as expected in the VCR. Fast delivery. 
3512 a bit cheaply made, but it pretty much does the job, especially for the price. 
3513 Great beginner set-up. 
3514 The Pixel Vertax D15 battery grip for Nikon D7100 works well on D7200. It s to bad u can t put 2 batteries in the grip like the grip for my old D90 s 
3515 It sort of did the job but it was hardly the easiest, clearest product on the market. 
3516 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
3517 Camera had good image quality compared for its price. Promised 60fps was not achieved on 720p resolution but apr. 48-50fps but it is still better than 30fps from ordinary webcams. Well worth its price. 
3518 Pretty cool softbox, look forward to using them shortly 
3519 This camera does not take very good pictures but it s not an expensive camera either. Pictures are grainy and the further away you are from the subject the more grainy they are. 
3520 Inexpensive and sounds great!!!!! 
3521 Good 
3522 excellent design 
3523 Solid case for air-travel with any kind of tools! Sturdy & Rugged! 
3524 important to protect the lens. 
3525 awful camera, doesn t include everything you need as well as just an awful camera I would highly recommend not buying it 
3526 It s ok in a pinch if you didn t have lens cleaner and tissue, however, it still leaves some residual smudges. If I had both, my preference would be the cleaner and tissue. 
3527 Fine 
3528 great 
3529 This is great. Out met my expectations. Delivery was on time. Would definitely buy from them again. 
3530 works great, good buy for the money 
3531 Very poor quality. Pictures are dark, sometimes scrambled, and strange signs are sometimes shown instead of pictures. I’ve always had good luck with Amazon, but these frames are definitely not as advertised. 
3532 Excellente Stick. Nothing else to say. EXCELLENT 
3533 Good dog watcher. May buy more 
3534 Great cameras and used daily! 
3535 Bought with the secondary battery unit, all works well! 
3536 Has held up well over the last few months, plenty of room, zippers work well. Good padding and several zippered pockets. Well made! 
3537 Perfect fit for fuji xt1 
3538 This was given to my daughter as a Christmas gift and she likes it very much. 
3539 I bought a camera second hand and the strap was missing. I ordered this as I like to carry a camera and don t want to keep fishing it out of a pocket or purse. The main strap is very comfortable and doesn t dig in to my wrist. 
3540 Iam glad to get the battery thanks 
3541 Very decent camera for what I needed to view. Also the price is great. I had to purchase an extra 150ft bnc cable for it to reach its location. Works great at night. Great buy. Bought 8 and all came ready to install! 
3542 This was a birthday gift for my wife. Her Nikon D7100 fits in here along with her 24-70mm lens and her primary lens. Great for carrying her camera and tablet and other stuff. She loves it! This is a keeper. 
3543 Excellent. I bought this for a Panasonic Lumix FT6, and its much slimmer than apparently all the alternatives. Floats well and doesn t look like a lift jacket on my wrist. 
3544 great flash 
3545 Excellent filter. I got amazing pictures. 
3546 Great!! I love it 
3547 great 
3548 Good camera, great zoom. The USB connector is hard to use and seems prone to breakage. External charger recommended - connecting camera to wall electrical outlet using the connector in the camera is not convenient at all. 
3549 Great product. Setup was simple. Works as advertised with no problems. I would buy this again. 
3550 very compact, great quality. would buy again! 
3551 works well 
3552 worked grate for what i was using it for. 
3553 I was nervous but pleasantly surprised. Very nice case and fits all my Phantom 3 components perfectly. I usually never leave feedback either. Good purchase 
3554 Zero stars if I could. This item doesnt work to charge your camera. Dont buy it! Waste of time and money. 
3555 used very well 
3556 Bought these to clean fingerprints off the screens of our tablets and they work great. 
3557 Met expectations. 
3558 This product is just what I needed to comfortably carry my camera and equipment in. I especially like the side pocket for storing a mini tripod. Everything that I currently use fits inside and it is still light weight and easy to manage. 
3559 another one bites the dust after I took it in the water 100 buck down 
3560 camera works great as it should and is water proof.battery last a long time. 
3561 it is a beautiful, fashionable product and i love it so much 
3562 Great value for money. 
3563 Everything fit in nicely. Nice sturdy case with handle. My only complaint is you have to be sure to open it right side up or it all falls out. It needs a lid inside so things don t fall out. 
3564 It replaced a like unit that I wore out. This one is in very good condition, and I am having absolutely no problems with the camera. Thanks for asking. 
3565 This worked very well for my very old Jason 12 x 40 binoculars. Easy to get on and off and kept the binoculars protected while in my backpack. 
3566 Excellent product. Well built n light! 
3567 I feel cheated, I did not get all of what I should be able to, the lens is only one, should the two 
3568 think tank is the way to go, I can carry my stuffs without a bag now 
3569 Works, good price 
3570 Camera did not recognize this battery as Info-Lithium. 
3571 Meh optics, sent it back. 
3572 Nice stand and price 
3573 I like the compactness and versatility. 
3574 Bought for daughter who is 10 
3575 Does what it says 
3576 Cheap cost. Well made. It s light and easy to operate. Awesome! 
3577 Very nice for a point and shoot. Takes great pictures does everything as advertised. 
3578 Works great with my Nikon D7100 
3579 Great batteries! Good charge time. 
3580 The original model order had been discontinued. The substituted camera (this model) has been installed and is working wonderfully. The images seem to be sharper. Quite happy with this purchase. 
3581 Works well. I have not had issues with it. 
3582 Great product. 
3583 Does not work 
3584 This camera is absolutely fantastic. I got it during one of the promotions, and I am very pleased with my decisions. The photo quality, camera size, battery life, wifi, etc all a plus. 
3585 Works great!! 
3586 I am very happy with all of our purchases. 
3587 Another cool go pro mount for a GREAT price! 
3588 My tv lamp popped five minutes after I put it in, the glass on it was in pieces, the product was defective, I have bought this product before and it took a year for it to do that, so I was very unsatified this time around 
3589 I use this periodically for my camera it works great. 
3590 Video recording quality is not that great but takes great shots. 
3591 I really love this camera bag. I have my camera, 2 lenses, a laptop, a sound recorder, headphones, and a ton of other stuff in it, and it holds everything in place very well. I would definitely recommend buying it! 
3592 Given as a gift. They really like it. 
3593 Very helpful and effective.Thanks! 
3594 I m very happy with the product. I received it quickly. Easy to use and durable. 
3595 A little bigger than I expected but works just like I wanted 
3596 Literally bs, pay so much for so little and such bad quality. It s like there s a horrible filter on every picture. Don t waste your time haha 
3597 Perfect for what I want, very lightweight and clear,crisp lenses. 
3598 Good stuff 
3599 Great Camera with lots of features. The WiFi transfer screen is bit confusing but its OK. 
3600 Works very well - program syncing with transmitter was easy to do 
3601 love this pack 
3602 Brand new! 
3603 The light was awesome! Works great! The adhesive didn t work very well on the car door though. Had to use a different kind. The bat signal is super crisp and clear, but the avengers one is just a bit fuzzy. 
3604 Excellent 
3605 Great camera. 
3606 No, used it on Sony Handycam HD, it did not improve telephoto capability the way I expected. 
3607 everyone is amazed of the output and capabilities 
3608 Good 
3609 Great product, got some new clothes to go with my new glasses and frames. Couldn t be happier! 
3610 Great product 
3611 Replacement was a snap. just follow directions. Your device will last longer and charge fully after the first few uses. 
3612 that plastic is so weak,keep tearing apart 
3613 I m having issues with charging it will not take a charge at all. I purchased the extended warranty with it but I m not sure how to claim it. Any help would be great. 
3614 The battery was about a millimeter off from the correct size, so it would only make momentary and unreliable contact with the Canon camera s battery housing, which made it unusable. Had to send it back. Return was handled promptly, but I would recommend using another retailer for this battery. 
3615 This is my second order love them. 
3616 disappointed in the fact that the autofocus feature on the camera will not work with this lens 
3617 Very cheap and not easy to use I ended up going to Sams Club and having my slides professionally transferred the Quality was so much better at Sams Club then this device claimed there product would be, Stay away from it, waist of time and money 
3618 Works great, motion sensor record good at 30 feet. Only 720p so not real sharp and low light recording is dark. It has IR but I don t use it and doubt if it would be any clearer. 
3619 The small diameter of the tripod are is prohibitive. I have a very small tripod (fits easily into a water bottle pouch on a bag), and I couldn t get it into this tiny thing. At best, the diameter is 1.5&#34;-2&#34;. Don t recommend. 
3620 Great addition to my GoPro accessories....quality product.....great price....BUY this is worth it! 
3621 Can t use my camera without this... 
3622 Thank you, :) 
3623 This bag is great! I highly recommend it. 
3624 bought to go with camera as gift for 11 year old very cute -she loves it 
3625 I sent the product back. It didn t hold time. Nor was it user friendly. It also only recorded short clips. 
3626 Simply perfect! 
3627 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
3628 Small, light in weight and perfect to carry anywhere. Incredible customer service with immediate response to an issue I was having. I would order again in an instant 
3629 Lost mine along the path of the USA so I need another one and this is the one I picked works great on my camera. 
3630 Had to return it because it doesn t fit my T5i with the standard lens. 
3631 Arrived early and tested the product in the field and it works well.A good investment. 
3632 I used these inserts while scuba diving in Aruba. They worked very well, keeping the inside of my Go-Pro dry and fog-free! An excellent product. 
3633 solid purchase...haven t had to use them much as I tend to mount my camera in other ways more often than not. 
3634 Fit perfectly. A little pricey for not authentically Canon. Did not receive cleaner cloth shown in picture. 
3635 I am thrilled about the quality of images this camera produces. 
3636 This is a high quality case for gopro cameras. It comes with the foam insert and the construction and materials are excellent. There was a slight issue with my initial order but customer service took care of it right away. Great service! 
3637 This product is a very good ,it lets you know when someone is either coming on your drive way or on your drive way. Thanks Amazon. 
3638 Perfect 
3639 The filters are of good quality and easy to use. I only wish that I did n t have to buy all the different size adap. rings each time I buy more filters. I use 62 and 72mm only. The others are a waste of money. 
3640 Purchased two, one worked the other we sent back. Received the replacement in two days and works great. We love them. 
3641 Works great. 
3642 The best 35mm lens in the market. 
3643 I m really enjoying this camera. It replaces a Nikon that poor battery life. Happy to say that this camera takes awesome pictures and is so user friendly. I love the rechargeable batteries too! Would definitely purchase this one again. 
3644 Fast delivered, very nice! 
3645 Clear, colorful pictures, lightweight and easy to handle. The supplied accessories that came in this package are sufficient for starting out. Didn t realize it came with a second battery. 
3646 Love this camera easy to pack takes great pics and has a strong telephoto. 
3647 I could not set it up on an Android phone. Set it up with an iPad and then I could get notifications through email. I bought factory refurbished and the work fine. 
3648 Nice that they have different magnification 
3649 When I got it seemed OK after recording one time tried to record again when I needed it would not even light up. I had even charged it up to make sure had full charge. 
3650 Great camera. 
3651 Terrible product. Has a bounce upon each revolution of the bearings. 
3652 This is a great product. Totally recommended product. 
3653 fake 
3654 I bought it for my mirrorless camera, it is a good quality Camera Bag. 
3655 everthing is perfect. We are happy.... 
3656 my son loved this. 
3657 Awesome case , nice foam inserts 
3658 Just as described. 
3659 Original lens cap replacement. Design flaw is that there is no way to attach a string from the lens to the cap to prevent loss. 
3660 Good camera. Small. Takes good pics. 
3661 Nice 
3662 WORKS GREAT 
3663 Good Product, but it s not useful, due to the position of the camera. 
3664 This is a great little gadget. 
3665 Real little difference with the picture, but the product is very positive. 
3666 for my purposes it is great, light weight, nice zoom 
3667 The picture quality is good considering the resolution, .effective and easy to set up 
3668 Ok it works 
3669 Great Quality! For low-light applications the night vision works very well. It s like have a DVR at the front gate. 
3670 Adds lots of flexibility to any photo shoot 
3671 Installed easy to my alarm system. 
3672 did not order this camera 
3673 i would not recommend purchasing this item.. for a few more dollars you can can abetter product 
3674 Was shipped with an incorrect ac adapter. After purchasing a new adapter I found the camera did not function at all. I returned it. 
3675 Very useful product. Excellent condition. 
3676 My son loves this. So much came in this kit. For the price, I was concerned about the quality. I was wrong, the quality is great. He has used all the pieces multiple times and hasn t had any issues. Great quality, great price, great product. 
3677 Best purchase for the money. It keeps my cameras handy. 
3678 Excellent 
3679 I love this tripod, I saw a review of this tripod on Amazon reviews in a video with a gentleman withe no hands. It came already assembled. 
3680 Great camera. The optical and the digital zooms are better than expected. The picture quality is excellent. Even after a few years of use. 
3681 The wrong charger and battery was shipped. Parts shipped was not as advertised. 
3682 It fits perfectly and the string is perfect. Why the original didn t come like this I ll never know. Sony messed up. I lost it before I d had my camera a week. I believe this one will hang around longer! 
3683 Well built, saves the hassle of running a separate power line to the camera or other device! 
3684 It s all ok! 
3685 The battery last twice the time than the stock one in my camera. Honestly I am very please with this and I would recommend to anyone. 
3686 Arlo has many holders available. You get a bunch and an adjustable one with the $499.95 kit. they all work well. I bought 2 extras because I wanted to mount the cameras differently. It is a matter of your taste on what you want to use. 
3687 The camera and lens that comes with it are a good quality, all the other stuff is junk and not even compatable with this camera 
3688 Bad quality 
3689 The plug works very well charged my camera right a way 
3690 Tried to get ADT Pulse Hub to recognize it. Never was successful. I can t say whether it was the Pulse Hub or the Wi-Fi Repeater but it has never worked. 
3691 awesome 
3692 Cheap and convenience 
3693 don t buy it doesn t work with 1DX :( 
3694 Bought this for my Dad s 90th birthday. Arrived before they said it would. Was easy to set up. Very happy with it. 
3695 great product 
3696 Product was as advertised. 
3697 These lens caps are perfect for keeping your GoPro lens clean and scratch free. Perfect fit and the lanyards are a good size. 
3698 it works 
3699 This camera has been awesome to use. Really need a tripod for the super zoom to work. 
3700 no what I expected. Not expecting a fisheye look. I thought it was just a wide angle lens. 
3701 Awesome product! 
3702 I own a Blackmagic Cinema Camera and I was looking for a good wide angle lens. This lens is the perfect match for this camera to establish great long shots. 
3703 Camera is great but seller indicated all accessory and that didn t happen camera 5 stares seller 21/2 
3704 Great bundle. It had everything I needed to get started taking pictures. 
3705 Great product. Would have given 5 stars but the view when hanging on the wall is a little dark from the bottom. Will lower Frame or tilt to fix. 
3706 Great dea!! 
3707 great 
3708 Cap is good. Fits well. However it is unclear how the strap can be fastened. It is a big loop 
3709 Battery door is very difficult to open. Otherwise I love it as alleviates having to change batteries during shoots. 
3710 Great Quality. Great Value. Great company. 
3711 Works great , but is 720x480 ... P5534 is better! 
3712 Super fast shipping, amazing product. Made our vacation special. 
3713 Excellent camera, just the size I was looking for. It does much more than what I know what to use it for, but it takes great photos. 
3714 Pain in the ass.... The recording is complicating and the wires gets all over.. Going wireless next time 
3715 Conterfeit item,does not work for nikon camera 
3716 So far so good. Fits great, holds great. Seems well made. Use it with my drift camera and it holds that no problem. 
3717 This is a large bag that fits my canon slr with the huge 200 mm lens, and two other lenses. Easy access to The camera and plenty of compartments 
3718 My daughter loved it! Her friends and her had fun with taking pictures. 
3719 not very functional. 
3720 Exactly as described! Fits Canon Charger perfectly and of course the camera. Would purchase this item again and from this vendor as well. 
3721 easily a quarter of the price for same quality you would get out of something 3 to 4 more times expensive. 
3722 Great camera. I received it on Wed and used it yesterday for the first time. It is great that it comes with the SD card so it can be used out of the box. The picture/video quality was really good. I am happy I purchased it. 
3723 Ver y good 
3724 Not sure if was defective or just junk, but it only recorded 7 minutes until it started deleting the previous videos. This was on a 64mb card with 11 hours of available space. 
3725 Cannot beat such a neat little reflector/diffuse for such a low cost! Used it on a shoot today, worked perfectly! Gave just the right amount of flash that I needed to fill my subjects with! Would definitely recommend for someone on a budget and needs something simple. 
3726 Great product, easy to apply and use. Helps to place on an additional/extra back plate for change out during non-water use. 
3727 I bought one adapter before this one and it didn t work. (Maybe you saw my other review.) My pentax pk lense mounted easily to to the adapter, and it mounted even easier to my camera. 
3728 It s terrific having three optimized USB ports for charging phones and keeping my MIFI running while on the road. This device works very well. 
3729 These are great. Good buy. Will buy again. 
3730 The harness is a perfect match. It allows me to do the activities I love and create memories at the same time. I would definitely recommend! 
3731 Nice,look little fragile 
3732 a great addition to the gopro hero 4 black. 
3733 very good kit and lens 
3734 The first one broke as soon as I got it so I had another shipped...seller was great, item somewhat cheap 
3735 Batteries are a perfect fit and perform just like the originals. I like the charger also because it is not a fast charger and the batteries stand up in it and not laying down. 
3736 This is a terrific filter. I would continue to order Tiffen products. 
3737 good case 
3738 not a movement friendly camera though and no sports setting 
3739 The screw in plate that connects to the camera tripod mount was not threaded. There is at least one other reviewer that had the same problem. 
3740 Good light 
3741 Awesome 
3742 can t seem to get it to work right 
3743 Fits, no problems. Does the job. 
3744 Better than I thought it would be!! 
3745 A useful product of rather good quality. 
3746 it is very helpful 
3747 I bought this for my husband for christmas and he likes it. For the price, you would expect it to take a little bit better pictures but its ok. Only other con is that it goes through batteries very quickly. 
3748 Works as well as the branded battery. 
3749 Great value for the money and shipped quick. 
3750 Received my new battery charger in a flash. The product was of good quality and used it immediately upon receiving thanks 
3751 Fits well and thanks to the variety of sizes, you have options to make it work for your need. 
3752 Could not see a thing during night or day!! Returned. 
3753 My teen loved it 
3754 Excellent for see horse race 
3755 Great 
3756 No comments 
3757 The charge pack is so small and compact 
3758 Received product on time unit was well built and Exceeded my expectations for the price Had a small problem with tilt function but has been resolved. Great product for the money. 
3759 I love this lens. I have taken some really amazing macro photos. It came on time and was in good condition. 
3760 What fun! Takes some training to fly this properly, but it s a lot of fun to learn. 10 minutes goes by very quickly. Can t wait to test video capability. 
3761 Cute protective case but I m always a little paranoid of the side hinge coming undone. 
3762 good 
3763 Great little portable light source. It s very bright and compact so it takes little room in my camera bag. can be used as a fill-in source for close up photo s as well. Well morth the money, a good value. 
3764 This tripod is fantastic! Heavy duty quality construction, versatile adjustments, works perfect with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Looked at many tripods and none come close to this for the price. Home run Amazon. 
3765 Constantly falls off camera lens, very limited use. 
3766 Very cheap looking and sheer. 
3767 Easy to use, instant gratification and lots of fun for teens who want more than posting pics. 
3768 Excellent product, a hard to find replacement battery charger. Works as advertised 
3769 Simple to use. Easy to understand instructions. Feels solid but can be a little finicky. Getting everything set-up correctly and it s a good remote. 
3770 Great camera, the zoom is incredible, i recommend it 
3771 all products delivered as advertised. 
3772 Great value - 1/3 boxes so far good. Can t find a better deal else where! 
3773 No leaks! Years of use now! 
3774 My nephew loves this. Easy to set up. Great resolution. Fantastic for all ages. 
3775 A+ thanks 
3776 This really works well. My wife uses it with the GoPro when scuba diving and it s great. Has never flooded on dozens of dives so feel free to keep whatever you need in the handle and it will stay dry. 
3777 Very nice product, daughter loves it for her new GoPro. 
3778 GOOD QUALITY NO INSTRUCTIONS 
3779 I must have older Flip...these wont plug into mine goofed again 
3780 Original Canon hood, so how to say, even though there is a circle gap between lense, it may be normal or supposed to be? I guess. 
3781 Like it it serve the purpose. 
3782 Works perfectly. 
3783 For a basic green screen setup this is ok, I only gave it 3 stars because the price is WAY too high. Also, there is no way to hang it long ways. 
3784 The quality of picture not that clear 
3785 package not good very poor 
3786 Not worth the money. Does not fit properly. 
3787 Great everyday lens should you not want to carry the extra bulk of the larger lens and just want to take snaps and not think too much. Bokeh effect is good on close subjects. 
3788 Very nice, light, and stable tripod that straps perfectly under my backpack. I like the latching leg hardware. Quick and easy. Ball top is stableand quick-connect mechanism is secure. 
3789 Magnet not sticky enough 
3790 I would recommend this product 
3791 Works nicely! 
3792 A bit too big for my day to day needs, but still a good set. 
3793 Good charger. Better than expected for price 
3794 it is very easy to use very convnient i like it. also they have best friendly customer service. 
3795 The case looked really cool. The clasp however were cheap and was hard to snap or take off. 
3796 I bought it as a gift....it was happily recieved and used. 
3797 I changed all the settings on the back to self timer on my Canon 6d and I could not get this remote to work. I even replaced the battery inside to see if that was the issue & it still didn t work. Having to return it. :( 
3798 Awesome product, fast delivery. Thanks! 
3799 I m so glad I bought this! I had a great zoom lens before, but this is lighter to carry around and all the pictures just come out great! 
3800 Neat camera with great features. Like using it with my phone but the app is a little weak. Wifi stopped working after a few months and now the camera is worthless. Too Bad! 
3801 It is a great neoprene cover that protects the camera from scratches and minor bumps. It is adjustable and that makes a lot easier to use the same camera cover with a variety of lenses 
3802 Great Camera. 
3803 NO! It didn t! The darn thing didn t even work! I hope NOONE ever buys anything from Discount Jungle ever again! They are crooked! Update: July 2016- I NEVER got a replacement camera or my money back! 
3804 You get what you pay for. I spent way too much time on each prop to get them as close to balanced as I could. The system didnt seem to be very accurate on any even and balanced surface I tried it on. 
3805 Good quality if you are a person that takes care of your things. I hesitated at first with some of the comments about quality, however no product will last if you don t take care of it. Excellent value for the price. 
3806 It doesn t work 
3807 I put this on my E-M5, and it really helps give a more stable grip... adds just enough size to let my hand hold the camera more naturally. 
3808 good 
3809 Solid company 
3810 Not in love with the color. Feel like it washes out the color in your image. They re fair. But not high quality. 
3811 I like the customization available with the velcro insert - it fits my needs perfectly! The shipping was super fast and the item was exactly as advertised. 
3812 Perfect product :) 
3813 works great 
3814 This crap will void your gopro warrentee, do not purchase it. 
3815 excellent! 
3816 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
3817 excellent item, solved my problem 
3818 This camera did not meet my expectations because the motion detector mode and the sound detector mode activated the camera every 2 minutes for two hours. It works okay in manual mode and the image quality is mediocre. It does come with may attachments for mounting the camera. 
3819 You really get what you pay for here. The filters scratch VERY easily. 
3820 Excellent product very good seller 
3821 It brings life to my camera but it needs some upgrades. It needs to mark the buttons better. I like it a lot. It s not easy to use the camera at first. It definetly protects the body. 
3822 just a tipp to the EU customs offices. This device MUST NOT be imported to the EU because of a lack of user manual in EU languages. The user manual is only chines which has to be taken ass an afront to EU regulations and againt EU customers. 
3823 Awesome product & awesome quality 
3824 Didn t work with my Nikon D750 even though it says it is compatible. I spent an additional $5 for a new battery and still doesn t work. Save yourself the hassle and some money in the long run by passing on this and buying the Nikon brand. 
3825 Excelent! 
3826 Great mounting kit, with this kit you can really mount the remote anywhere. I have it mounted on my goPole to use as a selfie stick for my girls. 
3827 Does exactly what it s supposed to do - securely holds my flash onto my light stand. The clamp for holding an umbrella is a little tight at first, but that gives me piece of mind that it s secure. 
3828 The perfect addition to the RX-100 series of cameras. It gives you a nice gripping point that allows for a much firmer grip on the camera... 
3829 Use this for astrophotography. Works great. Use on Pentax cameras 
3830 Item works great. One must go online to read directions though as the printed edition has minute printing. 
3831 This was a great purchase with the GoPro camera! 
3832 perfect 
3833 Maybe it was me but I could not get the thing to zoom in and see anything. I returned it. 
3834 I bought this as a baby monitor and it does not work. The recording lags sometimes minutes behind real time or will time out completely. Nothing scares a new mother more than to wake up and see the video frozen. 
3835 This is renamed Looxcie LX2 which I have with 480p at 4:3 aspect ratio, good enough for the price I bought for $40.00. Red LED lit if recording, if you try filming ongoing police activity better cover that red LED with black cut out electrical tape before doing so, lol. 
3836 Motion detector does not work properly need to send it back to get exchange 
3837 So far so good! 
3838 Looks great, awesome quality 
3839 great 
3840 I miss the buttons that you normally get other that that great little compact 
3841 all ok 
3842 Great product and service, 
3843 My wife enjoys this camera,body color and great resolution 
3844 As described 
3845 I knew Bolide for good quality security equipment, but this change my mind, i bought 8 units, and 5 are defective, during almost 4 months of working well, 5 of 8, got a bad image. Really disappointed for this bad experience. 
3846 Ordered this case for my Hello Kitty Polaroid came and it fits like a glove. Took the camera to the beach and the case did its job well. No sand got into the lens and kept it safe. 
3847 Great thanks! 
3848 Great option for a cheap ND filter. There is some dark banding when turned all the way up in bright outdoor environments, but otherwise very usable footage. 
3849 Dose it record video with voices or without voices? 
3850 Very tight fit. Runs small 
3851 really good point and shoot camera. would highly recommend as a first camera. 
3852 This is a stylish photo album to put these pictures in !!! This is a bueatiful album looking in it just. Makes my day 
3853 perfect perfect perfect 
3854 better than expected, great value , at this price and quality can not go wrong. if your in the market for go pro accessories, this is the one to get. 
3855 Fast and Reliable 
3856 this is a nice screen protector it has done its job protecting the LCD and it is easy to install 
3857 Good product 
3858 Love this BW film. Dark blacks, bright whites and everything in between. Great in low light, really excellent! No grain, crisp. A fave. 
3859 I was very happy with the charger for my camera. 
3860 Easy setup. Works great.Excelent product support. 
3861 Well made and very spacious. For enthusiasts who like to protect their investment, this is an excellent case. Likes: size, depth of compartments, stability of drone storage. The retractable handle and wheels are very smooth when using. Dislikes: none. 
3862 Just what I ordered were perfect for my photos job 
3863 This one seems to have a very hard time staying connected to the wifi without being power cycled every day. The version below or before this one seems to need a power cycle once a month if that. 
3864 Works as advertised. 
3865 great tripod. The legs each have 3 adjustable sections. Feels light but solid as well. I debated between this one and a few options in the $20-30 range. I am glad I decided to spend the extra money for a brand name and still reasonably priced. 
3866 Nice to have both options for charging. 
3867 I love this product for my nikon d750! Arrived on time and was easy to apply. I highly recommend it!! 
3868 i like the side 
3869 Nice Nice Nice 
3870 Works if you only want to take less than 99 photos per sequence. Mine broke because of poor quality battery door, but mfg replaced it. Next time I ll spend more and get one that will take unlimited photos. 
3871 Stellar product!! A++++ seller, the only thing which was a personal preference was, I didn t like was the floating wristlet. 
3872 This camera was the most difficult installation I have ever come across (updates are way too complicated) and support and software was lacking. Would not recommend this camera to anyone!. 
3873 Awesome 
3874 Equipment is very durable! I am very satisfied with everything in the package I purchased. I would definitely recommend these products to anyone! 
3875 Nice unit, but for the price they should include the transformer 
3876 Fantastic. Was exactly what I needed for an active vacation. 
3877 Works perfectly on my D7100 and D3200. One of the best (and reasonalby priced) investments I have made thus far. I just wish I had picked this up before wasting $$ on various remote units. 
3878 I m enjoying my dvr it s clear and sharp for what I need it for... 
3879 Worked great 
3880 Fits my Canon t2i + 24-105, with my Speedlite on top ( not attached ) - I put this in my waterproof bag and take to the beach. 
3881 Good parts. Would recommend 
3882 Excellent for interview lighting. The boom is dangerously flimsy, don t use it. 
3883 This poser worked very well. The filling instructions that came with it worked well too, but was beneficial to have two people to do it. 
3884 perfect fit on the NETGEAR ARLO cameras 
3885 This item fits great on my Canon T5i as well as my ring light!!! Quick shipping too! 
3886 only records 20 min and stops and starts again...not able torecord a full event 
3887 Seems to work as expected. Delivered on time. 
3888 excellent 
3889 Great camera,but if you need to use there instruction booklet it s pretty much useless,got better advice from other people s reviews. 
3890 Delivery was fast. I have the vortex solo 10x36 as well and this has a more clear focus and seems a much bigger magnification than just 2. Although not as compact the polaris is a much better buy for the money. I highly recommend. 
3891 Me and my kids love it 
3892 Well built. 
3893 Exactly the way they described. 
3894 fast delivery everything as promised 
3895 Fairly easy to use and takes very good pictures. My wife likes the ease of use and I like the WiFi connection to my computer for quick download. the Canon software is a download, so be prepared to take care of that if you want to use the WiFi feature. 
3896 Working well .I had trouble with written instructions. Maybe just me I biggest problem is getting it to stay looking forward in pocket nothing wrong with camera. I am going to try a pocket protector to keep it straight 
3897 My wife is a bit OCD and wanted order and this product was great. Great shipping and I will be utilizing them again. 
3898 Got all the basics that one needs. 
3899 Good sturdy camera, mounts easy, easy setup, comes with all the plugs and wires, counterbalance weight for the gimble. I mounted it all on a Cheerson CX-20 and it fit like a glove. Even survived a crash with no damage. 
3900 The set I received have no lining. They are just neoprene bags. They are okay. Certainly nothing like advertised. 
3901 Great Camera. can t go wrong though with a cannon! 
3902 Given as GIFT and she loved it. Recommend 
3903 These work great- I have several lenses and these cleaned them all right up. I mostly use canon ef lenses but they work great for pentax as well as my Nikon lenses. Definitely a but I d recommend to photographers who like to keep their lenses clean on the go. 
3904 Camera is great but lenses are crap, cheap and don t work on auto focus. Buy body and lenses separately. 
3905 Lasted 3 months as a backup battery and stopped working completely. 
3906 Can t believe I waited so lonh to switch to an over the shoulder style strap. This beats the tradition &#34;around the neck&#34; setup in so many ways. 
3907 I love it. Specially image quality! 
3908 Product arrived before scheduled delivery date and is as described! 
3909 Compact and easy to use. 
3910 Light, portable, rapid set-up, easy take-down. 
3911 Just what I needed 
3912 Love this thing. It s just tricky to close. The first time closing it was a nightmare; it didn t come with instructions. You can find wonderful youtube instructions, though. 
3913 Easy to place in my purse while traveling. 
3914 It s very easy to use, easy to clean, if it get s scratched, I have a spare. A good product to protect your screen 
3915 It works quite OK as it s price. 
3916 Perfect for my needs 
3917 everything fits in it s proper spot safe and secure! Only thing I would change is have optional shoulder straps! 
3918 Bought it as a gift and the daughter in law and she loves it! 
3919 It does not support 960H 
3920 Good stuff! 
3921 good products 
3922 Just as described 
3923 Awesome product! Very easy set up and they work great! 
3924 A better battery than battery that came with camera so far. 
3925 Excellent case. No longer need to worry about my go pro. 
3926 I have used this lens a lot recently. It is a gem. For a novice like me it is enabling me to produce some awesome nature photographs. Although it is a manual focus, it is very easy to use. I will not hesitate to recommend it. 
3927 These are solid and seem well made. I m using them to convert some older tripods to the Arca type quick release plates. They work fine with my Surui quick release plates, too. 
3928 Battery works great. Delivered on time. Great price. 
3929 Perfect fit! Made my camera look like new again! 
3930 Useless junk - it burned both my original Canon batteries - do not buy! 
3931 Case C6721591 Badge Ar004276 Product works great Technical support is EXCELLENT AND very courteous and helpful My Tech support listened to the problem and had the answers to resolve quickly THANK YOU 
3932 excellent!!! I have not use them yet. 
3933 I ve been using this light on top of my DSLR for wedding filming and it s perfect, high quality and I love the magnet snap on filters. 
3934 Fast delivery and the build quality is great. I reviewed about 10 floating GoPro grips in preparation for a Hawaii vacation. Glad I did the research. This handle looks great and has a good feel. 
3935 Bought as a gift and....Dad loved it! He s a carrier of multi-thousand dollar equipment and put his trust in this bag! 
3936 Decent case. 
3937 Recommend 
3938 Awesome bag for my new 13&#34; Macbook Pro with Retina screen and iPad. 
3939 Does not come with door or window sensors. Product is useless unless you have an alarm already in place. VERY DISAPPOINTED! 
3940 My camera works great. I ve had it for almost a year and haven t had any problems. 
3941 I ve used these all summer for about 4 weddings and they have never failed me once. Excellent bang for your buck if you re not looking to go over crazy spending! 
3942 Honestly, I feel like I get better white balance when using my white and grey cards. I followed the instructions in the video but this just doesn t work that well, in my opinion. 
3943 Works great. 
3944 Super quality 
3945 Great deal. Excellent bag for my Nikon D3300! 
3946 Great product. Perfect for the car. Love the charge percentage 
3947 It s pretty tight to release, but otherwise works great. Use it on my sailboat. 
3948 Great deal!!! 
3949 nice device 
3950 I bought these for a coworker and she loves the convenience of not having to find a place for her lens cap. 
3951 Did not work they were not compatible with the batteries 
3952 Last night I tested this device with my Panasonic GH4. It worked, as expected. 
3953 Worked great 
3954 Fast shipping great item 
3955 This was exactly what I needed! Perfectly well suited for my wants! 
3956 Fits perfectly and affordable! Will order again!! 
3957 great product 
3958 I love this camera bag it s light weight and holds everything I need. The strap sits perfectly on my shoulder and doesn t bother my neck. 
3959 It s perfect. I have several Cannon accessories for my camera but I m not a professional photographer and I want to carry my camera alone sometimes, so this is the perfect case for JUST YOUR camera. 
3960 Brilliant lens - wish it were cheaper. Will give 5 stars if it cost ~220$. I do repent buying the olympus camera - very expensive lenses. 
3961 Great value! 
3962 Works great, good price too... 
3963 I ve used these refills for decades and they work very well. Pictures are preserved and easily taken in an out even decades later. 
3964 great price and so easy to fly 
3965 Great filter. Great price on Amazon Prime day! 
3966 Nice roomy case and I love that the dividers are movable! 
3967 Works well 
3968 OK 
3969 worst pursuce ever on amazon does not record at all and just blinks fast and does nothing else so pissed 
3970 Works for the most part, but not as useful as I thought it would be. 
3971 Bought this at Khols and it could not install on my computer or my dad s. We tried everything! What a huge waste of money. 
3972 These are a great way to keep track of your lens cap. Works great! 
3973 Good quality, sturdy. Proved to be more durable​ than those that cost 4 times as much. 
3974 Works perfectly for the price. Simple to use. 
3975 Handy device for long exposures. In that it also has a timer built in makes it a great buy. 
3976 Very happy. Great value in the bundle. 
3977 I returned this after a few days - difficult to use, doesn t work in low light, and recording time is extremely limited. 
3978 I haven t really had a chance to use this like I want to but so far its worked perfectly. My kids are in sports and go to a lot of sporting events and this is the zoom I needed for all of it! 
3979 needs information for all strap use 
3980 SO FAR ITS GOOD STILL IN THE PROCESS OF USING IT IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS 
3981 Oustanding customer service after the sale. Thank you Walter for patiently guiding me through reinstalling the software settings. 
3982 Item was exactly as described, shipped super fast and packaged well. Couldn t be happier with the purchase. 
3983 Works great 
3984 It is so handy.. Save so much time and space by having splitter.. Good price also.. 
3985 the flash works but does not work with my canon 5Ti 
3986 also, the flash is not the one where you can remotely use on its own. 
3987 Kind of expensive but it works really well and is super solid. 
3988 Excellent 
3989 I use the StackShot for macrophotography of minerals. It works amazingly, allowing me to capture incredibly crisp images of my collection. 
3990 has some great features, that it can fly itself is awesome 
3991 Great product.. 
3992 Quick and easy to use and easy set up. 
3993 One of the items came incomplete. I would like to contact the seller accordingly. 
3994 You can rotate whether right eye or left eye you are using in viewfinder. 
3995 I have purchased from Certified before, the first time was in person, and am still very satisfied. Great product, great warranty, and quick service. I would not hesitate to refer or use them again. 
3996 Did not work. So inexpensive I didn t bother to send it back. Just order another more expensive one the next go around. 
3997 The shipping was super quick! Once i opened the package everything was true to the pictures if not even cuter! Very pleased with this order :) 
3998 My first time ordering from Amazon and loved it. Will order again in the future. 
3999 Good video for small cam. Not mac friendly, had to download a converter. SOUND SUCKS, very low fidelity sound. Ya get whatcha pay for. It s worth something, not much though. 
4000 Simple and effective setup with easy to use. 
4001 I really like this case and it is built really well! 
4002 Arrived on time and is great quality! 
4003 Excellent !! 
4004 Lost my original charger, I m happy to have my camera back. 
4005 I ve just used it once so far, but it worked perfectly and was easy to program 
4006 Works great and arrived on time. Thank you 
4007 This was a much more comfortable replacement to the stock shoulder pad that came with my rig. I love that it fits snuggly on the shoulder. 
4008 Worked fine 
4009 If you have a waterproof camera, this is a MUST. You can toss the camera in the pool/ocean ahead of you and then grab it. great for snorkeling adventures. 
4010 Amazing product. works great. Definitely recommend it. 
4011 Excellent on mountain biking, motorbiking and jetskiing. 
4012 Broke right away. Didn t even have a chance to take any video. 
4013 Not really very happy with this product. It s difficult to use and doesn t give a very good charge to the battery. I rarely leave a bad review about a product, but this one warrants it. 
4014 Great system 
4015 Good battery. Finally one that could be charged and not continuously replaced 
4016 Very tall, sturdy and has all the bells and whistles I could ask for. Very Happy with purchase. So nice that it is so light. 
4017 Fine 
4018 Great walk around lens. I also use this for portrait sessions with excellent results. Image quality is top notch. I hardly ever change lenses now. 
4019 very effective and simple to use 
4020 This is a great price and works perfectly. I use it to trigger external flashes - does the job well. I was also pleasantly surprised to see all needed batteries were included in the package. 
4021 Case C6729888 tech ID AR004273 helped get cameras set up properly. thanks Henry 
4022 Everything was extraordinary 
4023 I have this on the Olympus 45mm f.18 and it doesn t really look good attached to the lens. It does do it s job of protecting my lens from debris and lens flare but I ll most likely end up replacing it with a higher qualit yone soon. 
4024 Awesome beauty dish. I love the quality of light and its very easy to assemble. 
4025 These batteries work maintain charge just as well as the stock batteries. With the charging dock included for these 2 batteries as well as another slot for the stock battery, this is a must-have for anyone who plans on using their GoPro for more than a few hours. 
4026 Excellent value 
4027 Can t beat it for the money 
4028 I kinda didn t believe I could get everything shown for such a low price...but I did. And it works! 
4029 perfectly meets the expectations. Thank you 
4030 Got this for my gopro didn t like it too much at first. But after talking to customer service they offered to exchange the old one out for a new one. The new selfiestick operate a lot smoother than the first. 
4031 Works well enough, but it came with a hole on the edge. 
4032 It s bulky. I pretty much don t use it because of this. 
4033 gave it as a gift for a GoPro since this was the specific brand that he wanted it. He has used the batteries and charger for about a month or so and has no complains thus far. 
4034 Within 24 hours of regular, everyday kind of use, it stopped working. Boo. 
4035 Good combo. (The tripod adds no value though) Great deal. 
4036 just what i wanted 
4037 Brushes are nice but the bulb is quite useless. Too dinky and as you squeeze the nozzle is moving in all directions. Get the biggest Bulb you can find. 
4038 Fits well and camera snaps well into harness 
4039 I bought this to use as a plein air easel for watercolor painting. I m still in the process of getting my attachments set up for it so I haven t used it outside yet. For the price, it seems stable, lightweight and has all the features I needed. 
4040 Henry was excellent and set up 4 cameras in 15 min Great camera s at a very nice price 
4041 Decent 
4042 Very good product love it 
4043 Item arrived damaged and dirty. Doesn t look new at all. After further inspection item is broken in several places and missing parts. Can t believe the shape it s in..it s terrible!!!!! 
4044 Took a little longer to arrive than expected, but it s everything I needed. 
4045 I just received the batteries, and they work beautifully so far. I am hopeful that they will last the test of time. They seem a great value for the money. 
4046 Macro is not great. Better buy separate macro lens. The sharpness and clarity is hugely compromised. 
4047 The video was too sharp the pictures were crisp it is going to make me a great camera like my 50d and my other canon each has it s uses 
4048 Very happy with the camera and bundle. It takes great pictures. The company failed to send part of the order, but were very quick to send a refund. 
4049 Good purchase and still working. Thanks. 
4050 Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend! 
4051 Works great. 
4052 This works great 
4053 I like it very much it is great for when you travel and you want to take photographs. 
4054 This camera is so fun, cute and reliable. My daughter has made a scrapbook of all her moments in time since she got this camera. She is 13 and loves it. 
4055 good cam 
4056 wheels are very cheap and loud. 
4057 This camera works well underwater. Have not developed the film yet. 
4058 Priced Great - Nice Size - Quick Delivery 
4059 Great product and great service. 
4060 The vibration sensors worked the best and super easy to install. You have to have exactly the right door and window configuration for the two piece alarms. Certainly not foolproof, but a bit of a deterrent. 
4061 works great 
4062 So far working good with my 50 mm/1.8 Nikon lens.I made some interesting shots. 
4063 Very cool product, works well. I look forward to using it. 
4064 I was nervous about ordering a refurbished product, but I m IN LOVE with this camera. This is my first Dslr and i hope to take it with me on my trip to spain this spring. 
4065 Product is what I expected for the money. Everything works well. Havent used it in photoshoot but plan on doing so soon. 
4066 Great fixed lens. Equivalent to 50mm on Canon 60D. Fast and excellent quality. My &#34;go to&#34; lens&#34; 
4067 This battery works just as well as my Nikon battery! It looks a little bit different, but I ll be buying a few more of these over the next year. 
4068 Works Great! I was missing a rear lens cap and for only a few bucks I could pass on this deal I would recommend this product for sure. 
4069 Great camera. Amazing price. It needs a steady photographer but for the price is an amazing buy. 
4070 Great deal. Good little kit for the price. Really happy with my purchase 
4071 Rod bends when fully extended. Also button is useless and doesn t work. 
4072 The floaty backdoor works great. I have a couple of them. The adhesive is very strong. This is cheap insurance. If your camera slips from your hand its great to see it floating up, rather than sinking to the bottom. Believe me I know. 
4073 extra batteries are a must with go pros 
4074 It won t fit my camera, but I think it should be okay to use for other camera. 
4075 Camera is perfect for me and it has helped me with my golf swing. J-Made ensured that I got it quickly and I appreciated their excellent customer service in doing so. 
4076 Just as good, if not better than the hood that came with the lens. 
4077 Perfect 
4078 I am not a professional so this backpack works well for me with the couple lenses I have. Great backpack, seems well made and I like that it has all the compartments for lenses and other equipment. 
4079 works great so far so good 
4080 It s not so accuracy. 
4081 Great product at a fantastic price I am very happy with this set. 
4082 Perfect replacement 
4083 Nikon MH-67P Battery Chager was just what I wanted & works great 
4084 Just as described and works amazingly. 
4085 I bought it as a birthday gift and My friend loves it! Great gift idea for people who loves taking pictures on their iphone and get keepsake instant prints. 
4086 Hated it. It leaves a film that is like paste on lense 
4087 Perfect for my Galaxy 6 and I love the bluetooth remote. 
4088 Very Poor Quality 
4089 Hard to focus. 
4090 Henry did an excellent job setting up my camera. It is amazing how smooth everything works ...picture is very clear on my phone. I think I will get a couple more for the other side of the store. 
4091 Great battery at a great price. 
4092 It does exactly what I need 
4093 it takes great pictures - I am quite pleased with it. 
4094 just tried one it s great! 
4095 great seller - delivered as promised! 
4096 Great product ,never have to worry about losing caps again ! 
4097 Excellent 
4098 I am still learning how to use it, but so far it has lived up to expectations. Good quality at an affordable price. 
4099 Didn t notice really any difference.... 
4100 Quality Goods 
4101 Great film. Perfect for quick small pictures. 
4102 Awesome! Finally can get good pics at night like the moon and sky etc. 
4103 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
4104 Very affordable protection for you home without monthly fees. Alarm is ear piercing. I have one on every window and door in my house. Batteries last a long time and are replaceable when needed. Small enough and portable enough to use even when traveling 
4105 Good product 
4106 Floppy 
4107 Solid product. Great price and it works well. The floaty device was even able to keep my GoPro (Hero version 1) plus the pole afloat in salt water. Haven t tested in fresh water yet. 
4108 This is what I need for capturing those big fish, and not having to worry about dropping my GoPro! 
4109 Excellent cleaning clothes for your glasses. They clean 100 % without leaving any mark on them!!! 
4110 charged one set of batteries right after I received it. After not using it for for a season it would not work for the second set. It will not even light up for the battery charge. 
4111 Worked perfectly for me. I haven t had any problems with either mount. Both have performed as expected. I would recommend this for anyone looking for either mount, it s a great way to get both mounts for a good price. 
4112 The Wasabi Power Battery Pack was just as described on Amazon. It also was delivered in appropriate time 
4113 Excellent quality 
4114 great pics - easy to use - love it 
4115 Good for lightweight cameras but not good for heavier models. 
4116 Works great. Love how you can tell how charged the battery is. Extra USB on the side is useful. Only complain, and why I only gave 4 stars, is the size of the unit, would be nice if it was more compact 
4117 These are ok antistatic bags but please note that 10x15 are the exterior dimensions, not interior dimensions (typically interior dimensions are used for other antistatic bags I ve gotten). The interior dimensions on these bags are 9x13cm 
4118 Happy with my charger 
4119 Just received the frame. It was very easy to set up. It came with a 16 GB usb. I loaded my pictures, and plugged it in, and it was ready to go. Very easy. The HD is awesome compared to my last picture frame. 
4120 product as advertised, very good 
4121 Works great. Just what I was looking for. Great product 
4122 I kind of wish I had bought a bigger one since this was smaller than I thought it would be. For what it is though, It performs perfectly. 
4123 Very good,good finish 
4124 Ill keep it simple because I m a novice. It s a great product. 
4125 Very easy to use. Fast shipping and great quality. 
4126 Love love it! 
4127 works perfectly as described 
4128 Works with my Cannon, great deal 
4129 I need a manual, it only records a minute at a time then skips a lot. and is there software to make play list, edit, add music? I hope someone can help me? I d like to give a better review .... I just think I never got the instructions. 
4130 Typical Nikon quality with fast auto focusing and sharp images. It is my &#34;go to&#34; lens for most situations. A+ 
4131 This was okay but I wasn t happy with some of functionality. So I returned it. I wanted something a little bit more high-end. However for the price it will do the job. 
4132 it s what I needed 
4133 Never needed this so far 
4134 nice product 
4135 Packaging bent it where I don t know if crease will come out. BUMMER!!! otherwise this should be a great item! 
4136 Great product at a good price! 
4137 really good , but with the time the water breaks in 
4138 Works great, holds any size tablet tight, unlike the one that comes with the Phantom 3. 
4139 Great 
4140 great product worth the money 
4141 Happy to find a replacement at a reasonable price. 
4142 Very good item 
4143 Does exactly what it is supposed to! 
4144 My daughter loved these items! 
4145 Bought on lighting deal. Had to return after a week. Delay on motion detection is ridiculous. What s the point. Got my refund. 
4146 Excellent case. 
4147 Excellent! Most comfortable strap I ve ever used...even with a heavy camera (Nikon D810) and lens (Nikkor 24-70 f/2.8). 
4148 I use these all the time with my GoPro and GoPole. I recently traveled and wanted to make sure I didn t lose my camera during my adventures and these made me feel a lot better about doing anything crazy with my GoPro 
4149 Fast delivery. Product as stated in the description,good quality at very good price 
4150 The Bag seems sturdy enough to hold up under use, however I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it outdoors. 
4151 Thank you 
4152 Worked exactly as described, easy to fit (perfect fit) no bubbles. As I already had one handy, I put a clear plastic protector over it, all works perfectly. 
4153 It was just as described and fit my camera battery. 
4154 Good product. Works as advertised. Would be great to see support for home automation systems such as Amazon Echo, Hubs like Revolv and maybe Apple s HomeKit. The notification part is necessary, but can be annoying. All in all - fantastic product. 
4155 These are well made accessories. If you have a polaroid cube you will need the tripod mount and a 1/4 20 camera mount adapter for some of the attachments. 
4156 Plastic price and plactic piece. 
4157 It s working excellently and I can recharge it at anytime rather than wait for it to get low.. 
4158 I gave this as a gift to my darling daughter. She was very pleased and I liked it as well. The package came intact and quickly. Thank you kindly. 
4159 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
4160 The Package I received didnt had the screw to be used to mount the go Pro. I have highlighted it in the image. 
4161 Perfect, as I expected 
4162 As described! 
4163 very happy 
4164 Good 
4165 Improved my product photography. Had to learn the right settings on my camera, but worth it. 
4166 So happy I came across this. Item functions as described. Always wanted to be able to geo-tag my photos. Excited that I got it for the right price. Thanks Amazon! 
4167 Works great on my Sony A6000! 
4168 Awesome 
4169 Good tripod 
4170 I follow the instructions and removed an anoying dusy particle always showing in my sony nexus camera photos 
4171 Love it, looks great and has held up well. 
4172 great camera, when I need additional wide angles, I m coming back! 
4173 Worked perfectly 
4174 Its nice value for money 
4175 work great. Fair price..Just dont have motion detectors. 
4176 love it, had to buy more! 
4177 Cleaned fine. Didn t fix the problem with the camera. 
4178 LOVE IT 
4179 Exactly what I wanted. A similar cable would not let me download my photos directly from my camera. This one works. 
4180 Received as described. Works fine. 
4181 Great quality, easy to use, perfect beginner camera 
4182 Walter with their tech support group helped me find an IP conflict on my router because I (evidently) didn t reserve the camera IPs in my router and my printer took over the IP address. 
4183 Much better than the standard battery. 
4184 Easy to apply 
4185 100% necessary if you have a GoPro. Nothing is worse than getting to your destination and finding that the battery you had in the camera has died. Great replacement for OEM GoPro batteries. 
4186 Cons : 1 - Flamsy. 2 - No .. including. 3 - bad full rig. Pros : 1 - Great price. 2 - Get the job done. 
4187 This item worked perfectly. My lens look like new!!! 
4188 The cord doesn t support I-TTL for my D7200 and any of my flashes however it triggers the flash just fine in manual mode. Will make a good back up for my radio triggers just in case. 
4189 Has worked very well with my Canon T3. Very happy with the product and price. 
4190 The charger stopped working after 6-months. How do I utilize the 1-year manufacture s warranty if I can t get any contact information for the company who makes the unit? It was purchased 10/21/2014. 
4191 Good for short to medium range. If you need to spot target shots past 100 yards this won t do, but anything shorter it is fine. Also used to look at the moon on a clear night and works very well. 
4192 Great photo tool. Getting some great portraits out of it. 
4193 Works perfectly, and shipped quickly! 
4194 Nice filters 
4195 works perfectly, easy to set your own code 
4196 These films are AMAZING they are SO stylish and leave your eyes with love the rainbow and stained glass were my. Personal favorite and candy pop was good too☺☺☺😍 
4197 Nice lens and filters. Cover for lens is a little bit less, and I cannot put lens there. Tripod doesnot hold anything, but it is not bid deal. I am glad that I bought that lens with these accessories 
4198 Good 
4199 good stuff. Quick, easy and made for fun 
4200 it really floats, its light and usefull 
4201 Pure Junk. 
4202 Product works just fine 
4203 I don t know why this has negative reviews. I think it s great. Mine works just fine. 
4204 the app is killing the quality of this product. it slows down the video as i move it. Sometimes the cam will stop. 
4205 Super fast service, item was exactly what I needed. 
4206 works great cheap price 
4207 These batteries work great. Best alternative to the much more expensive canon brand. 
4208 Just what I needed! 
4209 Nice camera, auto-focus doesn t work great but I bought it for manual focus use. Nice sharp pictures, fairly easy to use. Battery lasts for 4 or 5 long outings. 
4210 I thank you very much I use this all the time I make my videos. 
4211 My favorite purchase ever! 
4212 great ITEM THANKS 
4213 Fast shipping!! Everithing that was on the list came in the box!! Ever item in good condition!! Enjoying it!!! The camara is amazing!!! 
4214 Perfect for selfie addict like me.lol...The mounting part is very handy and i like the idea of using remote control on taking pictures..Very nice! I gave 4 stars since I received the product without battery for remote control. But everything works fine for me. 
4215 Well it works, but ive noticed that most of the time its a bit blurry. Depends on what your looking at i guess. 
4216 I only managed to get one session from this when the screw from the ball joint came out. Tried screwing back in and there no threading at all. 
4217 Working with no problems 
4218 I like it very much. I wanted to carry binoculars while backpacking, but I couldn t find a light enough pair. This will let me scope out the land without the weight. The description failed to 
4219 Camera works well, easy to setup. 
4220 its awesome 
4221 The little accessory looks great and adds a wonderful &#34;feel&#34; to the shutter release function. there is no going back once you have experienced it. 
4222 great product at a remarkably low price. Being able to focus at 0.5 meters is great for insect watching. 
4223 The joint isn t strong enough to use on my Harley. The vibrations are just too much. Probably great for a mountain bike or road bicycle, but not for a vibration machine like a Harley. 
4224 This cap will stay on. 
4225 I bought this as a gift for my husband. My husband was very doubtful but once he started using he loved it too! The pictures come out looking great! 
4226 Replaced the originally item only to find out the replacement is just as bad. The adjustment dial doesn t not change. 
4227 Not too bad, fits perfectly on my 22&#34; Paul Buff beauty dish! 
4228 OK --but tight 
4229 Perfect choice for the perfect camera. Good product with a good price. 
4230 These batteries cost a fraction of what an original GoPro battery cost. It comes with a charging dock and cable. The quality of the cell is very comparable to that of an original go pro battery. 
4231 Good product for price, only thing I could complain about is the siamese cable not as durable as I would like. System itself is very good. Cameras have good range, night vision good, very simple to install. Very satisfied and will be ordering the additional 4 cameras soon. 
4232 Images were not sharp at any distance, with and without a tripod. The original lens came with original Kit was excellent. I am returning it. 
4233 love it 
4234 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
4235 Alvin Matthews Excelent Help! It is good to speak with someone that is professional and patient too. 
4236 Light and excellent purchase. It arrived in perfect shape and works better than expected. Totally recommended. Ergonomic design and awesome touch screen. 
4237 All I can say is for the money wow what nice video comparing to my friendsthathavethe go pro I am glad I bought this all the accesories that came with it made it even a better deal.. 
4238 The battery dies quickly and it constantly has to be re-programmed. It goes with the the old saying &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34; 
4239 This is an amazing camera. I am so impressed with the quality of the photos, which I believe are equal to what is produced by my Canon DSR EOS. Great zoom on this too. 
4240 This is a great camera and so much fun to have instant photos to view and share with friends. 
4241 Good enough. I liked it. 
4242 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
4243 dont hold a charge for long. 
4244 No more worries about charging up my battery before I go out to take photos. I can shoot replace, shoot replace and go all day. 
4245 This was a hit at my party. Love it. 
4246 Great little lens for the price! Very sharp images. Very well-built lens 
4247 Good Product. Fast Service 
4248 A big hit with our family &#62; the older ones enjoy the views and the younger ones like having the ease of sharing their favorite photos beyond the usual social media sites. 
4249 The battery arrived as expected and I am using it in my camera 
4250 I love this camera. it takes amazing pictures is really durable and is great for vlogging which is essentially why I bought it! 
4251 these are a nice addition I would tell a friend 
4252 Very easy to use! I like it! 
4253 Theses cameras and the system were easy to install and it has a lot of nice features. The clarity of the cameras are great. I would definitely buy from this company again. 
4254 Not sturdy enough to move around, however it did the trick for the occasion... Good for the value and prime shipping was a bonus 
4255 GREAT LITTLE BATTERY S FOR MY CANON 
4256 The best point and shoot out there. I am a photographer and I love carrying this around with me on the go to take photos with if I don t want to lug around all my lenses and equipment. 
4257 Needs much brighter lights. 
4258 Almost everything my daughter needed for her GoPro! 
4259 Worked well for over a year, but recently we lost 2 ports on the DVR, followed by another 2 - cannot be used and do not offer a signal 
4260 Don t fit good even though size is correct 
4261 great price and good product. it gives extra protection. 
4262 Great product 
4263 So heavy! 
4264 Better safe than sorry and this rainsleeve gives me peace of mind knowing my camera is protected. 
4265 Life saver!! This has been an excellent purchase for me because I always have a battery back up ready to go. I use an adaptor often to plug into the wall. 
4266 I think this is a great starter kit for a low price. I m enjoying it. 
4267 works great, good deal for the money 
4268 Fantastic product, incredible technology. I was concerned about battery life based upon some reviews but have found this to be a non-issue. Only regret is that I did not purchase more cameras with my initial system purchase! 
4269 Broke the first time my 5y/o used it 
4270 Great Kit... As advertise.. and arrive on time. 
4271 Works just as described. 
4272 Less than a year old and will not charge to full capacity. Doesn t last very long. After charging overnight it only had about 30 minutes of charge. 
4273 The head is plastic and not capable of holding a DSLR. Legs are fine, but the head is overrated. Maybe for a dinky little point and shoot it would make a decent travel tripod., but that s about all. 
4274 Cool Kit, Comes with a lot of stuff 
4275 great lens for macro photography or portraits 
4276 Love it 
4277 no work for me 
4278 Love this. Video is excellent, sound is also high quality. The time lapse mode is awesome. Love that the wifi will send updates to the camera automatically without having to plug it in anywhere. Battery life is pretty low, but I was expecting that and got two extra. 
4279 Excellent filters at an amazing price. 
4280 All good thanks 
4281 It works 
4282 The focus does not seem to always be in focus once you zoom the lens. Otherwise small, compact and easy to use. 
4283 Excellent item 
4284 Exact l y what I needed 
4285 Took me a while to put together. No manual 
4286 It was just what I wanted! Compact and sturdy. 
4287 Great for controlling the flash gun beam in a pinch 
4288 not very stable... loose between clicks, but it does the job. 
4289 This lens! If you re looking at it and can afford it, you will never regret it. Just amazing and clear!! 
4290 This was to replace the pistol grip on my Sunpak tripod. Works fine but didn t realize that the plate wasn t a quick release like others but really not a problem to turn the base plate knob to remove. 
4291 The shield fits nice in the camera To be honest u don t no that it s really their, Nice product The small one for the top of my d7100 also fits nice 
4292 Thank you would buy again 
4293 The best shotgun mic on the market! 
4294 So far so good...used them for an even this past wkend, very pleased. 
4295 So far I love it. I had no problem connecting to WiFi. The pictures are great. The battery lasted 8 days of my 10 day vacation. It was nice to have a second battery all ready to go. 
4296 Olukai are THE best ! 
4297 Fits perfectly on my new Olympus OM-D E-M5 mk II. Install was easy and the fit is perfect. I couldn t tell that I had the Expert Shield installed. 
4298 item delivered on time and perfect 
4299 Best PTZ camera for this money 
4300 Amazing 
4301 I was hoping a new charger would solve my battery problems and I was correct. My charger was delivered on time and I m very happy with the product. 
4302 Works great 
4303 Perfect for my lenses which don t come with a pouch. Enough protection to store in a backpack. 
4304 Like all Pelican cases; this is well worth the price. 
4305 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
4306 fair case with cutouts for separate compartments. not very padded for protection on the bottom,otherwise nice storage case that fits all go pro and other small pov cameras! 
4307 One battery charged and performed adequately, but one battery would not charge and caused a &#34;battery not compatible&#34; error. 
4308 We used this selfie tool once and liked it so much. Easy to handle, extend to full length that we could easily take 12 people selfie. It is convenient to have small Bluetooth controller. We are satisfied with this product. 
4309 Instruction are only in chinese. I am wondering how to conect it. 
4310 Its ok-I wouldnt tell anybody not to buy this product 
4311 Outstanding. Witty, clear instructions. Very simple to apply. Fits perfectly. I m a fan 
4312 Great for the price! Will be buying more! 
4313 I would never buy again. The only reason I didn t return is because I ran wire around my home. Never again 
4314 Like it. 
4315 a real walk-about-lens great build very sharp. 
4316 Great Product. Just as describe! Will buy again! 
4317 Cheap and hideous 
4318 Lost my original charger and this works perfectly! 
4319 was easy to set up, we are easily able to connect to the security camera with android and windows devices from home or wherever and quickly see the footage at our storefront even at night. 
4320 ewery thing was fine thank you 
4321 My copy of this adapter was a bit tight on the lens side which I m okay with. x mount end is a little sloppy on to the camera body. It doesn t seem to cause any issues, however. But I ll dock a point for being not quite perfect. 
4322 Super smooth, solid, and the price is great. I tried out another more expensive slider first and I couldn t stand it--glad I tried out Konovo. 
4323 Great Buy ! 
4324 The tension pieces broke the first time I put it on the camera. Now it s useless. 
4325 The quality of the picture is very poor. My iPhone s camera takes better pictures. 
4326 Best action camera on the market PERIOD....I own two no name and all four &#34;competition&#34; to go pro ...with the mounts with all it can do with its app nothing COMES CLOSE!!!! so nice now I need 3 more and a 3 gimbal and underwater mounts ;) 
4327 Good product at an excellent price. Very Quick shipping. Would buy from again 
4328 This is a great unit for the car. It s the perfect size. It s very sturdy 
4329 Works perfectly right out of the box for my iPhone, iPad, and MacBook Pro. A lifesaver on a long plane flight 
4330 package was delivered 
4331 Very compact and versatile. Works well with my sony a6000 
4332 GREAT LENS .. I USE THIS LENS FOR EVERY THING.. 
4333 totally and completely worthless. extremely unstable. check out the how small the legs are. unless you are using a tiny COMPACT mini camera it will cost you a broken camera. MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SELLER IS TERRIBLE. RESTOCKING CHARGES AND AN ATTITUDE MAKES YOU WISH YOU NEVER BOUGHT FROM THIS SELLER. 
4334 Well made bag! Perfect for my needs. If you have a huge camera with a long lens, you might want to look at Tamrac s larger bag. But for someone like me, it is the PERFECT bag. Holds my Canon 70D and 4 lens with no problem. 
4335 excellent 
4336 I like having extra mounts, everything fit s and work s great 
4337 Sharp as can be but hunts a little. Overall a very nice lens 
4338 Easy to use. Great 
4339 I am pleased enough that I am planning on buying more, this time with Bluetooth. 
4340 Works great. Good price good quality. 
4341 nice 
4342 Doesn t live up to it s billing. I returned the lens in question 
4343 Bought for camera and so happy I did! 
4344 All camera functions work, battery indicator always blinks as low battery; perhaps it needs just a little more power 
4345 I think this is a cool idea. It s small, takes seconds to set up and it has the dusk feature for 4 or 7 hours, Helps make the house look like someone is home with little power usage. 
4346 great looking FAKE camera. really easy to install, looks real. comes with flashing red light( if you install AA batteries). 
4347 Pleasantly surprised at quality 
4348 I am blown away by how high end this tripod looks and feels. Better than I expected. Holds my T5i with battery grip and 75-300mm very secure. 
4349 great camera 
4350 good backdrop lights are okay--- wish I would have got the LED- screwing 5 bulbs into 3 bases makes them NOT really portable--- GO LED 
4351 Camera is what was described. I love the zoom. Great price! 
4352 OMG ! It s too cute ! Love it so much ~ HelloKitty fans Must have item 
4353 Broke after a week 
4354 Exactly what I thought it would be. I am satisfied with this product. 
4355 Best investment I made........Works great when you re taking sports pictures and it also works with your auto focus motor 
4356 Just what I needed, priced resonable and shipping wasn t outragous. 
4357 great idea 
4358 One of the nicest/most quality lens pens that I ve ever purchased. Great buy! 
4359 Thank you... Now I can download my pics from my New camera 
4360 Very good made. I recommend this product. 
4361 Fits perfect while still easy to remove scope cover, I m really happy we added it to the purchase of our scope 
4362 works great 
4363 The item was perfect and delivered on time 
4364 I love the interchangability of these flaps - great idea. 
4365 Great, secure fit! Worth the extra money. 
4366 The end connecting into the camera is not as snug as I think it should be, but it works fine. Just need to handle camera more carefully and watch that connection is still in place. 
4367 Constant issue with the power supply 
4368 Crapy product. Save your money and get a promaster. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008SSMYZ0?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00 
4369 Had I realized about the vector effect, would have purchased a round rubber flexible hood which is what I had before 
4370 very good 
4371 Works Perfect. 
4372 Nice product 
4373 Quality charger. Happy with purchase. 
4374 Everything was shipped safely and in good order and for such a bargain price. 
4375 Great battery Good price!!! 
4376 I had this one month, everything was great, then the tilt stop working, I hope they will make it good without me having to ship it back to China. Otherwise I would of rated it 5 stars. 
4377 Awesome camera. You have to learn how to use it for sure but it takes really nice pics. 
4378 perfect for what i wanted 
4379 Fits my Nikon 300mm 2.8 vr 2 
4380 Just installed. Good product! 
4381 Lighter than the GoPro and image quality just the same. 
4382 LCD quality is very low, contrast is very bad using with my GH4, don t recommend it much. 
4383 Thank you product works good. 
4384 Windows 7 professional 64 bit, right clicked the install file &#62;properties &#62;compatibility &#62;check run in windows 98 compatibility mode. Once the software is installed, set your USB to Serial adapter to Com 1. It worked right away. Took control over the built in hand controller. This is very cool. 
4385 Good 
4386 Wasn t loud at all, could barely hear it 
4387 Gift for granddaughter. No info yet on performance. 
4388 I was unable to mount a speed light on the grip so with the zoom device it made it easier plus having a PC connector available. 
4389 Great BUDGET lense for the price! Works great on a Canon Digital Rebel XT. 
4390 The view is decent at night but blurry during the day even when it is adjusted for focus 
4391 Lens worked great with canon 70d or Apsc camera, this doesn t work on full frame canon 5d mark III camera 
4392 I love this camera. It is small enough to fit in my purse and works great! 
4393 Great set. Works great with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Nice fitting chest mount and head mount. Extra screw is nice as well and fits everything, including other official GoPro mounts I have. I would highly recommend this, especially at a great price. 
4394 Great for the price 
4395 Great product. For once, I have more pockets than stuff! 
4396 This is a very nice lens cap for the price. The fit is better than with the oem in my personal opinion. Shipping time to the U.S. is not the best with any of the current sellers, however. 
4397 Fantastic. Did not expect this to be so good. But there is always a flaw to a product and it is the microphone when on a the bike mount. 
4398 Very good camera. Reacts quickly and smoothly through wifi. Clear image. 2 way audio if very good 
4399 This is decent for quick review of 35mm slides and negatives. I wouldn t use it to gauge colors. 
4400 They work as advertised. Clean eyeglasses and screens well. Fiber pieces big enough to actually hold in your hand unlike the itty bitty cloths that you get with eyeglasses. 
4401 It was a quick, easy setup. It worked great the first time and seems fairly durable. 
4402 Fantastic. I shot a movie and tossed this critter in my bag and used it as an eye light and as a computer light. Dang thing runs forever! (or so it seems) 
4403 A great lens for macro as well as general photography. It produces a very sharp image. I have found my normal lens for the Nikon D3200. 
4404 It is a good complement for your camera specially if you like to take couple pictures in a trip. 
4405 Nice!!!! 
4406 Use these all the time 
4407 awesome! 
4408 Works as advertised 
4409 Basic yet adequate product 
4410 It works as suggested by the other reviews. 
4411 Nice 
4412 great lens clothes, just the right size 
4413 This is a genuine Canon battery and works perfectly in my Canon T6s camera. I think you should always have a charged spare battery on hand when on a photographic trip to avoid the sad event of a power failure. 
4414 I really like the effects of this lens. At 10 stops, my dSLR can literally see nothing through the viewfinder. Please pardon the Spinal Tap reference. I could not help myself. 
4415 you push it to turn it on and off! very convenient 
4416 I found this product to be very flimsy without much padding to protect my camera and lenses. It is also lacking in pocket space. I have a case that is half the size with many more pockets and thick padding and I fit more things in it. 
4417 It is so hard to find a strap for my semi-compact Canon camera, and this is the best you can get imo. I really love it! 
4418 Excellent product.... Technology is super.... Ease of use is outstanding... It s a ready to go unit in a box... Compare it to a High End Security service... Security service would cost a minimum of 2k... Believe me, I priced them!!!! 
4419 Perfect and great... 
4420 Product arrived as described in a timely manner. I ll gladly buy again for future lens cap needs. Recommend. 
4421 Pro: - works very well Cons: - it drains the battery 
4422 excellent 
4423 Terrible product, too many problems to waste my time writing about it ,no customer service ,just find another company then Lorex , and I don t normally write a 1 star review but this product and company did it .... 
4424 this bag was a really nice bag... lots of pockets.. just not big enough for what I needed 
4425 Was an excellent purchase. Love it! 
4426 If you re a Pro. Don t do it. Spend the extra money for the Canon. I should have just thrown $70 down the toilet. Live and Learn... 
4427 I absolutely love this lens. I am still a newbie w/ DSLR. And this lens has made me so comfortable behind the lens. It has to be my favorite. 
4428 Love this! Awesome product Love this! Awesome product.Does the job perfectly. Fast delivery. Quick and easy to assemble, works great! Highly recommended! 
4429 if you own a camera and it taiks these batteries ... then its the perfect buy... has saved my many times when one battery dies and your still wanting to take pics 
4430 Did not fit my lenses. The adapter fit into my camera body fine, but the lens mount was wrong. Ended up returning. 
4431 intake, compression, power and exhaust 
4432 Perfect 
4433 Love this collection. Good quality - came faster than expected. Very nice. 
4434 Great camera and cost/benefit for the kit. It really worths it. 
4435 excellent product. 
4436 Just got my camera hooked up. The technician was very awesome! CASE#C6728526; AR004246, ALDY; Kyle, Case#C6728562; AR#AR004218 
4437 CHEAP quality.. almost a toy. buy something better. 
4438 Very cheap quality. It wasnt out of the box and it was broken! DO NOT WASTE YOUR 11 DOLLARS JUST MAKE THE INVESTMENT IN A GOOD TRIPOD!!! 
4439 Very Good 
4440 These thing is cool with alot of upgrades to be done. 
4441 this does not work well, the setup is confusing the company will charge you to help set it up. I did get it to work after 4 hours but the recording process stinks. I don t recommend this product at all 
4442 Nice, cheap, and works well. 
4443 Great IP cameras for around the house. Will FTP snap shots or full HD video (720p) to any FTP server. 
4444 Awesome camera has multiple filters for one shot and uses some different angles for one shot. and capture photos very well. 
4445 Excellent and fast shipping! 
4446 This was a great replacement to my lence. although it is a little loose, it does the job. 
4447 Awesome first stage of alert. 
4448 Love it 
4449 Received it and found all these white marks on it. Looks like chalk 
4450 Nice power box with plenty of capacity. 
4451 Love the go pro!! My kids love it more 
4452 Nice product and good quality. Delivery was way to slow. 
4453 Highly recommend. 
4454 Very smooth gearing - and mounts nicely on tripod. 
4455 I am writing this review regarding the excellent service I received from Titathink Support Service. Taylor was able to help me correct my problem very efficiently and with excellent customer service I will purchase more products from Titathink. 
4456 Henry, Thank you very much for helping me set up my foscam! Very easy and simple. 
4457 Came in time and as advertised. 
4458 did not use this camera , sent it back , wrong type 
4459 Fits and works as expected. 
4460 Just what I was seeking at a fair price 
4461 Exquisite B&W film..use it with old school fold out Polaroids...awesome results..! 
4462 Great little camera. Very clear images. Zoom is great. This my second one exactly the same because my first one got wet (stupid me!!) and stopped working. Had to have exact same one because I liked it so much. 
4463 Nice unit, but range is 50-75 feet 
4464 Not much to say excapt taht it works well and is priced right. Now I have an extra one that I keep at work. 
4465 Well made, just what I have come to expect from Neewer 
4466 This is a great lens for the price. I used it to take pictures while traveling and found the long zoom capability to be very handy. The pictures that I took came out beautifully! 
4467 Much smaller than its seems but I m a short girl so it looks nice on me! 
4468 A great bargain for a good camera! 
4469 Great accessories for your Go Pro and it all comes in a nice case. 
4470 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
4471 Bought this for my daughter and she loves it! 
4472 Love these!! They re amazing and so dependable!! 
4473 A great buy. The charge last a long time. 
4474 Great camera ...great pictures 
4475 excelent 
4476 more features than I can figure out how to use. still learning how to make it go. 
4477 Works pretty good for the price Can see a black ring around the edge unless you zoom a little on the phone. Used on iPhone 6 and droid turbo 
4478 this is my first tripod 
4479 i just recently opened a youtube page and needed it 
4480 its awesome thanks https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1J5rgMIfqZJkJDL--JoA6Q 
4481 Bought this a while back and it has been my prime lens ever since, the quality of it is amazing photos are so clear even in low light i completely recommend this lens 
4482 Works but it s stuck on my Nikon. 
4483 TAKES GREAT PICTURES AND EASY TO USE. 
4484 Easy to set up! Picture quality is better than average! Can t beat the price! 
4485 Works well and looks good. Quick delivery from seller and very good to deal with. Highly recommend 
4486 These are okay. Only really get tood shots from exactly head on :/ 
4487 works great 
4488 Very handy to have while swimming 
4489 Great product 
4490 Functions exactly as advertised 
4491 It is a good case 
4492 Im very unhappy with these batteries I purchase them months a go for backup never charging them until I was ready for my vacation and they fail. They did not hold the charge. I charge them the night before and then when to use them two dudes. 
4493 The strap broke immediately and the last 3 (of an expensive roll of film -only 12 photos) did not print out. Instructions on the &#34;lighting&#34; button on camera would have been preferred. 
4494 Great value, has everything you need for your gopro! 
4495 Good Product Works as expected 
4496 it s a D 80.. What more to day. 
4497 Great plan for 3 years. Hope I never have to use it but if I do then I will give a follow up. 
4498 Excellent 
4499 great little case for GoPro hero 4 but ordered a bigger one because it hold very little accessories. 
4500 replacement as advertised 
4501 Really helpful!! Love it 
4502 Doesn t fit the Polaroid camera very well, the camera turns on when put in the case. The Polaroid printer fits perfect. 
4503 Great price and they actually work! I ve used my batteries for a year and they work as good as the original... and they are mysteriously exactly like the OEM version. ;) 
4504 fabric is much lighter than show. It s pastel blue instead of the deep blue with dark accents. Very disappointed! 
4505 good battery power for my camera 
4506 The recipient, inasmuch as it was a gift, expressed his full satisfaction; that has not always been his practice as a response 
4507 Easy to connect to Smartthings, works great so far in a garage. 
4508 Love it..Great Product...Thanks 
4509 I have used this in two full cycle and both of them were just as good as the Nikon OEM s. With the way I used it, shooting and reviewing on the LCD, it shot 1,000 clicks and there was still 25% charge left. 
4510 Great product and fantastic customer service. I recommend! 
4511 This is the worst camcorder that I could ever imagine. 
4512 Love this Camera, decent priced and works great! 
4513 nice for the price 
4514 Good protection for long lens circular polarizers. 
4515 These little mounts are very versatile and they re a good thing to have in your camera bag/backpack. Great buy! 
4516 Great for super long exposures! 
4517 Got one just before leaving on a trip. Love the collapsible build. Like being able to just push it back instead of remove, turn around and screw back on. Worked well. 
4518 The batteries have a high self-discharge rate. After a week of non use, they need to be recharged. 
4519 Good Camera, Fast Shipping 
4520 A great case! 
4521 good product. Case very large 
4522 Well made and useful as a spare. 
4523 protects lenses nicely 
4524 Very poor image but great sound!!! 
4525 Everythings fits well. I wouldn t use this case for air travel but for storage, vehicle travel it works just fine 
4526 it works as long as you don t try to go over 5 feet.. 
4527 Works well and a great price. 
4528 POOR QUALITY, SOMETIMES IT WILL SYNCHRONIZE WITH THE CAMERA, OTHERS DONT !! DONT BUY THIS !! 
4529 works great for what we need it for :) 
4530 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support was a great help, friendly and very knowledgeable. This was the second time that I have used the tech support and they have always been very helpful and solved my issues quickly. Love the cameras too! 
4531 The screen was scratched. 
4532 I still use it and it works great!!!! 
4533 Has a cheap quality to it but it gets the job done! I use it with my HOLGA and have not had any issues with it. 
4534 thanks 
4535 great bag and sturdy with lots of room for dslr, lenses accessories and an iPad. 
4536 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
4537 This thing works, easy to setup but not great. The sensor was too sensitive even at the lowest setting that the reflection of the beam on my car did not trip the sensor causing the gate to continue opening slamming into the side of my car. 
4538 Used these on safari in Tanzania. I was amazed at how well the worked. We compared the glasses to another rated the same and these out performed them and we were all amazed. 
4539 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0083WYDAU 
4540 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... First one came with a little failure, then I returned it and get a new one with no issue until today... 
4541 As expected 
4542 Nice product--good price 
4543 Great product.... 
4544 A high quality product with a great warranty. You won t be disappointed! 
4545 It was just what I wanted. 
4546 great product 
4547 I need batteries to last for over 8 hours, and these batteries go strong days after. They re perfect for a camera flash where I need a quick refresh rate to fire off a flash as needed. Paired with the Powerex charger, these are a must have. 
4548 It does the job..... 
4549 Image quality is poor on any setting. Action shots are impossible to achieve. 
4550 Great 
4551 Works so so... you need to be on ice if you ever want it that smooth if you get my drift! enjoy the bumpy footage! 
4552 Pins all bent up. Two sockets missing two pins each! 
4553 Great customer service and product is made out of superior materials. 
4554 Works exactly like the original 
4555 Works as well as the original GoPro camera batteries 
4556 Just like the originals, now the kayak has what it needs. 
4557 All accessories seem to be of good quality and function properly with my GoPro 3+ silver. Can t beat it for the price. 
4558 Awesome scope, with it s uniform size, not tapered, you can attach a green laser to sight in where you want to view, I just used rubber bands 
4559 excellent 
4560 fits well 
4561 Great purchase. Works well. 
4562 Not A mirror, very small , very low quality 
4563 I don t like typing 
4564 Nikon quality as expected. 
4565 They are really cheap batteries. They do not last 10 to fifteen shots. waste of money 
4566 Love it.works easy. 
4567 Works great! Nice clarity! Great Price! 
4568 A good price. Now I have a few spare covers at the same price as buying a single cover at the store. 
4569 Fantastic Product. Aperture ring is not so precise, but still manageable 
4570 i love it! 
4571 Great little accessory for my iPad. Great close up photos. 
4572 great item 
4573 It works very well!!!! A++++++!!!! 
4574 Kids can break just about anything. However this helicopter is easier to navigate than others. Its durable and can take some pretty bad falls or crashes. In the situation that my kid does break it. Its super cheap to be replaced. 
4575 Perfect for what I needed 
4576 It s an ok telescope, design is great and compact and easy to use. 
4577 These came without all parts. It said in the listing there was no manual, so I was expecting that.I was not expecting it to come with no peer sources. I had to ship it back 
4578 This is the perfect match to the LX 100 – it s fit and finish match and it even fits in the leather case. 
4579 i love it...as expected 
4580 Awesome , work great charge fast 
4581 Amazing for what it is. Definitely one of my smarter purchases. Does pretty much everything and offers as much as the gopro for a third of the cost! 
4582 But unfortunately I had to return the item because I received a new camera for my Birthday 
4583 Really good camera. Fast delivery 
4584 It was easy to setup and video quality is very good. 
4585 Great little camera! Fit perfectly on my 230 and 250 quadcopters and added very little weight! Can plug straight into fatshark or immersionrc transmitter. Good picture quality for fpv. 
4586 It works amazingly and the amount of light that it puts off is great. 
4587 GREAT CASE 
4588 Very good case for the Sony A6000. A kittle tight and a bit difficult to put and take off, But it works for me. 
4589 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
4590 It is everything I have been looking for. Great for telescope. It makes my cell phone a mini TV 
4591 It appears to be a well made filter, Works awesome with clarity..I recommend it... 
4592 Awesome! Just like OEM batteries, if not better. You just can t beat the price!! 
4593 really good, only one time allmost loose it, 100m altitud and do not respond get back home!!! 
4594 Exactly as I expected.[[ASIN:B00NIYJKL0 GoPro HERO4 Dual Battery Charger + Battery for HERO4]] 
4595 Excellent alternative to cable tethering... Have to get used to the lag time when shooting Raw but a necessity for location shooting and really sets you free in the studio. Great advantage shooting to an iPad for client involvement and approval. If you shoot tethered... It s a must have. 
4596 Great to have for surveying and inspections, bought several to have when needed. 
4597 popped right on, works great!! 
4598 If you need it, you ll love it. Otherwise, its another piece of gear looking for a use. I thought needed it, but by the time it arrived I had found a better solution to my problem. Still, its likely to be useful in studio photography. 
4599 Quality is not bad. Good lights. Easy setup. 
4600 Works Great 
4601 It is a tripod - does everything I expected it to do 
4602 It says on the site that it is compatible with the T5i but in the book that comes with the remote it does not say it is compatible and I cannot get it to connect to my camera. 
4603 good clean product. I wasn t sure what to expect but after receiving the package and using the cloth on my glasses, I glad I purchased them. I gave one to my wife, I have one in my vehicle and in my backpack. I expect to purchase another order soon. 
4604 Used this accessories kit to go cliff jumping and atv riding. Never have problems 
4605 really good quality 
4606 the night view is very good, I can see my Sofa so clearly, also my door 
4607 Fun, fun, fun! If you love bokeh and want to experiment, this lens is for you! Play and have fun and expand your creativity. 
4608 Do it - this has been great! 
4609 Not really satisfied. I m not recommend this product to anyone. Usable, but not even good made, especially all bolts what you use to keep your go pro firmly. 
4610 It does exactly what it is supposed to do. 
4611 Inexpensive, reasonably well constructed, works brilliantly (also very light weight). Given the battery life in an A6000, two are a requirement, and being able to charge both simultaneously saves getting up in the middle of the night to swap batteries into the charger. 
4612 So awesome to have another battery ready to go. These are working great. Recommended. 
4613 Git it on time. Everything as written came.Learning to use, but like it so far. 
4614 I was really happy with this purchase and made a review regarding the quality of all the accessories. The only accessory that I think is not so great is the monopod/selfie stick. Here is the link to my review on this purchase. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzvifJOyfac 
4615 This is just the right combination of super optics, travel size and affordable price. There was no perceptible difference between these and Leica in terms of clarity and ease of use. It is super easy to adjust thr focus by turning just one knob. 
4616 see pics. that s a dell e7440 and Sony a55 w/ 16-105 zoom lens. 
4617 Its good but it tend to turn off my screen on Nikon d5500 when I use it. There is a feature on my camera when something cover certain spot, I can t view my viewfinder at all. 
4618 This harness was great. It was easily adjustable and fit both my 18 pound Beagle and my 23 pound mutt perfectly! 
4619 It s the most useful thing I have purchased in a while. 
4620 so great to use them 
4621 I`m using all these pieces and there is a great difference no using them. Filters are very useful for specific pictures, anyway you have to be patience for selecting the right moment with the right place with the right filter. Good lenses for taking pictures of insects. 
4622 Was better than expected, solid, and compact enough to transport. 
4623 Works fantastic and it s exactly what I expected 
4624 Absolutely worth it... Grabbed one of these to keep an eye on our dogs! Took less than 2 min to set up! I will be adding a few more of these once our house gets built. Great for security as well. 
4625 haven t really used them yet, tested them they all work, were shipped on time, so far I think they will work great. 
4626 Looks just like picture. It is perfect for any size cell phones. 
4627 I bought this for my Husband for his birthday And he had yet to put it down..he takes it everywhere 
4628 Excellent design. Can carry a lot of gear for the size. A bit over priced. 
4629 The photo is a bit red. It is all godd! 
4630 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
4631 Monopod is useful for a video camcorder. Tripod camera mount plate/plastic clamp is so weak YOUR EXPENSIVE DSLR WILL FALL RIGHT OFF! You ve been warned. This is an imported piece of trash that is an expensive mistake! 
4632 Surprisingly simple and reliable 
4633 wy too small to use with a selfie stick! will work if you use the clamp from the stick for your phone or have a camera with a 1/4x20 hole in your device but that s about it. I need something with a wider stance (longer legs). 
4634 GREAT LENS. 
4635 Love it. Great price 
4636 Love the magnetic feet! 
4637 Works as it should (tested as soon as I got it) and the bonus adapter was great when we went to Paris. Unfortunately, I forgot the charger, and the extra battery (original), plus I left the adapter when we checked out of the hotel. :-/ 
4638 I love it 
4639 Works perfectly - much more convenient than the standard cover. And - the camera is not even longer (maybe by half of a milimeter) 
4640 Great product. Larger than I expected but perfect for cleaning for cleaning the screen of my phone and tablet. 
4641 Very bright and clear for day time, easy to use. Pretty powerful even for long distance but don t expect too much. Very good for general use, looking at bugs, butterflies, passing by ships etc. Would be great if the pouch has some extra room. 
4642 Quick shipping. Product works fine. We are powering 3 cameras with it at this time and plan to add more soon. 
4643 I m just a casual picture taker and 99% of the time use the automatic mode. The pics are fantastic. Great clarity, huge rage when zooming, and easy to carry. 
4644 Good tripod but no for heavy cameras 
4645 Thanks so much all products are in good conditions 
4646 Needed another shoe on our Canon C100 cameras for second wireless mics. The 1/4-20 hole at the back of the handle is the perfect spot and this shoe fits the bill. I bought 4, one for each camera. Why did we suffer so long without these? 
4647 Based on past experience, this sort of battery charger may be more apt to fail with heavy use; however this charger works well and, hopefully, will last a long time. 
4648 Not for heavy cameras. It will work perfect with light DSLR cameras and point and shoot cameras. 
4649 I bought two extras of these to glue together for lens organization in my bag. 
4650 Great for what its meant for. Make sure you clean the camera with rubbing alcohol before you stick this on. Used on my RX100 M2. Obviously makes the camera thicker. 
4651 works great 
4652 Item came in on time, in tact. Very happy with the product. 
4653 Better than expected. Easy to install and operate. Great system for price 
4654 Sturdy and heavy duty. I can pretty much angle my camera in an direction. This product is very well made! 
4655 Exactly as described. Quality is excellent. 
4656 It s great! 
4657 Works very well. 
4658 Great solid antenna with very good signal expansion compared to stock 
4659 Save your money! This is a piece of junk. The software is terrible and there is NO US support. Try emails to China. Look at the other reviews; all written by the same person. Buy a camera which has a US presence and support. 
4660 Well the build quality was alright but the actual use of this item was horrible. It would slide on its own and hit the insects id try to photograph. do not buy. 
4661 The cap fit very well. I have an old 35mm camera and lost the body cap. I can now shoot film and take my camera out and about 
4662 Just what I wanted. Works well 
4663 Great for boating or the pool. Easy to attach. 
4664 Great quality 
4665 Learning is half of the journey. 
4666 works perfectly 
4667 quickly and very good 
4668 This dash cam has paid for itself when my wife had an accident and it was all on dash cam. Great camara 
4669 Great bag, recommend to all photographers 
4670 Very versatile piece of gear. Protects cameras and lenses well, fits inside most backpacks and messenger bags. Would buy again. 
4671 Works perfectly on my 80lbs Doberman and she barely notices it. Would highly recommend this of the costly GoPro brand dog harness mount 
4672 Great product and a Fair price.. 
4673 Very nice product. It has work really good and the quality of the pictures is the best 
4674 Fast shipping and was exactly as described! 
4675 really if you look closely it looks like false but if you install it on the roof or in a faraway place the camera seem real 
4676 Great starter pack. Gets the chicks panties wet. One mount sucks. 
4677 Battery does not communicate with Nikon charger so you don t know whether it is fully charged. Disappointed. 
4678 A++++ 
4679 I don t like typing 
4680 Much lighter and sturdier than my earlier one, that weighed much more than this. Love it with the Sirui T-1205x 
4681 Inserted the sd card and it got lost in the camera. Had to take camera apart to get it out. Re-inserted, tested camera, and didn t work. Returned camera and sd card. Won t order anything that small again. 
4682 Good items! 
4683 Excellent product - camera fits perfectly! Super fast arrival time too! 
4684 Great product 
4685 The battery I needed for my camera and it works fine. 
4686 My Raspberry Pi is finally able to work with my older big screen. Just had to swap the plugs around to get the picture to display after I forced the Pi to output analog video (under the config file). 
4687 great gift lots of fun 
4688 Awesome with a rigid hinge. Robust better than expected perfect for a gopro or camera gear. 
4689 pretty good, nice kit that comes with a lot. be careful when putting them on though, they can stick really easily and can be nearly impossible to take off 
4690 very good item delivered as expected. 
4691 A perfect product for when you run out of juice. 
4692 Not much to say other than it fits and works perfectly. 
4693 Great! 
4694 One of the green pens is totally dry and doesn t work at all. Out of ten pens, only four show up on a black paper. The box is broken. 
4695 All excellent mounts. It does not use the contour sliding system, instead it uses a standard camera screw. 
4696 Great price and great quality. 
4697 price is very competitive 
4698 Nikon Brand so you know without a doubt....it will work! 
4699 OEM. Lasts forever. Great pricing. 
4700 Looks great, fits perfectly. I have a Canon eos XS and I got some old lenses from a flea market. They are canon FD lenses and everything works great. Just need to clean up my new (old) lenses and I m ready to go 
4701 I have Pelican cases for a lot of valuable equipment. They never let me down. 
4702 Excelent Quality Pictures with this camera, i look like a Pro 
4703 Works perfectly for what I needed. Super clean and tons of gain! 
4704 I stuck this to the tail of my airplane for some amazing in-flight shots. When size and weight are important, this is the one. 
4705 SO GLAD THEY OFFER PAGES TO EXPAND YOUR ALBUM. SO FAR I HAVE EXPANDED 2X AND ROOM FOR MORE IF I NEED TOO. 
4706 Works adequately. 
4707 I use it a lot for the Eagles that I watch and for some motorcycle rides. 
4708 I sent this camera to my son who is out of the country. When he uses wifi all the pictures will go to the cloud. If he loses his camera he will never lose his pictures. He loves this phone. 
4709 As described. Packs into small space. Ideal for macro work. 
4710 These are just what we have been looking for. Right size. Arrived on time. Works perfectly. 
4711 No More VR Issue. I received the lens yesterday without any VR issue. The lens is great. 
4712 These were my first pair of binoculars and man am I impressed. These pull in a lot of light and offer a crystal clear viewing experience. 
4713 Received these today and tried them out and I m very satisfied with the results. 
4714 Good 
4715 Excellent 
4716 Really a professional piece of equipment. Used with cameras of appropriate weight and this is a great tool. I have heavier pro version but don t want to carry on smaller jobs. This I will take everywhere! 
4717 I would like to know if the little screw that s long enough for the P3S is sold anywhere? The one supplied is not long enough to mount to the rc mount to eyelet. 
4718 Very happy with this set. I ve had a lot of fun decorating my pictures! 
4719 Got a couple of these. Both went down within a day of putting them up. I hooked them up to all 5 of my camera systems and they didn t work on any of them. One did last an hour longer than the other. Won t do that again... 
4720 fit perfect, easy to apply. 
4721 I bought this as a Mother s Day present for my wife. She wanted something between a point-and-shoot into DSLR. This fits the bill. 
4722 Nice little kit. its obviously cheap and the the brushes may loose a hair inside your camera from time to time so double check it before you start shooting but otherwise im really happy with it. im not a pro photographer. 
4723 Nifty camera. Great outdoor solution. FREE online storage is a huge plus. Easy setup and surprisingly good battery life. Likely to buy another. 
4724 Money value package 
4725 works well for a novice 
4726 Excellent value at twice the price. Equal to, if not superior in quality and functionality to the camera float manufactured by Olympus. 
4727 Product came as described with all parts in tact. They are fairly sturdy and seem to do a good job. 
4728 Bought this product for my grandson to anchor his gopro to boat motor and it worked great. 
4729 Ball head fully met expectations; it held the camera very securely - could saftly walk with the tripod with the camera locked in place. was easy to adjust, with a time and coarse adjustment capability and scanned smppthly. Nice small size and light weight, 
4730 works as advertised. 
4731 Film in pack didn t always result in good picture. Not sure if it was user error and we exposed film because first picture turned out great. 
4732 This product met advertised specifications and was promptly shipped. However I would recommend spending additional money for brass rings to prevent sticking threads. 
4733 The NIKON LensPen Lens Cleaner works as described, so I am happy with my purchase. 
4734 Wonderful protection, light weight, good harness. 
4735 Came exactly as said and about 2$ cheaper than if I bought it at a store, so I guess it s worth it 
4736 love this camera, battery does seem to lose charge fast. 
4737 On the Nikon J4, the minimal focal distance is closer to a 50mm lens. I love this lens. I intended to upgrade to a full DSLR, but, my J4 is awesome with this lens and the FT1 adapter. 
4738 Accurate reading. Cheap, does what it should 
4739 Nice cover. Fits the A6000 well. I d love a belt strap, but this is a good cover for saving the camera from small dings and dirt. 
4740 Looks great, works great. Not the fastest lens or lowest F-stop, but pictures are clear and focus is quick enough for money spent. 
4741 Great! 
4742 satisfied with the order. the product was exactly as it was described. 
4743 Swivel section will not turn more than a few degrees! Had to move the whole unit to video. 
4744 Just what I was needing for my gimbal 
4745 worked great.....the same as nikon battery. 
4746 Item works great and arrived in a timely matter! 
4747 These seem to work fine. I can t comment on whether they last as long as the original battery. they seem to last a long time. 
4748 The Sony battery is exactly as advertised. Thank you! 
4749 It works perfectly. I really liked being able just to put the battery into the camera without having to power it up first. 
4750 I m a wedding videographer and this is a must have!! 
4751 Not user friendly and the owners manual is worthless. Find another product that is easier to use and more reliable. 
4752 Bought this Hood for my Canon EOS T5i with 18-135mm lens and fits perfectly! Very good quality item! 
4753 Great gear for use. 
4754 Perfect, controls my 560III s power levels remotely. Superb portable lighting setup. 
4755 Quality product. Fast shipping. For Fujifilm XP80 fit. 
4756 Love them, 2nd pair I have owned 
4757 Order arrived as stated on the site; the cameras are great - we are very happy. 
4758 Yes I still do Polaroids 
4759 One of the bulbs was not working. 
4760 It s a flash stand. Therefore, you stick a flash in it and it stands. Done. 
4761 One, two three, I had my cable and it fit perfectly. 
4762 Smaller than advertised :( 
4763 Great quality and is definitely an upgrade from the stock screws. Don t think i ll ever use the stock ones again and will slowly replace all my plastic ones with these. 
4764 Love it 
4765 It charged the battery. 
4766 Not pro quality or durability, but it gets the job done and works well. The reversal cover is a nice solve to the problem of needing to bring several reflectors to a shoot. 
4767 Delivered as advertised. 
4768 Exactly as needed. 
4769 I still have been able to get it to work 
4770 very good quality and very good prices 
4771 Works great 
4772 Very pleased 
4773 Didn t work. Manual had instructions for a different model. Honestly, I wish I had just spent the extra few dollars for a decent one 
4774 heavy, flat look at objects 
4775 Perfect. Brought my camera back to life. 
4776 Easy to use but battery died on me pretty quickly although I hardly used it. Also never learned all its features, my God, why do they put so many features on it. 
4777 Easy to install and works well. You do have to hit # after your code in order to unlock, which is slightly annoying. 
4778 Worked great, easy to install. Great communication. 
4779 Just fits the front of the SB600 but don t stay on..must tape it to keep it from falling off 
4780 Pretty decent monopod, locks function properly, lightweight, stable enough for a Canon Vixia hf 400r camcorder. Not sure if it is up to professional standards but the fluid head pans and tilts smoothly with no discernible drag. Construction and materials are up to par for the price. 
4781 Lena works perfectly for selfies! Couldn t be happier and it snaps on and off seamlessly 
4782 Setup was very simple and once it s configured (in less than 10 minutes) it s very easy to use with the app and web site. 
4783 bob s knobs alwasy good for your telecope. 
4784 Wish it was bigger, but it s tough and very high quality. I store 4 light stands and a soft box in it. It can t take any more than that. 
4785 It s a great product at a great price. I love the bubble levels and the height adjustability. 
4786 I loved this camera and it is a very good one and i think some of you should but it 
4787 Arrived on time. Great package. Some of the items were not really needed, but I am very pleased with the whole transaction. The camera is a great camera for an amateur photographer. I really like the size. I also ordered a 50mm lens for the camera. Have everything I need. 
4788 Worked exactly as expected 
4789 Quality exceeded expectations that were based on price. 
4790 Cool 
4791 Nice case, fits well. Product arrived sooner than expected. 
4792 Fit the lens it was purchased for, seems okay. No distortions. 
4793 Very cool product. I am pleased with my purchase. 
4794 It is good product 
4795 Lens works well.. makes reds pop out..Awesome 
4796 Sets a role model for how flexible gymnasts must be to make it to the top 
4797 Works great 
4798 Package came a little damaged and sealed with tape, but product was in good condition. It works fine. Level indicator is a little weak. 
4799 The logo does not look like what it shows in the picture!!!! Instead of the embroidered letters, it s actually an ugly piece of black rubber attached onto the bag. :( 
4800 AAAA 
4801 Great value. Perfect for teenage grandson. Holding up well. He lives it. 
4802 Great lens very sharp and fast and I love it! Quality feeling and quality look. Worth every penny. Very happy I purchased this lens 
4803 Met my expectations. 
4804 This battery died very quickly on me. 
4805 Needs handle bars. 
4806 Fit and works great! 
4807 This umbrella soft box does not have a white interior as the description claims. That was the only reason I bought this version over the others that are available and it was incorrect. The build quality was fine for the price. 
4808 Great for home 
4809 Works great, But complicated. Have to read directions often. I don t use it a lot so I forget. 
4810 I love the Bella twins poser 
4811 Great device extremely helpful in close-up work 
4812 Met my expectations 
4813 Better than the factory dji box, but you still have to remove the rotors and it bends the RC antennas a little. Also the pockets and zipper storage for the rotors would be too tight and potentially bend them. 
4814 nice cap. cheap replacement. 
4815 Canon continues to stay on the cutting edge of digital photography, with controls that can be changed on-the-fly while in use. 
4816 two details of this tripod that I do not like: the minimum length is too long, the 2 release handles (for the quick release plate) are a little too stiff. 
4817 Fine 
4818 This was a great first lighting kit for me. The quality of the items were great and its a very easy and quick set up and take down with great carrying cases. 
4819 Arrived as expected and was in good condition. 
4820 No problems. Very accurate description 
4821 Great quality. Better than Nikon 
4822 The cameras have only been up a little over a week now and two out of four no longer even work. Is this set of security cameras junk? I paid an additional $100 to have them mounted on the outside. And I am out a lot of money now. 
4823 At full optical zoom the image starts to get blurrier. 
4824 LOVE IT 
4825 i had the instax mini 8 and was fed up with the over or under exposure that happened too much! this one enables much more control on how the photo turns out! love learning all the cool functions and modes! 
4826 while I have only used the camera for a few weeks and still learning I have noticed improved speed and sharp pictures. 
4827 Great charger! 
4828 Wifes rebel t3 fits nicely. 
4829 Only helpfull if you use them. But reading them they are full of good info. 
4830 This bag is beautiful and holds a mirror less camera, four lenses, batteries, filters and memory cards. Truly amazing for its size. 
4831 Would not fit my camera. Should have read reviews before ordering. 
4832 i love this flash! adds such good dynamic lighting 
4833 These work great in the woman s locker room at my health club. 
4834 Awesome bag, the quality is high and the design is awesome. if you love old school stuff :) 
4835 Fast shipping, nice flash, awesome speed light. 
4836 I like the head mount better for what I am using it for (tracking with my dog, and nosework) but it is very adjustable and another tool to use with the GoPro :) 
4837 Love love love the bag! I couldn t be happier with my purchase! The bag has plenty of room for my camera and everything else I usually carry in my purse! 
4838 Nice products! 
4839 Easy to use camera. Quality pictures & simple directions 
4840 It okay the press button does work to good 
4841 The camera is great, all in perfect conditions! 
4842 it doesn t last and it gets hot 
4843 I purchased these to use on a Galaxy S6 and was disappointed, the clip did not fit well and the Macro only seemed to come into focus if the object was about 0.50&#34; so I returned them. 
4844 This is well made and I use it alot, I carry it everwhere with me because I take my camera everywhere with me and it has stood up to my goings. 
4845 The treading is a bit rough but it definitely gets the job done. 
4846 Look very official. Can only be seen on clear windows as they stick on the inside of window. 
4847 Henry i want to say that Mr. Henry was very helpful he installed my cam in it didn t take him a long time i want to say thank you for all your help in doing so 
4848 PRICE WAS FAIR AND QUALITY IS EXCELLENT..NO LEAK S AND SIMPLE TO USE... 
4849 It works great even under water 
4850 Muy buen producto 
4851 Works perfectly! 
4852 Super fun camera! Captures great sunsets and dogs running on the beach with great detail. Looking forward to getting additional lenses! 
4853 None of the pictures came out. They were too dark. 
4854 If you are considering purchasing a digital frame, this is the one to buy! My pictures look fabulous. I will be purchasing additional frames for myself and for gifts. 
4855 Love it! Nice to handle and work photos! 
4856 If you think about getting a tripod for your camera? This is the perfect one! Very light, user friendly, and i just love the design. I didn t have to read the manual, it s that easy to use. 
4857 I have more bags than you can count. Always looking for the best camera bag. It has not be made as yet. However, this is the best bag I found for the micro 4/3 camera and three lens. Love it. My favorite bag. 
4858 I bought the 16 inch one and the 10 inch one. Very protective, but also very thick. I like the fact that I can wrap my lenses up as a burrito or a baby, hahaha. 
4859 Works well when taking group picture! 
4860 Fantastic !! 
4861 I received the item in a well protected box. The battery grip comes with instructions in English. I am very pleased with the grip. Function keys work perfectly for my Rebel XSI. I would recommend this grip. Feels solid on my camera. 
4862 Exactly as expected. Never had a problem switching lenses, comes off and goes on with out a problem. Came quickly, very satisfied with purchase! 
4863 Worked well when i owned Cannon 
4864 Great product at a great price. 
4865 Works great 
4866 I really like how the camera works 
4867 Great kit highly recommend. 
4868 Useful 
4869 Works just like the original.... Kept my GoPro attached to my motorcycle fender from San Frandisco to Portland and Back! 
4870 It s a camera case, and a good one. Fit my waterproof Fuji camera really well and feels as though it provides excellent protection for my camera. What s not to like? 
4871 Tried to revive my flip ultra that won t charge...still won t charge. Not the battery s fault..I guess. Too bad, it took great pictures, but too expensive to replace. Will go back to using my camera phone. 
4872 compact and easy to store, easy to use. 
4873 Great Binoculars for the price. They can be hard to hold steady in your hands. 
4874 Awesome! 
4875 These hold a charge as well as the Fuji X-t1 battery, and maybe a little better. It turns off when fully charged and will hold its charge for many days unused. 
4876 Not impressed, already the large thumbscrew has strip out. The quality is very questionable which is my reason for one star. 
4877 It does the job ... However, build quality is not as good as it should be 
4878 Better stay off it unless u have all day time and a dead specimen to click. 
4879 Not that much good quality video 
4880 really handy charger convent battery holds good charge 
4881 Good product. 
4882 good 
4883 This item fits perfectly. They are a great, affordable alternative. 
4884 Nice strapt but without enough flotation for maintain coolpix AW130 on the water level, you need to add an small flotation block 
4885 Wish the batteries last longer. At 2 and a half months the battery reached the red. Still an awesome device for home security. 
4886 Very clear picture. Works great! Set-up was a breeze. Had tried other cameras before and the set-up was terrible, so bad I never used them! 
4887 I got this thinking it would work to start and stop video, but it works only as a shutter for the still camera. 
4888 This camera case can carry all of my equipment to a crime scene. I also like the fact that it s water proof (more so than my other bag was) and that I have everything in one place. 
4889 Enjoyed using this lens on vacation. Used it for landscape as well as astrophotography. 
4890 Everything has been great.. Pleasure to use! 
4891 As i expected. 
4892 Thank you! 
4893 Using now and they work great and hold as good a charge as my original. 
4894 Battery charger works well. No complaints. 
4895 haven t had a chance to use yet but everything looks fine 
4896 I have used this type device before and paid 3x as much for one that is no better, if not as good. Really makes a difference in the grip and ability to steady the camera. NICE! 
4897 This microphone worked really well for General sound on my short films and videos. 
4898 The selfie stick works awesome. Not quite as long as i expected but has a great battery life. The seller was very easy to work with and 10/10 would buy from them again 
4899 Nice Point and Shoot Digital Camera, but the battery runs out pretty quickly! 
4900 i love using these with my instant camera. especially when i take photos of my 3 year old, she loves seeing the photos come out on the disney film 
4901 This was great! Looks like the real thing. 
4902 I love it! It s exactly what I was looking for! 
4903 Batery life is 45 minutes 
4904 a little expensive but works great 
4905 Horrible quality. Get a better camera. 
4906 I wanted one of the clips shown in original picture but what I saw and what I received were 1 piece different. No other issues! 
4907 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
4908 good to have it... 
4909 Works as advertised! Not much more to say than that! 
4910 Everything fit my SONY, great price too! Everything is still working after three vacations! 
4911 Works Great !! 
4912 Great Thank you. 
4913 Works great! ! Camera I just bought didn t have one. I like to keep the flash connection clean and damage free. 
4914 Perfect!!! 
4915 Extremely fast service, got it in one piece. ** Only one situation. The ilustration (as shown)and as per description, the &#34;The Tripod adapter&#34; Base is incomplete or missing. 
4916 Thank you 
4917 It s a cool grip but the camera feels a little unbalanced when it s on. 
4918 The batteries worked just fine,in the camera and the charger.Thank you. 
4919 Fantastic. Will be buying many more. Only gripe I have is that the base plate doesn t have the larger thread option. Really wish it was there. 
4920 Just as advertised. 
4921 excellent 
4922 A must for any one camping and good for everyday use. 
4923 Awesome, if u r a little girl 
4924 It works as Intended and right on time 
4925 Bought one along With the camera but the lens cover on the case was cracked and felling apart Just by taking it off the bag, by mistake I bought two cases and the other one was fine but Im second guessing on submerging this case With the camera incide 
4926 not user friendly 
4927 I really liked this camera though it is not advanced as others I have owned in the past, For the price, it gets the job done. 
4928 Product was in great condition(new) and worked out great 
4929 Nice 
4930 Works as advertised charging my Sony Camcorder NP-F330 battery 
4931 Great camera, amazing pictures, easy to use, awesome zoom and incredible quality product 
4932 Not as expected. I thought from picture it would be a dual charger. It isn t. 
4933 very portable! 
4934 Excellent camera, service was great and help me set up in minutes. App makes the camera useful and mobile. 
4935 Delivered as advertised and works great 
4936 Nice product and delivered on time. 
4937 Gave as a gift to my daughter. She is very pleased 
4938 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
4939 I m very pleased with my tripod came a lot faster than I thought. It s a lil flimsy but you get what you pay for I m satisfied over all 
4940 Perfect fit arrived a day early. Thank u. 
4941 Seems sturdy and easy to use! Take the time to learn the menus for ease of changing settings on the go! 
4942 It is too small for my Nikon D3000 
4943 I ve had nothing but problems with it, from the wheels falling off, to the knobs not holding their position to an unfixable wobble, the problems are endless. Invest in something better than this, you ll be glad you did. 
4944 Absolutely the best! I only put B+W on my lenses. So clear sometimes it appears like there is no glass in the frame. The slim profile is perfect for the Olympus 12mm wide. Plenty of groove up front for a lens cap. 
4945 Too much distortion, even after you set the Lens Conversion setting. This is true for both the wide angle and the telephoto. The telephoto is worse, though. You re better off just spending more money on a better attachment. 
4946 Everything you d want and more! 
4947 My old worn out battery holds better charge that this new one... I don t recommend it. 
4948 Needs to be plugged in to charger to use auto feature. Also very sensitive to the touch, it falls off holder when I go to unplug it. Other than that it does its job! 
4949 Great,thanks 
4950 Takes alright pictures...just takes what feels like &#34;a few seconds&#34; between each shot. So, can t take rapid pictures. 
4951 Great add-on for a product. Excellent shipping, and no issues. 
4952 Affordable and handy. Very sturdy build. Worth the money. 
4953 Just bought this camera a couple of weeks ago for a really good price. I m really Stocked with the camera and everything that came with it. The shipping was great. Thanks a lot! 
4954 Did not come as pictured. Connectors are female to RCA, not female to female 
4955 Don t bother with these. They fall apart and are easily lost. My husband lost 2 in 2 days. Money down the drain. Buy better ones. 
4956 So far, so good! Does exactly what I wanted. 
4957 I had bought this alongside my RF Explorer because I figured it was something special for the unit. It is a fine case for it, but its nothing different than a generic hard drive like case. 
4958 quality is good enough for indoor use. 
4959 Good 
4960 Excellent service from Calvin in helping setup. Camera is great 
4961 I ve owned two of this lens and it is my favorite I have ever had. Everything is perfect. Sharp!!!!! 
4962 Working good so far Don t know in the future 
4963 Great product. 
4964 An amazing camera with an amazing auto focus and built quality. Image quality is what you payed for. No more to say. 
4965 Pleased with product performance, soft yet durable with multiple functionality options at a super great price. Glad I bought it! 
4966 It works alright. Little bulky.. Not as much room as indicated by pictures and other user reviews. Decent for a casual day of shooting, but doesn t hold all I d like it after reading the reviews 
4967 Perfect was what i need 
4968 Great for keeping a your Gopro equipment safe and orderly. Would recommend. 
4969 Everything Works Great 
4970 Screen became washed out after 40 days. 
4971 Works great. 
4972 This lens is well worth the price of admission. It is fast and sharp. It is great for shooting sports. It is very heavy, so expect a workout when you shoot. 
4973 Great video quality, and works really well with my iphone 6. Love the ease of viewing. 
4974 Simple and effective! 
4975 Easy setup, works great. 
4976 It works!! I like it! 
4977 Glad I found this for the price,works great .. 
4978 Battery arrived in time and is working beautifully 
4979 love having an extra battery when traveling 
4980 Product was as advertised. 
4981 True to what it is and how it is advertised. Love having an extra battery; keeps the charge just as long as the battery that came with my nikon dslr. 
4982 Lost my old cord - works great. 
4983 Compact, well made, will be taking them to our Yellowstone park trip next month. 
4984 A little pricey but works geeat 
4985 Gave this as a gift. Friend loved it. Uploading and ease of use is wonderful. Nice large screen. She likes to display four photos on each screen view. Would definitely buy again. 
4986 Lena cap does not fit hood 
4987 Same color as described. Great thick quality as usual 
4988 This was a great tripod for the price range. Just high enough that you can film people with the camera at face level. Very easy to use, no complaints at all! 
4989 Not as cheap as sony but still good 
4990 Camera works as advertised, wish the mounting bracket was better designed so I can attach it to the eve versus having to mount to wall, other then that works very good, great night vision, field of view is better then most others I have tried 
4991 Love the caamera and the picss. 
4992 I like it 
4993 great value, thanks for the deal 
4994 Love the camera but the accessories are junk. 
4995 Great product, I use it on my seadoo spark. 
4996 The product comes in Chinese letters and could not figure out how to put it into english. 
4997 Great lens!!! 
4998 good product 
4999 Just what I expected 
5000 great price fast shipping 
5001 Great bag, too small for 9900. returned bag 
5002 has very short sensing range 
5003 Nice 
5004 Nice color 
5005 Great product! exactly what I needed. 
5006 Just like the original. perfect fit. easy pluck. used it to reconfigure the case for my camera and lenses. 
5007 good designer, good quality, and easy to use 
5008 great 
5009 This lens is very good 
5010 its not a wide angle 
5011 .but works well for phot and video on my DSLR 
5012 Works perfectly for when I need flash harsh light diffused. Great price! 
5013 Great Battery 
5014 very happy with my purchase! 
5015 Product was as advertised. 
5016 Thanks 
5017 for a motorcycle rider it is far superior compared to the competition. The video and audio is clear and after 6 months of use has been flawless in use after hundreds of hours of recording on a daily use. 
5018 I like this camera and have gotten several compliments on it, some due to the red color which makes it unique. My only problem is that you have to turn the camera off , and then on again if you turn it on before removing the lens cap. 
5019 Low Quality Gives cameras a rainbow on the screen 
5020 Works fine. Not enlarge enough and not bright enough. 
5021 Fine product. 
5022 Good price/delivered right on time!! Work s well!! 
5023 Good purchase and overall quality.... I would prefer if the joints remained stiff over the life of the tripod... but it s not bad! 
5024 The camera is good but the rest of the assessories are garbage. The batteries on the battery charger wont charge. The cleaning solution was open and everything on the inside of the bag was wrecked so I had to be thrown away. 
5025 Great walk around lens. Takes decent portraits. One of my favorite lenses. Does a good job with indoor photos. Excells outdoors! Great price for an L glass! A must have for any collection. 
5026 Very good! Works great! 
5027 Returned 
5028 Great product and will purchase again. 
5029 Didn t meet my expectations, couldn t charge battery 100%,mostly 85% to 90% only. 
5030 lens cap is great so far. I tried an attachment ring for the first time. It moved and caused my camera lanes to jam causing an error code, and then it fell apart. But I bought it for the lens cap, not the attachment. I could do without those. 
5031 Hard to install on a verizon system. The night vision requires a bright light. The picture however is excellent. 
5032 Excellent! 
5033 This case provides great storage and travels great for my Sony Digital SLR. Lots of pockets and is made of good quality. 
5034 Works fine I like it 
5035 Love it! Wish I had bought it sooner. 
5036 Worked perfectly. Looks identical to the Sony original at a fraction of the price 
5037 Ok 
5038 My daughter loved it!! So happy with it 
5039 Easy to use, perfect for our needs 
5040 I am enjoying to see my cats in my house while I am working at my office. 
5041 Fine for the price but does not have a tripod mount as the description implies. 
5042 To hard to get loaded on pc , light weight and moves around to much on your face and you can t tell if you are recording or not 
5043 Great product. Fast shipping. Secure packing. Exactly as described. Thank you! 
5044 a little short, shorther then the factory one, it it was 10 inches longer this would be a hit. 
5045 First one fell apart So far the replacement is fine Easy return process, with no problems 
5046 This product is a piece of crap I tried to get my money back but they never responed 
5047 Very helpful item,thank you very much 
5048 the backpack does look like the one is the picture doesn t say DJI on it disappointed 
5049 after reading all the reviews, I elected to buy this lcd cover (I m too clumsy not to scratch things). Easiest application ever, perfect fit - looks like part of the camera. Doesn t obscure screen at all. Very happy with purchase! 
5050 For the price, it exceeded my expectations. 
5051 Just as described. 
5052 Super high-quality polarizer filter. I like the great thin construction of the filter, the color cast isn t too blue either. Breakthrough also stands by their products. If you want to step in from Tiffen and Hoya, try out Breakthrough filters. 
5053 Super convenient and as such you ll likely have it when you desperately need it (as I ve found) 
5054 excelente 
5055 We bought this to fit our Nikon COOLPIX P600 16.1 MP Wi-Fi CMOS Digital Camera with 60x Zoom NIKKOR Lens and Full HD 1080p Video 
5056 Works great, no complaints. 
5057 Quick turn around. Great product, fantastic price. 
5058 I love it. 
5059 This is a great bag. Seems well built. And for a camera bag it s probably just right. I m using it as a messenger bag for work. As such, having some more organization would be helpful (pen slots, interior pockets, etc) but ice made sure by accessorizing. 
5060 Easy to use, not too heavy, and I like the document flap in the front inside cover. 
5061 Junk. Brand new and don t hold a charge. 
5062 Compact, but amazing little camera. Great zoom capabilities. Love it! 
5063 It s okay, but nothing to write home about. 
5064 Works as expected and no complaints from me. I will update my review should that change. 
5065 Great service, delivered precisely as stated. Thanks. 
5066 Works as described but the remote control switch felt cheap and felt like it would not hold up over time. 
5067 works as described. 
5068 Works really well, batteries seem to last just as long as the original gopro battery. Charger works great as well even with all three batteries charging simultaneously. 
5069 For the price you cant beat it not to mention the looks, its preety good 
5070 Looks and works great 
5071 awesome bag 
5072 My friend told me I do not need to worry about the battery cause it does last long. But it s OK. 
5073 Perfect!!! 
5074 Great camera. I use it outside of my home and it s got the clearest image of any camera I ve used. I have is recording constantly to a nas and it has worked flawlessly. I highly recommend it. 
5075 Excellent strap. I really like the fact that the strap is detachable via a click button and swappable with a normal non floating cord for everyday use. The regular strap came with the two pack. Strap is very buoyant in the water. 
5076 good cap cheap replacement. 
5077 Just as expected and fast delivery 
5078 Very versatile and did what was expected. I am really amazed at the quality you get for the price. Great value! 
5079 This works perfectly for in-studio shoots. A heavier version is better for outdoor shoots or if using heavy backdrops. 
5080 More then enough light at an exceptional price! 
5081 My Canon Powershot SX710 fits perfectly in this - with room for extra batteries. It is small enough that I can put it in my purse so my camera is with me all the time. It is a quality product. 
5082 Awesome 
5083 Very good results. Totally satisfied... 
5084 Excellent buy. 
5085 They are what they seem to be. Very large, easy to store and they get the job done... oh yeah and they are priced right. 
5086 great product 
5087 The best value with the lowest cost per photo - I ll never run out or miss the perfect shot! 
5088 I m not a camera person...not what I expected... 
5089 Pretty nice camera for what I paid 
5090 Only worked for 7 months. 
5091 I was surprised how well constructed this was. I mean good zippers and all. I feel you really get your moneys worth. 
5092 Got this as a present for my parents and they LOVE it!! 
5093 great product 
5094 It s a very nice Len very solid but it doesn t work that great with the A7ii. 
5095 Great product. 
5096 Camera works great and Henry at Foscam did the install. Henry was tremendous -- patient, professional and helpful. Kudos to all! 
5097 This is a great product!!! 
5098 absolute trash 
5099 Great buy, great item, works 100% every time in all modes... 
5100 Great little camera! 
5101 I received this and wanted to charge the battery for my son. It didn t charge, I don t know whether the battery is bad or the actual charger. :( 
5102 Perfect! 
5103 Excelente product. Amaing zoom. 
5104 LEAVE ME ALONE! 
5105 my daughter loves this- was her Bithday gift. my only concern is it will be outdated in no time .too expensive for what is about to come to market 
5106 came in black, but i like that better than the grey. no sealed pockets for memory cards and spare batteries though. 
5107 So far its being great 
5108 Arrived promptly and as described. 
5109 Not bad. 
5110 Not good for all cameras listed. The case included is tiny. 
5111 Henry Thanks again for helping me set up my 2 cameras again. These are great cameras and the only drawback is I need to buy more. I highly recommend these cameras as well as the tech support provided by Henry and the Foscam team.. 
5112 Received my product very quickly from the seller. Thanks!! The film was perfect and the price was PERFECT!! 
5113 Love it it is great! I m using it with Canon Pima IP110 and while slightly large, it works well!!! 
5114 Everything worked perfectly. Very satisfied. e 
5115 Exelente 
5116 Good quality mount for smaller diameter bars. 
5117 Returned for refund as they were not genuine GoPro items, as advertised. All of the other items I purchased WERE genuine. 
5118 All is perfect 
5119 trash!!!!!! original battery with 1030mAh working in two times longer than this batteries with 2300 mAh 
5120 Works good. Delivered in time. 
5121 Great 
5122 The glass was very nice. I just used them a couple of times but looking forward to playing! 
5123 all good; great value and great product. 
5124 The battery is listed as DMW-BCF10PP but i received BCF-10E which is a different voltage and mAH rating so i had to return it. 
5125 Works well. I have been a max of 10 feet away so far, and I have yet to have trouble. This is DEFINITELY worth the buy. 
5126 very clear, you need a tripod for steady viewing 
5127 charge up fast, work great, don t heat up while it is being charged up, holds charge really good 
5128 Excellent item 
5129 Love it! Arrived fast ! 
5130 very good！ 
5131 Perfect way to hold my camera! love it way more than a neck strap, and it looks cool and kind vintage! 
5132 Looks good. Wife really loved it! 
5133 gets the job done. 
5134 My daughter enjoys taking pictures. 
5135 Works great 
5136 don t buy it !!!!!! went up smoke !!!!!!!!!! 
5137 I m not pleased with the color of the pictures it takes. 
5138 Really love this camera! It has been a great upgrade for me. I use it for interior real estate photography as well nature and family photography. 
5139 Got it the next day COOL a swivel to point the camera forward be handy 
5140 Love the Glass. Extremely sharp when stopped down to 8.0. It is solid and goes great with a full frame body. 
5141 Works! 
5142 Great product! Was as described and received item in a very timely manner. 
5143 The LEDs are grossly underpowered. It wont even light up an area 10 feet away. I m sorry I bought it. Used to sell for over a hundred dollars? Baloney! 
5144 works, gets the job done 
5145 High quality, best cleaning pad I ever had 
5146 compared to what plastic components for the GoPro are going for, the price on this item seemed steep. my suggestion is that if you have this component, don t lose it. otherwise, it does what it s supposed to do. 
5147 Awesome product, easy to assemble and use. 
5148 Did some shots of the Milky Way here in New Mexico and they came out better than I expected. So far I m really impressed with this lens. 
5149 Good package deal, easy to fly, lots of fun 
5150 It s nice enough but it keeps corrupting the USB stick that stores the photos. I ve had to reload the USB several times now. 
5151 One of the last viewfinder cameras. Takes great pictures when you allow sufficient time for it to focus. 
5152 Love my Foldio! I use it to take pictures for my esty shop. They turn out well lit and with a nice uniform background. It is also very convent since its not that big and can be folded up to taken on the go. 
5153 I like this camera, nice size to fit into your pocket. Got some amazing photos at a concert. The zoom made it seem like we were right up front. 
5154 I love the device. Only wish is that it sat high enough when facing myself from a low angle that the hardware was not visible in shot. 
5155 Very good I would recommend the sky master. 
5156 Great price! heavy though. 
5157 Only complaint, battery life should be better, drains to quickly when recording video. Good for simplicity, but battery, MEH! Wifi turned on and battery really tanks pretty quick. picture quality is good for the price, audio not it s finest feature. iPhone app, kind of sucks and crashes a lot. 
5158 Fake toy, None of the sensors were accurate, not even close. 
5159 exelent! 
5160 Works great 
5161 We have loved this easy to use camera. 
5162 good price and product. 
5163 Works great and Good price 
5164 I was skeptical at first when I ordered this, but was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this item. Very satisfied so far. 
5165 While these batteries are not the best build quality as the original GoPro batteries, they last quite as long as the Original batteries. And for throw away prices, you wouldnt regret a bit. Go for it! 
5166 Cheap but works. 
5167 Returned, it did not fit. Seemed to be made as well as any others I have seen. 
5168 works perfectly with my a6000 
5169 This hood is perfect, fit and finish very good, always satisfied buying from this seller 
5170 great item, will buy again for my 2nd a6000 
5171 Works as advertised for Canon 7d Mark 2 
5172 this is my 3rd time buying for my friends same product. 
5173 LOVE THIS MOUNT SO MUCH!!!!! customer service is incredible. no problems with shipping. cant wait to try it out 
5174 nice case 
5175 Worked as advertised. 
5176 Works! 
5177 A little bulky for what it does (remote camera shutter, flash) but works as stated from any position. 
5178 I couldn t find all his potential use yet. I m trying to find special situations to use it. 
5179 Memory Card not included in the box. You need to buy one separately or the camera will not work. Also, the &#34;Must Have&#34; accessory kit is not needed. Other than the camera case, all other items come with camera or are superfluous. 
5180 It s all good. 
5181 A 
5182 It does the job. I love the lcd screen. Why pay over 400 when u can get this camera 
5183 Ghhg 
5184 great product......super fast delivery 
5185 works ok 
5186 Works great. I love that I can use this with the wrist guard or without. I like having to be able to take a picture one handed and still have my camera secure. Great purchase! 
5187 Its so great that its good in capturing those moments other consider as hard to capture 
5188 Great birthday as birthday gift or special occasion. The girlfriend loves it, and is super satisfied with the picture quality. 
5189 Excellent- I put it on my Sony night shot and can see and record 30-40 ft farther than without ity. 
5190 Very good quality, perfect fit, and superb aesthetic. Well worth the price. The supplier also sent me a complementary wrist strap of equally good quality. 
5191 The ones shipped with camera go out around 1.5 years. I have 6 cameras and have had to replace 3. Hope this lasts a little longer.... 
5192 It fits as advertised, seems to be of high quality and is made in OH. What more can I say! However, I have not crashed my Phantom 3 since I installed it, which is also a good thing. 
5193 Bought this for my daughter for a birthday present and she loves it! 
5194 I bought this for nikkon p900.. But it too small to store it.. 
5195 I could not find the cable that came with OLY OMD M1 camera and I did not want to pay OLY s price and this one seems to work perfectly. 
5196 The box was opened and the backdrop was wet and mildewed. I had to wash it when I got it. I should have returned it but I took to long. 
5197 The control board works great. Didn t need the new housing. 
5198 Could be more helpful for setting them up. No help at all from anyone.. 
5199 Works with t1i. 
5200 Nice. Keep an eye on the knob attached to the camera, it does work itself loose. 
5201 Love how you can use it with one hand. 
5202 Nice product. Good value. 
5203 Great product 
5204 Good product ! 
5205 It didn t work w any of my lighting 
5206 Great for wedding pictures. Holds lots of 4x6 pictures. 
5207 The cables were not long enough and my mouse was cracked once received, which made me have to purchase a new mouse and longer cables. Also the instructions were not very detailed and very limited. Picture quality is good. 
5208 Excellent 
5209 fits & works... what more? 
5210 Perfect replacement for a lost charger 
5211 Exceptional. Very comfortable. As described. Hand slides in, able operate camera and easy out. Secure. 
5212 Love it! It worked perfectly. One thing to be aware of, it completely overrides your camera s controls when plugged in to a remote trigger (i.e. pocket wizard), so you must unplug it to adjust exposure, focus, etc., then plug it back in. 
5213 Excellent! 
5214 Very nice point and shoot camera! Love how small it is so it can fit in my clutch! 
5215 Came in very quick. I love how everything was in it s individual packages. I have two lens, on 18-55mm and on 75-250mm, and this actually works for both! 
5216 As described. Wery good 
5217 fits perfect on my girlfriends Fuji xe2 kit lens. 
5218 Love these and easy to use. 
5219 Very nice outfit. Easy way to just jump right in and have everything you need to get your feet wet. 
5220 product was not one continuous printed sheet which would have been fine, except there is a very noticeable seam that wasn t properly aligned. Print quality is great, and the material is of good quality, but would have been a much higher rating if the workmanship was better 
5221 My daughter loves this camera. Had to replace the SD Card almost immediately, but since then it has worked for her. 
5222 I would recommend this slider. 
5223 It said right on the box it would not work on the Olympus OMD EM5 which I had purchased it for. 
5224 Does not turn on, stuck on intro screen 
5225 it s ok 
5226 The lens does a great job for us. 
5227 Never got to use them, as the Ram Twis-lock suction cup mount that we purchased to mount our GoPro camera with fell off of our Harley, on our way to Sturgis SD, over 4000 miles round trip. 
5228 I just wanted something simple but good quality - this one is perfect for me. Easy to use and great quality! 
5229 WORKS GREAT 
5230 Defective! When plugged it did not even turn on... I m returning this item. 
5231 Does what it says - great product, easy to set up. 
5232 Thx 
5233 Great camera, good deal. Very happy. 
5234 The cable didn t fit on my Olympus 1030. 
5235 arrived quickly, mounted easily, seems much better than the spotter scope which came with the telescope 
5236 Nice, works well with my camers 
5237 Worked Perfectly in my old SONY MVC-FD200. Charger even recharged the old (10 yr) Li-on battery that came with the camera. Highly Recommend. 
5238 Works perfectly. 
5239 Love it! 
5240 Great condition, works perfectly! My pictures have all come out fantastically. No complaints. 
5241 nice construction and quality better than expected for the price 
5242 Great lens!!! 
5243 Good value! 
5244 Very cool little add on, they work great, they re light durable and easy to pack around! I d say the perfect solution if don t want to get a real flash extension! 
5245 Amazing light for the money, the battery pack is pretty reliable and last as described. 
5246 Great product! 
5247 Light weight easy to use, this is my 3rd GoPro 
5248 Love it! 
5249 Love it! 
5250 Even better quality then the image depicted. Good tripod for the money. 
5251 I love it 
5252 I am very happy to get the disposable camera, because I can t find them in a store anymore...Irene 
5253 I just love it. Perfect size for my camera and great quality 
5254 these do the trick very well, they went on without any trouble J R 
5255 This camera met all of my expectations. I used the bicycle mount and recorded my bike ride. I also went swimming with it and got great footage. 
5256 My camera did not get scratched at all when I journeyed with it over seas. 
5257 It was great and better then I expected! Highly recommend it. 
5258 I received the Canon EOS Rebel T6s as promised. The Imaging World shipped it faster than I expected and it was exactly as advertised. 
5259 For the size, I really don t think that this stand can be beat. 
5260 Everything arrived on time and in clean working order. I had no issues with my photo shoot so I am very happy with my order! Thank you! 
5261 Great price, works perfect. 
5262 Couldn t have found a better deal. However, will have to return it for a Tab 4. 
5263 Very nice Camera and the technical support was outstanding by Richard with Foscam. Had some trouble adding to different devices and they completely walked me through all that was needed to get connected on 3 devices. Very fast answer rate as well. 
5264 One of the very coolest electronic items i ve worked with in ages. Priced right to be easily incorporated in any project. 
5265 not as good 
5266 Excellent batteries. 
5267 Good lens I like it fits perfectly on my 60mm fotasy lens adapter on my canon sx50 camera takes get pictures at the beach 
5268 The camera works well when the ethernet cable is plugged in but the wireless function is very hard to set up and goes offline several times a day. I don t recommend this unit so keep looking. 
5269 Love them! I have better security cameras then stores do. I can see clear and love that I can zoom in on specific areas. Feel much safer! 
5270 Not the quality I expected from Sony. Doesn t grip very firmly for an *action* camera. For my use (hiking) I much prefer the no-name camera mounts with spring clips that are much more secure. 
5271 The magnet keeps falling off :/ 
5272 Thank you :)) 
5273 Great product. I m not an over the top go pro accessory kind of person so this is great for me. It would be good for day trips so that you can leave your main go pro box at home 
5274 the lighting kit is a wonderful start would buy again would recommend to others 
5275 Nice cover piece !! 
5276 Nice fitting lens cap 
5277 Absolutely exceeded my expectations with syncing to my phone and emailing pictures directly from camera and the front LCD for easy selfies, no selfie stick needed! 
5278 Everything arrived on time, great experience. 
5279 The x100t button is quite small so this soft release really helps to make it easier to press and reduce camera shake very slightly. I love the look of it too! 
5280 This is one easy camera to use. It takes the nicest photos. It is a great camera. The shipping was spot on as well. It is very thin and fits into most pockets with ease. The only thing I would suggest is to add a screen shade on the back. 
5281 Love it! & so do all my clients! ☺️ 
5282 Great all around camera that takes nice pictures. I use it more than my Canon T3i because of its size and features. 
5283 Excellent lens.. 
5284 Good product. A+ 
5285 Received earlier than expected and works great! 
5286 Filter works as advertised. 
5287 Miniature camera holder Brooke almost immediately and battery does not charge 
5288 Exactly as advertised. I really like this product it seems durable and reliable. I definitely recommend it. 
5289 An amazing camera ! I connect it on my iphone 5 and my wife rus it on her Iphone 6! Both work really great as the description ! Easily achieving remote control and video call functions. Super image quality and clear audio. Happy purchased order 
5290 The Vixen representative gave me incorrect information about its compatibility for use on my Pentax spotting scope. It cost me shipping and insurance to obtain a full refund. 
5291 Really great value at the price! Takes E Mount lenses which I already had so it was an easy decision. I bought it as a backup camera but finding myself using it often. 
5292 Does what it says, solid connection to any Cannon D-series camera, works well with my Ralei strobonar with sync cable. 
5293 great bag for a great price. 
5294 took it out of box and tried to update firmware,now its in repair shop for 8 weeks 
5295 Color temp of the lamps are a bit low for what I had hoped for, but switching them for higher K. (more daylight spectrum) and this works well for taking stock photos for our website. 
5296 I am used to Axis cameras that cost $700 and up so I was very pleased with the quality of this unit. The night vision is way better than any of the other low end cameras I have tried 
5297 Perfect for the little camera we bought. Fits it nice. 
5298 Came in earlier than expected. My son loves it. Just wish the battery last longer. And the SD card won t go back in the camera 
5299 Does what is says. Good machining. 
5300 The product is very compact and seems to work very well. 
5301 Exactly what I was hoping for and it arrived quickly. 
5302 Takes great pictures easy to understand once you realize that the advance mode takes digital zoom and is mode for choosing reds and rest of picture black and white the advanced mode is awesome 
5303 Fantastic product! Best cleaner kit on the market. 
5304 Worked perfectly on all my batteries including the ones I thought were faulty, but the charging port on the camera was the root cause. 
5305 Fit perfectly! 
5306 Seems to be everything it says it is. Still learning, but early trials are very positive. 
5307 i love it...as expected 
5308 Perfect size! 
5309 Works great 
5310 I love tgis light. I ve had for at least two years and it still works great! Not a lot of misfires and the output is good if you are working in a small space. 
5311 Great value. 
5312 Exactly what I was looking for. I have an older Samsung l100 camera without the charger (lost or misplaced it).. This works great! Now my 6yo daughter thinks she s a photographer and loves it! 
5313 The price was perfect for what this is. 
5314 Nice camera and extras. 
5315 Great product, perfect fit for my lens, fast shipment, arriving on time. 
5316 Great! 
5317 Very week broken with the small bump first one 2 minutes 
5318 Great camera for traveling. Great picture quality and easy to use, just need to get used to it. 
5319 Awesome lights. Cheap, affordable, and quality. Excellent quality and really gives that daylight white light instead of yellow room light. FREAKING GET IT!!! NOW!! Or later, I mean it s your choice. 
5320 Guess it is fine, I just do not know how to see with it. 
5321 Good for the price this is all I need for the photos I take. Not professional. 
5322 Lemme was confusing at first had to push button on side to open lens to take pictures works great though 
5323 excellent! 
5324 sorry not much to say it only worked for a couple days,not very well built,the company was very promt. 
5325 Time clock didn t work 
5326 Works great and would buy it again 
5327 The thing works great! I wore it snowboarding and when ur head hits the ground it doesn t break of get damaged! Would recommend it for people that want to wear it during sports!! 
5328 One of the bugs had a broken leg piece (it was separated in the acrylic resin) but other than that, LOVED it and so did my little one. 
5329 Love this! I wish I d had it sooner! what a peace of mind to keep an eye on my dementia mom! 
5330 Fits perfectly. Original Nikon product. 
5331 Just what i needed, awesome camera. 
5332 It worked grate for my Kodak Z730 Camera. 
5333 These are NO good. The thread on the first set I got did not fit any of my Canon DSLRs. I was sent a replacement pair and they too did not screw into my camera. I am return them all. 
5334 It was gift 
5335 terrible 
5336 Got exactly what I ordered quickly and everything is just as I expected it. Couldn t ask for more. 
5337 Camera won t connect to phone. App won t let me sign in on tablet. They shipped a color they didn t even have as an option. Instructions had details wrong. No troubleshooting in instructions. Did I forget anything? Now I have to get my money back. 
5338 Purchased these as a gift for my dad. He says that they re nice and lightweight, with a bit more strength than his previous binoculars. 
5339 Good price and fast shipping 
5340 Got away from kit lenses and glad I did, I have alot more keepers now 
5341 Lights the model very well. The honeycomb grid directs the light very evenly. 
5342 Looked great for my Holiday photos! Good quality too. Wish it was larger size. 
5343 Protects the lensce and gives it a cool look👌 
5344 For the Price there is nothing better 
5345 Impossible to set up. Our son could not figure it out and he is a network engineer! 
5346 Did not fit phone correct as advertised. 
5347 Works as expected. I have no trouble with the fit of the plug/socket on the D610 that some report. A must have for long exposure shots. Landscape type shots with these high res cameras also benefit using a cable/remote shutter release 
5348 Doesn t work 
5349 Affordable lens for great bokeh! 
5350 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
5351 i love it 
5352 Was nicer than I expected. Also the bag itself is relatively easy to carry. 
5353 Good quality OEM product! 
5354 Awesome 
5355 decent system for a decent price. 
5356 Awsome and it was quick shipment 
5357 Was everything I expected. 
5358 It is good shape and works fine. 
5359 Simple to use, and made me feel much better about protecting the LCD on my camera. 
5360 Everything was just as expected. Thanks. 
5361 great product. 
5362 Great item. Delivered promptly and product was perfect. 
5363 Fits perfectly and inexpensive 
5364 Charger works well. Batteries have a very short life (50%) compared to original. 
5365 The price is right. Doesn t work with my Odin TTL flash trigger, but it works as advertised when it is on camera. That s what happens when you try to save money. 
5366 I bought a digital camera at the pawn shop for ten bucks not knowing if it was even going to work and as soon as the battery came I popped it in and it worked! 
5367 i think it has longer battery life than the original. 
5368 The package that i got didnt work 
5369 Love it! 
5370 As described and arrived on time. 
5371 just right 
5372 They work just as well as the OEM batteries for half the price. 
5373 Great for backup. 
5374 Love it 
5375 Did what it was supposed to. Battery charged, no issues. 
5376 wonderful and strong and reliable 
5377 Very nice kit, great price!! 
5378 fit well and stays on 
5379 Item works as expected, arrived ahead of time. I bit small for what i had in mind but it woks. 
5380 excelent product 
5381 Great little camera. Nice pics. Videos take a while to download via WiFi. Going to get a second one for my quad. 
5382 Clamp may work well enough. But I didn t get that far. The arms inside the Gopro mount adapter are too thick. When I mount the camera, the screw does not reach the nut on the opposite side. Useless to mount a Gopro. Back it goes. 
5383 This camera, thus far is superior to the DLink product which costs more. They could use a bit of work on the directions but once I got what they were asking it was a snap. 
5384 What do you expect for 25.00 dollars. 
5385 I m indifferent about this. I thought it would have a little more blowing force but it does its job. 
5386 I love the flexibility of options this shutter gives. Would highly recommend. Only complaint is, like almost everybody else has mentioned, is that is has no on/off switch and will activate easily in a bag if the batteries are left in it. 
5387 simple, easy, fun, and great for scrapbooking, or as party favors! 
5388 having the extra power on hand is crucial when you re out and about. Threw these into my backpack and went all over Mexico with plenty of space on my memory card and plenty of juice in the form of batteries. 
5389 quality...You must be kidding 
5390 I use this as my carry on for business travel. This thing is a TANK. 
5391 works great everything i expected 
5392 Impressive 
5393 Leaps and bounds better than my 50 D. I still use both cameras but the 70 D is my first choice. Light years better than my old 30D. mike 
5394 Excellent product. We use it at the range. 
5395 This item looks great and seems to be made very well. Works perfect and very easy to use. Everything was as described and works great. It fits very well to my GoPro camera. Great value for the money. I highly recommend this to everyone. 
5396 Need to return this. It never worked. Worst product I ve ever ordered off of Amazon. It turned on but would not record anything. Then was unable to turn it off. Seriously do not buy this. 
5397 Pelican is just the best...I have bought other cases, but these are the best available and worth the often small premium. I use mine for go pro and SLR gear and have no fear of water, dropping, or other calamities. 
5398 It works as I expected, sometimes the camera don t record when someone pass in front of the door. 
5399 Love how spacious is! Everything is well cushioned, which protects the equipment. 
5400 Works fine ! 
5401 I thought it would be perfect and ordered one. The product did not work and even when changing the batteries, it still did not work. I ll try another product and see if I have better luck. 
5402 Definitely not as expected, much smaller than I anticipated. I will re-order a larger one & send this back. 
5403 Nice value for money. More than enough light for all my use cases. 
5404 Started with the Foscam... Returned that for this vastly superior product. 
5405 I got exactly what I expected. Case Logic always makes good camera bags. 
5406 WOW! I love this I have made use of it for picture taking it is durable but lightweight it is very comfortable and stays in place when walking the price is great didn t know what to expect because of the price but I am very happy. 
5407 Exactly what I needed. And got it quick 
5408 Didn t give me the results I was looking for. However, that may be my lack of understanding of infrared filters. 
5409 Amazing 
5410 This is so adorable! I bought this to go with the Fugufilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Camera. I think this is a must have to go with the camera! Love everything in the box! 
5411 Took it to 10m under water and works fine. Although the battery seems having a shorter life under water, but generally fine. The image quality is just so so with the original lens. No experince on other lens. 
5412 Fits perfectly, works, one third the price of the way-overpriced Canon version. What more is there to say? Those who say it doesn t fit must be putting it on the wrong lens, this is for the 18-55 STM version. 
5413 I ordered 2 and got 1 not pleased 
5414 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
5415 The cd would not load and the instructions were not in English. I figured out mostly how to use the camera but I have not tried to print out any pictures yet. 
5416 The video quality is great and it switches to night vision gracefully. Sound quality is not so great. Even with speakers hooked up to either laptop/computer, its very hard to hear noise. The reason this is so important to me is because I use it as a baby monitor. 
5417 Perfect 
5418 This is perfect for my Lumix GX7 camera and it fits it perfectly. 
5419 Get s the job done 
5420 Fantastic lens! Clarity and quality of shots is amazing 
5421 It s so useful for product photography and portrait also macro photography , so I order it from you , thank you for arriving it so quickly 
5422 Great camera 
5423 Works great for my needs 
5424 Works automatically with my cycling computer. Just wet the sensors and strap it on. Strap is comfortable. Nothing much more to it! 
5425 I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends.good price 
5426 great bag 
5427 Works as well as any other filter set and price is reasonable. 
5428 did not fit my lens 
5429 Item broke within a week. Money wasted on something that didn t work. 
5430 Good camera 
5431 Everything was good except for one of the light blubs not working. Overall the home studio is coming along quite well with the addition these units. 
5432 Perfect for me photo needs 
5433 This slider is the perfect length! Not so long for transporting. Not that heavy either but the build quality is great! Very smooth operation. Bought the Manfrotto MVH500h Fluid head with it, works great! 
5434 It s definitely not super great in quality, but does the job in terms of capturing a wider angle as a macro lens. Definitely had fun using it, but would not use for professional grade photos! 
5435 Excellent product 
5436 Email motion alerts are crapped ! 
5437 Best mount for the Mobius action cam. 
5438 This is a cheap version of a tulip lens hood, but it did the trick as well as the overpriced ones. I d purchase it again in a heartbeat. 
5439 Would have liked the cases to be a bit more sturdy but worked as expected. 
5440 Good price, quick shipping 
5441 Great, as expected 
5442 Used this with a gopro on a recent dive trip. Six dives in total and it worked well every time. It made for some great underwater shots and selfies with the rest of the dive crew. Solid construction, lightweight and easy to adjust. 
5443 Practical bag for my Sony NX-5N and lenses 
5444 excellent graduated ND filter 
5445 Great value 
5446 its works pretty well 
5447 must have great backdrop indeed 
5448 Really enjoying the mount thus far. Very sturdy and secure. 
5449 Yeah these are awesome. There is a trick to fold them, but there are good videos online. Seller could include a link to a good video though! 
5450 Worst product I ve ever received on amazon. It doesn t work, it doesn t have any of the features that it states. Can t believe they can even sell crap like that! What a joke is right!! 
5451 Disconnects during transfers to my smart phone, got no response from Nikon as to the software they provide. Cannot maintain a connection to my Nikon D3200. Waste of money... 
5452 Great camera. Super happy with it. 
5453 Love this camera. The instant gratification of your pictures being printed instantly is fantastic 
5454 Fits my new Lumix perfectly. 
5455 I think that s what the Doctor order. 
5456 ok 
5457 Nice. 
5458 A must have for photographers. You can fix horizon lines in photoshop, but why have to with this. 
5459 The telephoto extender did not fit any of my EF Canon lenses. 
5460 William Tom was wonderful helping me in getting the camera up and running. Got on my computer and in 2 minutes I was up and running, great tech support! This Camera is fantastic so far.. 
5461 Decent filter, only thing they only have the 52mm size but no markings to identify the manometers. Would not have been that much more effort to add 690nm, 1000nm, ect... on filter. My other filter was also like that so 4 stars. 
5462 Awesome device! 
5463 As advertised. 
5464 Item works well 
5465 The camera works just fine. Gives acceptable video. 
5466 It even fools me. I catch myself going into the room to turn off the TV before I leave, only to realize it s just the fake TV doing it s thing. 
5467 No Complains on the Hood, but unfortunately, I have vignetting issues on my 10-18mm lens so if you are looking for wide angle not recommended, else its good. 
5468 A great camera kit for an even better price! Easy to use a pretty straight forward DSLR 
5469 Excellent product at a great price. 
5470 Takes great photos. However, the camera is either too small for my hands and fingers or my hands and fingers are too big for this camera. Since Amazon won t give me a bigger camera I asked God to give me smaller hands and fingers. 
5471 Very nice item!!!!!! I got it earlier than I expected, great shipping !!!!!!! 
5472 Excellent product! 
5473 love the new camera strap! I get lots of complements on the new look! Love the colors and the sizing. 
5474 After trying 4 other cameras. This one is great. Opened the package and 5 minutes later we were viewing picture on APP. 
5475 Work great, nice packing. 
5476 Very nice 
5477 It s a good bag other that it really needs a little more support in the back to keep your items from beating you up when you have it on. 
5478 For the price, the build quality could be much better. Specially the pol filter is tricky to screw on and easily can fall off. Was expecting much better quality for such a price tag. 
5479 Love it! 
5480 Great protective case while still allowing you to touch the screen through the case. It s a must have for the GoPro! 
5481 works great. arrived as promised. very good value. 
5482 works fine 
5483 I think this one is the best you can get for the money 
5484 The green part is dark. Not a true choroma green color.. Requires more light to render green screen properly... I regret buying it. 
5485 Real nice 
5486 Easy to use. Once you find out the best area you need to place the monitor its very easy and I have had no problems with using this device. I would purchase this product again. 
5487 I used this lense to rake time lapse of a sunset. The pictures are so clear abe crisp. 
5488 Excellent product at low Price and excellent comunication with the seller, the i­tem arrived before the date estimated, thanks a lot!!! full recommended. 
5489 Excellent déclencheur mutifonction je le recommande 
5490 Awesome product. I like it much better than the screw on and safety clip version. 
5491 I m not a professional photographer so I don t see the stuff they see in photos. All I know is this filter works for me & my nx2000 with no &#34;X&#34; in the picture like people claim to have. 
5492 Incredibly well made, fits perfect. Firmly holds both the camera and lens. 
5493 nice 
5494 Helps my device stay a float in water. Color is visible from far away. 
5495 Love it 
5496 it does what it says it was going to do 
5497 Works great!!! 
5498 Great deal and an excellent product 
5499 Worked great on my recent vacation. It is a bit heavy to carry on the camera around my neck but I just supported it in one hand while walking and it was fine. Wish I would have bought this one years ago! 
5500 very good quality 
5501 Worked great! I used it with my iPhone and Camera, pictures came out great! Bluetooth worked great on this as well. 
5502 Good. 
5503 The more I use it the more I like it. For the price it s great, but the software could use some refining. 
5504 very sweet grip 
5505 very good 
5506 Bought as a replacement for an older set wanted better glass than I had. These are very clear and lightweight. I will be taking them on my next hunting trip. 
5507 Works great 
5508 This case for moving your Slik tripod around is very well engineered and made. I am glad I purchased it with the tripod. 
5509 Terrific camera. Very compact very easy to carry 
5510 Fast and perfect fit! Highly recommend this company. I was worried about a lens cap which wasn t Canon made but Canon s were so expensive...these fit well and have attaching chords....Delivery time was before I could lose my last lens cap! Thanks! 
5511 These work perfectly, small and cheap enough for one in every camera bag. Batteries are easy yo find and last a very long time. 
5512 defective would not work at all 
5513 European 
5514 Love this little thing, but make sure the gopro is showing or else it might look like somthing a bit weird. Works Perfectly and is fun to use! 
5515 I ve used this product over the last year while skiing in Colorado, underwater in Mexico and everywhere in between. Works like a charm, never had a problem with use or durability. 
5516 Great strap!! Got this for my dad as a gift and it works amazingly! 
5517 Quick delivery, item just as described. 
5518 Not sure of the battery s charge life yet, but so far the battery works great in my camera. 
5519 Too heavy for a phone, and the quality of the picture comes out too distorted on the edges. The quality of the alleged &#34;Professional HD&#34; camera lens needs serious improvement. I love wide lens, but this one is a big disappointment. 
5520 Love it. The ball joint is my favorite feature. Love the construction, feels well built but super light-weight. Quickmount is a bit tough to get on and off. 
5521 Good 
5522 Working like a champ! 
5523 Works Like the Nikon Battery. Camera Shows the Information about the state of the battery. So Far NO Problems. 
5524 These are great lens cleaning cloths. I bought extra so that I could keep some in each backpack and my travel case. They also make great presents for all your friends that shoot Canon 
5525 This camera is junk, I could never get it too work. If you re looking I would definitely pass on this one. 
5526 Good thanks 
5527 Doesn t work with Sigma DP1s 
5528 did not work as expected. returned 
5529 The system works great. The DVR was easy to hook up and installion of the cameras was a breeze. 
5530 Great Product for the Price. I ordered a backup since the price was reasonable. 
5531 Great case for what I needed 
5532 Good product. Nice to take it. Confortable. 
5533 Great little camera for snorkeling. Has a nice secure lock on the battery cover and takes great underwater photos at shallow depths. 
5534 Works just as well or better than the original Canon battery. Using in Canon G3 X camera. 
5535 Brilliant. Just with turning on the two modules are connected within seconds. It works perfectly and the scope (complies with what the manufacturer says) is more than enough for the task for which I need it. Always carry spare batteries just in case. 
5536 photo instructions are NO value. There is no visible way to connect the wires to the power terminals. 
5537 It arrive quickly and was exactly as described in listing. 
5538 it s alright 
5539 Working just fine with my GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition. 
5540 Loved it. Exactly what I needed. Thanks 
5541 Brilliant quality, used underwater and it floated perfectly, even with the weight of the GoPro. Loved the design, would definitely recommend. 
5542 wish the remote came with a cord. The tripod is a lil flimsy but it s a quick fix 
5543 as expected, but it has 9 leg clamps to go full extension. 
5544 Great product, easy to install 
5545 These portfolios are ideal for things you care about. I ve been pleased with everyone that I have purchased. They will hold a lot of material in a minimum of space. 
5546 Excelente 
5547 It s okay. Lots of good information, but I still find myself googling and youtubing things to find out more simplified versions of this information. I ll keep it, but it s still a bit above my beginner s level. 
5548 It only lasted a few months and it no longer holds a charge. The original battery that came with my camera is still going strong after three years. Over $36.00 and I had to throw it away. 
5549 The lens stopped working in a year. 
5550 the reason this is not a 5 Star is that the clip does not rotate.. so it s only adjustable in one direction. For the price I paid, I really expected more flexibility. otherwise, it s a great product and seems to be something that will stand up to use. 
5551 Great Charger, very compact and for a great price! 
5552 Good quality photos! 
5553 Great deal for this!, shipping fast and product works awesome now I have 3 batteries all the time ready to go in my Go Pro. 
5554 Love it works really good 
5555 Try this. Wrap the clip with masking tape or some soft tape. Mount the GoPro camera on and bite the mount. Film from mouth level and use the remote to take pics. Helpful? 
5556 Great service, I got exactly what I asked for. 
5557 Good quality 
5558 camera is awesome great point and shoot! 
5559 Great price for this timer. I used with my Canon 7D to create a time lapse video of a remodeling project in my home. It s easy to use, has an on-off switch, and uses standard batteries. I highly recommend it and would buy it again. 
5560 Not what I was expected, to cheap. 
5561 The best! 
5562 I have 2 of these units they are great for the money im also thinking of getting another one for my winter home in florida. 
5563 Very pleased with product and service 
5564 The product itself is good but I do not receive the rubber pad neither the top rubber cover 
5565 Works (and looks) just like the Nikon original HB-69 lens hood for a fraction of the price. People that have issues mounting the hood (too loose....?!?!?) need to turn it just a tad further until it clicks securely into place. No complaints at this price!!! 
5566 Arrived quickly works fine 
5567 I used this a lot 
5568 My purchase was for a replacement, lost the charger. This charger and the batteries are excellent. The service time was short, I am happy. Thank you 
5569 Haven t used it yet bought it to replace one I broke that belonged to someone else. The one I broke has problem fitting in the holder and s tr staying steady. 
5570 Gives connection error after a few clicks.. 
5571 Great product. Prompt delivery. 
5572 Awesome investment ! Great quality for a low price ! 
5573 It filled up with water and sunk the first time I used it. 
5574 Work great so far. I love not having to worry about the lens cap. 
5575 The unique filter. Excellent effect. The criteria are different, but I liked it very much. I suppose that it gives a different effect on different lenses. 
5576 great 
5577 [[VIDEOID:32726b0daee64c9d77072690c0baf647]]Unfortunately just a few days outside the one month return window the camera broke. The record button no longer works. Since I cannot return it I took it apart and the button is stuck in its housing so it is not fixable. 
5578 THIS THING DOESNT COME WITH THE REQUIRED 12V POWER ADAPTER!!!!!! I don t know how well it works yet. Gotta buy a power source...... lame 
5579 Excellent 
5580 Works great with my Hero Three! Holds a charge longer than the original battery and charge time is pretty quick. Great deal for the price! 
5581 Good quality. Seems solid. I like the ability to unsnap and resnap it from the camera quickly rather than having to fully remove the tether. It floats a Olympus Tough TG-4. 
5582 Unhappy with stiffness 
5583 Everything arrived on time and in great condition. The bag straps, however, are starting to fall apart, so will have to buy a new bag very soon. I strongly recommend persons buying this to have a backup bag as well. 
5584 good quality 
5585 as advertised... delivered on time... no disappointing surprises... will consider the company s products first if they offer what I need... THANKS, J 
5586 Size was perfect for my Sony Alpha a5000. It is thicker than expected compared to ones I have purchased for other devices. Instructions are a little lacking which could prove to be a problem for anyone lacking experience installing this types of screen protectors. 
5587 This worked perfectly for my camera and I got it really fast!! I was hesitant to buy this one because it was so much cheaper than the others, but I got it anyway and it works perfectly!! Very happy with my purchase! 
5588 Thanks. Bluetooth doesnt work but i loved everything else 
5589 Good product, nice quality. Compatible with Logitech C920 
5590 Not having an ON/OFF switch and having to take out the batteries is only negative feedback I can provide. Everything else is as advertised. Extremely happy with purchase. 
5591 Works great 
5592 good quality 
5593 Batteries hold charge and i can use the battery charger in my car..love it 
5594 Love my camera back pack and how it can hold soo much. I now have a larger laptop but still pack this bag for long trips so I will still have it. 
5595 Great price but the rubber eyecup pulled loose from the plastic frame and had to be glued before I attached it to my camera. 
5596 We have been using these for only a few months now and already one of the two we bought is dead, will not hold a charge. UGH! 
5597 This was a great purchase - but 8 months later, it s completely stopped working. 
5598 Great package and price, fast service and works very well. 
5599 I ve been using Lithium batteries in place of alkaline for many devices--especially those that I tend to overlook for long periods of time. Time may prove different, but I ve yet to have a leakage problem with these. 
5600 Do what they need to do, great little piece of equipment. 
5601 Just received these so have not had enough time to compare with other, similar, cloths. However, the quality appears to be excellent and they are more than large enough to handle almost any cleaning requirement. 
5602 Works just like it is supposed to. Does not come with detailed instructions for recording/motion detector settings but works well. 
5603 Good all around! 
5604 Great price for what u get! 
5605 A lot of quality equipment for the price! 
5606 Works as advertised. No problems nor issues. 
5607 loved therm 
5608 Works Great!! 
5609 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
5610 It did not work, I had to return it and get my money back. 
5611 Thanks! My cam is working again! 
5612 Works well. 
5613 Didn t fit at all on my Camileo X100 video camera. Difficult to find the right cap for that. Universal means it should fit, right? 
5614 Some of the parts are useful , most I found won t fit the camera,poor engineering I believe, stick with the go pro accessories! The case as far as I can see was not made to hold the camera securely and not well thought out. 
5615 These frames are cheap plastic and they do NOT work! I ve been trying to get the company to take them back and give me a refund, to no avail! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! COMPLETE RIP OFF! And lousy customer service. 
5616 Everything I expected... 
5617 Just what I needed and at a great value. 
5618 The Macro lens is pretty amazing. The fish eye isn t as good. 
5619 Works great with my S3000, recharges and downloads. 
5620 This lens is absolutely amazing. I use it primary for family photos, cooking images and video interviews. It brings out vibrant colors, textures and depth of field that I ve never been able to achieve before. It s worth every penny! 
5621 There was no audio coming from the camera. 
5622 My first security cameras, easy to install and simple to use. Only wish I could zoom in and out. 
5623 Yes. It was just what I was looking for to replace my very old one which was broken. In fact, the new Spinning Photo Cube is far better than the old one I had to replace. Thank you, Amazon! 
5624 great 
5625 Loved everything in this pack, all fun goodies to go with my camera. It came on time and in excellent condition! 
5626 My daughter loved the film itself. She s a pretty big Disney fan. The pictures are so cutE 
5627 more than pleased ... great. exactly as advertized ... super easy setup 
5628 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
5629 JUST WHAT I WANTED 
5630 No comments 
5631 Excellent 
5632 Worked great! 
5633 Cannot recommend. Shoe would not even fit in my Nikon. 
5634 Did not charge my camera :( 
5635 Very practical to have on hand. 
5636 Fits perfectly and matches the textured finish on the lens. Don t be alarmed by the tiny gap as any light entering from the side is not going to affect your image. 
5637 This seems to work just fine, as well as the factory brand, for a lot less money. Recommended. 
5638 Great camera! Love that it is light weight and takes great pictures! Received on time and in great condition! 
5639 East setup and installation, Excellent color and clarity. 
5640 received in time 
5641 pleased 
5642 Very fast shipping! Exactly what I needed 
5643 took a while to get here, but thats ok 
5644 I use this camera whenever I shoot landscapes and it has never failed me. It s quite durable and the images it produces are razor sharp. 
5645 Very pleased with the camera so far. 
5646 It is sturdy and built well. Relatively light weight. I have no complaints really. 
5647 Good 
5648 Seems to work fine although it is a bit bulky for what it actually does.... 
5649 priced great, car plugin is great. 
5650 Just what I needed. Promptly shipped. Good price. 
5651 Less than 80 degree tilt what in the world would you use this for? Staring at the ground? 
5652 Thank you for the case the product looks and feel amazing 
5653 Thumps up for you 
5654 excellent, very nice company to deal with. 
5655 I like the FloatPro! It s easier to put on and more comfortable than the chest strap I have. I also positions the camera higher and that helps avoid frequent views of my paddleboard paddle. 
5656 HI I BUY OTHER LENS THEN I TAKE PICTURE THE PICTURE IS STILL BLUR THE CAMERA NOT FOCUS GOOD WHAT CAN I DO NOW THE CAMERA STILL GUARANTY CAN I RETURN THE CAMERA 
5657 This camera is loaded with more features than I have mastered yet. It takes excellent pictures, even in low light. I bought a factory reconditioned one so i added a 2 warranty as a precaution. 
5658 Was okay for the price, you can get more shots of film for less if you really do your research. 
5659 Great product with super fast shipping. 
5660 I got this case for my Raspberry Red camera and the colors don t match. The case is darker than the camera. I think this is a great protective case, the only problem is that the camera is hard to take out sometimes but overall this is great 
5661 Cheap, but you get what you pay 
5662 Nice quality bag, stylish and perfect way to store and carry your camera while on the go. 
5663 Great deal! Thank you! Love the kit. 
5664 My camera did not fit on the tripod and it was a Instax camera! 
5665 Fits great! Would buy from this seller again :) 
5666 The case is fine but it did not protect my camera lens when the bag got dropped. Now that I had to purchase a new lens, I am also purchasing a more protective case. 
5667 These are awesome mounts, I have one on my bike helmet and one on my kayak helmet. Look out YouTube the next sports sensation is on his way. HA! 
5668 Very disappointing 
5669 Lever broke almost instantly making it unusable. Flimsy construction. Total waste of money. 
5670 Nice backup for my original battery. A charge lasts well. 
5671 Exactly what I wanted, without the added cost. Fits my Canon lens perfectly. 
5672 It is really easy to control and the battery life is impressive. 
5673 Great value. 
5674 It will fit the a7rii, but you will have to fit it upside down. The borders are thinner on the left side. Right side-up and it will cover a very small part of the screen. Otherwise, the size of the entire screen protector is the correct dimensions. 
5675 Using it in Costa Rica right now! Great purchase to protect my investment. 
5676 Good cap wrong size. 
5677 works perfectly 
5678 awful. don t buy it. 
5679 Great mini quad. You will not be disappointed for the price. Have fun and fly safe. 
5680 The product is great and very versatile, but the zippers are low quality. The stitching at the ends does not prevent you from pulling the zipper all the way off of the end. (this happened to me on one side) 
5681 This case is amazing. I bring my drone on the plane when I travel about once a month. This is a solid case that fits all of my accessories and looks great. The handle and wheels are great and it is easy to move while traveling. 
5682 I love it It is great 😁👍👌 
5683 I had a soft box just sitting around because it wouldn t fit any of my lights. This universal ring allowed me to finally put it to use , and surprising works even better than the standard rings with other lights. 
5684 Much better than the original one i had, it s super bright, superb CRI, wonderful size, just wish there was a soft box included or as an option 
5685 Great Camera and with everything that comes with the bundle a great bang for ya buck....Camera takes great pic s even for an amateur like me 
5686 It provides the best exposure. I don t have to perform any white balance correction on my images. 
5687 Shipped on time. Works ok 
5688 Great camera 
5689 Very smooth fluid head. only issue is when you are panning left or right the base seems to click or pop like it isn t lubricated well enough. That s the reason for the four stars. 
5690 Did seem to be able to hold a charge as long as OEM GoPro batteries. Typically would get 45-50 minutes out of goPro battery compared to 30-40 minutes with these on my Hero 3 Blk 
5691 protects my camera holds accessories 
5692 after two months my video on my smart phone is connecting to someone else s camera I don t know where in the world! App crashes every single time 
5693 I shoot at times with five flashes. A lot to keep track of but it will do several more. Works every time except when I made a mistake. OOPS 
5694 This GoPro is as barebones as you can get, you will eventually need to upgrade though as I did since you can t record quality audio with this. It is just a regular point and shoot GoPro 
5695 better than what i thought. 
5696 Nice nocs. Nothing spectacular but they are great for the price. I have had no complaints with these. 
5697 excellent 
5698 Versatile, you can use the shoulder strap or place it on your hip. 
5699 Excellent product. I would order again thank you 
5700 [[VIDEOID:6b380c4d9dc4ade4c4475b347444e5c8]]This is an amazing camera. Small looks expensive and works great the best I have found in amazon. SJ4000 Sports Cam Best GoPro Alternative! Here is my driving test https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aMd1XBk9zpo 
5701 Bought it for my husband. He loves this camera. Very easy for people who are not technology smart to learn. 
5702 Using this for cave photography/video very pleased with the results. 
5703 As advertised 
5704 every thing that I hoped it would be and more 
5705 Works well. No issues so far. 
5706 Than I imagined to be small, but the price is very good! 
5707 Worked once for me, doesn t stick on the dashboard, it dropped my camera not too happy about that but it s very disappointing cause I really wanted one guess I will have to just do without. 
5708 Great Product 
5709 The build quality is good, but I found that I had to really torque the knobs to hold the camera. That said, it met my needs for a stable mount for my camera. 
5710 The bag didn t even come close to holding the camera. Very disappointed. 
5711 It was perfect. I use it as a screen for my phone camera with my drone. 
5712 amazing heavy stand, holds my Kupo baby boom rock solid 
5713 This camera is amazing!! It s so adorable, perfect for the hello kitty lover in your family. Take some getting used to with the different settings but easy to follow. I would highly recommend. 
5714 very heavy and cant take off the head 
5715 Great price 
5716 Works as advertised. Perfect fit to my scope. 
5717 The time stamp wouldn t deactivate when I chose &#34;no date.&#34; Everything else was great, but I don t want a time/date stamp on all my videos, so I sent it back. 
5718 It was good while it lasted but it stopped working 2 months and so, now it was a complete waste of money. 
5719 Super cute shinny film. Perfect for a young girl or for a birthday party. Fast delivery 
5720 great product 
5721 Runs great. Install was relatively easy. Nice green light. 
5722 seemed like it was going to be a little bigger than I expected but still cute and pictures come out very clear loved it 
5723 The quality of the camera isn t the best but it s fun to use and it works great! 
5724 Works perfectly. Modified it to add an autoguiding port using shoestringastronomy.com s GPUSB and instructions! Allowed me to turn my Celestron CG-4 mount into an autoguiding mount for astrophotography. 
5725 This is a great camera! 
5726 Excellent product and service 
5727 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
5728 Product delivered as described and pictures. It was a nice surprise to see felt cases provided with each lense. 
5729 Good 
5730 The product does a great job but very difficult to setup. I would suggest the plug and play do you don t have to play with the router setting. Does not work with the app as I have to go through IP 
5731 very good material 
5732 Much easier to set up wirelessly than previous camera I had. MyDlink gives great connection to device. 
5733 Great value. I use my GoPros on my motorcycles and the lenses get chipped easily. I needed to replace the lenses and these were great fit perfect. 
5734 its so great to have extra batteries for the Go Pro, especially when you don t have the time or place to charge! 
5735 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
5736 good 
5737 Study design and bundle to have. I don t have to worry anymore about adapters. 
5738 Best thing I ve bought in a while! I love thus camera! 
5739 great just need to be build a little better 
5740 Perfect! Works with camera and charger as well as the original battery. 
5741 It s pricey, but it works well. I got it so I wouldn t have to worry about losing the lens cap. 
5742 Good value 
5743 Great shipping product wasn t that great. 
5744 Perfect! I would like to purchase from Goja again if I need other related products. 
5745 This case is a great size and holds a few extras like batteries and cables. 
5746 What s really to say about micro fiber cloths? Excellent quality, cheap and useful! 
5747 Great battery. I was the second photographer for a wedding with a 5d mark ii. I took close 1,000 shots and this wasn t even half dead yet. I m glad I found these batteries and was able to pick up plenty of backups for a great price. Highly Recommend. 
5748 GREAT! Great price, service & product 
5749 Very nice and useful product! Used along with Mogopod, they are a great pair, and make great videos. 
5750 charger works well 
5751 What a wonderful product. The cloth is beautiful, and so soft. The picture is beautiful and perfect. 
5752 Great Product 
5753 Would not work with my camera/lens. 
5754 Surprisingly works better than expected. It works as expected. Was a little tight when initially closing while latched to the camera but I like that. In my head it seems as if it s just a tighter latch 
5755 I love everything about this bag except the fabric. There is more than enough room for my camera and necessary purse items. I love the pocket for a water bottle. The removable camera bag is excellent. I would just like a different fabric. 
5756 Best aftermarket batteries I have found as replacements for the Sony NP-FM500H 
5757 Love the hero 4 
5758 Was delivered quickly and received all the items in one shipment which was very nice. 
5759 Awesome 
5760 Pretty much disappointed in bebop drone 
5761 1000 down the drain. 
5762 While not a disaster, it s nothing sensational. Basically, the 3 stars is the middle of the ratings and this set is pretty much middle of the pack for digital backgrounds. Draped Muslin is probably the worst collection in the batch. 
5763 works great 
5764 The lamp and light is great... just be careful when installing the batteries. As you remove the battery cover and replace it, it is VERY EASY to break two of the prongs that hold the cover onto the base of the light. 
5765 Worked great out of the box. Although I must admit the software works much better with Windows than with Apple. 
5766 Unusable. Plastic flexes rather than grips. 
5767 It s a good option for indoor moments 
5768 Amazing bundle. This is the best bundle I have seen on Amazon and I look forward to purchasing another one for sure. :) 
5769 Great Bag.!! for my canon 6D with 24-106 lens and laptop 
5770 This case is everything I needed and wanted. 
5771 Is a very good camera, considering the good price. Is as well as a gopro but cheaper 
5772 Great deal! Very durable! I m really enjoying this convenient way of carrying my lenses and camera! 
5773 Sharp lens. Would like to have a few more markings on the lens and controls. 
5774 Duds...batteries don t fully charge 
5775 Excellent transaction and you could not tell that camera had been reconditioned. Love the red color and easy to spot the camera. Works fine and happy to have it. Would buy more items from this vendor. 
5776 excelent , no problem 
5777 Does the job. Just remember to select the correct range. 
5778 Excellent Product. Charges Fast. Reliable. 
5779 Excellent mini-tripod base for using while Periscoping. Very good balance for my iPhone 6. 
5780 The I have had this camera for exactly 47 days and the lens is already making a weird &#34;zipper noise&#34; whenever the lens extends. Not only is this affecting my audio, but I fear the problem is only going to get worse.. 
5781 Excellent information and presented in a useful way. Thanks 
5782 Fun camera. Very easy to use. The ability to change the focus point after the photo was been snapped is awesome. The lens cap is easy to lose though. 
5783 great case fits all my accessories with gopro 
5784 Just what i was looking for! At The right price! 
5785 It was a gift to my boyfriend!! 
5786 Good product! Great price. 
5787 I use both of these with my Canon water/shock proof camera. One will keep it afloat, but I like the extra security of having 2. Attached both to the mounting loop and I can just let the camera float in the water safely. They do not soak up water. 
5788 It was amazing to wear it in a 31km trail race in Switzerland with the Chest mount harness and didn t even notice it. Even took it sideways during some of the cliffs to shoot them while running. 4 1/2 hours and not one issue even during the rain............Love it! 
5789 certainly love this lens! 
5790 I like them 
5791 So happy that everything I ve tried in my purchase so far has worked and is of good quality. Great deal! 
5792 This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it. 
5793 Purchased for shooting H.S. Volleyball action. Just what I was looking for. 
5794 Too small to be functional/useful. Camera fits, but nothing else. 
5795 Scratches kind of easily so it does get hard to see the actual screen. However that said, it is clearly doing its job by protecting the main screen. 
5796 I like it, it is what it says it is. However, it s a little fragile, so handle with care. 
5797 I could not see any improvement from normal phone lens. 
5798 It works great and looks great. The screws are very low quality, i would use your own screws if attaching to wood. 
5799 great deal. exactly as expected! 
5800 Great attachment to have 
5801 I love it and recommend this product to everyone. Thank you. 
5802 Very well, including underwater, except that there is no lens cover 
5803 Maximum allowable size, heavy duty rolling suitcase for your gear. It was super helpful on my last overseas trip. I was confident it would fit carry on baggage limits, confident it would protect my gear, and it was really convenient rolling out the plane and in the terminal etcetera. 
5804 Awesome product!! 
5805 Super easy to set up. Great picture. THE FUTURE IS NOW! 
5806 Not beginner friendly at all. I ve been trying to balance it for almost 4 hours now, didn t work at all. Still trying, looked at the CD, every tutorial on youtube. I find it impossible 
5807 great camera, no issues 
5808 Came off and left a permanent residue on my screen. 
5809 Love that it connects to my DLNA media sever but keeps loosing connection with it. Trying to figure out how to keep it more consistent. Picture quality is fantastic and love the functionality. 
5810 Couldn t get it to work properly. Would up in the trash with my old one. 
5811 Works as advertised. 
5812 Excelente 
5813 works great cant beat the price 
5814 thank you 
5815 I am glad that it came with two. After a couple hours of use. The string that loops around your waterproof camera began to fry, deeming it useless if you lose your camera anyways. I would recommend purchasing a better quality floatation device for your camera/what have you. 
5816 Great tool for price. It would be a plus if timer had on/off switch. 
5817 cannon lens works great. 
5818 It doesn t prevent from shaking and swinging while walking and filming. 
5819 Very handy and works ! 
5820 Nice clear picture. Easy install with longest time taken to route cable. 
5821 great entry telephoto lens 
5822 nice case. could use a little more pocket room for extra cords 
5823 it did not work well it only work for 15 mini and that is all 
5824 It broke the first time I used it. 
5825 Really good mic! I m very impressed 
5826 Great buy on these. Decided to get extra batteries and charger for my Ghostpro camera. 
5827 Good product, prompt delivery 
5828 Works great, worth more than what I paid for it. 
5829 Well made, feels like a tank. Perfect flash for me. 
5830 100% advisable 
5831 The best! 
5832 Excellent 
5833 Great product it is my first stabilizer, its all about practice. 
5834 If you need an extra battery for your Canon Vixia hf 500r. Order this. 
5835 Very happy with the replacement. Only issue I ve had is if you don t dry it properly after submersion, the non-aluminum metal clip will start to rust. 
5836 Awesome! 
5837 ok 
5838 Nice build quality. It can charge larger battery too. 
5839 Was sent quickly hover charger was not correct model. Both batteries were correct howe ve charger did not fit these batteries. 
5840 Nicer charger than the one originally supplied with my Fuji X100T. Batteries hold a charge nicely & perhaps as long or longer than the original Fuji battery. I d recommend this brand to anyone looking for a replacement. 
5841 Beware! This third party Seller does DOES NOT ALLOW ANY RETURNS!!! Make sure this cable is compatible with your particular camera - is works with only select Canon digital cameras. 
5842 I LOVE IT CANT WAIT TO REALLY GET STARTED ON TAKES SOME MORE PICS 
5843 This is a trippy little thing- Gonna take some learning to master but it is well made and works well. A poor man s steadicam! When you get this take some time to learn it and you will be happy! 
5844 ive had this accessory pack for over a month and still continuing to find things that I can use my gopro for! 
5845 Very good camara 
5846 I love it! The pictures of Winnie the Pooh and tiger and eeyore are so adorable! Buying again! 
5847 Perfect! Keeps my camera afloat! 
5848 Used for FPV quad racing. Image quality for FPV is poor. Onboard recording is really good quality but that doesn t translate to good picture quality over a wireless FPV link. Do yourself a favor and use the RunCam 600TVL as our FPV camera. HUGE difference! 
5849 Very good lens at a reasonable price. 
5850 I bought 2 batteries and one did not perform like it was supposed to. I contacted the seller and they sent me 2 more batteries. I am happy! 
5851 Excellent for low light street photos. 
5852 Great product for my iPhone 6 plus! 
5853 Does the job. The fit is a bit tight, as other people have noted, but not too much. All my lenses have managed to get in and out of it ok. 
5854 Simple to install and does what it is supposed to. 
5855 The camera arrived really fast and I am really exited. Ran to my house and took some pictures with it and the photos are AMAZING. Thanks for the amazing service, fast shipping and an amazing camera!! 
5856 WOW! Both my husband and I wear glasses. I have been looking FOREVER to find a product which cleans glasses without leaving the glasses in worse condition with smudges, prisms, and streaks. I have FINALLY found that product. Amazing! 
5857 Couldn t wait to get this and I was pleased! Everything I expected. 
5858 Makes carrying the camera around so much easier. 
5859 This Casio EX -FC150 is everthing that was advertised. From the slow motion which was the main reason why I got it to the snapshot still camera feature. 
5860 It s a good product for biggner who just started but I think there are much better ones to use. 
5861 Great camera with an easy to use interface. Only problem is that it doesn t come with an SD/memory card. 
5862 Excellent desicion. 
5863 Cameras finally arrived and were as advertised 
5864 Instructions easy to follow. Straight forward to set up internet connection. Only drawback - camera s are outdoor rated, but the power supply transformer requires 120 volt AC is indoor rated. 
5865 Awesome!. Bought for photography business -works great with cannon Mark 5Diii JaneB 
5866 no problems at all, easiest to set up, and I have set up other brands, excellent amount of components. enough for most homes, the extra siren was a real surprise 5 star rating for sure 
5867 Gerat lens, sharp. Weird how tight the focusing barrel is. Had read about it but in practicality is not very good. I only got rid of the lens because I found a Sony 10-18mm for a good deal. 
5868 fast delivery service, arrived just as expected! 
5869 like 
5870 This cable works perfectly and is rugged enough to last a while, very similar to actual Nikon cable. 
5871 Looks slightly cheap, but if placed high enough, no one can tell. 
5872 awesome camera, works great, great price and got it fast 
5873 Very nice camera 
5874 Love the camera! It is small enough to fit in my purse or beach bag, but takes great pictures. 
5875 I hate to scratch the lcd display on my camera - attaching this gives me peace of mind and I can keep my camera in a pocket so it is handy. It is cheap insurance to protect the display - easy to install and easy to change if required. 
5876 Camera did not make clear pictures and did not satisfy me. Very blurry images and wasted very expensive film on this. very disappointed in my purchase. 
5877 these are amazing! no need to bring along bulky lighting systems with you... you don t even need a flash on your camera!! harness the natural light of the sun! 
5878 Perfect, have a couple of these 
5879 My twin granddaughters are getting for their birthday and are thrilled. 
5880 The software is a little buggy (the notification checkmark doesn t appear to ever be really clear about what state it s in, and sometimes the video just won t load), but the hardware is excellent and very discrete. 
5881 Works Great, I m very happy with it! 
5882 Wobbly. Great for stationary video. Terrible for anything in on the go. The clamp is fine, but the swivel mechanism wobbles. 
5883 Awesome mount for my ATV 
5884 Does not work 
5885 When you buy Sony you don t have to worry. 
5886 fit for my Fuji X100S camera 
5887 I just got this camera and it s awesome. Remember to buy the memory card separate though. It looks, feel and handles perfectly. Worth every darn penny 
5888 Works great. no problems so far. 
5889 I am very happy with the whole package. I am impressed with the Nikon camera, since I ve only owned Canon. All the accessories were a huge bonus. The price was exceptional for all that I got. 
5890 I love these the only thing I can complain about is the price but that s not Amazon s fault they are expensive everywhere you go. 
5891 Great light for video And for the price you can t go wrong 😉 
5892 Great camera. Easy to use and it takes great pictures. 
5893 great buy 
5894 These work great and for the price you can t go wrong. truthfully I never thought they d work considering the price difference between this and a pocket wizard, and yes the wizard is nicer and was more features, these things work and work really well. 
5895 Excellent quality of vidieos and pictures. Very good resource when at work and recreational use. 
5896 ok 
5897 Nice edition to a golf cart. 
5898 could not find any better product than this one. It s really great and accurate would recommend anyone to buy this especially for the wonderful price dead cheap and very good quality materials. 
5899 Excellent product! Extremely satisfied! 
5900 great deal and service 
5901 Best float strap for any camera. I use it for my gopro with a go poll attached and it still floats 
5902 Great camera we love it! 
5903 Very good Superb quality lens for 300 focal length ! 
5904 Awesome 
5905 Perfect size. 
5906 Very nice camera, easy to use and to handle, very user friendly, comfortable and cute. 
5907 Great product! 
5908 I have had this charger for over 3 years. It has always worked well, plugs into any slot. I take it with me when I go on vacation or when I know my battery needs a little juice. 
5909 Doesn t look like the photo at all, came in a reddish color and the flap was completely flat without a circular indent for the lens like the picture shows. It s an OK case, just not what I expected or wanted 
5910 perfect replacement 
5911 Works as advertised. However wished they were not so flimisy. However they work if the glue sticky parts stay to the lens cap 
5912 Great product. Screw in easily and the rubber o-ring is great. You don t have to crank down as hard on the gopro to lock in desired angle. Also the screw threads in on first try. Great purchase 
5913 These offer a great alternative to the plan white background film. They are bright and fun. I would recommend getting these as I believe they are the same price as the white background. Just a way to add some color and pop to your pictures. 
5914 Love this strap 
5915 Awesome product. 
5916 excellent product, arrived on time, works great so far. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
5917 Saved by Ortho Litho film! 
5918 Product is good but i wish it had come with some camera tips video for newbies 
5919 I have owned this for less than a month and have discovered that it it used and only charges on one terminal i bought a duel charger which is not duel 
5920 I thought it would be a great gift for myself but find that it gets extremely hot. Battery life is less that a hour. I get great video at 4k but anything above is halting. I hope that they fix the heat problem and short battery life. 
5921 Gave it a one star because when I received it, it didn t work, if only it had a return address maybe I would give it a higher rating. 
5922 excellent product for and excellent price! 
5923 I use this whenever I use my underwater camera. I tested it in calm water first and it floated just fine. It s never slipped off so it hasn t been tested in the wild but I have no doubt it would work OK if it did. 
5924 Got every thing advertised in excellent codition 
5925 Good!! I love it so much!! 
5926 Got this for my birthday from my wife to upgrade the dinky factory bag that came with my camera bundle. I really like the amount of room this pack has and easy access for all of your go to accessories. 
5927 Great filter and works as described! 
5928 Works very well. 
5929 Great alternative to the camera strap. Only down side is it came with no instructions. Easy fix with youtube. 
5930 works great 
5931 Loved them 
5932 Worked great. 
5933 The quality is beyond poor…and there are Chinese characters on the back of the paper frame, the color is terrible as well. I threw them all. 
5934 You have to switch mounts everytime you use a phone or a gopro. Very time consuming. 
5935 Very comfortable 
5936 Great price 
5937 These are pretty nice but I have already lost one due to, I think, they are made flexible and not have a firm mounting. 
5938 Delivered on time and very happy with the product. 
5939 I don t like how the case has an embroidery of the name &#34;Katia&#34; on the side. 
5940 Great camera, takes very nice pictures. Love how its so portable. 
5941 Great cable does what it is supposed to at a great price. 
5942 A bit overpriced but well designed, and I use it constantly. 
5943 Worked perfectly. Exactly like the original. 
5944 These just run out of juice too fast!! Only last a couple of days!! 
5945 OUTSTANDING camera and a great buy! I highly recommend it!!! 
5946 Great product...as advertised. 
5947 Felt flimsy. Plastic, light weight. On/Off button sticks. Sent it back. 
5948 The image quality is great and it was easy to set up. Very easy to use too. My only complaint is the sound quality. We use it with our iphones and it sounds like you are talking through a tin can. Doesn t bother me enough to return it. 
5949 This product is great! Customer support is great! We had a problem with the wrist band, it broke, we sent an email with pic and they sent us a new pole immediately! Thank you! 
5950 everything I was expecting and more. I have had a great time taking pictures of old homes and wildlife 
5951 Good and nice for my camera 
5952 My wife absolutely loves these lens! She is extremely happy with this product. 
5953 Works great. 
5954 works well, only lost about a half stop of light using if. using it. Did not loose any image quality with this filter. 
5955 Memory card and filters and bag useful, the tripod cheap crap 
5956 The pack is kind of heavy, but that is to be expected for 23000 mAh. It works well and charges my Surface Pro 3 and Tab 4 with power to spare. 
5957 Great addition to my GoPro accessories 
5958 Works well as long as you re not in cold weather. 
5959 Works great 
5960 Very nice travel case! 
5961 Works good on LG G4. Even bought the huge Love Mei heavy duty case and it just opened up far enough to fit. 
5962 The product is really very portable and convenient, very helpful to my work. 
5963 Broke after one year. 
5964 Ordered several of these for officers at the police department. They work great, good size to keep with you, and take good pictures. Overall, it s a good little camera for the money and serves the purpose well. 
5965 The mounts are good but the screws that come with it are weak (two sheared in half). So my advice is to buy better screws separately. 
5966 Did not work at all. 
5967 High quality piece! 
5968 Quality image fair 
5969 Thanks I m enjoying my filters 
5970 Quite stable appears to be well made 
5971 After period of time batteries slipped out of slot while charging. 
5972 Great 
5973 It is a bit larger than I expected but rock solid when in use. Very easy to adjust with a Nikon D2x and all lens that I have tried so far (from a 10mm up to 80-200mm). 
5974 The product NEVER worked. Battery wouldn t hold a charge and the zoom wouldn t work. Couldn t get any decent pictures. Photos all disappeared every time the battery died. Who thought this one up? 
5975 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
5976 Great little camera, gets the job done. 
5977 i got it turned out i didnt need it.but it worked great 
5978 great value 
5979 I have a canon rebel t2i, this charger works great for my battery. 
5980 Sort of pricey but it does work very well and makes the lens much more user friendly. 
5981 nice in theory. Not able to wrap hand around camera and still use shutter button with out loosening grip. 
5982 Perfect glass which provides excellent depth of field! 
5983 Silly product and has no sleeve. VERY disapointing. 
5984 just what we needed at a good price 
5985 Looks and feels great.Haven t used it yet 
5986 Now I can use mine video recorder... I am one handed. 
5987 It fits on both Sony and Sigma E lenses. Doesn t fall off and screws on smoothly. 
5988 The cameras work well - and far - during daylight hours. We were so surprised at how well the cameras worked at night! The LEDs do produce a blinding glare if reflecting near glass (or behind glass), but if you can hang them appropriately, they work great at night. 
5989 good seller, I recomend 
5990 This item was an excellent addition to my videography kit, it allowed me to make smoother more professional shots. 
5991 I love this camera can t wait to purchase another one. 
5992 I love these battery pouches. They are perfect for my Sony batteries. 
5993 AAAAA+++++ 
5994 The color is pretty poor, but it s light and tiny and cheap. 
5995 Good! It is as described. I ve used it a few times and it s very comfortable to hold. You do get what you pay for so keep in mind this is not a high end grip. 
5996 Neat 
5997 Stopped working after a week. Should have installed it earlier to enable processing of refined... instead, sat on the dining room table for a month prior to installation... 
5998 I bought it after I read good reviews from several books. You can get more info about the meter usage from Youtube. 
5999 very Packaging bad and quality bad 
6000 All ready malfunctioning 
6001 Good case 
6002 Great camera that I put to use the minute it arrived. Works beautifully and great pictures! 
6003 Fast and true to listing. 
6004 Works great on bikes and golf cart! 
6005 Very nice product, you can see everything nice and clear and feet any were you want. 
6006 Complete scam, f n cons, false advertising,...get a rope! 
6007 cant return and has not user manual!! 
6008 Works as intended 
6009 Love this camera strap, and have gotten a ton of compliments on it! Great quality as well! 
6010 great products. Thanks 
6011 Good but too small 
6012 Perfect fit for my Kodak camera and my computer to download!! Sent right away and packed well!! 
6013 good 
6014 I believe that this lens will get a high rating once I begin using. Had rotator cuff shoulder surgery and have not used as of yet. 
6015 Great value 
6016 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
6017 ok 
6018 battery it s very good, didn t fully tested for longer periods of time but so far seems to be at least the same with the original. 
6019 Fit and worked perfectly and super fast shipping! 
6020 Great walking around lens! 
6021 Seems to fit a little loose and can easily come unplugged - Olympus must know this because they supply a velcro band to attach to your tripod while using... With a little care, it stays in, and works well otherwise.... 
6022 Fortunately there support atrocious 
6023 good product works fine 
6024 Perfect as advertised. 
6025 Bought for my Sigma 150-600 S lens. This is better than using the cover that came with the lens when I am in the field. 
6026 Good quality, nicely packed, fair price, quick delivery. Great product! 
6027 Low quality. Globe just fell off after just a couple of days. 
6028 Extremely sturdy but definitely has some tilt smoothness issues. I only trust it for static b-cam shots. EDIT: The seller contacted me immediately upon receiving this review and put in incredible effort to see that I was cared for. I would not hesitate to purchase from them again. 
6029 Love my camera! 
6030 Switched from mirrorless APS-C to D750, best all around camera! 
6031 I had a hard time setting it up but Vincent from Technical support walked me through the setup and got it working. 
6032 Nice little case and it works great 
6033 Beyond expectations. Great value! This camera is awesome. So many unexpected extras. 
6034 AWESOME case for my gopro and accessories. Every gopro owner should have one of these! 
6035 The battery I received did not work even after hours of charging. The charger itself felt cheap and unreliable. 
6036 I m just starting off with my DSLR but this is an easy camera to use and takes really great pictures. I m still learning to use it but so far I like it. 
6037 Handy for when you camera is on the tripod. You ll have no movement in the camera for shots that are zoomed in, or with slow shutter speeds. 
6038 The was a very nice fabric back drop. No need to steam or iron either. The colors were vibrant and it looked just like the photo online. I would order a back drop from this company again. 
6039 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
6040 0ne battery was dead and charger holding pin broke at the first try and can t hold battery uprigth. But Amazon Emailed me asking of it and I tell them about the battery and they had it replaced for free. Amazon takes care. 
6041 Awesome. Has made my experience with the x100t even better. Love this conversion! 
6042 Totally awesome ! Light weight and fit to any face ! The clarity is perfect ! 
6043 Great replacement for missing lens cover. Good value 
6044 worked good for taking pictures at a wedding 
6045 has already paid for itself in time, quality camera and power for testing cameras, sure beats running in and out of the house to check, just connect to the camera and see where it is pointed. quality tester 
6046 Inexpensive, but the image quality is lacking for a 3MP. It is laggish no matter the network and comes in grainy. I have it on a GB network. 
6047 I couldn t be happier with this product. I came to amazon looking for a quality product at a decent price and I definitely found it here. No complaints only praises here. Makes me proud to be an amazon shopper. 
6048 Within expectation. 
6049 A great bag. Plenty of space. Has side pockets for extra space. I bought two of them and hopefully they will last. 
6050 Seems to be good, but I haven t figured it out yet. It s higher tech than I am. 
6051 good product, so far very good 
6052 not verry usefull 
6053 Love this thing, almost take it everywhere with me. 
6054 I used it with my Kowa spotting scope at the shooting range. Worked great! Used it to photograph the northern likes with my Canon 70D. Worked great! 
6055 Not worth the money 
6056 Not as clear as hoped 
6057 Very good product for the price. Works well, has beginner and advanced mode witch helps when your learning. The camera works well too, audio recording was a surprise. 
6058 This camera is only meant to fill in spots with real cameras around. If this is the only camera, everyone will know it is fake after about a week. 
6059 Nice photos and solutions 
6060 Turned out fine. 
6061 So far this is the ultimate drone 
6062 Only disappointment was the built-in pop up flash will not work with this in place 
6063 Great Camera, and great seller 
6064 Gift for someone however they love it. 
6065 You get what you pay for. The very first day two of the clips to hold the legs extended snapped. Easily glued back together. You get what you pay for. 
6066 Signal as good as 50ft integrated cable. 
6067 Fast service, great product and price. 
6068 die too quick 
6069 love this Camera and will reorder from this company again. 
6070 Came on time and works well. 
6071 Very affordable, and easy to set up. 
6072 Amazing product. Great and easy way to carry an extra lens. 
6073 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
6074 Within the first week, the main zipper broke. Within about a month all the smaller side pocket zippers were broken. Such a shame because this is a nice looking bag and otherwise sturdy. But you just can t use the bag with ALL zippers broken! 
6075 Does what it needs without any fuss. Connecting standard component receiver to plasma with BNC connection. 
6076 Got it for my 85 1.8 after a close call almost rubbing the lens on a broken fence when the cheesy hood popped off. Have not noticed any issues with glare or contrast issues. 
6077 having tons of fun with this bad boy! 
6078 Not ready for prime time. Very poor internet server. As with all internet accessible services, if the company shuts down, its server will and you will have nothing. 
6079 A great light pack, low cost Not wanting !!! to ruin your show off pack in the woods, forest, and dirty places we go to fly & film. This is the $30.00 pack to get... 
6080 awkward to use. 
6081 great deal. very fast shipment 
6082 All of them are good 
6083 Do not waste $12. Poor quality. Stitching for drawstring closure broke just after two days of use. Small pouch useless; too small 
6084 Great camera. 
6085 Batteries seem to have a long life and work well. Great inexpensive set! 
6086 god 
6087 works well 
6088 Not to bad, looks almost like my very expensoive real ones which are near to these, J R 
6089 this camera doesn t even have a mic port so how can it be for this camera? 
6090 Great camera. Does what I need and then some. Particularly love the built-in 42x zoom. Beach Camera provided great service - camera was delivered on time and as promised. 
6091 Very sharp, great for low light. Received it before estimated delivery date. 
6092 very cheap material compared to original but works fine 
6093 Cheap, useless camera. 
6094 I got what I expected. 
6095 Very good 
6096 DO NOT BUY ! I have 3 of these systems and on every system 2 cameras on each system went bad 
6097 If you know what is good fo you don t buy this junk. DON T BUY!!!!!!!!!!!! 
6098 Works fine! 
6099 have not fully tested how good they hold charge but seem Ok 
6100 excellent product and service 
6101 As a gift for a 7 year old boy this was a big hit. Easy to operate. The styrofoam type body won t hurt walls etc 
6102 Got these to hang a photo backdrop. They are lightweight but clamp well. 
6103 Love that all I need is the paper and do not have to worry about the ink. 
6104 Good product 
6105 the best drone i ve had up to date, just don t update firmware ! 
6106 Great in the field and easy to set up and transport. 
6107 I needed to file my helmet mount to make this fit. Once it fit, it was loose inside the mount and rattles slightly. Not a big deal, but not as expected. I plan on eventually buying the brain explodercreations.com version. Looks more thought out. 
6108 Gave it as bday present for my sister....she said it s perfectly amazing! 
6109 Just what I expected 
6110 SO SO SO glitchy. I only get this to record about 30% of the time. Battery life is s***. I hate this helmet camera, it has let me down so many times. 
6111 This is a great Security Camera. I really like it!! I had some issues with setting up my system. After calling Amcrest and working with Chris I was good to go. The Customer Service was amazing. Highly recommend this product! 
6112 I bought this filter because I have one just like it for my film cameras. This filter is excellent quality and works as it should. Here is the thing though, my Nikon does not seem to need it like my old film cameras do. 
6113 Great little batteries and charger! Charge 2 at once. 
6114 Very very small 
6115 Great camera. Love that it connects to my phone to save pictures. This makes it possible to print better quality pictures when resizing for large pictures. Highly recommend this camera to anyone! 
6116 i worked just as advertised, my go pro got knocked out of my boat at it floated fine and was easy to see for retrieval. 
6117 We needed to replace a broken light source and these worked well for us in the laboratory. I used one in our biohazard lab and the other in receiving. My people liked the adjustable light source. 
6118 Close ups with the macro look really good. Only 4 stars because I really believe the wide angle could be better. 
6119 Works great! Use for my gopro hero 4 and have not had any problems! 
6120 Worked as expected. 
6121 they work as advertised and they ve took plenty of hits and still no cracks 
6122 Very helpfull. I could not have done it myself.Thanks Dave 
6123 We are still learning how to use it, really wish it had come with instructions, but seems to be all it said to be 
6124 Arrived in good condition and is as advertised 
6125 This material is is extremely abrasive. Compared to the factory strap (only a few bucks more) it seems to be made from old pot scrubbers. 
6126 Flawless. 
6127 Awesome bag, my wife loves it. Many compartments, lot of storage space. 
6128 Great Value for quality of this camera - bought for my young son and he is loving it. 
6129 Its ok. the only bad thing is you have to make sure all the air is out of the space between the lens and the gopro. if not the footage would look like crap. 
6130 gets the job done, not great quality but works just fine 
6131 Terry Morgan was terrific on support for the 9826. He was very helpful with the excellent Foscam 9826... great cam quality with expert support 
6132 perfect! what I needed!!! 
6133 Easy to use and takes great pictures 
6134 liked it even better than the A77 I have now due to the lower weight and smaller size 
6135 Well built, doesn t smell like a cheap knock-off like some products do. Be aware that a Canon Rebel T5i and 2 lenses is a TIGHT fit! The interior is customizable as it comes with padded dividers. 
6136 Nice product! 
6137 FALSE ADVERTISING. This case does NOT fit Lumix camera, specifically the DMC-G6. This case is too small, and will not physically enclose the camera. Do not waste your time or money. RETURNED. 
6138 Simple installation. Quick disconnect guards are great. Only con is that they do affect speed. I also find that on windier days the guards tend to hinder the stability of the quadracopter. All in all a great product. 
6139 Great little connectors...my Camera hangs just right now! 
6140 delivered on time and as described 
6141 The monopod is made of good material, strong, but not heavy. I dive, and it s perfect for a good grip, since the handler is made of rubber. I think i made the best choice 
6142 Thank you 
6143 My Nikon stopped working. It wouldn t take a charge So I decided that I Needed a new battery. Put your battery in and it works like a charm now. Thanks 
6144 It is a very good compact camera 
6145 Great eye cups. Seems a little more snug than the others. Hated the first one broke and the 2nd one fell off. If you buy use a little glue to hold it 
6146 Threads fit perfectly. Quality is good -- no distortion as best I can tell. 
6147 The absolutely best 
6148 Bought for vacation and arrived one day before leaving. Small, light, and compact enough for pocket or purse. Easy enough to use without reading directions; however will have to use manual to get full benefit of camera options. Very happy with selection! 
6149 Fast delivery and it works 
6150 Even at $4 this is a waste of money. The cheap vinyl smells awful, there are loose threads, and the fit is cludgy. Immediately replaced it with a good quality strap for only $12. 
6151 Great! And fast! 
6152 On time! Highly recommend. 
6153 Included magnet. Used it to replace defective door sensor (ADT Safewatch Pro panel). Easy to program replacement S/N. 
6154 This adaptor works perfectly with my fuji x cameras. It allows to use both Nikon f and g lenses and even lets me control aperature on the g s. It also looks great and is well made. 
6155 Thank you 
6156 Very Nice!! Love it 
6157 Better than the scope from school, and you can take pics. Works good to keep the children occupied too :&#60;) 
6158 Really happy with them. Just what we were looking for! Good service and quick response. 
6159 Very easy to set up. Very easy to use. Very easy to pull videos to the computer. Nothing to complain about. It just works. 
6160 Very easy to use. It works great. No problems here. 
6161 Awesome fit for my Canon Rebel T3 
6162 Henry from their support team was very helpful. It was really quick to set up. The Foscam camera is great so far! 
6163 Good quality product. Unfortunately if you place a filter on the camera, this no longer fits... 
6164 This is VERY nice, not reflective and vibrant color. Also somewhat durable 
6165 Very easy to use and very effective also. If you slop food on it, you might need something different, but if you are not a sloppy eater you are good to go. Easy to fit in your bag. 
6166 Its what I wanted 
6167 Perfect for my Calumet 32 Softbox. 
6168 I had bought an expensive one that did not last for very long. I have since replaced with this one and it works perfect. 
6169 after several a few try s at setting this up and failing ( user error), I finally got it right. Its a cool little camera. 
6170 It meets my needs. 
6171 Very good quality product. It s heavy and long with heavy duty attachments. Great price for a such a nice piece. 
6172 work fine 
6173 Great picture and value for money. It is a very good camera , not heavy, its design makes it very practical. Its great in capturing those unexpected and funny moments. 
6174 Product was as advertised. 
6175 WORKS GREAT , LOOKS LIKE A REAL TV 
6176 Super solid, and really useful. Very happy. 
6177 Very good device. A significant improvement in functionality over those available a couple of years ago. 
6178 Fantastic lens ! 
6179 Manfrotto makes solid part. Not the most affordable of its kind, but it ll last a heck of a lot longer. 
6180 Excellent customer service! I had a minor issue and Zomei took care of it immediately. I recommend this company. 
6181 The 1-Port power switch is used with our web cameras and is a great product. 
6182 Amazing features for a little point and shoot. I m loving the 30x zoom! 
6183 It exceeded my expectations... 
6184 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
6185 not bad for used cameras did not want to upgrade as I have of these 
6186 Fits well on all my other cameras as well as the Canon. 
6187 I don t understand why you can t get the one which pops directly on instead, they have this Velcro held diffuser which flies off sometimes, no bueno, it works though ughhh 
6188 Menu comes up in chinese and the majority of the interface requires ActiveX. Not compatible with Linux. 
6189 Came with an EU adapter. Was unable to use. Did not mention this in the product description! 
6190 Nice well made case. The one I had tore after two uses. This one is made of more durable material and has more space for extra batteries and cables. 
6191 Hard to set up for recording, I return and switch to some other brand that can record! 
6192 Top quality portable backdrop for shooting portraits. 
6193 I ve got a G5, running 5.0 and with CameraFi it works fine. There are other setup out there I m sure, however, this one is working for me. 
6194 Great lens, I love it. I second all the positive things being said already. 
6195 Great product for the price 
6196 Not easy to assemble. 
6197 great product 
6198 The picture of this charger shows it as a dual charger for charging 2 batteries at once. I ordered 2 since I have 6 batteries I keep charged for my professional photography business. I was sent two standard plug in chargers. This is false advertising! Buyer Beware!! 
6199 Great kit to go along with the go pro. You get so many pieces for a great price. Glad Amazon recommended that I bundle! Husband has had lots of fun using all these accessories with his go pro! 
6200 If you try to figure out how to work this thing-good luck! Whoever translated the instructions from the Chinese obviously forgot to learn English! It s indecipherable goobledygoop. 
6201 Excelente 
6202 This is a great set of photo or video lights for a great price. It has greatly improved our picture quality. 
6203 Love this product! Extends the recording time of a 3/3+ camera almost by 4, making them a lot more usable. 
6204 An excellent product. Operates exactly as described. I appreciate greatly. YES I WOULD RECOMMEND this product to friends and colleagues. 
6205 Excellent. Works great. Got at least eight hours out of it. 
6206 I love my JVC Camcorder let s me record my favorite shows! 
6207 I love this camera and bundle! 
6208 Worked very well and received in a timely fashion. 
6209 So happy to get a replacement battery charger for our camera since ours was lost on vacation. 
6210 It did what it was supposed to do. Sadly it came off very easily. Eventually it was lost and never seen again. 
6211 Purchased as a spare battery. Battery is compact and has a good mAh rating. Both this battery and the orginal take 3.5 hours to recharge inside the camera compartment. Nikon should have bundled MH-65 with the camera instead of this cumbersome USB charger. 
6212 I didn t want to lug around a big hefty camera bag. This one is perfect size for my Sony RX10. And there is plenty of storage room for some lens cloths, extra SD cards, lens brush and more. I also like the solid quality of the bag. 
6213 works great. love that it has a strap so you won t lose it 
6214 This was a perfect upgrade for me! Thank you! 
6215 Replacement for a camera that stopped working after 4 years in Las Vegas outdoors. 
6216 Good camera. It has worked well after my lady figured out the many functions. Stars were withheld because no product manual was provided with camera. The online manual effort was completely frustrating. 
6217 Powerful flash 
6218 Outstanding!!! Best Tripod ever! Tried many, this one is beyond any of them, 5 stars SOLID, 
6219 Excellent for ultra compact cameras! 
6220 It is a nice lens filter, comes in a nice case. 
6221 Great for the money. Somewhat easy to setup and customize. You MUST have a PC monitor initially to setup & run this system. However once setup you can view and record from your mobile or from a secondary program on laptop. 
6222 Very handy to use and read the information I need to. 
6223 vgreat 
6224 It fit my 18-55mm lens 
6225 They don t last as long as the actual GoPro battery, but these are cheap and useful. 
6226 Perfect 
6227 Battery life is marginal. Was hoping for much better. 
6228 Exactly what I needed - works exceptionally well. 
6229 Love It ! 
6230 I like it 
6231 I anticipate that when I make it operation, this camera will fully meet my security needs Just installed with excellent help from Walter 
6232 Fits perfectly, made by nikon, not much more to say. Does it s job protecting the rear. 
6233 Broke less than 2 fays after receiving this product. Not happy with this service at all. 
6234 I am just learning to use a DSLR, but this seems to be a great choice with the ability to go fully automatic, but also various manual settings as well. Very light weight and compact for a DSLR.I am pleased with it so far. 
6235 The bundle did not come with the camera wall mount like shown in the picture and also in the description. Contacted company and the response I received back was that the bundle did not come with any additional lenses (I was not asking for a lense). 
6236 return 
6237 Worst instructions ever seen. Can t understand how to set time or clear value memory. Maybe the instructions are for a different model. 
6238 Like this camera, bought it used on Amazon. Only problem I ve encountered is occasionally it will take two pictures in a row when I push down button to take a picture 
6239 I love this lens. The quality of the photos is excellent with beautiful clarity. The wide angle works great for places with a wide field of view such as the New York City skyline. I am amazed at some of the photos I have gotten with this lens. 
6240 Good product. 
6241 works great, good price versus factory batteries 
6242 This has improved the quality of my photographs and YouTube videos. 
6243 This is an awesome camera. Just about the closest you can get to a digital SLR without the size and weight. The ability to connect via wireless to my phone is an added bonus. 
6244 Seems like good quality! Very handy to have 
6245 Works well. Wish the trigger was integrated. I fixed that by slipping it through the tether. Got it on sale for $1.00 with free Prime Shipping so it is hard to complain. My son has enjoyed it. 
6246 Great purchasing experience 
6247 Those guys who have stabilizer must Buy ITem 
6248 So far, a solid product. It s small, portable and gets the job done. 
6249 What can I say Teenager! 
6250 Worked fine for a day. I originally purchased this for a trip out of the country. The day I was leaving I tested the camera and it wouldn t work. Ended up having to buy another camera last minute. Not happy with this purchase at all. 
6251 Exelent purchase, no more head pain. Light, and nice price 
6252 Great case but I wish it had a place for my steadyGrip. 
6253 Just like the original from Canon 
6254 Love the color, and this camera is a lot of fun for my friends and me. 
6255 Good 
6256 Works well. 
6257 Great case with plenty of padding and compartments. It is a little bit larger than I expected. This case is a little better suited for cameras bigger than mine. I still like the case though! 
6258 I was very happy at first. I installed the battery and everything seemed great until I tried to charge it. Thats when i figured out I got ripped off. Very disappointed. I have a new battery that I can t charge. 
6259 Good quality 
6260 Rapid shipment 
6261 Great rate 
6262 Very useful bag. Lots of compartments. 
6263 Should have some more views and 2-3 days to check event on the free version. I miss different user permissions, just to allow them to disconnect the alarm when they are close to the device or make it able by time. 
6264 It was as described and worked perfectly charging my batteries. All parts were included and shipped promptly. 
6265 great product. Fits the screen! 
6266 Took this to Alaska and got some amazing whale and grizzly bear shots! 
6267 works great!!!! 
6268 Excellent product! Met my expectations 
6269 Took this into the pacific ocean and not a single drop touched my camera! It also fits Nikon Coolpix L30 
6270 Sometimes it goes off for no reason at all and other times it doesn t go off at all. 
6271 My husband bought this camera to replace on that just gave up the ghost! It takes movies and wonderful photos! 
6272 Great price point. Meets expectations. Incredibly easy to use and save pictures and videos. 
6273 Nice 
6274 Don t bother getting this. It arrived already broken and felt fragile anyway. Not worth the money if it even did work. 
6275 great product 
6276 As good as a cheap lens cap gets. 
6277 Daugher loved the gift, but it did not work. The return process was VERY easy, would buy from seller again! Thanks! 
6278 Good addition 
6279 The camera takes very sharp pictures. It is very easy to use. It fits very nicely in my hand, The only con is that the flash seems a little slow 
6280 Packaged neatly & works great! 
6281 Doesn t take good pictures when it s sunny outside, kinda a waste of a money in my opinion 
6282 Fits a little snug on my XE-2 
6283 While this is a terrific idea, the adhesive gave way by the second time I took the lens cap off. I am keeping them to see if I can find another way to make it stick. Other than that they are easy to &#34;install&#34; and they arrived quickly. 
6284 do not seam to hold a charge as long as original canon batteries. 
6285 Works great 
6286 Reasonable price for a rare product. 
6287 Great product delivered as advertised. 
6288 Works Great!!! 
6289 Great buy. No one even notices it. Video clarity is outstanding. 
6290 Love this product. 
6291 Purchased it thinking to record while walking around but the videos are just too shacky to be watched. A stabilizer is the best options. 
6292 Really nice kit. Happy happy with it. 
6293 Good Product Works as expected 
6294 The piece attached to lens cap separated. Almost lost my lens cap. 
6295 so so~ 
6296 Perfect little stand. I use it for long exposure shots on my Galaxy Camera which come out great. I can also use it for the auto timer feature. 
6297 Did not work on my pc. Instructions are confusing therefore will be returning the product. 
6298 Great Product Fast Delivery!! 
6299 The product was exactly as promised and works great, thanks! 
6300 Relive the joy of toys, without the hassle of aerodynamics, with this brilliant piece of work 
6301 Great device. 
6302 Very happy with this camera! 
6303 works good 
6304 Thank you for your persistance and finding the right part 
6305 AWESOME 
6306 Good quality, A little pricey but as an original accesory you get what you pay for. 
6307 I REALLY liked it. I used the album to create a scrapbook for a recent cruise. Perfect! 
6308 Fit perfectly into a case I already owned. Foam customized to my needs without any problems at all. 
6309 great 
6310 Nice product a little bigger than I would have liked 
6311 I consider it false or disingenuous advertisement to advertise a wireless system, especially for DIYers, that doesn t include the essential wireless component, the Wifi Module communicator that enables the system to &#34;communicate wirelessly! &#34; It s another charge for the Wifi module communicator. 
6312 This bag rip the third day I use it. The material isn t hat good. I recommend buying a professional one and not this cheap one! i have a canon t5i with an extended battery pack. 
6313 Good stuff! 
6314 Bought it for a friend and the feedback was more than amazing! 
6315 good 
6316 Good 
6317 Camera works great after dealing with D-Link agent (AR004636) 
6318 Case ID C6719807. Hazel was fantastic. 
6319 Not very good. The metal port got stuck in my laptop port second time I used it. Video isn t bad. It s just made like crap. 
6320 Love my gadgets thanks 
6321 Best camera strap ever!!!! 
6322 Awesome camera! takes amazing photos and video! 
6323 I bought this looking for a durable tripod for my ipod and this wasn t a very good product. The legs get very thin at the bottom and it is cheap and unstable. I would advise to spend a little more money to buy a better one. 
6324 comfortable, simple, useful 
6325 Dlivery was fast, and the product works 100% as expected. 
6326 Good quality for an upgrade from the nifty fifty which I also own...Better glass (to me) and love the stm system especially on my 70D. 
6327 Great product. Voltage and percent charges displays very helpful. Fast delivery and great customer service 
6328 Generally works great, but sometimes, without cause, the camera goes out and requires that it be unplugged, wait 10 or more seconds, and replugged. 
6329 The hook came off within few days of use. 
6330 Very pleased with these. The light with a speedlight wad great. 
6331 Product showed up dead on arrival wouldn t power on, tried to return with no luck 
6332 not as good as expected, case is large enough for intended use with GoPro and accessories; however, the zipper malfunctioned on initial use. no wont open without having to hold the zipper in place so not to further tear. very disappointing... 
6333 Came in handy. When my other battery died. I like to have this handy when i m with the kids on the road. 
6334 Item as described! Works great! 
6335 Works great with my Olympus E-M! and FL600 flash system. 
6336 good stuff 
6337 This product is great love it it is really better than a gopro compared to the price I am in love with it I use it all the time just some of my parts fall apart but is is still great 
6338 Great battery performance, great purchase value, love the external battery charger. 
6339 Good product. Fast shipping. 
6340 some of the balls keep coming off. 
6341 this was great better batteries than what came with the camera so happy with this 
6342 Cheesy but works and at low price. Works for the few times a year for crowd control or people mover. 
6343 Love this lens. 
6344 READ ALL THE ONE STAR COMMENTS. THEY ARE ALL TRUE. THIS CAMERA IS NOW BEING SOLD FOR A FRACTION OF THE ORIGINAL COST BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK AFTER A FEW DAYS OR WEEKS. SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT BUY EVEN FOR $5. 
6345 defective on surface, make unusable for professional use, as metal scuff, or little dents or cracks make base bump. Try another model type that couldn t get easily damaged......well China low quality products and poor model design some times make things bad. 
6346 Cheaply made...The shaft broke after one us...... 
6347 Got these two batteries really quick and they work really well for the came I would buy them again 
6348 I bought this charger for my daughter s sony camera and the first one they shipped didn t work, I contacted them and they quickly shipped me a new one and it works perfectly!! Very satisfied and good customer service 
6349 Makes DJI phantom professional very unstable... 
6350 Charges holds change and works in my camera. 
6351 Much more padding than expected. Great bag. 
6352 Perfect just as described, great price! 
6353 this case is really too small for the Sony Cyber shot for which I bought it. :o( 
6354 I feel like is to plastic, but it does its job which is what you want, correct? 
6355 grandaughter loves the camera, especially the double exposure........... 
6356 A good versatile lens but not as sharp as I hoped in the 150-250 mm range. Still a good travel lens. 
6357 The thumbscrew was missing for the gopro stand and the thumbscrews that originally came with my gopro hero3+ weren t compatible for some reason- which is too bad. It s really light and would have been great for backpacking trips. 
6358 Excelente 
6359 This bag is conveniently sized, well-constructed and has ample space for for my wife s Nikon Coolpix P600 while providing some space for small accessories, etc. and most importantly protection for the camera. 
6360 Goes through batteries pretty quick 
6361 Purchased for my Canon G-15, fit perfectly and worked great on my vacation. 
6362 Good quality I m glad I bought it and for the price you can t beat it 
6363 The camera works great 
6364 C6722013 TECH ID AR004273 Henry was very helpful and patient. His English was not the very best but it was a fun venture and I like the product as well:) 
6365 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
6366 it works well 
6367 This product is built using low quality plastic. The maximum syn speed is only 1/160s. If you are looking for a higher syn speed like me, you will be very disappointed. 
6368 good product seems to work for now will recommend to friends 
6369 I m using it mostly for checking out the cool, binocular-viewable bits of the universe, but of course they re usable for anything. Price is great, quality is great, I d recommend them to whoever. 
6370 Great video from a easy to use camera! 
6371 Bag is small size, and zipper fell so tight, hard to pull, return and take so long for process a refund. I m totally not happy with this seller.... 
6372 I really like this case! I didn t need a huge one just enough for my everyday uses. It holds my camera and my extra lens along with some misc stuff. but it was exactly what I wa looking for! 
6373 Sensors works very good. Amazed by the effectiveness. 
6374 plenty of room for my stuff except for the extended stick but other than fits everything else! 
6375 very nice. 
6376 Great night black and white picture. Great color in daylight. 
6377 great price for a nice camera and kit 
6378 Perfect replacement eye piece for my Nikon! 
6379 very high quality and easy to use micro tripod. I am using it for Olympus Micro four thirds camera. Both for PM2 and OMD EM10. easy to use and carry. I always carry it attached to camera 
6380 Works great! 
6381 Very good. Better than expected. 
6382 Works well, so far. Why pay more? 
6383 Does not attach or fit properly. 
6384 glad to find film for special project. 
6385 Good scope for bird watching and the like. My Kids love playing with it and learning how to focus and find stuff in the wild. Does what it says- a spotting scope. 
6386 fits perfect. So far no issues 
6387 spent a few hours this past weekend trying to balance it - fail. bought the roxant pro instead - balanced in minutes. 
6388 Just as described. Fast delivery. Large. Great for portraits. 
6389 It did not work at all. Do not buy. 
6390 love it 
6391 Great camera case for a great price. It is well made and sturdy and fits a small point and shoot camera. The camera I bought it for was just a bit too large, but otherwise the case is great. 
6392 the clip is good. The headstrap is good but after awhile i cut it off and diy on a hat( it will look way better ) and i think you can buy a aftermarket bundle. It cheap and will funtion the same. 
6393 super cool strap 
6394 This is a fantastic camera and worth the extra money. The quality of the pictures is amazing! I bought a factory refurbished one and have had no issues with it. It has performed flawlessly. You will be very happy with this camera. 
6395 great 
6396 It shows in my 18-55 at the lower range focal lengths and the threading is weak. Dont get it for short lenses. 
6397 Best head strap ever! 
6398 The product didn t work and I contacted Foscam two times and they have not responded to me. 
6399 They didn t have the size I needed so It was a waste. But the product seems to be good. 
6400 This did the job for my SJ4000. After a while, the center piece to mount it started breaking, but it still works well. I use it often. 
6401 OK 
6402 I love this charger, really fast. The only thing I don t like is 100% is not really 100% on the battery, it s more like 87 to 93%. 
6403 I haven t used it yet but it looks and stands great! Assembling it was a piece of cake! I just bought this for my daughters first!! 
6404 Its very good! 
6405 Love this bag 
6406 Love it 
6407 Lens does all that it is supposed to, but some of your customized settings (aperture) have limits compared to a Nikon lens. 
6408 Makes your gear look pro, and I wouldn t part with it for anything! 
6409 Excellent 
6410 Great product. Works flawlessly in daylight and at night. 
6411 No complaints here works like the original ones. Love the dual charger too 
6412 Great lens. 
6413 Its so dificult instol softweare. I m sorry but I returned back. 
6414 Working great! Using this with a Nikon D70 and have had no issues so far. 
6415 Great product 
6416 Good product at a reasonable price. 
6417 Item worked just as expected and arrived very quickly! 
6418 Had this battery for about 6 months now. Worked for 2 or 3 charges, now no longer accepts a charge, so its pretty much useless already. 
6419 Look real and self adhesive. 
6420 ONE OF THE BEST PURCHASES I VE MADE YET 
6421 Works quickly and the batteries last as well as the Canon brand. 
6422 Great product! The only downside is the polaroid picture is the size of a credit card, which is small and not the normal size of polaroid. 
6423 Quality not so good 
6424 Great little item...just what I wanted...and great service as well. 
6425 It s convenient that it folds up, but it s a bit wonky trying to get it closed up. Takes some practice. 
6426 Very easy to use. I love it. It adds the prefect flash. Very compatible with the Canon Rebel. It is easy on batteries and allows for modification right on the lens. Super quick to change the settings and I appreciate that. 
6427 We have a Sony Alpha SLR camera, these fit perfectly! 
6428 I have two other LUMIX cameras with the string attached caps. This cap is so much more appropriate for shooting. It performs as promised and looks great. I cannot understand why it was no included in the kit. 
6429 Beautiful and well made 
6430 Not expensive and it works 
6431 thanks 
6432 Originally I purchased the Neweer brand but it s too big and doesn t fit in left side. I found this Morros and it s perfect fit for my DLSR Canon 6D. You can install either left or right and fits perfectly. 
6433 Now I need 4 more :) 
6434 Great minimal bag for sure, (it s smaller than it looks online) but my new Sony a7r mark ii just barely doesn t fit with the Zeiss 1.8 55mm lens attached. Go bigger to the &#34;plus&#34; version of this bag, I think it s the 625. 
6435 thank you 
6436 Everything ok until Now ! 
6437 I had to return because the cameras are not compatible with windows 8 
6438 I used this lens paired with t3i and it did a wonderful job! Got it for a family visit from out of the country. We went to see so many sights and 35 mm was perfect! 
6439 Great little camera. Easy to setup the app works very very well 
6440 It works 
6441 It is the same old simple light behind the film viewer that does its job simply and well. That is what I had 50 years ago. It worked well then and still does today. What more is there to say? 
6442 Seems fine; pictures still in camera, yet the video works great for streaming! 
6443 Great lens, I forgot that it weighs as much as my 70-200, only shorter, much slower 
6444 Well made I love them 
6445 This is such a fun camera. Totally took me back to my childhood. The pictures are great and having them right away was the best part. I wish the film role held more than 10 pics, but the novelty of it all made it worth it. 
6446 We love our camera and use it daily! 
6447 Works well but I have not put my go pro on high speed risky situations. 
6448 works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life 
6449 I really like the look and feel of this bag. Build quality is good - zippers, pockets, and handles/straps feel very solid. This bag is perfect for a small camera. Highly recommend. 
6450 I wish the slides moved out easier, but other than than it works great for what I need. 
6451 The lighting might be tough to dial in. I ve had a few that were too dark and one that was too light, but it s a super fun little camera. 
6452 It looks really cool, works too. 
6453 It works good. Looks like an original. 
6454 works great thanks 
6455 Fabulous! 
6456 Nice option this is the second set of these I have purchased the first set still works fine. I use them as single straps but it is nice to have an option if I ever need to strap them together. 
6457 Great filter Kits! Exactly as described .. quick, fast delivery! Would order again! 
6458 Awesome stick, very sturdy, I use it all the time and it is great! 
6459 Work good, easy to set up (installing your own hard drive). The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok. 
6460 -so much easier than binoculars- 
6461 Decent quality. Might only take one or two out with me. 
6462 Cheap protection. If you want to preserve resale value for your Canon equipment, this is an excellent option. 
6463 Fit nicely on my lens without intrusion. 
6464 Looks great! 
6465 received in good order; slightly better capacity than OEM battery with camera 
6466 The picture is nice and clear. I really like the thin frame because it makes the pictures look even bigger. 
6467 Still getting use to this. Wouldn t let me download app to my Iphone but takes great pics 
6468 Prompt Delivery & Intact package. I ordered this cable to use on Foscam camera, I ordered & it worked without any issue. 
6469 I bought one Setup Adapter Ring: 52mm - 58mm. It arrived on time. I haven t used it yet, but it looks fine. i m from Venezuela. Thanks. 
6470 works great 
6471 Worked good 
6472 Very powerful. If your camera is less than 10 meters away use something smaller. This will blind most short range applications 
6473 Very nice lense 
6474 It is very nice 
6475 must buy for go pro, hope the next one would have a more modern look. 
6476 Great price 
6477 good deal! 
6478 Everything I needed and wanted. Thanks! 
6479 Excellent Product, highly recommended!! 
6480 The quality of the product I received was sub par - the screws weren t properly fitted and the build quality is bad - The shoe mount on the bottom is loose. Unhappy with the product. 
6481 I was told by mistake that my home alarm system needed a new backup battery but that was not the case. Oh well, now I have a backup battery in case I need one. Bobby B 
6482 Amazing very well crafted feels extremely sturdy 
6483 Volume is a bit low but otherwise works well. 
6484 I purchased this Manfrotto 128RC Head for my Canon Vixia S20 video camera. Very smooth, and as a bonus, it comes with two extra QR mounts. Would buy again. 
6485 Perfect replacement for OEM batteries 
6486 My daughter loves it!!! 
6487 buen producto 
6488 VERY NICE 
6489 Good quality, very happy. 
6490 Fast shipping, the camera is very easy to use and comes with so many accessories, the video and pictures came out nice! definitely worth the money... 
6491 Did not come with any instructions on the parts. 
6492 I simply love it. 
6493 A little clumsy to use but overall works very good. I use this with gradient ND filters and it allows me to adjust it to the position I want. 
6494 lens is to small 
6495 Nice Kit 
6496 These are fun! I have gotten to take some pretty cool pics with them.. I am planning on using them for a wedding photo shoot ( which is what I bought them for) in the near future. 
6497 The only reason I don t give it five stars is that I ve only had it two days. It charged my four RED Bricks from 0 charge in about four hours. For the price It seems to be great. Great build quality. So fingers crossed that it will last... 
6498 Work great thanks for the quality 
6499 fair for the price 
6500 This was a gift for my dad. He loves it! It works great and is nice and small. He has a chest strap and a strap to go on his hat, both of which it works great with!! 
6501 Looks great in my family room - very unobtrusive. 
6502 This camera is amazing. Easy to set-up and easy to use with my I-phone. Great picture and I can receive updates on my phone if it sences activity in the room where the camera is. Love it!! 
6503 easy to use 
6504 Danny was very helpful and did an excellent job! camera is very good and functions well! 
6505 Single-handedly makes the EOS-M useful. 
6506 It was exactly what I was looking for..... 
6507 Very fast good deal 
6508 Great product for deterrent. 
6509 Exactly what I needed and got it early! 
6510 Perfect 
6511 Nice extra gopro batteries. The wrapping makes it a little tight to fit into the duel charger, but very very slight inconvenience that I am ok with. Little accessories was a bonus! +++ 
6512 The best paper trimmer! 
6513 Great product 
6514 Needed to upgrade Firmware !!! 
6515 It did not quite work for the eos as it completely covered the dial for focusing the viewfinder. Bummed. 
6516 Nice screen size good viewing angle and pic quality. 
6517 Received the flash as described and promptly! Works fine on my Nikon D3200. Great price and good quality. 
6518 Perfect for filming skateboarding. 
6519 nice & easy to use seems to stay on well. 
6520 Really a great beginners drone. Lots of fun, wish the batteries last longer 
6521 I used it for my Jamberry storage and I love it. The black background contrasts nicely with the nail shields. Now I just need my order to come in from Jamberry! 
6522 I love this camera. It works wonderfully. When mine died I was heartbroken. I m so glad I found this one. 
6523 I got quite a lot for my money, the chest piece is the most used and very very comfortable and steady taking great pics and video with my go Pro 3+ 
6524 does as advertised. difficult to find locally 
6525 honestly didn t really like it can t see what you re recording the instructions are hard to follow. it s nice and all but wouldn t buy it again 
6526 This camera is amazing I upgraded from the gopro and will never go back. The tube design works great with my helmet and weapons. It also makes a great low profile dash cam. 
6527 It is a very good camera. 
6528 It is as advertised. Fits my 18-200mm VR II and will snap in place reversed. It is the one piece version not like the cheaper ones that have to attach by a ring. Pay another $10 and be satisfied.[[ASIN:B000C0QGAQ Nikon HB-35 Lens Hood (Bayonet) for 18-200mm AF-S Lens]] 
6529 Great quality images and optics, was just too heavy for what I wanted to use it for. 
6530 Good so far. Good quality resolution. 
6531 very difficult to make sense of the instructions for playback. I used this for the birth of my Great Granddaughter so I don t want to return it because I don t want to lose the footage. 
6532 All good 
6533 Nice 
6534 Already used in 3 dives, works great. 
6535 Perfect for HDM Z1 CPAP Machine 
6536 Everything I expected. I m glad I received it very fast. The pieces are of good quality. Can t go wrong! 
6537 Bought this for my daughters Powershot. Great construction and extra pocket for battery charger 
6538 Great! It comes with User guide and in perfect status. 
6539 2 years later and it s totally dead, I can get about 5 pictures on a full charge. I kept it as a secondary battery and it got little use and then when I really needed it nothing. 
6540 Good cheap tripod and selfie stick, but the tripod is wobbly due to the small feet. 
6541 Have not bought any film in 15 years so my supply of these was eventually exhausted. Very handy for screws and various other small things. The tops take a bit of effort to get off and seem to be better made than the aging Kodak canisters. 
6542 Now I can go through old negatives and slides and make prints for my family. 
6543 There is no off switch 
6544 You must remove the battery to turn it off 
6545 Excellent product! Fast delivery! We can now talk to each other clearly and not shoit down the stairs! Thank you! 
6546 Light weight and small. Great for my trip. 
6547 The camera would not turn on. 
6548 Love it get here just in time to see the meteor shower that is tonight 
6549 very good 
6550 Great deal 
6551 Works well. Love the length and does not tangle 
6552 I knew what I wanted/needed, saw it, and now have it! 
6553 Fits like a glove and looks OEM. 
6554 Easy to use. Great detail 
6555 Ordered two cords... one was fine. The other did not work. I checked the system w a different cable and it worked fine. Just a bad cable. 
6556 The first Phottix had a great wired cord that lasted several years, Today no matter where I buy them including Phottix they fail after a couple times. 
6557 Great camera with plenty of options 
6558 Exactly what it s says it is. 
6559 it doesn t focus properly at all..total waste of money 
6560 Has all the screws needed for my Phantom 2. I had stripped s few and needed some replacements. This pack had them all. 
6561 Great product. Would definitely buy from this supplier again. 
6562 Smooth and flawless operation. Works great with my manfrotto tripod! 
6563 Does everything I asked for. Easy to setup. I use it every day. 
6564 cheap 
6565 Camera will not work right out of the box the pictures and videos are full of horizon lines .Well got my replacement and guess what it is worse then the first one it is a shame that such a good flying drone have a peace of junk camera 
6566 Great product! It is exactly like the expensive versions. It s crazy how that can be. 
6567 Fast delivery and received what was purchased 
6568 Waste of money, and will drain battery s fast. Not functional at all. 
6569 Not as stable as it looks but overall I am very happy with the purchase. Not bad for this Price. 
6570 poor quality. very cheap made you get what you pay for. 
6571 Well worth the money 
6572 Good. For my camera. 
6573 Sorry... but this is a piece of junk -- do not buy it -- I was stupid for not believing the reviews. 
6574 Quick shipment....item as described .....Thank You! 
6575 The Pentax X-5 digital camera fits nicely in here, on its side. The pouches are roomy enough for memory cards and batteries. The padding is ample and the camera feels well protected. Overall, a good value. 
6576 easier and cheaper than other brands with great quality 
6577 great seller - delivered as promised! 
6578 Very easy to add to my Hensel equipment. Works like a champ. 
6579 Awesome camera great accessories but the bag won t hold everything. 
6580 Got what I wanted 
6581 Perfect fit, integrated look, very secure grip! 
6582 The first set I purchase were nice but the 2nd set I got wasn t so nice... will add a picture of it to show what I mean 
6583 Junk!!! 
6584 Good price 
6585 My husband was able to fit his keys, iPhone 5 (inside an Otterbox defender case), and his full wallet in the case. It fit nicely under the bungee cords of his SUP. Everything stayed dry while paddle boarding. 
6586 works well and is handy to have 
6587 Great magnifier and light, the versatile magnetic base is a plus. 
6588 Works...thanks. 
6589 Great Product! 
6590 Worked great the first night we took it out to an outdoor location. 
6591 Very functional, light, and easy to position on my belt. 
6592 Epic!!! nice 
6593 Product arrived quickly and worked as advertised. 
6594 Very useable and works perfectly with my Canon Camcorder. 
6595 Cheapest find for Film. The more you buy at lie time the better the deal. 
6596 Works great and the price was certainly right. 
6597 Excellent item for my photography studio and at an excellent price. The instruction manual is also in color a rarity in this cost cutting world we live in now. 
6598 No good sound 
6599 Very stable even though I have no rc experience. In not saying it is easy to fly for me, but that s not the quads fault. Everything worked as is should, no issues with seller, shipping was fast, and I even bought a second quad for my spouse. 
6600 Nice camera 
6601 it was cheap and it allows me to use my camera 
6602 Fits my Nikon D300s 
6603 Seems to be Just as good at a way cheaper price... Perfect purchase for my super surfing videos 
6604 Love Them. 
6605 We have installed the security system, it will meet our need. The only disappointment is I thought the system did not require a land line, but it does. 
6606 Very helpful in teaching me all the tools that I have on my camera 
6607 Returned 
6608 These are great so far. Have used them numerous times and do not get any fog on my Go pro case - These are very inexpensive compared to the other brand 
6609 great transaction. Product as described 
6610 Awesome product 
6611 LOVE THIS THING!!! Only one drawback, it drains the battery quick. 
6612 Very good! Good design and price point. 
6613 Love it works great:-) 
6614 nice item 
6615 Great package, the right amount of needed accessories. It came on time, in great condition, and i am pleased with the quality. Highly recommend it. 
6616 For this price!!! Awesome! But it is not carbon fiber! It is aluminum but works great! 
6617 Best tripod on the market for the price! Does stuff even the Mephoto tripods don t do for half the price. 
6618 Meets my need for a high quality and affordable polarizer filter for my new Panasonic DMC-FZ200. 
6619 So disappointed in this camera. The picture quality is poor and operating it is difficult. 
6620 Genuine Battery. Initially I was after a Japan made one. However, long story short. This one works well, couldn t see a difference with my other Japan made one. Now a days all are made in China even the one one you get with the camera. 
6621 useless. I returned it 
6622 Great remote control &#34;Master&#34;, simple to use. 
6623 working very well, glad you could provide products 
6624 Loved them very professional 
6625 Very good!! 
6626 Product as described, fast shipping, very pleased! 
6627 Good idea to create this, but build quality is really bad. It cannot securely lock with the small plastic attachment. 
6628 Excellent product 
6629 Very happy with the products and how quick they got here. Used the batteries and chargers that day. 
6630 Pleased with the order..:) 
6631 I LIKE IT ! 
6632 These are awesome and I love that I can just screw them on to my other lenses. 
6633 Neat product that allows customizing the setting on Sigma lenses 
6634 Worth the money!!! Buy the protection plan if you buy the camera!!! 
6635 Easy, fast, good product. 
6636 Excellent filter. Goes on the lens easily, excellent fit. 
6637 Awesome...significantly better than the Polaroid duel charger. I love the USB charging port on the side. 
6638 Easy to carry in case and works great. 
6639 it is so easy and fast to release the stands. 
6640 Works great. compatible with my camera and useful on our long trip 
6641 Great for any camera. The legs of the tripod are very flexible and has a good grip. 
6642 Works good 
6643 Works as advertised. Great product and good buy! 
6644 worth the price 
6645 I really love all this set up. Thanks. Good timing for delivery. 
6646 Technical support agent AR004631 was extremely competent and very professional and helpful-Very patient. 
6647 Good 
6648 Great product and price. 
6649 Takes great photos and love the waterproof feature 
6650 My 6D would not fits because it is too bulky. Smaller cameras would. It does protect your gear. 
6651 not bad 
6652 It was pretty easy to set up. Pictures look great. It has some cool transitions and an option to display multiple pics in a collage format. I was looking for a frame that could be hung on wall and display pictures taken as portraits (vertically), versus landscape (horizontally). 
6653 I love this thing. works like a charm- allows for new trigger options on my Fuji 
6654 great lens. great photos 
6655 It s a good case, but I thought it would be much bigger. 
6656 Like the small size and the strap is really nice compared to the on hand strap following the camera 
6657 It was just as described and quick service. 
6658 I m using Ravelli stands for many years. It s well built stands for all video works I do- holding lights and mics. I m abusing it very hardly and it lasts for me exactly to years, then I buy again and I m very happy with Ravelli stands. 
6659 Amazing prime lens! 
6660 Burned out the first day of use with my 14 ft LED strip. My fault. I should have got one with higher ampere rating. 
6661 It doesn t work. The battery never charges and the light of charge doesn t work. The app doesn t exist!! Sad you sell a not working product 
6662 I use this on my Nikon D5200 and it works good. 
6663 Good 
6664 Exactly what I was looking for at a good price. 
6665 Second time purchasing this same setup. The batteries run great just like the original gopro batteries. I have an older set that s already a year old and they re still running like new. 
6666 It s nice and small and compatible and easy to make videos 
6667 The lens is great, but the tripod fell apart on my first trip and would recommend a new product be included in this package. Great price for everything though, but would ve just bought the lens outright if I could go back. 
6668 Emailed them for new parts and they replaced the whole unit. Very easy to work with! 
6669 Easy to setup and works great. Picture quality is not as great as I would ve hoped for. 
6670 My camera doesn t have a snug place to place it. I am using it because I couldn t wait for another but once I have enough money I will purchase a better one. 
6671 Awesome durability, just like genuine. 
6672 Great item. Work as described. 
6673 Love this case holds all my go pro acc for any trip and sleek and small case as big as a binder 
6674 These batteries are good and reasonably priced 
6675 I should have gotten one sooner! 
6676 Doesn t have enough storage and broke after only a few uses. 
6677 Looks bulky but enough room to store camera, charger and extra battery. 
6678 Very versatile. Very handy for traveling. Lots of features in a concise light camera. Great lens. 
6679 Fast shipping, nice product! 
6680 Easy to carry your camera. Anti slip (grip) is working well. 
6681 fits, no problems 
6682 It s not a good 
6683 box was opened returned it. 
6684 For not being a go pro. Takes great pics and video. I got it mostly fir video. Love it for the price 
6685 Send item back was to big 
6686 Excellent product as described, fast delivery times!!!! 
6687 great low/mid level camera , bought as a gift, they love it 
6688 Thanks 
6689 As advertised, works great 
6690 Seems simple to operate -clear picture. Really haven t used it much yet but always like the quality of Samsung 
6691 Great image quality with awesome zoom. Lots of features, maybe too many! Would recommend for someone wanting a DSLR (without all the bulk, lenses, cost, etc.) but more than a point-and-shoot. 
6692 Not to hard to install 
6693 Colourful and functional at the right price 
6694 This is an excellent alternative to more expensive action-cameras out there. Good video quality and very easy to use. Waterproof cover appear effective enough for light underwater use, still need to test it. 
6695 Worked really well on our trip and paddleboarding! 
6696 Point and shoot cameras are a must have for surveying and inspections when on the road and this has lasted a long time. 
6697 This is a perfect walk around lens for my Olympus OM-D 5 Mark ii. Can get a little iffy in low light but during the day it is absolutely amazing! 
6698 LOVE this camera and super cool --- you can use ALL of the go pro accessories with this as well! 
6699 works ok but not very loud i bought it to use inside as a &#34;help&#34; alarm but the chime is not loud enough to be heard will have to get something else 
6700 It charges faster than camera base. 
6701 I lo ve it 
6702 Awesome little camera really helpful and fun. 
6703 Great security camera. I love the tilt and pan and really like the talk and listen feature. 
6704 A++++++ 
6705 Really good adhesive. Feels super secure. 
6706 Perfect case for our little Canon powershot effective protection great value. 
6707 The best bag I ever had... 2 in 1... 
6708 I am the one that loses these lens caps on my camera so I cannot tell you how thrilled I am to have one that stays on! Not only is it so convenient but I won t lose it anymore! Awesome product that arrived in 2 days as guaranteed! 
6709 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
6710 Great camera easy to work 
6711 Worked wonderfully as usual! 
6712 waterproof case is good but the suction does not stick 
6713 only complaint is when the touch screen waterproof cover is on it will not unlock. Other then that its great 
6714 My 15 yo son used it on vacation this summer. The pieces survived horse back riding in the mountains, paddle boarding and kayaking in the river! 
6715 Dead on arrival. Not worth the print to advertise it. A peice of junk! 
6716 We had an old camera and needed the battery charger and this was perfect for my camera to gift this to my mom 
6717 Well made and easy to use product, well worth the money. 
6718 Great 50 mm lens! 
6719 This is a great lens, works great for details or portraits 
6720 On time and exactly what I expected. Excellent job and a magic fiber cloth came with it. 
6721 Amazing price. Excellent for Gopro. 
6722 Cable a little longer than expected. Otherwise, product is great. 
6723 Thanks 
6724 Very good quality and very cheap for a rig AND follow focus! It s a perfect size and very easy to use and versatile. It s relatively lightweight but I would suggest ordering a counterbalance as well in addition to it. Would recommend this to any videographer. 
6725 looks great on a utility belt, but didn t feel like batman. it receives many filters of varying sizes. decent construction and easy to get stuff in and out of. mounts securely. good thingy. 
6726 Works perfect and I don t even notice it doesn t have a nikon logo -why pay more? 
6727 Very good quality 
6728 great price and reliable. 
6729 Does its job! 
6730 Nice addition to my macro photography gear. 
6731 On a budget? Great! This works perfectly on my canon 6D and the panning is smooth. Height is great for a 6ft good. 
6732 Shipping was fast I received it earlier than expected and I m very happy with the camera and accessories! 
6733 Outrageously expensive for a camera for which you cannot buy good film - all film for this camera has been discontinued or is expired. 
6734 These do a great job clean my glasses and laptop 
6735 great price 
6736 A great great deal. I saved a lot of money on all these accessories. It came very quickly in time for my vacation. 
6737 5 stars for the cost and the fact that it works under water. Needs more mounting options, made it work on my pontoon boat ok, but not on speed boat. 
6738 Product arrived as expected 
6739 Perfect 
6740 Just used it on vacation. Works great. 
6741 Did not buy this item 
6742 Didn t expect that &#34;Anti-glare&#34; means frosted, I don t like that. And the little one for shoulder screen doesn t fit, it s a bit smaller than the screen. 
6743 Good system Beautiful night vision I say BUY 
6744 3 days past the 30 days return policy and stopped taking a charge! I would think that an expensive item like this would last more than 30 days guess not! Maybe thats why they only offer 30 days?!?!?!?! 
6745 I took this camera to the water park for some reason when it went off it was hard to get it back on I had to take it out of the case and take the battery other than that it took great video 
6746 could not get it to work 
6747 Item did not specify what it could (or could not ) fit. This does not fit a Nikon D60 so I had to return. 
6748 awesome! 
6749 Attached it to a 300mm Nikon and works well for my intended purpose (astro-photography, long distance canyonland shots. 
6750 It was everything it said it was. easy to install. no problems. 
6751 Your 55-200mm needs this! Doesnt fit reversed on my55-200mm dx vr. 
6752 Wasn t a perfect fit for my camera, and by that, I mean it was a little loose on the mount, but other than that, it is a really sturdy lens. Very soft picture at f3.5. The camera I am using is a Sony a57 
6753 Great Customer Service, Henry , Solved all my connection issues! Foscam excellent camera all features HD and all are included in this Camera. 
6754 Product as described, arrived in time 
6755 Junk - the screws don t fit through the slots as they show in the photos. Completely useless as shipped. 
6756 like it a lot 
6757 Sometimes, it s better to save. 
6758 Excellent charger. No issues so far. 
6759 I use this along with the Joto Universal Waterproof sack for my Samsung Note. Both work great on kayak trips. The bright color is easily visible in case I drop it in the river while shooting photos. I suggest always testing these things in your sink/tub first. 
6760 loveit 
6761 work great and very reasonably priced 
6762 So cute and awesome, loved it! 
6763 great case for the price and is made with quality material. 
6764 Everything you need to start out with your Instax obsession! This is definitely worth every penny. 
6765 Good 
6766 Wow!! This really worked and now I can see everything closely and clearly. Great low price!!!! 
6767 Sucks 
6768 Perfect for table top 3D scanner application with a small projector and camera. 
6769 Very incredible flash, in depth for the Nikon d 5500, decent quality piece of equipment for the price 
6770 SO awesome! Very nice. My only complaint is that my black pear receiver cuts off some of the information. Not sure if its the mini iOSD or my receiver. Still pleased though! 
6771 All of the Datacolor gear we ve tried works GREAT! 
6772 The charger seems to work but one of the batteries will not hold a charge any more. This happened after 2 months. I d spend your money on the samsung battery as a spare and not worry about a charger. You can charge the batteries using an external pack anyway. 
6773 Up graded my gear and camera and this bag holds it all and then some. Awesome bag. 
6774 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
6775 Wonderful camera, so happy 
6776 It s difficult to turn the camera off or on, or to change the camera card, without taking the camera down from its mounting position, unlike front-loading cameras. i would not buy another one. 
6777 Had to return mike because it was faulty, was unable to connect to it. I was going to use it as a baby monitor. I was too afraid to get another one. 
6778 Don t waste your money on Nikon or Canon speedlights. Go with these. They get the job done and match and go beyond quality of c and n. 
6779 Fits the Canon Sx170 camera perfectly. I would highly recommend this case. Good quality and camera protection. 
6780 This is absolutely the cutest little camera! It was exactly what I wanted: old school pictures in a modern little package! I absolutely love it! Everyone that has seen me with it wants one too! 
6781 Good 
6782 can not loop record and destroy 3 of my SD card 
6783 Just received my camera, turned it on and found I was looking through a very grainy viewfinder. Thought maybe I failed to remove a protective sheet, but nope. Been searching the web for answers with no luck. Disappointed! 
6784 Perfect fit, easy to use controls. Just be careful not to lose the focus gear! 
6785 Kenneth with foscam s support team remote connected into my computer and made the setup effortless. The camera s quality seems pretty good. 
6786 right angle viewer works on canon reflex camera..dont have to bend your head so much. 
6787 Broke first day! 
6788 great product. 
6789 Can I just set the cams up without DVR or an computer? Can I just drill them to the walls and turn them on? 
6790 great product so surprised that the batteries were charged when I received them. 
6791 Awesome 
6792 I love it but was at first concerned with the free floating aperture lever. Just seemed a bit chincy that it would bang around like that. Overall I m impressed. 
6793 😀 
6794 Great product for the price 
6795 Great Product for the Price 
6796 GOOD sturdy material in useful szes. 
6797 Sweet 
6798 Works great, easy set-up and great price. plan to buy another in the near future. Highly recommend. 
6799 Really like this product nice pictures under water my granddaughter loves to play with it And the playback looks good.would puy again 
6800 Tiny bag must be like 4x3x2 
6801 The batteries work better then the one the camera came with. 
6802 This is just what I needed. It was packed real good, here when you said. Thank You,. Have a nice day. 
6803 Perfect way to carry your camera equipment without the camera bag. 
6804 Its a good deal but the quality could be better, but then you get what you paid for! 
6805 Canon expensive. 
6806 awesome little camera. takes great pictures. i use it with the 30mm pancake lens, it makes the camera very portable. 
6807 I haven t used this yet, but have tried it with my binoculars and it fits fine. 
6808 Works great more distance and clearer 
6809 Cool little device but not for me. 
6810 A+ 
6811 Adequate cable length 
6812 great product for the price...light weight and easy to use 
6813 Very good. 
6814 This cable is five feet long so I can drape over back of desk and leave plugged into the back of PC. Will carry smaller two foot original cable in camera carry bag. 
6815 easy to use & diverse tools to use with gopro! 
6816 Repeat customer for this brand. The quality and price are great and so far no issues. 
6817 Really nice bag for my camera and photo supplies 
6818 If you can spend money and buy something better go for 
6819 The accessories are great, but the case could be larger or designed better. The case will comfortably hold your camera, a couple batteries, and few small accessories. You can jam everything in there but I wouldn t recommend it. 
6820 D-Link case C6724030 Technician ID AR004276 I was provided excellent help from this great customer service expert guided me though install and setup. Able to see the camera in desktop, tablet and IPhone. 
6821 Fulfilled my expectations 
6822 good 
6823 Excellent filter, nice and thin, fit well. 
6824 camera works well, but the video output requires proprietary editing software to publish 
6825 Excellent, robust and easy to use. Once stretched with clips there were no visible signs of crease in the first photo shoot we did after unpacking the sheet. It comes with a nice cloth case with pull-string tie. I am very happy with this background sheet. 
6826 Looks a little different from the one that came with my T3i, but it works just as well. 
6827 This case is too small for my camera, so I don t use it. The return shipping fee is almost the same as the price of the case, so I didn t bother to return it. It does look well-made, however. 
6828 bought to protect my lens from scratches. does the job. 
6829 it does not work for Samsung cameras - not for NX. The NX screen flips up and the hinges are on the upper side. Impossible to mount on those cameras 
6830 For the price, this is an awesome little tripod but it can easily tip over with larger cameras so be careful of that! I ve had a few incidents of my camera flopping over but thankfully wasn t damaged 
6831 I purchased this so I could recharge more batteries faster. Works great and a much better price than from Canon. 
6832 Can t go wrong with Tiffen 
6833 This flash is working very well with my Sony a6000. It s a huge step up from the built in flash. The package came with quite a few extras. However, I have really only used the flash so far. Great for the price. 
6834 Ordered same day but did not make the delivery on time... Now I m out of film for my vacation. Nothing against the product. Love my Fujifilm..lesson learned from ordering last minute.....BUT IT SAID SAME DAY!! 
6835 It is a Pelican case what is there not to like about it! 
6836 The price was definitely right for this. It helps while taking photographs in bright sunlight, allowing me to have a bit longer exposure and capture vivid landscapes better than previously. The glass is fairly good quality, I will probably buy a stronger one (0.9, etc) in the future! 
6837 My first nice camera and I m very happy with it. I can definitely see the difference in the pics from using a cell phone camera. 
6838 It is what it is 
6839 Took it to the beach in FL. Sand, salt water ... no problem. Next year it s underwater pictures in Belize ! 
6840 GREAT 
6841 Great purchase, especially for the price. I wasn t sure what to expect, but works perfect for watching our pets and home while away. 
6842 I have issues with the zoom sticking. I have had it in the repair shop three times. I am not sure if anything will fix it. 
6843 Pelican = great stuff 
6844 Camera takes great pictures. Good weight. Camera needs better gripping to hold the camera. I think the flash should be located in the middle of the camera not at the end. If holding the top of the camera and the flash pops up, my finger is in the way. 
6845 Great product. 
6846 Great item, with this adaptor I can now use all my GoPro mounts with my new JVC Adixxion Camera 
6847 Fits my camera perfectly. good quality! 
6848 Works great! 
6849 As Promised and on time! 
6850 Only connects to their smartphone app, so very limited functionality 
6851 great 
6852 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
6853 Small and works perfect. Very happy with this product. 
6854 these are rough, they do the job protecting the stuff but dont think you can use them as lens cleaners too like a real goggle bag does. if they made a 5 pack of smith goggle bags or oakley goggle bags that is what most people are looking for !!!! 
6855 Really upset that I only got 6 prints out of each pack when it claimed to have 10 prints per pack! 
6856 Love it! 
6857 Bought it for our vacation at he beach. Loved it, takes great pics, loved having screens on both sides. Was able to get shots while playing around in the water without worrying about ruining the camera. 
6858 My hope was to use this as a baby monitor however the picture and sound won t stay up on any of my apple devices so it is not a good solution for a baby monitor. 
6859 At first I thought these were oem go pro batteries, but once I received them I realized they were not. Still a great deal and comparable battery for less than half the price of oem! 
6860 Strap a little thin but it works well 
6861 Great lasts forever 
6862 ETA September 24 I received items August 22. Way earlier then expected! great item! 
6863 After setting up two out of three cameras, I was having trouble setting up my final camera. I contacted Randy (AR)004232) and he was able to help me through the set up process. I was very impressed with his knowledge and his ability to help me get the camera connected 
6864 AWESOME, works as intended. need to struggle a little to understand how it works though 
6865 according to expectations, very good article 
6866 Love this stand for my D40 Nikon 
6867 Item did not come in original Nikon box, as described. All other items are included as described 
6868 Easy to install and get up and running. Package was delivered the evening before I left on vacation. I quickly had it set up and viewable from my android phone and tablet for easy viewing from hundreds of miles away. Added security and peace of mind. 
6869 Good 
6870 I received a used filter with finger prints on it and multiple chips on the glass, they were needle size tips chips but none the less, I was under the impression that I was getting a new filter. Very disappointed, going to stick to buy my filter from B&H Photo 
6871 super nice, I used for my gopro 
6872 I m an experienced photographer. These are perfect for most situations - particularly street photography. 
6873 What s there to say? It s the product from the manufacturer and does everything it is supposed to. 
6874 Was much larger and clumsy to work with than anticipated. Seems to be well built, good quality. I ended up buying a selfie which my teen daughter has now taken ownership of. 
6875 i really love it thank you 
6876 It fits. Its plastic. It was $2 used. I will not spend $30 on a piece of plastic because it says Canon on it. This does the same thing, just without the expensive logo. 
6877 work nicely with the Mini Sony CamAction and the Shoei Helmet. I mount it on the lower left side of the helmet. 
6878 didn t fit but the people worked with me and got me the right one.. 
6879 It works fine 
6880 Great high res camera for an excellent price 
6881 Easy to set up. Easy to change settings. Great little camera. 
6882 works just as good as the OEM ones for a little cheaper. no problems encounter 
6883 A must have if taking your GoPro in water. Works!! 
6884 The best 
6885 Simply Awesome. Hope they will come up with a auto retractor 
6886 Great product. 
6887 What can I say? This OEM Canon battery is the gold standard. It is more expensive than aftermarket options but when you need guaranteed performance, this is the battery you want in your camera. It holds a charge when used or stored, and the camera software recognizes it. 
6888 Charger works great, charged both our OEM battery and the Kastar battery. And the Kastar battery appears to last as long as or close to as long as our original batter does, so that s great! Thank you Kastar! 
6889 Just buy it camera is amazing makes every pic look like a professional photo. 
6890 Works great for my camera 
6891 Great price! 
6892 Works exactly as it is described. Other reviewers stated it really has an intense rubber smell...they are correct and that is why I only gave it four stars. I will be cutting the rubber off. 
6893 Terrific for the price. 
6894 Works as expected 
6895 ok 
6896 I am so glad I purchased this, as a graphic designer and photographer I desperately wanted my monitor calibrated. It was easy to use and I was able to calibrate my monitors of two screens. Very happy with this purchase. 
6897 great deal and smooth transaction 
6898 Perfect 
6899 Everything in this works great and I love it! The video quality is also very good and I enjoy my kit a lot. Good price. 
6900 Good 
6901 Perfect for my needs 
6902 Fits my Canon 70D perfect. Nice and durable bag. Would recommend. 
6903 Works well and no glitches so far. 
6904 I love this camera. I bought this camera because my iPhone doesn t take good video in low light. The camera is amazing. I highly recommend it and it s worth every penny. The 1&#34; sensor makes this camera shine and stand out from all the rest. 
6905 Good cables 
6906 Not as pictured Missing bag Missing screw Missing filter 
6907 GW Security technical support was excellent. I had a small problem and GW responded in couple of days and rectified the issue. Thanks GW the camera is great. 
6908 Love this camera! ! 
6909 Nice 
6910 Works like a charm! Was finally able to clean my laptop screen with out it being left with streaks! 
6911 this case is great. the quad fits perfectly with enough space for plenty of batteries and accessories. the only thing is the space for the extra props fits 1 set of 4, maybe 6. 
6912 Just what I was looking for. Adjustable intensity of light and a rechargeable battery 
6913 Nowhere in the description (or product packaging) does it say that it is ONLY usable with the &#34;Swann&#34; brand receiver. Bought this as an add on to a different brand wireless system, it will not connect. 
6914 Great product. Used it on 9 dives our past trip! it is lightweight and very comfortable to wear. 
6915 works great, used in the ocean in california 
6916 Its like receiving a bag of goodies. The Case is good and accessories are decent, but for the suction cup holder I will stick with the GO Pro Brand. 
6917 works as advertised and doesnt leave a ring around your eye. 
6918 Great tripod. Versatile and super sturdy, even with a 500mm lens on my Sony a6000. 
6919 excellent product, works well and at a great price! Would recommend this product for any photographer in need of a neutral density set. 
6920 Do not buy this product, after days trying different things to make it work it will not detect the cameras, its not worth the headache, it does not work, buy something else. 
6921 I work at HD & use them to find product numbers on high storage items. Even with my glasses I can t read the high numbers. 
6922 I really like this lens hood. It stays out of the way, but works very well and can be reversed easily. It s a great buy! 
6923 Lasted a few hours with its first charge, which is fine. But with subswquent charges it only held its charge for about 30 minutes or less before dying. Sucky. 
6924 I was not able to use. Even though it was a replacement for Bf808u, the wall unit nor car charger was correct. 
6925 excellent filter! 
6926 Nicely made and neatly stitched. This is a handy way to hold two batteries. I am using mine for Panasonic batteries for the G3 camera. 
6927 I love the camera. It s so much better than any one I have ever had. Great deal. Thanks. 
6928 just what i wanted; good visibility and not too heavy to use without stand; 
6929 I took this camera to London, Paris, Istanbul, and Doha. It performed wonderfully. It does all of the basics well, and has some nice added features (like a pop up flash.) This is the best camera I ve ever owned in this price range. 
6930 does the job! 
6931 The camera lens case worked out and fit perfectly. Quality looked good and put together well. The purple band and purple fur interior helps to differentiate between cases. Very satisfied 
6932 Broke within minutes. Seller said the faulty part would be replaced, months later, nothing 
6933 You can t wear it, inside is the hat there s a hard plastic shell to keep the wiring from you head so the hat doesn t stay on your head. This was a waste of money for me not a good purchase. 
6934 I have had this camera for a few years and used it extensively in cold weather shots in Alaska. I like the viewfinder for people pictures or taking shots in too much direct sunlight. The movies are pretty amazing for something you can tuck in the shirt pocket. 
6935 OK for me! 
6936 Love it! Got one for my husband and my mother. Like the calendar feature that still plays the slide show in the smaller frame. Would definitely recommend - and size is just right for desk - anything bigger would take up too much space. 
6937 Recieved, everything ok. Excellent product. 
6938 Works as expected, this is the kind of charger Nikon should have included 
6939 Excellent quality for the price! Easy to use, durable and good quality. 
6940 So much nicer than my 3rd party grips. 
6941 Fits Olympus 17mm f/1.8. Works well as replacement for outer edge pinch cap which are difficult to remove or replace especially with a lens hood in place or on smaller diameter lenses. 
6942 So I guess I thought this would focus up close with this lens but it is literally just a mirror attached to a clear lens. Kinda not what I thought. Its a little dissapointing 
6943 Worked fine and at a MUCH lower price than the Cannon 
6944 Great for out budding &#34;scientist&#34;. Decent optics at the lower powers. 
6945 I ordered a purple camera and received a white one. I am very disappointed. If it weren t for the fact that returning items was such a hassle, I would return it. If it were possible to give zero stars, I would. 
6946 Nice plate to keep on camera without taking much room. 
6947 Low quality printing. I d go with another company/ design. 
6948 Didn t last long. Broke quickly. Dangit! 
6949 Use this every time I pull out my telescope 
6950 Great bag! Holds all my equipment and that s a lot!! So many pockets that I sometimes forget where things are. 
6951 Upgraded from the old style controller without the gimbal tilt wheel. This is the same controller as the factory controller that was shipped with my first DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, however this controller also has the rechargeable battery. For the price, it was well worth the added features. 
6952 Utilize this every job I ve had. Excellent quality and great price 
6953 Great Product, works as advertised with no issues with broken parts or dead batteries as some have reported. 
6954 Fits my new long lens perfectly and is well built. 
6955 The battery has worked excellently, and it was delivered very promptly. Having used it in our GoPro for several months, I can say that it has worked exactly how we wanted it to. I highly recommend getting it from SNOW_WAKE_SURF! 
6956 Built like a tank. Exceeded my expectations. 
6957 Very tight for my Galaxy 6 with the Otter Box case. 
6958 Easy to use. Recently used on a trip to Russia from U.S. 
6959 These are crap they fall apart wasted my money once again. I am a real paranormal Investigator I no what is crap 
6960 The tripod is so cheap I would never trust my camera on it. Other then that everything is great. I love the side hand grip, and have recommended it to anyone who will listen! Great product. 
6961 Great condition and cost effective way to give yourself secure piece of mind when away from home. 
6962 Although the camera said it was connected over wifi, once I disconnected the wifi cable it would not connect. I repeated for hours, restarting and rebooting every device. 
6963 Great for the price but not real good cameras at night 
6964 Great item! easily accessible and works great! 
6965 You pay for what you get. It has decent quality and video. Mine had a black dot right in the middle of the sun when it was in veiw. Don t let it take shock at all it ll screw it up bad. Mine no longer works properly. 
6966 Love how it s softens my flash. Used it for outdoor & indoor shoot. 
6967 This camera does not focus good at all, the color seems to be off some, Not true color. and the night vision was super grainy even with some light.. I have several cheaper Zosi cameras and they are much better quality then this one. 
6968 Saved my drone thanks so much 👏🏾👍🏽 
6969 Nice camera, weird user interface, takes some time to get used to, for the price its a nice camera 
6970 Easy to attach. Seems sturdy enough in construction. Given as a gift to a friend who is planning on using it for his hunt coming up. I m looking forward to the pictures. Company was prompt in delivery. Nice box with added accessories.thank you 
6971 I have always used the Hoya filters and love the slim frame design. 
6972 Comfort s quite disappointing. 
6973 Awesome lens. Delivered promptly and the item was as described. Thanks so much!!! 
6974 Works perfect, great price at Amazon. 
6975 Bought this mostly for the air ball. 
6976 They dont do anything, except the fisheye, but it s not even that great. 
6977 I have a Sony Cyber-shot. fit my camera exactly. 
6978 Not a DSLR but this is a great camera for family reunions just to save the memories. 
6979 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
6980 very happy now I can play with my camera, I recommend 
6981 The item is not worth the price paid. 
6982 I absolutely LOVE this lens. It is used all the time and looks phenomenal. I would immediately recommend this to anyone that asked! 
6983 The measures are good, and you can move it easy, the materials are well for the price. But the head make noise when you paning or tilt. And the legs loose the high easy. 
6984 excellent price, product as advertised, held charges well, highly recommend 
6985 It does the job 
6986 very good lens 
6987 This arrived as promised, with two functional batteries. Great item. 
6988 its good 
6989 compact, works great and is light. 
6990 excellent 
6991 Not very impressed with this tape. Looks great on the roll but doesn t stick to anything. I am not sure what this is for... tape that doesn t stick... 
6992 Won t stay on! 
6993 ... years ago, when I purchased this lens it was the only 300mm option for the GF1 I was using. That aside, I have used it to get some nice, exciting shots of birds that I otherwise would not have. I m very glad I purchased it. 
6994 Wonderful units! A must have. 
6995 Ok 
6996 Good bargain on these batteries. They are hard to find in stores and when I do find them I pay $5 for each one!! 
6997 Gotta love that pick n pluck foam ! I ll be ordering for my other cases. 
6998 Just started using the camera. Will take time to benefit from all the features. Happy so far. 
6999 great 
7000 Good light for the money, 
7001 A good battery and charger I purchased for the Panasonic ZS15 .Very good in all this great compact camera 
7002 Couldn t be happier! What a vendor! 
7003 I rate 3 star because the tightness adjust screw can t keep on my set. once its set on tight, and loose after few times rotate monopod. 
7004 Don t waste your money. Just buy more battery packs 
7005 I love the camera, but very dissatisfied with the battery life of each charge. My previous cannon had a different battery pack a lasted almost twice as long. 
7006 It works like few weeks now after few days It was not working. I am not sure its battery or remote control by it self. 
7007 I was able to fit an 808 hq30 camera. I have not tested it underwater yet. 
7008 good item. a little tight, so I didn t use it yet. 
7009 What a bargain~ 
7010 It give you the essential s to help anyone take better pictures. In as much if you purchased each item separately it would be pricey worth the price 
7011 There are no better cases than Pelican. Hands down. 
7012 Works great just as good as my Gitzo 6x but for 2/3 the price 
7013 Good for messenger bags; not good for typical backpacks. It s wider than expected, but of reasonable quality. 
7014 Install this great add on to system. Great picture 
7015 sets itself up easily. sound works on an ipad with the app. for it. 
7016 one of a few places where can purchase a great purchase 
7017 I really like my Nikon Coolpix camera. Easy to use and light weight. Works great. Love that it s pink! 
7018 Bought this camera for my daughter prior to our trip to Maui this summer and it took some fantastic pictures of our underwater snorkeling trip. 
7019 Works great 
7020 I had to return this item. The built is good, it s also bright but the green spike is a little too much. 
7021 The batteries work just like the original batteries I got with the camera, so far I have about 10 recharges and no complains. 
7022 Great camera. 
7023 Excellent product 
7024 Perfect!!! 
7025 A good buy, Happy costumer. 
7026 Satisfied 
7027 look no further! There are no exceptions for this product! 
7028 Great cameras for the $. We can see everything. Clarity is awesome too. No blurry spots. 
7029 easy to install 
7030 Held up in some intense class 3 whitewater on an upside down kayak... Got some cool footage! 
7031 Exact fit. 
7032 Good 
7033 Best, top of the line camera. Love the quiet shutter, its heavier than most, but takes remarkable images!!! I ll never own another camera. 
7034 Useless. Faulty design. Returned it. 
7035 I ve not used any of them yet. Ordered them for a party. They are cute though. 
7036 I bought this as a gift for a family member and they love it. States it is much better than the regular neck strap which gets tiring after a few hours 
7037 Nice, portable. I use it with my iPhone 
7038 good 
7039 Awesome lens. Bright and sharp photos. Loving it so far. 
7040 Good 
7041 Works very well and consistent after you learn to use it. 
7042 Cool!@ 
7043 my only grip of the 7000 series is the small body size compared to my D200. This really made a big differece. 
7044 5 stars because you can t beat the value for price. It comes with a memory card and I filmed a time lapse first chance I got and loved the results. Using the wifi mode a huge plus. 
7045 Good product; well designed. My Phantom 2 Vision seems to fly much better with these props than with other brands. 
7046 Awesome product. Works well with waterproof cover in the ocean, on my motorcycle, sports events 
7047 I have to say this is super easy installation camera that I highly recommend to any mothers who need to watch their babies. Although it is VGA resolution , it provides me good image quality that I expected. 
7048 Battery was well priced and delivered on time. However the camcorder it was going to be installed into no longer works. Never used this product. Thanks anyway Amazon 
7049 Easy on and off for storing in the bag and protects the edges of the lens nicely. 
7050 It doesn t work! I opened it and the screen won t turn on 
7051 Everything was as expected. Product and timely receipt were perfect. 
7052 The AmazonBasics Tripod is sturdy and secure. A good choice if looking for a tripod with a GREAT price. Love the hook to hang additional lens on!!! 
7053 Takes great close up pics. 
7054 Excelente 
7055 Worked grest 
7056 Extremely practic. Nice 
7057 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
7058 Very happy with the camera. Its a must to turn it off or the battery will drain. 
7059 Product was as advertised. 
7060 I didn t really want to add a surveillance device to my security system, but opted for one camera along with motion detectors and sirens. The resolution of this camera is very good but it would warrant five stars if it had a zoom feature and smoother action. 
7061 Excellent service! Product as described! 
7062 Looked like it was gonna work great. Then an oring broke before first use. Total garbage. 
7063 I love this product!!!! 
7064 Works as expected... It s definitely an affordable option when considering an action camera. Only down side so far is that the screen is a little flimsy. 
7065 Perfect mount for my Olympus Camera 
7066 Easy to use; Effective and used for a successful installation. Good price 
7067 Well made and fits my nex nicely. 
7068 as described 
7069 Great battery life. Works great, fits great. 
7070 Nice!!! 
7071 They are batteries. They fit in my mouse. What else can you say about batteries? 
7072 My camera fell off in mid air and smashed to the ground. 
7073 Seems to drain quite quickly compared to batteries with similar MAH 
7074 Product is exactly as advertised. 
7075 Good 
7076 Love em. Perfect for pranking however when outdoors and windy they audio can be out of sync with the video to see them in use check out my YouTube channel @ psycokid4ever88 and watch my pranks 
7077 Good but i think this have remot for com 
7078 Eighty bucks well spent, love this thing, don t know why it took me so long to get away from stupid neck straps. With the Arcatech swift clamp it was a bit pricy, but well worth it. And you won t look like a tourist when using it lol. 
7079 Holds 2 Paul C Buff Einstein lights, extension cords, light stands, umbrellas, triggers, and various other items. Now all I have to do is grab one bag and all my gear is in there. 
7080 really works for me, especially on the streets of europe. wished it was less expensive though. the rain cover at the base really works. the padding which comes in contact with your back though will suffocate & make your back sweaty 
7081 This is small enough that I can take it anywhere in my camera bag. I love how adjustable the legs are. This was not an expensive tripod, but it s actually pretty sturdy and really comes in handy! 
7082 Exactly what I needed! 
7083 Difficult to operate. The toggle area is very small and hard to manipulate. Wouldn t buy again. 
7084 I love it take nice clear picture and you can zoom in and all so fits in your pocket. its great!!! 
7085 Super! 
7086 Works great, however sometimes the onboard controls seem to take priority to the camera controls. When this happens it is quickly resolved by switching the on/off switch on the battery grip on/off. Definitely not a deal breaker for me, but would be nice if this didn t happen. 
7087 Thank you! 
7088 waterproof, dustproof and shockproof?the best camera in the history of human race. quite pricey but the quality of this device is really great. 
7089 was not all there len cap missing got 3 lens and the case hat all no len cover cap bad......[[ASIN:B003QQYFLA Bower VFK46C 5-Piece 46mm Digital Filter Kit]] 
7090 I wouldn t recommend. It definitely doesn t work for what I want. Limited focus. You truly get what you pay for. 
7091 Works great, got this for Canon G16 so I don t have to wear it around my neck, I can just slip it in my pocket. 
7092 I ve been using this camera for 5 weeks and am totally pleased. The seller shipped it fast and sold it at a good price, just as advertised. Most of my pictures are of wildlife, especially birds, and I highly recommend it among cameras in its class. 
7093 Very Good 
7094 This is just what I needed for my camera! 
7095 Thanks so mush I like it 
7096 Nice quality product. Excellent price! Delivered on time. 
7097 great 
7098 Worked just fine. Interesting video shot from unique perspective. Do you have enough ideas for video to make it worthwhile. 
7099 Works! 
7100 So far so good. I needed camera with zoom plus ability to make pictures while shooting video. It kinda on a slow side to start, has bunch of futures for young people, manual on short side but you can find it on computer. 
7101 The Canon EOS REbel T5i camera is an excellent addition to the field of photography...easy to use with professional results. 
7102 My six-year-old grandson seemed to like it! But, he did not provide a detailed report. 
7103 3 1/2 some pieces are hard to fit 
7104 I could not get it to work 10 days after receive it! 
7105 Very nice! 
7106 Been using this product so far so good. 
7107 This tripod is great!! Its very affordable and easy to set up!! I love the fact that I can use it to film with my iPhone 6!! 
7108 IT WAS THE WRONG CHARGER 
7109 I like it 
7110 works perfectly. 
7111 Does what it say. 
7112 hard to find additional quick release plate mounts :( all the plate mounts that do fit come from overseas and takes mount or more to arrive 
7113 Quality is cheap 
7114 Was very happy with this! 
7115 Easy to set up and operate. I operate from both the browser website and the Android app. Have set up in two different houses. Seems like good Wi-Fi range. Comes with nice, flat patch cable to hardwire into router for setup. 
7116 Fast shipping works well 
7117 Much sturdier than I expected. Holds flashes, umbrellas, video lights. Appreciate the ability to change angles of whatever is being held. Plan on ordering a few more. 
7118 Fast shipping. Vid is grainy at times but for the price it is very a very good cam. 
7119 Wonderful product for the price. I attached it to a 18mm lens and got some dramatic shots like the one attached to this review. Mind though, that they are a little heavy and bulky, so your zoom lens will look like a tele and weight as much. 
7120 Awesome package deal , everything was as described will do business again 
7121 It gets the job done, especially if you are on a budget. 
7122 love the zoom feature for a compact camera. 
7123 Doesn t hold a charge for longer than three weeks. 
7124 Very cool product! I have it on my camera, and it is nice to know that I will have plenty of juice for all of my shoots. 
7125 Bought 2 and both are coming apart at the seam. Good when they work, though... 
7126 Works as advertised 
7127 Awesome product, awesome pictures. 
7128 The best! 
7129 works good but under articulation you can crack the joints rendering it useless 
7130 It works good... 
7131 Works perfectly and love that it comes with extra batteries! 
7132 All good! 
7133 Works great, looks great. Battery life is decent. Can t see anything in the dark 
7134 Exactly what I was looking for 
7135 I have the older style: single position bulb for 60X and slide out 8X. The 8x is useless, but the 30X has very sharp magnification and the focus wheel is very helpful. An annoying aspect is that it has a backward reversed image. 
7136 rain proof it is working for my ip camera. 
7137 It does it job, rubber caps are ok, back and side doors quality feels low but you definitely get what you pay for. 
7138 Acceptable quality for the cost, but have reasonable expectations on visual quality. 
7139 Loved this and worked exactly like I needed it to. Simple and easy. 
7140 I received this camera on time; but when I looked at the package, it said to develop it by April 2010. It is at least 5 years out of date. I am returning it. 
7141 Loving it! If you re looking into buying one of these, you probably shouldn t be looking at Amazon review. Very complex. 
7142 working as advertized 
7143 Nice new camera. Very useful for taking pictures all around. Arrived on time. Thank you. 
7144 You can count on Lowepro to deliver quality products and I love this bag. It carries all my camera gear with ease and is not too bulky or heavy. I purchased the bag in the green color and have received compliments and &#34;where did you get that?&#34; questions. 
7145 Love it!!! 
7146 Recommended! 
7147 great 
7148 Very happy with this product - it s inexpensive and works great! 
7149 Excellent seller and product. A must have for anyone who shoots photos with a DSLR camera. 
7150 Came with the printer, paper works fine and prints fine. I wish there was a local source so I could get replacements quicker when I need them 
7151 works well and very affordable 
7152 Amazing! Does exactly what you need. Built like a tank and very sturdy. Must have for any serious photographer. 
7153 Very nice case. I cut out the foam to fit around my drone. Keeps it nice and secure 
7154 It did not work. I changed battery and it was still dead! Very cheap feel too. I cannot find any reliable looking remote control for the Nikon N1 VR3. 
7155 Th sound don´t fuction. 
7156 Perfect size for Panasonic Lumix. 
7157 Works as expected. Pretty long lasting, but mine is brand new, so we ll see how it goes. 
7158 Excellent accessory for the Go Pro. Allows hands free use. You won t worry about dropping during entry/exits on your dives. Go Pro cameras has now become the number one object divers find on the bottom, replacing knives and weights! 
7159 Great little camera for me. Easy to use and takes good pictures. 
7160 SUPER PRODUCTO 
7161 Worked as designed. Solid build. 
7162 I was really happy with these stickers. They came promptly and they were just as expected. I like all of the designs. 
7163 Love it! Works great and fast shipping! 
7164 This is the best bag for cables. 
7165 It s a wonderful camera with almost everything one need to learn the art of photography. I strongly recommend it. 
7166 Excellent Quality. Stylish mat black structure. This product exceeds my needs for my photography skill level. It is not the lightest one on the market, but works for me. 
7167 I love this as it is very light weight to carry, but with you camera on it, it is kind of unsafe...make sure you have your camera strap around your next just in case it tips over. 
7168 Handy and easy 
7169 I guess as long as you get a smatree pole you should be alright. Was hoping there was a kind of &#34;standard size&#34; pole. There isn t. It didn t fit my pole 
7170 Careful they dont sent you a 16.1 MP and pass it off as the 20.1 MP....after this happened I complained and got 10$ refunded and kept the camera. The camera is very nice for the $. Point and shoot. 
7171 best of the best 
7172 Do yourself a favor, if your looking for batteries and accessories for GoPro, buy original GoPro 
7173 I have been happy with the product for the last year. 
7174 Great product - Easy to use and protects camera from the elements. 
7175 It s amazing. Very easy to us. I can tell you, buy it! Thanks Neewer and Amazon! 
7176 Excellent 
7177 easy to use, sharp, clear vision through the lens 
7178 Takes very good pictures, easy to use, great zoom!!!! 
7179 Generic lens failure reported on google search. Returned. 
7180 Very good. 
7181 I am very unhappy with this product as we have been unable to connect it to the internet and numerous calls to the company s tech support have only resulted in frustration. It is a huge waste of money since it can t be set up. 
7182 Exactly what we needed 
7183 everything was ok. the camera is amazing and the kit is good too 
7184 This does NOT come with the mount, you will need to buy a mount that can fit your flash and also mounts to a bowens mount 
7185 Beautiful bag, enough room for my camera body and a couple of lenses. The padded insert comes out so I can use it for a handbag. 
7186 Great protector of your main lens and adds to clarity of photo. 
7187 Fits everything that I use for my GoPro Hero perfectly. Have had no problems with the case, very durable and compact. 
7188 Nice filter. Thin, light weight.haven t had it out on a shoot yet. Super fast shipping, well packaged. Thank you. 
7189 Fit for purpose. 
7190 And it works, well. 
7191 For the price you can t complain! They are nicely built and give you clear image even there magnification is so high! You need stable hands or tripod otherwise things look shaky because of 20x. Recommended for night viewing and wild life. 
7192 Good 
7193 It s great thanks 
7194 Looking forward to using this. The toting bag is nice. Quick to set up, light weight. 
7195 Arrived on time and a better value then purchasing locally. 
7196 Great Product! I will buy it again. 
7197 NO COMMENT 
7198 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
7199 a nice improvement. 
7200 Really easy to use and has a great range. We actually have family pictures from our recent vacation with ALL of us in the photos! 
7201 Almost too bright. I had to pull it back farther from the window to make it look like our TV looks normally. Nice, random lights like the TV. 
7202 seems pretty durable and the hotshoe fits very sung... maybe even a little to snug but at least I know it won t fall out 
7203 Came in handy with my water camera. Best purchase!! 
7204 Love this lense. I currently use it with the a x1 
7205 I was able to photograph the moon with it and it came out very good. 
7206 great, just rec d and have not used. But have never had problem with other tapes before 
7207 Excellent! 
7208 Love the Polaroid Zip ... and the paper you have to get prints out dry. 
7209 Great product 
7210 This is a really fantastic camera! Go to DxOMark dot com and read more about it: they say the D810 is not really much of an improvement as far as picture quality and sharpness goes. The photos are fantastic. Read all the other reviews. 
7211 Perfect fit. I love it. 
7212 worked great 
7213 So far so good. Surprised they came fully charged and ready to go. 
7214 it go s 150 feet or 50 meter and more 
7215 The unit is sturdy--I am still playing around with different configurations 
7216 over priced 
7217 The binoculars had a very strong noxious odor from the rubberized coating. 
7218 No holes in side. I knew this might be the case based on other review, but for $15 I can drill some holes in it. Still cheaper then name brand gopro skeleton housing. 
7219 Photos show beautifully. Music does not work and instruction manual does not explain how to correct it. 
7220 Great price and quality of product. Thank you 
7221 The product doesn t like brand new as the inner filter box was quite dirty and there is a dent on filter can t be cleaned off. I am in oversea so can t return it, not a good experience this time 
7222 Great filter set with compact carrying pouch. 
7223 Works well. My teenage daughter is going to town. Easily pairs up with iPhone 5C, and appears to be well made. 
7224 Excellent transaction - no issues 
7225 It was broken when I opened the box! 
7226 Great bag, Roomie and would trust that it will withstand a fall. Was impressed by the color, durability of the pockets and it s organized design. Would support this company as their customer service is helpful :) 
7227 I think it was a little too expensive, but it does work well. 
7228 It works great 
7229 excellent camera, great photos and very durable. Arrived much earlier than expected - great all around! 
7230 Takes good photo s and video is decent,battery life is not good drains to fast must carry extra batteries. 
7231 Yes I decided to keep the Meike Battery Grip can you email me A reasonable price for Battery s for the Battery Grip for Canon 70 D thank you for your business 
7232 this is my second buy and came with several problems Not save the changes in configuration every time you turn off the car and start again reset the value to factory reset. so it s a good item but can t be sure if came or not with problems 
7233 Just what was needed. Thank you. 
7234 I was extremely pleased with the quality of photos and video from this camera, both above and below the water. I would definitely recommend it. 
7235 Prompt delivery and it works like promised. Thanks 
7236 The camera works beautifully. The night vision, and the fact we can check the app from anywhere is really cool! 
7237 O.O So many buttons. I ll figure it out though. It seems to be a great deal so far! 
7238 Works well. No instructions. 
7239 I have EXTREMELY small wrists, so it can still wiggle around a bit even tightened down on me. However, it s still super useful for many situations and being adjustable, I ve been able to let others use it when filming with my gopro. Glad I purchased. 
7240 Great camera!!! I have had several cameras and this is my favorite by far! 
7241 Had some glitches with the ejector for the film but it is overall a really good camera for the price. 
7242 Good product. 
7243 Does a wonderful job removing the &#34;dust&#34; particles - easy to carry and ready at all times. Every photographer should have one packed. Visit the truetoad site for reviews... 
7244 the tool doesn t fit 
7245 great 
7246 camera was a gift 
7247 The binoculars worked great. Took my granddaughters to a One Direction concert and our seats were in a higher section but with the Olympus we could see every eye color, smile and dance that the band performed. 
7248 Quick delivery. Everything was as portrayed. 
7249 Fits well. 
7250 Lovin these clips, waiting for the AA to be released 
7251 worked great for my camera, bought it a couple years ago and its still working great! 
7252 This is a great hand held telescope 
7253 Inlived ur product but i expected to have instax mini film included 
7254 good item 
7255 it s normal 
7256 Great. Very easy setup 
7257 It is good. It is a battery. What can I say? It charged up, it works. 
7258 All products came as advertised and work really well. No issues at all. The selfie stick does have a bit of a balancing issue since you cant lock it into a certain position but as long as you are not swinging it around like crazy it will stay upright. 
7259 The set is everything Inwas expecting. Shipping was quick! 
7260 Pretty good lights. Except that I don t like that the bulbs stick out past the &#34;cone&#34;. The lights have dropped to the floor and it breaks the bulb. That s annoying. 
7261 Loved this bag, looks nice feels well made and there are many bucket in it. 
7262 It was nicely made but soon came off the camera I had put it on. It was an experiment that failed. 
7263 I have been using the battery ever since I bought it and it works great. No issues at all and I would buy another one if I needed it 
7264 good to have on hand and works well for my needs. Thanks!! 
7265 good~~ 
7266 Awesome camera deal!! Camera is everything and more than I expected great buy in my opinion. 
7267 Excellent on all counts!! 
7268 I was very much satisfied with this product and received exactly what I ordered! 
7269 Met my expectations and all the extra stuff was great. 
7270 it is really good. Do not hesitate to buy it. I am totally satisfied with my purchase 
7271 Excellent bundle package. 
7272 Cant live without this case. 
7273 Package arrived on time and in good condition. Soft box was was easy to put together and held up well. Does a nice job with a speedlight 
7274 Too small for the A6000 when a lens is attached thereto. 
7275 Love the size of this camera. The video is not the greatest but for what you are spending it is nice. The water proof case is a nice addition. I took it on a rafting trip, no leaks. Nice combination. Very pleased with this set up thus far. 
7276 Great 
7277 Excellent product and seller. 
7278 It quickly charges my GoPro batteries without having to use the camera. The car charger is perfect for road trips. 
7279 Didn t fit my X100LE , way to tight , damaged the hotshoe upon removal ... I would give it 0 stars if I could 
7280 Excellent deal. Product just as described. 
7281 Nice item works great 
7282 The service reps stick with you to figure out how to fix. And they are very knowledgeable. Awesome! 
7283 Great item, my camera fits and I can carry an extra battery. 
7284 Excellent quality! 
7285 Excellent product, using with a Logitech c920 webcam. Sturdy construction, had the ability to lock at the perfect angle. 
7286 Small, simple, well made, and looks great! An indicator light for each battery shows when it s sufficiently charged, which is about all the info I need. 
7287 Just what I wanted and work great 
7288 Works great and I love the camera 
7289 Good 
7290 Cheap, but functional. The threaded ring came too easily out of the rubber piece. Collapses well, but I don t expect it to last too long without the rubber cracking. 
7291 Excellent buy. Good quality for the price. Bought two. One for my wife and one for myself. Beats sharing and having to constantly refocus. 
7292 great 
7293 Optically perfect but heavy. 
7294 Very nice case arrived in great condition. 
7295 I use this brush for scanning photos. It helps minimize dust between each scan. Does what it s suppose to. 
7296 Super, super! 
7297 Great stand! 
7298 Although claimed it does not work with D750????? 
7299 great for the price 
7300 Good Case 
7301 Really happy with the teleconverter and the results I am getting. The conversion of my nice nikon 1.8 50 mm into a 100 mm walk around lens AWESOME!!! 
7302 As advertised. 
7303 This Tripod is very wobbly. I put my camera on it and the legs bend extremely easy. I cannot recommend this product. it is cheaply made with cheap materials. I dont trust my camera with this Tripod 
7304 Arrived in great shape. Although it s a very basic lens it was exactly what was needed for the project. 
7305 returned... was not in shape stated. cat hair all over it...nothing worked properly. 
7306 The battery was of very good quality. Price was also excellent. 
7307 works as advertized 
7308 Hubby is sooooo happy with it. He;s still learning lots and enjoying it all. 
7309 Works well. I had bought one of these years ago for $50, and this one is just the same. When I ride by the house it looks occupied. 
7310 Great price for the kit. The flash itself is a work horse.. Doesn t over heat like bigger ones if you need to be able to shoot rapidly. 
7311 The set up is super difficult. If you can get past that, it is a good camera. I still haven t figured out how to record…I can only watch live 
7312 A great gift for an 80th birthday...She can now have her family with her always in the pictures of their lives which were downloaded for her! Easy to use! AMAZON DELIVERY WAS AMAZING...ON TIME AS PROMISED! 
7313 Great value for the price! Its a good combination of lenses/filters. The threads fit perfectly with the camera lens. Quality of the material used is also very good. 100% happy with the purchase! 
7314 GREAT service and prompt delivery. Unfortunately, the glasses were too big for my head but a friend took them and absolutely loves them! 
7315 Set up is pain 
7316 I had D link cameras too 
7317 and it didn t require port forwarding, and all other critical set up activities. It was just plug n play. Returning product and getting Dlink again. 
7318 Works fantastic with my 70d. Feels solid, button feedback is crisp and clicks not rubbery. There s a distinct off, half way and full press on the shutter. And the batteries fit perfectly and work perfectly. 
7319 Love this camera 
7320 Liked the selfie stick it was better than what i thought .. 
7321 GREAT 
7322 Seems to be poor quality - I don t really trust it. 
7323 Awesome speaker, tough as can b 
7324 And rather loud to, great for my PA system and air horn 
7325 This purchase went exactly as planned. Order, receipt, and function were all what I expected. Good job!! 
7326 Great product and exactly what I wanted! Works amazingly well! I was amazed at how well it helps remove reflections and also darkens the leaves of trees by cutting down their shine. Very happy with this filter! 
7327 Perfect. Just like the waterproof case, except with cutouts for plug ins. Works great, especially when driving long distances. Allows charging cable for the GoPro 
7328 VERY HANDY AND PRACTICAL,ALSO VERY CONVINIENT. I RECOMENDED. 
7329 perfect fit 
7330 A great wrist strap! 
7331 excelente 
7332 I also have a Go Pro 3 Black and found that the menu system sucked, the battery died way way to fast. The drift while larger has outstanding battery life and is very very easy to use. The remote is also way better than the go pro. 
7333 I like it very much 
7334 Great camera. Pictures are amazing and very easy to use 
7335 Works great. 
7336 Great Product for the price! 
7337 take some good pic night and day. 
7338 Worked ok 
7339 Purchased this watch for my 13 year old son and he loves it. Great price and much to my surprise great quality. This watch has held up to a 13 year old boy s abuse and keeps on going. Looks good too! 
7340 Great camera, with terrific picture. The new Nest app is easy to use and set up. 
7341 Excellent device! I would give it 5 stars but it is a pain to have to remove 4 screws just to change the batteries. 
7342 Was what I was looking for. 
7343 My teacher recommended the 13x19 portfolio, but I find it s just too big. So I had to buy a new one that s smaller but this one still was great quality. 
7344 The strap for the arm got broken 
7345 Missing pieces. No batteries, no lens cover. Did not know the item was refurbished. Very disappointed. 
7346 This is a great deal. The pictures are beatiful 
7347 Perfect, guaranteed, durable product. Amazingly fast shipping and superb customer service. 100% recommend. 
7348 Worked OK. 
7349 LED lighsts only works with with battery packs and not batteries. The lights were smaller than expected. 
7350 LOVE this camera. Definitely a much-used addition to my camera &#34;arsenal.&#34; 
7351 This is exactly what I needed and was much more affordable priced than from Canon! 
7352 I have used this film ever since I got my instamax mini and I have never had any problems. Every role I ve used has produced quality pictures. I haven t had the problem of getting a role that just keeps printing out white pictures. 
7353 had to play with it a bit to get it to work the way I expected to but the video is great and I use it now with no issue. 
7354 I took this camera on a road trip, and let me tell you, It produced great videos of my trip across the United States. 
7355 Shipped right on time! Amazing product. Bought this set for my trip 
7356 All the components are great quality. 
7357 Bought some flashes that didn t fit my hot shoe, this works perfectly. 
7358 This was the same type of a battery I had once before. Worked as expectedly. 
7359 Good 
7360 Greatest purchase! I use the pole for taking photos while sailing and you can get some really awesome shots! The pole allows you to get take pictures from angles that are impossible otherwise. So glad I bought this! Very cool item! Well made, very sturdy and secure. 
7361 Great stands!! I love them!! 
7362 very good product 
7363 Great filter, love the performance and it just feels high quality. Great buy! 
7364 Worked as advertised. Did get water droplets on the filter during the dive that were not visible till watching the video. Then again, the gopro was mask mounted, so got lots of bubbles. Dove to 90 feet, visibility was great, colors were accurate at depth. 
7365 All metal parts...high quality and it has lasted several years. Just bought another one because I was so pleased with the previous one. Don t waste your money on the cheaper ball head camera mounts. This one is the best. 
7366 no power cord! 
7367 Great Product 
7368 Very good 
7369 Good unit, decent recording ability, for $20, it s hard to lose. 
7370 Fits - timely delivery 
7371 Probably works great for small action recorders, but will not work with a dslr as they are just too heavy for the timer to be able to keep its balance while spinning. 
7372 everything works as advertised, very pleased, just ordered a second one. 
7373 It was my sister present! So great!!! 
7374 packed great, as advertised. 
7375 They work well once you get the right angle, but I think they could use a bit more eye relief than the twist-up eye caps offer. I sometimes find it difficult to acquire a view unless I play with the angle. 
7376 Very nice 
7377 works nicely and protects my screen well. does not affect my recording or images, clear right through. Thanks! 
7378 8&#62; Thank You $$$ 8&#62; :D ^^ 
7379 built like crap 
7380 Your device will slip out of the Phantom 3 tablet holder using this shield. Not a good fit. 
7381 Very simple but built well. No complaints and very pleased. 
7382 Easy to install & works well 
7383 Sucks, doesn t charge all 3 the same. POS!!!! 
7384 great 
7385 Awesome! 
7386 my family was heart broken at the loss we suffered my daughter wears this every day thank you 
7387 I use them to clean my glasses, they work great. Fast shipping. 
7388 Works just fine. 
7389 Works just as described! This is very moveable mount that works well. I d definitely recommend......note I haven t used this mount for more than 2 weeks but so far, so good. 
7390 I bought this to go with a large kit that included a camera, some lenses and filters but didn t include this item. This item worked well, was shipped quickly and was a great price, thanks a bunch, will buy again! 
7391 Great clarity and quality for the price. The app was updated, very disappointed. Its slow, sometimes it will just spool with no picture and i never had a problem with the the motion alert with the older app, now with the Vimtag it crashes! 
7392 Great value! 
7393 Works well when I need to use it on a frame. 
7394 Great package for the price. 
7395 It sucks 
7396 Wasabi batteries have been excellent. I ve used them in two other cameras and a camcorder. They communicate with the camera, have more capacity than the oem battery and I ve never had one die. 
7397 Remote works great and very helpful in my learning how to use my camera 
7398 Great product. Thanks for good business. 
7399 LOVE LOVE LOVE IT... CAME SUPER QUICK.....GREAT QUALITY BEST PRICE 
7400 Bought this for my grandson and does many great video now, he loves it , hes 16.... 
7401 Works well for the most part ... Wireless is a huge plus ... Takes a little tweaking but is pretty straight forward ... I added a 3rd camera and most likely will buy 2 more for the outside ... 
7402 Gives a good picture quality, housing seems rugged enough for the price. happy with this unit. 
7403 Worked well during my wife s European trip. Simple and functional. 
7404 Pelican, as always, a great product. Have several in use for the last 10 years and still working great. 
7405 Really like it. It holds a lot and the sections inside can be moved around to suit your needs. The adjustable straps are nice so whoever is carrying it can fit it to them. Don t miss my clunky camera bag one bit! 
7406 works great, i should have bought more, and probably will buy more in the future! 
7407 good mic for the low price 
7408 everithing OK 
7409 This package is legit. Buy it. 
7410 The float stick works well but after using it on vacation it already has water in it that won t come out. The extension stick is crappy, it s hard to extend. 
7411 No issues with it, highly recommend and a high quality product. 
7412 You need it, that s it. Best bang for the buck. 
7413 It s very nice!!!! i like all. 
7414 Great item and great seller 
7415 It is too bulky- when it is closed it s also too large still. 
7416 It seem very well made but I haven t use it at a live gig yet so I will report back if I have any problems. It has lot of hoops to hang accessories. So far I could not find any negatives. 
7417 Great units. Hi speed sync is fun. 
7418 DOES NOT FIT CHARGER ARE YOU SURE IT FITS Nikon D70S Is the S model different from d70 Batteries edges more square. I am going to return battery 
7419 I feel like I stole this item for what I paid. It works perfectly! 
7420 I am very pleased with my experience in making this purchase. Everything was as promised and was delivered very quickly. I would recommend this company based on my interaction. 
7421 It s a great camera bag! 
7422 Works! 
7423 Good saller 
7424 I have so many of these packs. They may not last as long as the Sony batteries, but my A7s it pretty power hungry so it s hard to tell. For the price, it s nice to have extra batteries in my kit. 
7425 The adapters worked as expected. Very inexpensive as well. 
7426 I Liked the camera and bundle so much, this was the second one I got for a family member! 
7427 I don t have to worry about losing the lense cap every again! 
7428 Great add on for my Cannon camera. No more running back to the camera for group shots. Works like a charm. 
7429 Very good product to my GoPro. 
7430 a little bit on the heavy side but sturdy enough to do the job and lighter than a tripod 
7431 These batteries physically fit the camera, but unfortunately did not work. 
7432 It is a great product. I felt a little hard to rotate the zoom, at the lens. 
7433 Got gere on time and works great with the camera 
7434 great camera delivered as promised 
7435 Simple to use. Clear picture. Fast shipping. 
7436 works initially but as time goes on the bubble starts to appear & it doesnt stick anymore 
7437 Great buy, especially for those that need the power and an almost universal flash. Pack has been going strong since purchased in 2007. I would highly recommend. Use a cheap shroud or soft cap for alternate effects. 
7438 They are realy good. Easy to install, and work perfect. 
7439 Fits perfectly. Looks great. Easy to use and great quality 
7440 It does what is should, but it is not a huge angle widening. I used it on my 50mm lens and it turned it into maybe a 45mm? The biggest downside is that you lose a bit of focus control since now you have an extra lens to distort through. 
7441 Overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it works as advertised. (It looks big, bulky, and silly when attached to the flash unit) 
7442 Great value and nice variety of useful items. Recommended!! 
7443 Didn t work for me. 
7444 Sensor works well inexpensive way to secure a room 
7445 Works Great!! 
7446 excellent product quality 
7447 Better than expected, I ve had it awhile now and it s still performing. Battery life could be better - but that s on nearly all speedlights. 
7448 The last flash that I bought is not properly shut continue on after turning it off , and the other does not work correctly the locking when mounted on the camera. 
7449 Terry Morgan provides the best tech support. Fantastic cam for the $$!!! 
7450 Advice for new parents, your iphone will need to be on ALL the time if you want to keep a constant watch. Otherwise, it s got a really clear picture even in the darkest of situations. Super easy set up. 
7451 Good 
7452 so far its doing great 
7453 This was a gift to my husband for his birthday. It is everything we had expected! 
7454 Very Good 
7455 I purchased this product. It came with NO instructions whatsoever. Can someone provide me with English instructions? 
7456 Great package 
7457 cool camera, impossible software. I spent like 3 hours trying to get it setup on WiFi and could not figure it out, even with the special support files provided by hoo too. not recommended for quick install. 
7458 Likely sufficient is shooting photos from the sidelines or traveling by car but for the hiker, too heavy, too bulky and too cumbersome. 
7459 Works fine. 
7460 Great chest harness, well worth the money. 
7461 Excellent 
7462 Great again and again!! 
7463 I got this to record my daughter s graduation. The picture is horribly grainy. I would note commend this camcorder at all. 
7464 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
7465 There big and the made the cameras float and the price was good. 
7466 So far so good, Camera is sharp enough for close range, IR works great at night. My only beef that kept it at 4 stars is it being a tad slow when you pan around. Other than that its great. 
7467 Great already have couple of others. 
7468 it worked until iOS 8.4. now I have a useless camera. 
7469 batteries came fully charged and lasted a good amount before i had to recharge 
7470 Being a larger than average photographer, I was having a hard time finding a long enough strap so my camera would hang comfortably. This is exactly what I needed! Delivery was super-quick! 
7471 This harness is so awesome I cant tell you how awesome. I am still finding way that this makes my whole photography life easier. Get you one! Even with one camera it sits fine on my shoulders. 
7472 good 
7473 Should have purchased these instad of the X1 brand. Works great 
7474 works great with amcrest system 
7475 Good product. 
7476 The camera was in a very good condition. Just I didn t get then what &#34;body only&#34; mean, and buying a lense now is another $150 and also an SD card. So I might as well buy a new camera in that price. Thank you again. 
7477 Worked perfectly, no problems. Very good buy. 
7478 I really like it, shipping wasnt bad either 
7479 Works great and I like it, but it was a little expensive. Also had to pay extra for the articulating mounting arm (which I also like and thought was overpriced). 
7480 extremely cheap product. 
7481 Its very weak plastic. Broke when i was puting it for first time. Doesnt deserve any star 
7482 🙈👆🏻😍 
7483 Fits perfectly on my cannon rebel 3ti 
7484 Very cheaply made. 
7485 I can t figure out how the use it 
7486 FUJIFILM s best instant camera as of this date. 
7487 There is no second for this case, it is so far out front of any similar case for your expensive camera and or 1911 .45 Remington semi automatic pistol and several magazines. Again, there is no second for the quality of this case. RG 
7488 Good optics and works well with my DSLR. 
7489 Amazing amount of gear and really functional as well. 
7490 I m a cheap butt, and this gizmo got me the shots that I wanted.... 
7491 es como se esperaba. 
7492 Good 
7493 its so cool, the USB interface makes viewing them so easy 
7494 Excellent companion to body case. Very high quality 
7495 I was expecting the entire picture not just the backdrop. Probably will return. 
7496 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
7497 Remote doesn t work. HDMI-out doesn t work. No instructions on how to view/setup online(the &#34;instructions&#34; for DDNS are incredibly vague and not helpful at all). Other than that, pleasantly surprised at the quality of picture and that the HDD was included with the DVR unit for under $200. 
7498 Arrived on Time! Great, clean NEW condition with everything in box. 
7499 performed as advertized 
7500 Awesome purchase especially for the price. Fits my camera perfect with a few accessories as well. 
7501 Great Product!!! fast Shipping!! 
7502 easy installation. Just take me less than 10 min to get it done. adjustable aperture is another sweet design for home use. Take it as a pet cam for my puppies. 
7503 Very satisfied with the transaction. Camera has excellent features for the price and fits easily into my pocket. 
7504 camera will not hold charge and I don t think its the battery, this is fine. 
7505 Had a difficult time uploading the video. Still have problems so I don t use much. 
7506 Very good 
7507 Batteries are great! Don t work with cannon chargers but work with the one it came with 
7508 IT IS MADE BY HIKVISION, BUT IT IS OEM. GREAT PRICE! 
7509 great transaction. Product as described 
7510 This stand works with the Neewer Camera Photo/Video 18&#34;Outer 14&#34;Inner 600W 5500K Dimmable Ring Fluorescent Flash Light for video recording. 
7511 Its all I need 
7512 Amazing bargain for an image stabilizer. 
7513 Perfect just what we needed. 
7514 Excellent product 
7515 Great little noise maker. No one comes into the house without my knowledge!!!!! Km 
7516 Great product, as advertised. 
7517 It didn t fit! I tried to make it fit and it broke. Now I am $25 lighter in the wallet. 
7518 Super.... 
7519 Good deal, easy to use and well worth the money as a refurbished unit( can tell - it looks new). 
7520 One of the items I don t regret buying. I use it as a organizer case for my various electronic components in my backpack, not just for my camera when I travel. Very purposeful beyond its original intent. 
7521 Nice 
7522 Amazing and used it through out a trip with a lot of hiking. 
7523 Works like a charm, affordable. Sony should have included it with its camera products. 
7524 Not as powerful as I had hoped. 
7525 leaves little spots all over the sensor. 
7526 Cool Kit 
7527 useless I returned it 
7528 Thought I d take a chance on this and i wasn t disappointed...great item and well worth the money 
7529 Great grip! 
7530 while this may be a good camera, we had to return it because it s rather bulky. Should ve looked closer at the pictures. 
7531 Great long and skinny chealplace for covering a 1/4 20 screw into various 1/4 20 and one 3/4.. I wish it had more 3/4 but what can a guy do? Work for me but might not work in every mounting situation. Do some research before buying. 
7532 Good!! 
7533 Nothing fancy, gets the job done for light activity. 
7534 The Go Pro suction cup mount is a great tool. As long as the surface is smooth and clean, you should be able to mount it without issues. 
7535 Not bad optics for an inexpensive macro solution...the swingaway mount is nice and handy--I just leave it on the camera. Good purchase. 
7536 What can i say, it s small, its heavy duty, it holds your lens caps (that aren t attached) & it should be included in every camera strap you buy... but it s not. Way to go guys at Vonoto... you filled my need exactly. 
7537 Love being able to check on the dogs while I m at my office and see what s happening at home when we re not there. 
7538 Thank you 
7539 Works great. Kids have used it a lot. Seems very durable. Lots of fun! 
7540 very good 
7541 Great speedlight. Everyone needs one 
7542 Do Not buy, Cameras do not last indoors or outdoors. Have add trouble contacting sellers to try and replace cameras. One by one they each died. 
7543 This was simple to install and really easy to use. 
7544 Sometimes works, sometimes takes few more seconds, first I thought It was because the camera needed time to focus but realize later the remote sometimes doesn t send signal. Battery draws very fast. 
7545 good product for the price, does everything expected 
7546 I love it 
7547 Decent product for the price. 
7548 Great fit for GH4, does just what it says and what it is suppose to do. I am able to mount Leica R glass to the GH4, which provides some great unique looks to video and photos. Would recommend. 
7549 ok 
7550 Came super quick. Just as described. 
7551 nice 
7552 Great floats! Love the bright colors that easily stand out in the water! 
7553 Handy item for carrying and providing easy access to required filters. 
7554 After charging them in my new charger, they worked just fine in my camera. 
7555 perfect replacement for my broken door 
7556 Works Perfectly. It can even fit a small tablet like my nexus 7 
7557 Pricey but works 
7558 Exactly as expected. Perfect case for my camera. 
7559 Works 
7560 It does work good. 
7561 Actually pretty good quality. It was simple to put together, and surprisingly easy to transport. 
7562 Fantastic! Great price, perfect condition, works amazing. Very satisfied. 
7563 GREAT UNDERWATER CAMERA!!! 
7564 As long as you realize these are standard def products and they sometimes have issues recording, nobody can beat the price/quality. You wont be disappointed. 
7565 Good product. 
7566 Don t try to take dry pics after taking underwater pics, water droplets will remain on the camera making all the pics you take look warped. Its really quite annoying when trying to take selfies with my head above water. 
7567 I can t complain at all about this purchase, it works perfectly for my needs and never fails. 
7568 Awesome 
7569 Check out my video review here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNJ-LqryG2s It s the perfect secondary camera to your primary vlogging camera. Audio is the best GoPro has to offer and video quality is up to date. If you want to see a comparison to the Silver look at the video above! 
7570 Works like a charm with my t5i.. I still have it 6 months later. The battery died but i just popped it out the bottom and replaced it. You dont have to keep buying it.. Just change the battery you guys. Lol 
7571 Looks good feels good, I have taken video through it but haven t used it under water yet. It didn t distort or interfere with the video or pictures at all. I would buy this product again and recommend it to friends. 
7572 Lightweight and useful. Get the job done. 
7573 Perfect replacement for the original piece. 
7574 Works well. Can t rotate upwards at all though. 
7575 works fine although battery was real low only 1 bar when I got it but it charged up fine. 
7576 Looks durable. Fits my 600EX-RT very well. 
7577 Exactly what I needed for my shotgun mic 
7578 easy to use, precise, its reading is constant, its a great deal. I love it. 
7579 I really like it. Its everything that i expected. If build quality is a big concern keep in mind that this is a 20 dollar shutter release. Don t expect any more than what your e paying for. 
7580 The price is good, but the batteries do not mark the used percentage correctly.. so they hapen to die at any time with no notice. they don t work for me. 
7581 I went into this knowing it wasn t a high-end technological marvel. I use it to view printed samples under pretty high magnification and it works OK. Not great, not worthless. Right smack dab in the middle for the price. 
7582 Works. Delivered fast. A+++ 
7583 After using the camera 8 Times( bought july 22nd) one button stop working. I just checked the return policy and just expired the 30 days window. What should i do? 
7584 Saved my day! Just the right fit and performance works as I would expect. 
7585 I needed AC power for video and stop motion projects. This thing did the trick for the price. Can t complain. 
7586 Works as expected. Nicely made with quality material. 
7587 I love my Polaroid 
7588 The grip was not equipped to attach to the camera. A 2nd one was ordered and it was also missing the connection between the grip and the camera body. 
7589 works well 
7590 Works as well as any other filter set - and reasonably priced. 
7591 The quality is ok, but only 2 axes is a bit of a pain. Not the fault of the seller but I should have paid more attention. Was a good price so I ll find some use for it. 
7592 Audio is worthless. 
7593 Long camera rod. limited adapters. Wish it was made of metal so I can use it as a weapon also for self defense 
7594 Great product great price 
7595 Get what you pay for...zippers pull apart and seams have torn after a few months of occasional use. Not professional at all. If you use in home studio and don t move...work fine. 
7596 Bought two, only issue was the first one was programmed in Japanese, both work well were not to difficult to install. Have not been able to get the reverse camera to put up the grid in reverse. The directions are rather skimpy. 
7597 These are so fun to play with and a great alternative to the expensive colored Film. These are cheap and way more options. 
7598 It worked out perfectly!! 
7599 Very mobile and charges my camera batteries very quickly. 
7600 Great camera!!!! 
7601 Was not the quality of camera I was expecting. No instruction manual to tell you about the camera settings or how to use them. Accessories not for the same camera. So disappointed......... 
7602 I have used this item several times and great for the money. Durable and sturdy. The only thing that I was not impressed or found challenging was putting it together, but after watching several Youtube views I finally got it. Easy to pack way and comes with convenient carrying case. 
7603 TTL not reliable 
7604 This item does not project a clear video at night. When it switches over to black and white, there is a glare in picture- reflecting the camera image and as soon as it switches back over to color, the camera video looks fine. 
7605 Couldn t be happier! What a vendor! 
7606 small and sharp the lens hood doesn t lock falls off all the time pic come out sharp 
7607 very good item delivered as expected. 
7608 All good.. Perfect match.. 
7609 Great Selfie Stick There are so many selfie sticks available how do I choose? The fact of the matter is that most of them are very similar. Aluminum color, removable phone holder, & built in Bluetooth.The selfie is for fun and functional. 
7610 Works as advertised! I was a bit concerned about getting a generic battery for my camera, but with the official Sony battery being WAY too expensive, this was the only way to go. It worked flawlessly and gave me no issues at all. 
7611 The unit itself is decent the cameras are great resolution, but amcrest DVR s offer more capabilities, and worse yet the Hard drive failed in less than a week, requiring a warranty repair. 
7612 Does everything I wanted it to do. 
7613 Just a little tight, buts works great! 
7614 very small size, puffy, not comportable 
7615 Excellent for protecting artwork purchased at conventions. The sleeves can be full of static when you open them, so some weights of paper will be harder to put in than others will. 
7616 Service was execellent item arrived a day earlier than expected 
7617 I couldn t be more happy I would recommend to anyone 
7618 So far so good! 
7619 I am pleased with the product so far - it seems to have a good line of vision. Vincent was a great help to get my cameras set up on my wifi network 
7620 Cool 
7621 Great lens. People suggest this lens s boca effect is better than that of the 50mm f1.8 but I disagree! But it is a great lens to get those wider angle shots that you can t get with the 50mm. This and my 50mm make an awesome film making duo. 
7622 ok 
7623 I wanted to like this... I really really did. But it cannot hold the weight of a flash, receiver and umbrella. No matter how tight I made it. An entire shoot it was sideways. 
7624 Did not fit with the bundled flash unit. If seller is reading was disappointed with something that did not work. Less trouble to throw in the closet then return. 
7625 Great for the price, arrived quickly and fit my camera well. 
7626 easy to set up and excellent quality great customer service 
7627 it didnt fit 
7628 my wife loves her fujifilm instant camera. this is a bulk deal. 
7629 omg good 
7630 After using a different DVR system that just didn t quite match our needs, we came across this item and they are working perfectly. 
7631 Real like 
7632 Worked great 
7633 GREAT! Perfect for my needs. Highly recommend for home studio 
7634 The ball head is light enough not to put weight on a supporting arm, and strong enough to put a couple of lights or voice recorder on at no problem. It s nice to have several of them at my disposal. 
7635 High quality Fast delivery 
7636 my goddaughter loved her gift 
7637 Should have bought this sooner. I use the Manfrottos at work, bought this for personal use. I like it far more, though I wish the feet could be removed completely. 
7638 No more AA batteries and the weight that goes with them. 
7639 Works fine; fair quality. Better if had shutter activation button, available for same price in stores or online. 
7640 The product is great and easy to use, but the instructions are in broken english and don t really make sense. 
7641 These worked great for replacing existing switches that were damaged during window replacement.... Came with stick on double sided tape to make install on vinyl windows a snap... 
7642 Very disappointed. I own a60 d and side by side the t5i did not perform well. Indoor shots very dark and unfocused not sure if I got a bad copy of why. 
7643 cheaply made, does the job but you have to be careful with the case or it will break 
7644 Excellent toy 
7645 Highly rated for a reason! This camera does it all, and it had easy setup and easy operation. So pleased, we will be getting more! 
7646 good 
7647 Loved the length! but the sound quality is horrible, sometimes it sounded like i was under water! 
7648 Charged the batteries and they are working with no issues. Work in my Canon 70D just as advertised. 
7649 i m actually impressed by this. video is actually surprisingly good. pictures, not so hot. it has it s applications. 
7650 The picture quality is amazing. The camera was recommended by my fried that is a photographer and it has exceeded my expectations. Fantastic camera, great price and it comes with everything you need! 
7651 It was fun to be able to actually see the photos and pass them around for a laugh or too. to compare the dress up of the kids immediately was loads of fun. 
7652 He print a handbook for me, thanks a lt. 
7653 Good. 
7654 Exactly as described works wonderfully with our LG G4, no third party app needed. Very fast shipping.. 
7655 Good price. Go through these pretty fast with Arlo cameras. 
7656 This charger works great. With the wake feature I was able charge my old battery that wouldn t charge from my original Canon charger. The display is nice as it gives you a better idea as to the charge level and completion. 
7657 OEM, no quality problem 
7658 Works fine 
7659 Nicely made. Some pre-cut foam areas are oddly shaped and GoPro accessories won t fit. 
7660 plastic that you cannot even use. This appears to be a solid snap on piece like the water case, it is not. it is in fact a rubber mold, all one piece and was worthless. I trashed it. 
7661 nice package, everything included. 
7662 Not worth the money! 
7663 so far so good great for the cost. Batteries aren t the snuggest but it works and they stay put 
7664 Great replacement cords for the Zendure. Nice/fair price for three pack of replacement cords. Highly recommend! 
7665 Though not made by Nikon, this package is worth every dime spent. All items worked as described. Who could ask for anything more. 
7666 it works very good. 
7667 works perfectly. 
7668 I love it. It is worthwhile to buy it. 
7669 By far the best camera for a beginner and someone looking to start photography. As many of the other reviews have stated, the tripod is extremely flimsy but everything else in the package will exceed all of your expectations. This is definitely worth the price. You won t be disappointed. 
7670 Great product works great 
7671 Would not buy this again. The camera quality is not there but the app is even worse 
7672 i gave up on it and now the camera sits in a box. 
7673 Picture could be a little clearer and instructions should be in larged. Not read the fine print. 
7674 Arrived as promised and was the proper battery worked just fine, already charged. 
7675 ok 
7676 Low price. Works great. 
7677 Some film didn t come out 
7678 Awesome camera 
7679 Kind of wimpy and cheap style 
7680 Perfect fitting adapter. Couldn t ask for any more from a $20 adapter. 
7681 We got this for my daughter s 13th birthday. She loves it! 
7682 Received as pictured. 
7683 great little bits to keep in the bits-n-pieces camera stuff 
7684 Ok but still not the standard fifty 
7685 Didn t get the 1/4 inch loops for the camera bodies???? The strap feels good but I was a tad disappointed to discover the item was not complete... I m assuming the camera connection screws were supposed to be in the kit? 
7686 Can t beat it for the price! 
7687 Perfect little album 
7688 Did not work 
7689 Great product. Lost one Samsung phone in the lake when we hit a wake, between a dry bag and the yellow floats, this won t happen again. 
7690 Doesn t work in lowlight. 
7691 Works much better than other products on the market. I m satisfied. 
7692 Good for price exactly what I expected no more or less 
7693 This is a great little attachment. I was leaving my lens cap off and misplacing it constantly, until I attached one of these. Simple and effective. 
7694 Great product and fast shipping 
7695 great product would recommend it 
7696 Used to keep an eye on my dog during the day... and be able to tell her to knock it off if she s doing something naughty! Great product, super easy to set up. Very pleased. 
7697 Tighten the screws on the legs.. Other than that great tripod 
7698 I couldn t resist the style or Amazon s great price on this adorable, functional new leather case for my new Sony camera! 
7699 Excellent product 
7700 If your GoPro is attached to a selfie stick, you will need to use both floaties. Good stuff! 
7701 imitation, fake, counterfeit 
7702 Material that touches my neck irritates it. Wish i hadn t wasted my money. 
7703 Great camera, fast shipping 
7704 What a handy guide to have in your bag. I ve read the books and now carry this reference guide with me. Good advice for mere pennies. 
7705 Great stand for shooting YouTube videos with my iPhone. It s totally flexible and works great! 
7706 Love these filters, they really do let your high-end lenses perform. Cheap filters can add a lot of crap to an otherwise great lens. 
7707 Was a very quick order actually received two days ahead of schedule, extras in box were a nice touch and unexpected. Was quite happy with lense itself... 
7708 it works fine, fast delivery. 
7709 I like it,would like it better if it came with an ac\dc power chord. 
7710 barley holds to the glass 
7711 Loved it! 
7712 Unable to figure it out. Still trying. 
7713 Pointless A/V out, it already had Mini HDMI. an A/V Input would be much more useful 
7714 Works as advertised. I look at the sun daily, if it s out. Only drawback was that the telescope fits very tightly in the case. 
7715 Great lens! A little distortion though, but has worked well for astrophotography for me on sony a6000 
7716 Don t crank the head all the way up or it will stick. Other than that, it s great. 
7717 Works great 
7718 working great 
7719 Fits magic mouse VERY snug. 
7720 Terrible resolución only works with one user lags all the time, kills phone battery. worst camera on the market. 
7721 Just what I needed 
7722 Item was as expected and promptly arrived on time 
7723 Was just what I wanted. 
7724 The charger works great, but rating the Smatree Batteries at 1200mah is disingenuous. Neither last as long as an original GoPro battery rated at much less. 
7725 excellent product. 
7726 works but screams cheap. my MOVO motorized head is infinitely better for not much more money and also can be controlled as to transit and duration. 
7727 Solid filter, smooth rotation. I can t find any faults. Love this company s attention to detail and customer service followup. If you re looking for a CPL on a budget, Breakthrough s X1 is a solid choice. 
7728 I think this kit has all the accessories I can use to keep my Pentax K-50 camera clean and in good condition. 
7729 A good replacement for the original supply. 
7730 it fits perfect on my advance mini shoe of a Vixia HF G20, 
7731 only one zipper, so they leak a little. i ordered them to hold down soccer PUG s, and they work great for that. 
7732 Fit perfectly and if you wash it first and hang it moist it will dry smooth. 
7733 Works well and is reasonably priced. Next time, I would buy the larger size because the 3&#34; X 5&#34; size is just a little bit too small to handle effectively. 
7734 Love it 
7735 would not charge 
7736 perfect! 
7737 For the price it s amazing. 
7738 It s a good switch for dimming. It requires a neutral but it seems to dim smaller numbers of LEDs better than Lutron s non-neutral offerings. Just make sure you have access to the RadioRA 2 software beforehand. 
7739 Good product 
7740 Its a good little fanny pack, my guess is you pay a lot for the name. Also, despite the photo it does not come with a water bottle holder. 
7741 The camera would not generate the IP address needed for set up. Tech support started out with &#34;is it plugged in&#34;, seriously. I spent several hours troubleshooting, waste of time. 
7742 Very good equipment 
7743 very cute camera, can be powered by usb cable via computer. Easy set up, two way audio is very clear, clear picture. very suitable for baby room. 
7744 Better than I expected. Very sturdy and well built for the price. Only con is the lower section needs to be a little deeper. 
7745 We now have 3 of these around the house. They work well & allow me to keep an eye on my kids while they re in their rooms! Love them! 
7746 Hold the camera and fits over my fat head. No complaints. 
7747 awesome 
7748 Great Value! 
7749 Works as advertised and screen is easy to see 
7750 Easy and fun to use! 
7751 loving it 
7752 Great case!!! 
7753 great case love it 
7754 nice item 
7755 A great design, I ve used it numerous times already, the way it attached to a belt loop is great, (an angle) great zippers, great design and materials for my Sony Camera. 
7756 Works great, but it s literally just a 60minute egg timer. You can easily make one yourself for just a few bucks and a little ingenuity. 
7757 Works great, extra batteries are more powerful than the original camera battery. Very good price. 
7758 Exelent 
7759 Love it 
7760 this is a piece of junk. Wifi camera won t start Web site is in chinese - no help there. Instructions are very confusing 
7761 Love them easy to put on and take off and gives some supper pictures !!!!! Thanks Deb 
7762 Bought to store cigars while camping. 
7763 Camera arrived as advertised. Very pleased with it. No issues. 
7764 Excelente 
7765 Price was right and it continues to work well 6 months later. 
7766 Connects my camera to the DVR on my surveillance system. They do the job. 
7767 Easy to set up, stable won t tip over. mine had no carry case if it did it would get another star. Works get for product pictures on a white back ground, not so goof for clothing site. Room will not warm up much. 
7768 Great idea but little pricey. Janeb 
7769 High quality. Excellent 
7770 Works great until they break at the foot of the 600ex-rt. 2 recent ones broke only after several months of use - the plastic used here apparently is not nearly as good as previous versions. 
7771 A++++++++ Highly Recommend 
7772 Turned out to be a little smaller than I was hoping for, but I still love it!! Really only fits my camera with a lens attached and then a second lens. 
7773 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
7774 great price 
7775 This is excellent for those occasions when you have to work without an assistant. 
7776 Great little flashlight. And it really is waterproof. 
7777 Looks like a toy. Doesn t work as great as i thought it would. 
7778 If your an action person, excellent 
7779 Fits nicely, makes using the GoPro while riding a motorbike or even driving much safer 
7780 It has a nice feel, but with the weight distribution it was hard to keep from spinning. 
7781 These studio lights serve their purpose. What a great purchase. 
7782 Fantastic! Planning on purchasing the DCR-250 as well! 
7783 Fits my camera perfectly. 
7784 It has high-quality video capabilities but it is not as functional as the FujiKam HD. It is stationary and cannot be moved remotely using the available mobile app. 
7785 Nice thick cables, worked well. 
7786 Always buy extras so you have them to replace if you shoot a lot out doors. 
7787 Battery works well in Nikon camera. I have had them for a few months now and under moderate use the batteries do now not hold a charge as long as they did initially. 
7788 Thankyou 
7789 well I am trying the tummy slimming body women s shapewear it is made with quality material and is very interesting to wear feels great..great product..I received this product in exchange for an honest review.. 
7790 My daughter is a youtube wannabe star so I had to set her up right! she loves it 
7791 Does not come with the case as descibed. Will not work without it. 
7792 Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
7793 Great package of products! Everything you need to start taking great pictures. Very pleased. 
7794 Wow! This a the perfect case for the Phantom. It is well designed and tough! 
7795 Good quality --better made than most albums at this price. I will buy another one. 
7796 Does what I need as extra battery power 
7797 Charged batteries one time so far with no problems. 
7798 Love these little albums. Perfect for mini 8 camera. The color of the album matches my camera. Love that. 
7799 Got it fast, works great. I absolutely love this feature on the Nikon D3300. 
7800 The color is great but it requires a lot of editing to smooth out the background. This is my only seamless that shows up as wrinkled/dented in photos. 
7801 so cool - my daughter is having a blast using this and all her friends are looking into getting one as well 
7802 Great delivery time. Work great. 
7803 Product as promised 
7804 Great tripod! Inexpensive, but works well for iPhone 6+ and my Nikon D300. 
7805 Simple to set up, clear picture quality. 
7806 Not the best, but very usefull! 
7807 Surprisingly solid. 
7808 This is great. Wish I had gotten it BEFORE the screen got all scratched up in the first place. 
7809 The Clik holds my D700 with battery holder and 15-30, 2.8 lenses attached, 2 flashes, 2 other lenses and my 13&#34; macbook pro and all essentials. Great comfortable backpack. 
7810 dropped it and it still works! Takes great pictures, get a lot of good comments on them. recommended to my friends who ask what camera it is. 
7811 Very good product works great only thing I would do is bring back wave points 
7812 I travel with SLR & Hasselblad camera equipment. This shoulder pad will work on any strap. If you need relief from weight ..this strap is it. 
7813 Just don t do it...... Had to send my camera to Canon after this caused my camera to short. $400 to fix the camera. Just don t buy it..... If you buy it make sure you don t use it. 
7814 Have taken awesome pictures with it still don t think I have met full potential 
7815 Totally cute! 
7816 I do like this product. My only complaint is that the straps could be a little bit longer. It works as advertised, keeping the camera stable at your side. It is much, much better than your typical neck strap. 
7817 I have my car as and equipment in this case. I love the protective compartments in the case. 
7818 Very happy 
7819 Absolutely an amazing lens, even on my outdated Epl-5. 
7820 bad focus 
7821 Fits - timely delivery 
7822 Great case! 
7823 love the low profile and wide base, great for bench rest shooting for my spotting scope 
7824 Works good. 
7825 Works fine 
7826 This Camera is no where near 1080p full hd...very graining videos ....here is a sample video http://youtu.be/xlbcBhx98NI 
7827 Room for everything 
7828 Gives you a little sparkle to your pictures 
7829 Just perfect , thought , tight and smooth , I use this for my two super takumar in a 5D 
7830 It is very useful. 
7831 Beautiful and beautifully crafted! Absolutely love this. Quick delivery as well. 
7832 Item arrived on time and works great! 
7833 It worked well straight out of the box. the packing was adequate to protect it and assure safe arrival. The arrival was timely as advertised. 
7834 not for a nex 3 
7835 Love it! 
7836 I guess I missed the part about this being a flimsy tripod, but then you get what you pay for I guess. 
7837 Very nice picture,easy to use and works better than three other brands bought. 
7838 This item broke within 10 minutes of me wearing it. I am very dissatisfied with this product. My camera is now sunk to the bottom of the ocean floor due to their faulty product. 
7839 this is a great case. i wish the leather looked a little more weathered. it s a little plastic like look but it s ok. hopefully it wears out a little to give it a cooler older look. 
7840 Everyone needs one of these.... unless you don t know how flight works. Then please, for the love of God, don t. 
7841 They didn t explain how to use them so they are pretty worthless. 
7842 Works as expected. Fits wrist comfortably; floats camera. Good quality. 
7843 Good size and light weight, the zipper tag did rip making the zipper only 3/4 to close the bag. 
7844 Good Quality! 
7845 Sturdy, well-built piece of gear. Able to shoot in landscape or portrait orientation with simple twist of the locking knob to rotate the swivel head. 
7846 it worked great 
7847 Awesome! 
7848 Just what I wanted. 
7849 Older camcorder and the power adapter got lost. Now I can down load all those 8mm videos.... 
7850 My daughter and her hubby love them. If they are happy, so am I !! 
7851 Great light protective cover 
7852 quick delivery. Would order again 
7853 love it...light! 
7854 Awesome camera!! 
7855 Bought and shipped from Chinese dealer for $100.00 US. The price was GREAT and it arrived new in the box. It works perfectly. I would avoid all non OEM adapters as they are all loose fitting. 
7856 Needs a carry case. Works great even though color temp should be 5500 instead of 5400. It s still a little green. Not a problem with white balance. 
7857 Great deal! 
7858 they did really geart ,we got al lot of photos from these cameras 
7859 Love being able to take anywhere and the selfi feature! 
7860 Great camera. Good transaction. 
7861 Fit perfectly wirh my sony a6000 camera. Thanks. 
7862 This product may work well, but I wanted and expected it to be white (looks very white on your web site). It is gray!! Now what? 
7863 Its not an expensive filter, works well for the price but when you want high quality in your pictures buy a high quality filter. 
7864 thin , easy to use 
7865 great camera. Takes great pics for the money 
7866 good 
7867 Very nice quality! Filled with gravel and despite the weight it is holding up well! I especially like the double zipper. I doesn t give me the impression it s going to open and spill the contents everywhere. The size also fits securely over my tripod legs. Highly recommend! 
7868 Everything went fine 
7869 Perfect size for a 7&#34; monitor and cords. 
7870 They are pretty much perfect. Durable, open wide enough, not too expensive. I m happy with my purchase. 
7871 Great product 
7872 Works great when changing telescope lenses at night. Well made. Highly recommended. 
7873 Filters worked great in 20-40 feet of water. I don t have experience with other filters but it was much better than no filter at all. We slipped the filter on after submerging to prevent bubbles. 
7874 Really good definition and practic. 
7875 great bag, it has a weather proof cover in the front zippered area 
7876 Awesome, floats and good quality fit 
7877 The battery can last around 3 hours after one charge.It works great on my 2m LED strip. The LED indicator on battery shows on or off of switch. It turns green while battery be full charged, Great 
7878 Works great!! I bought this with the ASUS S1 LED Projector, and they are a perfect combo!! 
7879 Works surprisingly well. I wiped significant grease and smudges off my sunglasses with no cleaning solution or water. 
7880 The originals at a reasonable price quickly delivered 
7881 it works 
7882 The zipper is hard and bendibg didnt think a higer tier pro bag will be that hard to close zipper my canon 6d fits inside even with a battery grip with a tiny bit of pressure and kit lens 24-105 attached gave it 3* only because of the bending zipper 
7883 This charger worked great for 3 months and then died. 
7884 Love love love! Can t stop taking pictures!! 
7885 The camera and accessories were the highlight of the party. The kids were able to take pictures home to keep rather than waiting for the emails. The different lenses and the covers for the pictures worked out well. 
7886 Have yet to try it snorkeling, but above water it is fine. 
7887 Lightweight and durable. 
7888 We got these for our Arlo security system. Even fully charged, they did not show as &#34;fully charged&#34; They were dead in a matter of hours. Definitely not worth the price. 
7889 Not very secure or stable 
7890 Small and effecient. Foot adhesive was a bit frail. One of the feet pulled off. 
7891 Great camera, great seller. 
7892 Pleasure doing business with! Everything as promised! 
7893 The only thing that I am a little disapointed in is that it is not fully waterproof. Thanks for your quick delivery Vic Sheahan 
7894 Just right 
7895 Works great. Very adjustable. 
7896 Much larger and bulkier than the Nikon version. 
7897 Good unit at the right price. Make certain the focal plane is absolutely vertical, and you will yield great results. 
7898 Exactly what I needed and at a very reasonable price. 
7899 Never work....... Waist of money. 
7900 At least half of these so far have had little to no charge but still way cheaper then the energizer or Duracell options. 
7901 Meh. The tripod broke almost right away, so don t buy it for that. The rest was OK. 
7902 Perfect 
7903 This product was smashing amazing. Arrived so quick and was well packaged. Great explaination of how to apply it. And I wasn t expecting to get protector for the view finder and the control panel. So was really impressed. 
7904 Good case 
7905 Buyer beware! It is O K for the price. Sometimes it does not work. 
7906 awesome product. I have tried some of the standalone versions, some cheaper some more expensive. This has been the best by far. 
7907 This is a very sturdy and useful mount. I use it frequently in the shoulder position. I m impressed at its stability. It s a very clever and flexible design and has encouraged more frequent usage of my Action Cam. 
7908 Great filter. 
7909 I am sure that it will be fine when I finally receive the Adapter/Charger which has been delayed twice already! 
7910 This bag has all I need, I am very happy with the size and all storage bags it has. In summary this bag is perfect to someone that loves to travel light but with everything necessary to take good photographies. 
7911 Not interactive window. Otherwise nice case 
7912 Does not support the weight of my standard digital slr camera. 
7913 Just as described works perfect I would recommend this product to family and friends 
7914 TriPod stand broke after a few uses 
7915 Work well to protect lenses. 
7916 Fantastic macro lens for close-up nature photography and slight telephoto (like a 60 mm on an old film slr.) Excellent price. It s a little bigger than a compact telephoto. Works well with my ds5500. I am very pleased with this lens. Bought from Beach camera- great, fast shipping. 
7917 Cheaper than old polaroid film and better imho 
7918 The lense does a great job. I paid for the 2x converter as well but didn t get it. So you won t get everything you pay for, beware. 
7919 As good as expected slowmo 60fps and 120fps amazing quality and with removable Battery plus 2 hour record fantasic for Martial arts if your an instructor. Price is another plus looking at another since I use the three camera setup. Back up good idea 
7920 JUST GOT IT TODAY...BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!!! THANK YOU 
7921 Works great, much better pic than the cheap one I had before, I need to get the second one installed out back real soon. 
7922 I use a pair of these to place multiple flash heads in 72 inch parabolic umbrellas for large group shots. It is well-built and sturdy. 
7923 Works great 
7924 Excellent case! It gives plenty of room for all the various items you need for a day of flying! 
7925 Almost completely satisfied but one of the lens did not fit my camera! 
7926 Excelente!! 
7927 Nice ..big ..great price 
7928 Everything was as stated and good quality for a great price. 
7929 Works great and has last up to my teenager thumping it around in the camera bag. 
7930 cannot get sound to work and pic quality is real bad, will never get another one. 
7931 Easy hookup and met my expectation: now i can finally spy on my neighbors. 
7932 Good quality, worked well. 
7933 Perfect camera 
7934 Room for my quick disconnect prop guards, 3 batteries, my tablet, controller and my props. Great quality! 
7935 Good 
7936 Exactly what I needed. Great price. Works as advertised. 
7937 It did not come with a selfie camera, so while it still works as an Instax, I give it one star for lying on its description. 
7938 I am electrical engineer with RF / wireless & US air force sensors training. it is hard to imagine a better value for home alarms than this fortress system...highly recommended :) 
7939 Great to have it. nice packaged. 
7940 great 
7941 I was looking for a good time laps camera release...WORKS GREAT 
7942 This little camera recorded the burglary of my home. Police officers viewing images captured the by Nest Cam recognized the robber! Now the crook is in jail with his 6th burglary charge. Can t brag enough about this camera. 
7943 GREAT 
7944 My kid loved it 
7945 Terrible quality 
7946 better than expected for the price 
7947 Say somthing and comes opposite 
7948 Battery doesn t last long. It died to quickly. 
7949 fits stands and umbrellas 
7950 The camera and kit were exactly what I expected and worked perfectly. 
7951 Amazing little camera!! Very interested in seeing the next release as well! Very cool device! The size is amazing and the quality is pretty good too. Battery life is not so great, but to be expected with the size of the device as well as reading other reviews. 
7952 Great item -reat Product - love the way it operates so smoothly. 
7953 Well worth cost. Batteries work great. 
7954 Works for me. 
7955 An excellent alternative to OEM 70-300mm lens — just as good as Nikon or Canon for less money. 
7956 It works great and the price is very good. 
7957 Excellent little battery and price point. 
7958 fast delivery. Good product. 
7959 this camera is really neat. the service folks were great. I highly recommend fujicam 8/10/2015 
7960 Fits just fine on my hero 4 black. I was a little scared at first that i would break it trying to get the case over the camera, but it seems to be pretty durable. Best thing is that you can charge the camera while it is in the case. 
7961 Does the job! It is pretty big, bigger than I expected. I didn t really pay too close attention when I ordered it or I would have gotten the medium just because it would be easier to store. 
7962 Perfect case to put all my lenses and bodies together for a remote shoot. 
7963 My fiancé loved using it at the beach! 
7964 I am very happy with the accessory kit I received for my Nikon Coolpix AW 120. I would recommend this to anyone. 
7965 Nice little package. Everything I wanted and expected. 
7966 Not even got the charge, and this is the second one i bough from Amazon the first one was broken at the time of delivery. 
7967 Worked out great. 
7968 I feel whimsical when I watch movies on it! 
7969 I was delighted with the product supplied. 
7970 Charged my Canon battery as soon as I received this charger, no problems at all in installing or charging. 
7971 Arrived 4 dias before! excelent! 
7972 Great and fast service 
7973 Nice Tripod, very stable and easy to use! 
7974 Sent it back. Instructions way too complicated for my technology capable husband. A gift for him. He spent one entire day trying to input a all the info. I should have listened to the reviews I read and bought something else. 
7975 Works well 
7976 Hard to setup. And battery life sucks. Will be returning it 
7977 Batteries fit well and last as long as the OEM battery at a great price. Love being able to charge 3 batteries at a time. 
7978 Great item, very strong base. Thank You 
7979 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
7980 Works good with camera and is fun to use 
7981 Worked for about 1 second with the new batteries that I purchased with this order. Back it goes!! 
7982 Shipping was fast and order was exactly what was described. No complaints on this order 
7983 Poor quality. You can get the same quality for $4 in Chinatown 
7984 love it!!! 
7985 I really like this camera, its light and easy to carry around with me and have a manual mode. 
7986 OK so far.. No problems to report. 
7987 Optic are kind of okay but your phone adopter is very poorly made it it is off the track very easy and flimsy!!! 
7988 Excelent product 
7989 Good! 
7990 Very fun glad I had it for my trip! 
7991 Excellent product. Thanks! 
7992 This camcorder looks absolutely gorgeous. Once you get used to the controls which are very simple, using it becomes second nature. The recording quality is great. Truly a great deal. 
7993 Snapped in riptide current. 
7994 Gracias! 
7995 Great! 
7996 The UV Filter was an excellent product and is working very well. 
7997 did not work well. 
7998 Very easy to apply - just follow the instructions. All but invisible when fitted and works exactly as described. 
7999 What s not to love? It s the Cadillac of quads, the one against which all others are measured. 
8000 Great camera with an impressive zoom. Haven t tried the wi-fi feature yet. Controls are logical and easy to use. 
8001 Very cute, makes great pictures 
8002 as advertised 
8003 I own Lion Security Specialist Inc.to compete i look for great values and this was one, thank you Amazon. 
8004 Had issues with the battery! would not take full charge. 
8005 My daughter is very pleased with the gift I got her. 
8006 Feels cheap but its works fine. 
8007 It was cheap and it works 
8008 Got it fast and works perfect. Nice to have an extra, I m sure I will order another as I tend to lose these 
8009 This was a European model so the power supply had a European plug Had to call and buy a 120v power supply...bummer 
8010 i can t believe this. the software is on amazon although foxhole has stopped supporting it. so why was it sold to me and why did i waste my time learning how to use a software that is no longer supported? This is a matter worthy of litigation 
8011 So far so good. What an awesome deal! Exactly as described. 
8012 Item is as described. Works great. 
8013 Junk. I was trying to save money but instead got a flash that fell apart, didn t work, and took up space in my bag. Spend the extra and get the one for your camera from the manufacture. 
8014 Fits screen perfectly and stays where you need it. I will getting more of these for sure. 
8015 very nice step up ring, my lenses and filters love it. 
8016 Great image quality, awesome zoom. Great versatility in choosing photography settings, as well as making movies with zoom or making highspeed video (slow motion). And all in one rather compact camera. 
8017 Good charger Worthless batteries 
8018 Batteries seem to work as advertised. No long term experience yet. Delivery was much sooner than expected. 
8019 EXCELLENT COMPLETELY MET MY EXPECTATION 
8020 perfect. this one is your absolute best bet. i ordered another brand before this one for less money and had to throw it out. this one is well worth the money, bulit well and works as it should. 
8021 I see you 
8022 I take this everywhere I go. I havent met someone who has had this one yet but i always get some looks for having the coolest pole. The grip is comfortable and the arm extends to a pretty decent length. Its sturdy even when extended. Highly recommend! 
8023 Excellent screen protection film kit which I bought from Amazon UK and applied to both of my Pentax 645D camera bodies. Very easy to apply, it is giving good protection to two cameras in constant daily use. Thoroughly recommended, a great product. 
8024 I like this tripod for what i need it for which is not every day use. Its definitely sturdy for my camera. Only complaint the quick release plate had a piece fall off of it the first day. But i am pretty happy with it 
8025 loved this fits everything you need for a shorter trips! 
8026 Defective 
8027 Love this camera. It is versatile and easy enough for the point and shoot crowd, but allows novices to advance to intermediates and it allows intermediates to move up a few levels. 
8028 Easy to use and clarity is awesome 
8029 Light and junky but gets the job done. 
8030 LOVE having a spare battery while vacationing! 
8031 Works perfectly with my Canon Rebel T5. Very economical and you can t beat the performance. 
8032 Not too bad for the price 
8033 VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !! 
8034 Watch for Warranty! Got 2 of this a couple of month ago and 1 got out of order, and Hikvision refused it s warranty coverage. Very bad![[ASIN:B00G7GMEOG Hikvision DS-2CD2032-I Outdoor HD 3MP IP Bullet Security Camera 4mm]] 
8035 Returned it due to difficulty setting up. 
8036 Has worked great. 
8037 We got these for the father-in-law who misplaced the charger for his camera. This package with two additional batteries was the perfect answer to prepare the father-in-law with everything he needed for a week long trip to the National Parks. 
8038 High quality and a reasonable price. Smooth rotating and good results (as good as the photographer). Why paying so many $ for other. Very satisfied. 
8039 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
8040 My 13 year old Granddaughter loves it ! 
8041 Just as described. 
8042 I ve yet to be able to get it to work correctly...but I m hopeful 
8043 I have been having entirely too much fun with this lens. 
8044 Can t go wrong for the price. 
8045 Worked fine until she took it and got it stolen. 
8046 Plenty stout and versatile for my full sized rebel Cannon digital camera. 
8047 Not only does it have physical zoom, it has a digital zoom. Even at maximum zoom the pictures are crisp and clear. Easy to use. Great pictures. What a camera is supposed to do. Have not tried the video. Still it does what I want. Anything else is pure bonus. 
8048 works fine but found the lost one two hours after i ordered this one 
8049 good value, it supports my heavy 20-60 x 80mm Vortex Viper spotting scope well. A product really has to knock my socks off to get a 5 star 
8050 As advertised. Great camera, arrived on time. 
8051 Works great Extra one in case I lose the first one 
8052 Excellent product, first I bought 1 camera after I installed by the way easy installation , the night vision is way better them those expensive ones. I decided to buy two more , clean colors ind zoom work great. 
8053 It s very nice, works well 
8054 Love camera and All the advantages 
8055 Two day prime was five days! And the new camera I bought may have been factory reconditioned. Charger and Battery don t work. have to return. Either bad luck or bad business... 
8056 Feels big and cheap, especially compared to the OEM charger, but it works. 
8057 잘 받았습니다 I received well! Actually i canceled many times(of dollar converting issues) but seller didn t care when i saw. anyway thanks x 1000000 times!!! have a nice day ~ (from korea) 
8058 good 
8059 Works good! got it set up in no time. 
8060 works as described good fitment 
8061 Excellent, fast and small. 
8062 Gorgeous packaging and a nice little velvet case. Works flawlessly, with a larger button that is easier to press than the stock one I lost. Great purchase! The slide-out easy battery replacement is a plus also. 
8063 it works. 
8064 as described. 
8065 Good Value for a case. the foam is easy to use and customize. quality is not premium, but it is quite good and good enough for most uses. 
8066 excellent product. 
8067 I happy with it. Just wish it had a rechargeable battery. 
8068 No happy with this product. No smooth swivel action. Very jerky and hard to turn. I never should have bought. 
8069 Great product that fits perfectly onto my stands that I use for video and photography. A little on the cheaper side but still gets the job done nonetheless. Holds my flashes just fine. 
8070 I love it! very nice and trendy. I received the item earlier than I expected. Thank you Amazon and MegaGear. 
8071 This is my 2nd Panasonic 7-14. I flooded my original lens by accident getting out of my kayak. The Panasonic GX7 camera the lens was attached to had no such issues and survived the dunking quite well. This sample and my original 7-14 lens were remarkably sharp and well corrected. 
8072 Yes, it works and the arduino knows about it. 
8073 Fantastic product. It feels like part of the camera. I should have picked the darker leather, but that s my fault. 
8074 love it. 
8075 Did not come with the two rubber inserts. 
8076 It is a very good starter set for this camera 
8077 I took it to Hawaii and went zip lining! They had a helmet with a GroPro clip! Its small but mighty 
8078 Great camera, has everything I need to get started. This is my first DSLR and I find it quite easy to use. 
8079 This is a great camera bag. Highly recommend. 
8080 Great product as described!!! Awesome seller! 
8081 I love flashpoint products, this one is no different. The diffuser cover is a bit fussy to get on, but it s really not an issue. 
8082 This innocent looking motion detector is fantastic. Picture quality is great. No one should notice their real purpose of video surveillance. 
8083 Great for macro. Used it to take closeup shots of eyes. 
8084 Awesome charger and batteries. I have the hero 4 black and these batteries work perfect and just as well as the one that came with the camera. The charger charges all 3 at once no problem. Or just 1 or 2 whatever your needs are. Highly reccomend! 
8085 Very easy setup and use. Good picture quality. Very happy with my purchase. 
8086 Nice 
8087 Great batteries to get for great price but those batteries drain little faster than original go pro hero battery. 4.5/5 
8088 ended up selling this on craigslist. kept locking up and overheating. made a great doorstop. 
8089 Love it! Some of the menu options are a bit hard to understand, and the included manual isn t very helpful, but luckily there are tons of tutorials about every feature online! 
8090 Love this works great! 
8091 I love Canons. Been using them for years. Love the rebel series. This was/is my first camcorder and got it for family funtions. Great quality!! So compact and ships to you fast! 
8092 I bought it for my daughter to play with. The pictures are blurry & grainy. 
8093 Perfect fit 
8094 Purchased a bunch of these. Really super! Love the new insert to give the &#34;v&#34; groove an option to be flat. Got to see it to understand. 
8095 Have not had to use it but glad I purchased it. 
8096 Very nice pouch s for my lens.Made very well and looks great too!Well worth the money to protect your valuable lens. 
8097 Great product 
8098 Great lens. Sharp and cheap! 
8099 Perfect size for X100T--but be careful to order the right one from the pull-down menu Installation was easy with no lint or bubbles, and it was even fun thanks to the humorous instructions. 
8100 I am sorry I cannot give a review as that item was ordered erroneously and returned. 
8101 I just love this camera, ease of use, takes great pictures and video. 
8102 very limited usefulness. i threw mine away immediately. 
8103 Works perfectly for my go pro and my Sony 4k actioncam Get one. You ll love it 
8104 Very good 
8105 Extremely clear and bright view. I use this for terrestrial viewing of the beach and mountains and it works amazingly well. I can also see the rings of Saturn with this! This model was a huge upgrade over the entry level Celestron 100mm spotting scope. 
8106 Lot s of light for the buck. Still not as user friendly as LED light panels. The green screen is thinner than what i expected and it doesn t all fit into the bag. Give your self lots of time to set up for interview and you should be good. 
8107 Quick delivery and great product! 
8108 Good camera 
8109 Great. Just wished the voice and speaker sound was better. 
8110 I had to return right away. Broken right out of the box and VERY flimsy. The neck screw to loosen or tighten the legs was broken as well as one of the legs would not lock into place for the bottom section. 
8111 Description said 30 LED would light up, as shown in the picture. The ones received only have one blinking red light. Disappointed in the description. 
8112 Nice! good Build quality. 
8113 Perfect... 
8114 Thanks 
8115 worked as advertised. the European adapter is a nice plus. 
8116 This tripod is a great value. It is of much higher quality than I was expecting for the price. I bought it to use with my spotting scope and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a low profile tripod to use on your shooting bench. 
8117 Fast shipping and exactly as described 
8118 Batteries were a perfect addition for my camera. Product as described and love that there is a travel charger included since we re doing a good amount of traveling around Hawaii taking pictures. 
8119 Met my needs. Great shipping. 
8120 awesome gift for my hubby he loves it 
8121 Works well for what it is. A perfect fit for my SoTech Mission Go Bag. 
8122 It does what it suppose to do. 
8123 Gave me plenty of back up 
8124 Works very well. My inital use was to create slides for a presentation. Very happy with this camera. 
8125 Good tripod for studio work, but too bulky to carry in the field. 
8126 They work just fine. The charger isn t as good as the Panasonic charger, but it works. 
8127 Works great and fits perfectly 
8128 Great strap for my Fuji XPro1. Really don t use the bag. 
8129 Worked great. Nothings perfect, but it works. The stem that goes into battery insert in the camera, seems a little fragile. Handle with care. Overall, good product. Glad I purchased it, lasted a lot longer since I use my 70D for video. 
8130 Bought this to replace a lower resolution camera. When I hooked it up, the image was black and white and continually rolled. Sending it back. 
8131 Good deal 
8132 Great product. Easy to use and setup. 
8133 Good 
8134 I bought this a while ago, it is still holding a good charge. I have noticed no difference in this vs the Nikon. 
8135 Great image quality. You lose one stop but it does a wonderful/clear job extending the range of the lens. 
8136 Great macro lens and rounds out a nice set of lens offerings for the e-Mount/A7 series of Sony camera bodies. 
8137 Gives you an excellent view with 2x magnification. 
8138 Doesn t fit the GoPro 4 
8139 I received the go pro lcd + for Father s Day I purchased this after some legwork on Amazon I am very happy with this product and feel confident that my gopro will remain safe and secure even though this is not an exact fit for it 
8140 Great little camera. It takes great pictures at night and in low light setting too. 
8141 As advertised, on time, works great. 
8142 Warning. My Wasabi charger died after approximately one year. The battery works ok. 
8143 Package arrived on time and the product is as described. It fits my Cannon 450D. 
8144 Works perfectly on my Canon FD 85mm f/1.2 and my Sony A7II. No movement, looks great, and works perfectly! I like to leave the adapters obn the lenses, so I will have to buy another one for my other FD lens. 
8145 This binocular has excellent vision. 
8146 Great quality batteries. Got these for my gopro hero 4 and they work great. Just as good quality as the gopro batteries at about half the price. Great buy 
8147 This is a fabulous product! 
8148 The camera is very good. Easy to operate and takes great pics. The added accessory is junk. 
8149 It does not fit my 4 Silver. 
8150 Just your normal battery charger. Nothing exciting. 
8151 Great lens, quality as expected. Great shipper! 
8152 I have purchased six Yongnuo flash units in the past and was completely satisfies that I got my monies worth. This is the first unit that I m dissatisfied with. 
8153 LOVE! This will probably be my new favorite lens on my D5300!! Excellent photo quality! 
8154 Almost all you need to work with an action camera 
8155 I have had this replaced three times in the past week. None of them work. Two of the batteries warped upon first use. CHEAPEST PRODUCT EVER DO NOT BUY 
8156 Perfect. 
8157 I will be in Nepal for 5 weeks trekking and I want enough battery life for my camera. I wish there was a USB charger. 
8158 i have used mine for the last ski season on my helmet, am very happy with it. but buy fast sdmc chip for it( high transfer rate) and it works great. Heck of a deal with all the accessories. Isn t a gopro but it also isn t $400 
8159 The picture quality is great and the supplied software is easy to use 
8160 Loved the camera, accessories where a waste: oversized bag and tripod the holder for the SDs , etc ... prefer accessories that match the product like smaller case, helmet or wrist mounts, etc 
8161 like very much 
8162 Software for remote viewing frequently stops streaming regardless of signal strength or connection method. Disappointing. 
8163 PERFECT and so affordable for such a quality item... THANKS, J 
8164 Good little ball head. Nothing amazing, but it works and it s a good deal. 
8165 This is not worth the money I spent on it and will be sending it back I and very disappointed with this 
8166 Really improved shooting and composing ease but it s just too bulky to fit with the tripod carrying bag. 
8167 For some vacation, I do need a affordable and waterproof camera 
8168 This is everything I need to have a great time with a gopro. Awesome kit 
8169 That was a funny time. 
8170 Good Batteries, better than other brands with higher amp hour. 
8171 Prints really clear 
8172 Affordable, works, what more can you say! 
8173 Solid estructure, very large. Easy to fold and light to carry 
8174 Great case for the price why waste your money on a name brand one. 
8175 Use it twice never damaged it but it started shutting off by itself I guess the product had it defects 
8176 Looks ok 
8177 The description should be changed. You cannot get film for this camera. It is useless ! Do not buy! If you want to look at it or collect them then but it. If you want to use it you are out of luck! 
8178 These work as stated but if you use large CFL bulbs for photography you need to take caution when screwing them in. The sockets are barely strong enough to support the weight of such larger bulbs. 
8179 Easy to install. Easy on and off. Good product 
8180 it makes good pictures 
8181 yes 
8182 The camera its self is great. Great picture and clarity. But the mounting bracket is cheap and doesn t hold the camera, it falls off all the time and even with the instructions it hard to navigate through the setting. 
8183 Compact, easy to use, has extra features, and takes great pictures. 
8184 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
8185 Works as a recorder and video. Hard to tell if it s on or off and no way to tell &#34;what&#34; part of the item being video d is being recorded - for example if you want to record someones face, there s no way to tell if you are. 
8186 I love my camera, I m enjoying taking pictures and learning how to use it to get the best quality. 
8187 Good for people like to do some sport or some movie free to move 
8188 Great tools, it has everything that I need in cleaning my SLR. I m also impressed with the fast delivery. 
8189 ok 
8190 works as planed 
8191 https://youtu.be/2uKrjo2SMuA 
8192 Excellent kit, camera takes very clear pictures and works as intended. Great Value. 
8193 Great product!!!! 
8194 These photography reflectors are awesome!!! I totally recommend them! 
8195 It s a great camera pictures are great even when all the way zoomed in they are still pretty good.In low light it s also good all of my low light pictures turn out good. 
8196 quality product, arrived quickly. 
8197 Exactly what I needed, much longer than the original which is helpful. 
8198 Great. 
8199 Excellent flash to use. 
8200 Extreemly good quality for the price. Almost as good as my Nikons that were twice the price. I would buy them just to have them in the car. 
8201 love it worked wonderfully to take family pictures with in combination with the Altura Photo E-TTL Flash Kit for CANON DSLR 
8202 This replaced a crappy Walmart special. I m definitely happy with this. It is heavy, so don t plan on backpacking with it. That does make it nice and sturdy though. 
8203 Bought last year, was still in unopened package and installed last week. Waited because I was undergoing chemo. Replaced battery, doesn t work at all. After reading multiple other reviews where people received ones that never worked, I would give this item a -1 if I could. 
8204 A true 360ws strobe for this price is really a great deal. I tested it and got F22 at 10 , 100ISO...that s a GN of 220 measured in feet.... !!!! I have used it a few times and so far it s held up very well. 
8205 This kit is really great!! It makes my pics much focused and wider. The fisheye lens is awesome for panoramic photos. 
8206 hoping for aluminum ! 
8207 Outstanding quality and function with nice rubber grip and very useful water tight space to store things such as thumbscrews or other GoPro parts. Overall it is a very nice, high quality bobber and worth the small additional cost to gain a better design and useful compartment. 
8208 ok 
8209 Great product. 
8210 I purchased these to use while snorkeling & kayaking. They fit perfectly on disposable waterproof cameras, were comfortable on my wrists and kept the camera afloat when it bounced out of the kayak. 
8211 perfect as described 
8212 Worked great on a BIG Lab!! 
8213 I bought this camera as a beginner camera for me. I love and and am still learning. 
8214 Not hard to use at all, simple entry level light meter. This was a great purchase for a photography student like myself, and it fits nicely into the camera bag which is always appreciated. 
8215 Martin Powell THIS TECH WAS GREAT UNDERSTOOD HIM. HELP ME OUT ALL THE WAY. I APPRECIATE IT. IRWIN 
8216 Received on time as promised and I feel this cap will last longer (not get lost) because of the strap attached to the cap 
8217 Really great design. Changes the look of the Sony A7. Usually gets lots of compliments 
8218 Works great. Fast delivery 
8219 Great buy, versatile, small, but not too, and I use it in the classroom and it is great 
8220 The battery and the travel charger are NOT FOR THIS CAMERA! The charger clearly says for a NIKON and the battery is the WRONG SIZE! Do not waste teh extra $20 thinking you are getting a good deal, You are better off buying the extra battery and travel charger elsewhere. 
8221 A perfect match and fit. I am very happy with the purchase 
8222 I am happy with this purchase, !!! 
8223 Great case for the money. Refill foam is available, which is great if you change your usage. Solid hard case. 
8224 Works great 
8225 Haven t been able to use it as it is missing the top bracket 
8226 Pricey, but works as designed and does a great job. 
8227 Extremely affordable and you can fit two light for night time shooting. 
8228 as advertised, no issues with quality or performance 
8229 This is invaluable for setting up a variable focus camera, while you re up on a ladder. It s self-contained and straps to your wrist, and even provides power to the camera so you can view exactly what the camera sees, before you finalize placement. 
8230 I am not real enthusiastic about the picture quality. The picture will jump for days on in and then finally stop. Get what you pay for I guess 
8231 Great filter for the price! 
8232 For the money it can t be beat, purchased as a spare to my Canon 430 speedlite, limited in someways but a great backup and came in quick, just before my vacation. 
8233 Really great lights if you are starting out with portrait photography. Great price and they work great. 
8234 product is great but delivery by USPS leave a lot to be desired 
8235 Correct part and on time delivery 
8236 As advertised. Well worth buying refurbished. 
8237 Well made. Reasonably priced 
8238 This is a great sports cam for the price! Have used it while riding ATV s and in the pool! Takes great pictures and the video is great! Highly recommend this camera! 
8239 Great value! Everything works amazingly well for the price. 
8240 Very close to OEM batteries, holding a good charge for a reasonable time. 
8241 asdf 
8242 Works as expected 
8243 Worked very well for gift to elderly parents. All they have to do is sit back and watch the photos. Only lacking star as user interface is clunky. And no notification provided to new account that can add photos by email 
8244 Works great with my camera! 
8245 Love this.. Also purchased the Canopy 2 year protection plan. I just need to know how to get replacement parts. The 4 things on each corner..? Already lost 2 in trees. 
8246 Amazing! 
8247 Love it 
8248 Works good. It could use a better manual. 
8249 I am very satisfied with my foscam f19831p. Calls to the support line for setup help has been easy and kenneth is nice and very knowledgeable which made setup very easy. 
8250 EXCELLENT...much better than another selfie stick (more expensive) that i purchased last...I lost that one. The Volsey is sturdy, lighter, has rechargable battery and easier to use. Thumbs up!! 
8251 Such a wonderful equipment bag. Love the size -- fits under the economy class seat of a 737 (at least it did for me). Great for European travel where they always weigh your carry-on... they don t ask much about this one. 
8252 Wife loves this camera. It can make anybody look like a pro. 
8253 Just what I needed to protect my new lens! Thanks! 
8254 gift 
8255 Excellent item, very quick to post, Thanks 
8256 It s ok 
8257 Just like the original one. Right fit and right feel. 
8258 I ordered 1 pair these I think came from California. ..and the were garbage. Very poorly made and didn t last long at all ....the part that came from China was very well made and had a locking ring and screw .... 
8259 Cheaply built, sound quality was extremely poor, and I could barely hear the sound. Would not recommend. 
8260 Great kit. 
8261 Great deal!!!! 
8262 Sorry, but this was a piece of junk. It s cheap plastic like a table cloth from the dollar store. It came crushed and wrinkled and I was never able to get the wrinkles out in order to use it. 
8263 Excellent quality. Use it to keep my b&w 120 film. 
8264 Great!! Product I love this camara, I show the camara to one of my friends and like it and he got one to... 
8265 Works best for skin response. 
8266 Works fine but instructions are hard to understand. .and even locate oniine.. 
8267 It s so nice to have this and it works pretty good. My only complaint is that the range isn t very far so it defeats the purpose of using it. 
8268 Camera uses unusual means of releasing the shutter. There is a ring outboard of the zoom ring, that must be pressed just right to release the shutter. My technicians had great difficulty getting the shutter to release on several occasions. 
8269 Far too overpriced 
8270 Haven t had this much fun since i bought my first motorcycle. Love this thing, easy to fly, almost addictive. 
8271 Super 
8272 Excellent value. 
8273 I used this camera and the quality is really good. I would definitely recommend this 
8274 Really love this bag. The sections in it are so helpful! 
8275 Got this as a present for a friend! She said the pictures may come out dark in too much sunlight 
8276 Great Product 
8277 Got this for a customer who misplaced their older-style / 1st generation USB cable to download photos from camera. Works as advertised. 
8278 Great series of reflectors. I love the shear scrim. Caveat: Almost impossible to fold up. Really! 
8279 Small form factor but great performance. Always missed out on a flash for fuji for covering small functions. 
8280 Great gift I gave my dad. The only thing is the tripod is a bit smaller than expected. Like that every fits in the case! 
8281 Great lights for close up filming and they work really well in low light outdoor areas. However you must make sure your camcorder matches with this brand of lights because it comes with a shoe mount you need to screw into specific sony model cameras. 
8282 I use my camera every weekend and did not notice that this shield was even on. Easy application and does not distort the screen. 
8283 had to write a review.... camera is fantastic! really easy to set up... great job 
8284 Good, thanks so much 
8285 have not realy used yet but what I did try worked fine 
8286 I just got the chance to try it right now. it is cheap material product, it s broke right away. 
8287 Solid Construction, threads very easily on several different lenses, from L series to non L glass. Perfect amount of drag on the rotation of the filter. eliminates guesswork. Color Cast?? NONE I could find. Solid piece of gear. Has replaced my Tiffen CPLs for good! 
8288 Batteries delivered very quickly and as described. Work well in my Nikon D5200 camera. Price was great for two. 
8289 very nice to replace all the adapters into one unit. 
8290 This is not working after a week! 
8291 Very nice and tidy, fits well for sony nex 
8292 Used for over 5000 pictures in two weeks. Worked great on my RX100iii. 
8293 Used to complete my camera system 
8294 worked great until transmitter went bad 
8295 Fit perfect and git fast 
8296 Received cables in a timely manner ( thank you ) replaced it with my 4 camera splitter and have no problems still. 
8297 Good and fast delivery and the productWorks and looks good 
8298 Was delivered when they said it would be lots of extras for a great price 
8299 *** Star 
8300 Works great. No problem with filters either... even a polarizer. 
8301 It s very good 
8302 This item is really great, and a good value! 
8303 love the space 
8304 perfect size. Tight to work with, getting in and out. stiff zipper. hope it will soften with use. 
8305 Excellent Tripod! ! Would always buy it again. Next time I would get the taller tripod So sturdy. It does anything. Love it! 
8306 Good for the price. Quality are beyond expectation. 
8307 no tan bueno 
8308 It does exactly what is suppose to, not to mention it s pretty sleek. 
8309 Everything was just fine!! Charged batteries & tested perfect In my S50 Cannon camera!! 
8310 One camera was missing the antenna 
8311 Works well, no humming, good for multiple long exposures 
8312 Gave this a bday gift and daughter loves it. A bit pricey having to constantly purchase film but it s to be expected. Nice shade of blue and works exactly as it should. 
8313 Working fine. 
8314 Accidentally threw out the original charger for my camera so I had to buy this one. It works well so far. 
8315 While it is cheaper that the Nikon version, and has an internal battery which is nice, it is bulky. 
8316 I m a big Rokinon fan as I own the 85mm and the 135mm. This is probably the worse glass I ve ever owned. 
8317 It s a Micro USB charger. Nothing more. 
8318 Worked well! 
8319 Amazing! So many possibilities. 
8320 2nd one I bought. I think the bag that it comes in has gotten a little better quality 
8321 really its exellent and the photo very sharp 
8322 thanks alot for 
8323 Yep, they re batteries. Work as advertised, and last longer than the one that came with the Fuji X100T. 
8324 Great concept, but it wouldn t velcro around my hands any way i tried. I may have had a defective one but i had to return it. Seemed like the velcro was in the wrong place. 
8325 These are adequate. Not as thin as the better pieces, but does the job. Good value. 
8326 It s great! up to now I have used it 3 times, with no issue. easy to connect and install. 
8327 The harness broke tge first time we put it on. Cheap! 
8328 great starter kit 
8329 Awesome kit for my Nikon D3100! Arrived quickly and already having fun with this kit and my new lense! Allows everyday people to take more professional shots with any camera! Very happy with this purchase! 
8330 Poor optical quality. Lot of purple fringing and image softness. Heavy and prone to lot of image shake due to high magnification.Returned and would not buy again. 
8331 junk 
8332 Item came in well protected and completely new. It was adequate for me to keep my dive mask and offer really good protection to my mask 
8333 They have great instructional videos n the product is easy to manipulate however, due to flimsy materials used it does not function as advertised. Expected stronger parts...seems like a $25 product instead. 
8334 Awesome Unit. Not phantom so only use with your powered mics before going into camera. 
8335 It is not what I expected but my granddaughter is having fun using them 
8336 Its totally working for me. Charging my D90 Battery like a charm. 
8337 Klugy, but it works. 
8338 Good stuff at a reasonable price. 
8339 The flip up eye piece is what makes this camera worth having. An absolute must for outdoor sunny days, and while zooming in on far away objects. 
8340 Perfect 
8341 Received broken. Very cheap quality. Is more a toy. 
8342 This was everything I expected and more. Absolutely love it.. 
8343 Good camera and even though it was refurbished it is in great condition. 
8344 Almost all the photos I took came out blurry, and I did follow the directions and made sure I was within 3 feet of the subject, etc. Disappointed. 
8345 This camera is better than my friend s GoPro! After I showed him my camera, he got one as well. 
8346 This camera has a nice clear picture. 
8347 You can never have too many mounts for your Go Pro. 
8348 lots of room fits canon t3 , 75-250, 35-55 lens, extra batteries, cone, point and shot, flash, lots more room 
8349 Nice 
8350 Works well 
8351 I have used this camera for the last 3 weeks in a Swimming Pool and at the Sea and It works great!! 
8352 Speedy delivery is always a plus and can I use the same UV filter on the zoom (300mm), part of my camera also? I am very happy with this one, easy for this lady who loves taking her action pix. Thank you 
8353 I love this! 
8354 Unfortunately there was something wrong with the camcorder upon arrival. We got in touch with Vivitar and they replaced it with a newer model. Great customer support! 
8355 Great stuff. 
8356 Use it only a few times.Hands should be steady to get clear pictures. 
8357 Best $$ I ever spent. This is really a good product. I was in Bermuda recently and I was able to take a lot of beautiful pictures under the sea!! I love it. I used it for my Canon Powershot S95. 
8358 Does the job but you have to tighten really hard so it does not come out and wiggle loose.. Good grip and cheap for the cost. Shipping came in whenever it wanted. It said 3-4 weeks but it came in 1.5 weeks without warning. Just showed up... haha China, man... 
8359 Love this lens and is on my camera most of the time. I particularly like the constant bigger f number in this lens. 
8360 Works but did not impress me too much...makes hardly a change in the picture 
8361 This thing is so sweet! Very agile, quick, and reaponsive. This puppy is so fun to fly! A great quad to learn the basics with. 
8362 I like it! 
8363 great value, works as advertised 
8364 So handy! 
8365 Helps extend recording time on the device without too much added mass. The small batteries in the GoPro Hero 4 are a joke so you really need to get this if you are planning to record for any length of time. 
8366 Good bundle. 
8367 Good Camera 
8368 Great buy 
8369 great 
8370 Works excellent. Fits perfectly on an HO flat car to make videos on model railroad as if riding on train. 
8371 Thanks everything was good!!! 
8372 We are very pleased and may buy another of the same. 
8373 Last a little longer than the stock battery. 
8374 it s very nice 
8375 An amazingly versatile lens. Easy to use in just about any situation. I ve only just scratched the surface of its capabilities and not come close to its limits. Except when I m going super-wide (and then I love my 10-24), this sits on the camera (70D) 
8376 Where can I get info on how to program this device? 
8377 Fits perfect, light and strong material. 
8378 Camera fits great in it and with the padding it stays safe! 
8379 Its a lenshood - not much function :-). It has a quality feel. 
8380 Perfect kit for maintaining lenses. Magic fiber is really nice for cleaning all glass 
8381 very good camera, installed and work better than the others, have purchsed more. 
8382 Product has met my expectations and great quality for such an affordable price! Package came in great condition and received it in 2 days. Very satisfied with their services. 
8383 Excellent 
8384 Charger works with my Canon T1i battery. Came in a small box and looks like the charger pictured. Haven t tried to use it in the car, but that should be a nice option. 
8385 Great camera. Easy to install, good quality and small enough to hide when needed. Great product! 
8386 Pretty good camera! 
8387 Did not work on my Canon Flash. 
8388 Best value for the money. 
8389 After doing a boatload of research on rear view cameras I decided to purchase the rear view safety camera. It has lived up to its reputation. Installation was a snap and I couldn t be happier with the performance. 
8390 The neck broke on the second use... Very cheap plastic. 
8391 Very sharp, very good quality. Great build quality. I would say much better than the Canon alternative. 
8392 Make sure to get the extra batteries as just having one in there is a waste. It adds bulk but feels good in the hand when flipping for a portrait shot. Its worth paying a little bit more for the official Canon grip instead of the other branded ones. 
8393 Works great! no issues with battery life after 3 weeks 
8394 Just love the product, worked out great. A+++ 
8395 This product is not as it appears in the ad. It is an ordinary, round mirror; so don t imagine an oval that fits our small, rear view mirrors. Fooled me with the picture. If you want a little, round mirror, shop locally. 
8396 Carl was VERY helpful in assisting me in activating my FOSCAM camera. Thank you. 
8397 Worked perfect, good quality 
8398 works 
8399 I love this bag. Well made. 
8400 Arrived in ecellent condition. 
8401 Great price.....fits well. 
8402 I didn t go through all of it s features. My Samsung phone takes less grainy photos. The zoom was the only advantage, and wasn t worth the extra expense. If I want zoom, I ll buy a film camera. 
8403 Works great with my Flash unit and is very adaptable to my needs: However, After only two uses the tension in the umbrella caused two of the prongs to bend. Though the everything works, the umbrella is slightly off and is no longer symmetric. 
8404 Excellent tripod and holder. 
8405 Great price. 
8406 I love bringing this camera when I go to Disney! The pictures come out so good! I recommend taking outdoor shots when the sky is clear for a more &#34;enhanced&#34; shot. 
8407 The t5i is a great camera. Nice features and no issues with it yet. I bought the bundle primarily for the extra lens and included SD card. The case, tripod, wide angle lens, and filters are passable but not great. The value of this set is worth the price. 
8408 The sling shoulder neck strap makes it much easier to pull the camera into position. It realigns the pressure points away from the neck spine and reduces pressure on the muscles of the neck. This is especially helpful for photographers with arthritic spinal changes associated with aging. 
8409 Great device. Easy to install and even easier to use. Just set it and forget it. Very good quality pics. 
8410 I love this camera!!! Exactly what I wanted! The night vision is so clear and I love being able to move the camera by touching the screen of the device I m using. 
8411 Good item. Sturdy. Worth every money you paid for. 
8412 Very light and powerful. Worked well in Alaska 
8413 Charger didn t last a week and batteries won t keep a charGe 
8414 wouldn t recommend due to vignetting showing up on videos. 
8415 Very good video! 
8416 These are beautiful original DJI Props. these are not the cheap knockoffs from other listings. you get what you pay for .Make sure if you are flying you are using OEM parts to guarantee you don t crash your quad from inferior parts. 
8417 Fits perfectly. Perfection in workmanship and material. All greatness! 
8418 Great camera and user friendly....takes great pictures 
8419 perfect gift for birthday give along with new insant camera. 
8420 Great deal for me-use for astronomy and birding. Field of view is a little narrow but that s to be expected compared to the Fuji 10x50 s and Pentax 7x50 s I use also. Good colors and it s made in Japan too. 
8421 Camera works great, arrived on time and as advertised, the lens on this camera is so much better than my last digital camera. 
8422 Awesome product,quick delivery, and great support 
8423 It work perfectly. I Hava bought other kid of before but definitely this one for much is the best. I love it. 
8424 I totally love these lights. Nice and bright and the ability to manipulate between incandescent and daylight gives a creator loads of options for setting up a shot. 
8425 I have to return them because it was impossible for me to contact customer services. Even though it was easy to install it, there were steps I needed to be guided through, and I couldn t get the help to go through it. 
8426 It works well for the money. The charge was a little less than I had hoped for. 
8427 Love it thank youuuu 
8428 I ve had no problems with the batteries or the charger. This should be standard for any GoPro user. Highly recommend. 
8429 Works perfectly to replace sensors zapped by lightning. Easy to install. 
8430 Fairly good for the price! Sometimes it takes a little bit to take the pictures but then once it finally connects works good! Perfect for a beginner. 
8431 Good products 
8432 I did not receive a Kodak battery. I received a Halcyon battery, which would not recharge. Since I ve misplaced the receipt, I can t return it. I have purchased a Radio Shack battery instead of trying to order one again. 
8433 Mounts and works very well 
8434 Excellent photo quality. Excellent build and feel. Excellent WiFi features. I bought this primarily to take pictures of Coins and it definitely took some outstanding pictures. WiFi Direct Transfer to PC was a breeze. Saved me a fortune of time. 
8435 Product works as advertised. 
8436 everything was ok. Thank you! 
8437 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ay8zAY_Jw This is how we used it and it worked great for us I love everything about it and it is so durable and easy to work with. 
8438 This camera is exceptional. It is very similar to my GoPro, for a fraction of the price. I would highly recommend this cost effective alternative, especially if you are investing in a GoPro like device for the first time. 
8439 The ad claims that the fp100c works in the SX70 camera but the plastic case is too large to fit in the camera. 
8440 Perfect product, great price. Not too big to take on outings and it is durable. Plenty of storage. Highly recommended! 
8441 Excelente cámara ..delivery rapido 
8442 good 
8443 Very comfortable for extended use. Quality is very good. 
8444 I like the handle best, because it does float. The handle allows you to properly aim and shoot shots in all conditions. 
8445 This little camera is amazing for the money! very easy to use and has awsome picture quality! 
8446 Solid build quality and protected all my gear after falling out of a car! 
8447 I love the product! 
8448 Great product. Works great 
8449 Works well for carrying our Sony HandyCam and accessories. Not a lot of extra room, but probably enough. Seems to be quality-made and should last. 
8450 in day time is perfect but in night cant see anything i not return because is really difficult take it off but i don t recommend to no body 
8451 Item arrived on time. I m happy with this product 
8452 Battery works great! Fraction of the cost from Manufacturer. 
8453 Hi,thanks for sending to me the thing that i ordered,i love it./. 
8454 Meets all expectations 
8455 I returned this item as it does what it says but there is noticeable signal loss and distortion. 
8456 Worked as a perfect replacement battery for my Cannon Vixia HF R10 digital camcorder. Have been using for about 6 months and the battery has kept a charge way better than the battery that came with the camera. I recommend. 
8457 I couldn t be happier with this telescope. it is my first ever telescope, and i have had many amazing nights on my back porch with this thing. 
8458 I ll prefer regular foam over this stuff next time. But, overall this is pretty decent foam far as quality. 
8459 Very good softbox, great price! 
8460 👍 
8461 Battery dead in 45 min. 
8462 Lowepro makes the best lens cases around. I have this case in several different sizes. Not only do they protect the lens like no other, but they also look and feel great too. 
8463 This little stand does the trick. I have used it several time to give presentations to the Rotary Club. 
8464 Really bright light and goes right on my tripod with ease 
8465 This selfie stick is really nice but it broke on me the third time I used it. The middle piece broke off and I could not salvage it and had to throw it away. It also took the longest time to sync with my iPhone. 
8466 I ordered this lens hood for use with my macro lens. Works great. Be sure to check the thread size of the lens you would like to use it with before ordering. I ordered the 49 mm thread size and it fits my lens perfectly. 
8467 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
8468 Works fantastic. Couldn t find locally and wanted it for vacation! Solution? Order thru Amazon and it ll be there when you get there!! &#60;3. #dottiedixon 
8469 Product was just as discribed 
8470 Great service and prompt delivery! Thanks a bunch!! A+ 
8471 Sturdy doors with secure latch. Just right for making access to space under RV dinette seats. The only improvement I suggest is to include a template with it for cutting the hole. 
8472 I just got a Canon G3-X with external EVF, and I needed a case that would fit it. This one works perfectly, plus there is room in the front packet for the charger and other accessories. Great case! 
8473 ITS OK 
8474 Magic fiber is amazing at cleaning glass. I keep some in my car, my husbands car, my camera bag, my desk office. It s so handy 
8475 Excellent product. I lost my original Sony charger along with the original battery. This is quite an excellent replacement. Feels like it charges much quicker than the original charger. The cigarette lighter charger comes in really handy. Overall, very satisfied. 
8476 Great value for a set of four. My SIL loves her little polaroid and this film is really cute. I would buy this for her again. 
8477 Amazing fit 
8478 Hoy glass is top notch. If you re a pro, and you re using high quality lenses, don t put a plastic filter over them and soften up your image. Just bite the bullet, spend the extra money, and get a filter you can be proud of. 
8479 Works as intended. Love the colors, hard to miss! 
8480 decent 
8481 EXCELENTE 
8482 Makes charging quick and easy. 
8483 High quality product in individual plastic envelopes. Excellent performance. Couldn t be happier. 
8484 This copter is so light when it crashes nothing happens. It is loads of fun and easy to fly 
8485 Love it! Works great at a great price. 
8486 Need to firmly tight...even after tight...it gets loose...so need to find the right position to place this arm and supporting device... 
8487 Very handy and everything I expected. 
8488 Excellent 
8489 parts where missing 
8490 I love it but its not water proof 
8491 I have a small camera that I travel with and it fits in this case very snugly. It seems to be enough protection while in my luggage, from clanging into other hard surfaces. 
8492 Just as advertised. Everything was brand new in its original packaging and it all works properly. 
8493 Nice 
8494 I ve learned a lot about my camera. 
8495 As expected 
8496 awesome item 
8497 The photos are very clear and sharp - excellent lens. 
8498 as described... work well 
8499 Very nice camera, but needed a memory card. This was a separate purchase and delayed camera use. 
8500 Arrived on time and everything was in great condition. The lens and flash just didn t work for me. 
8501 Just an FYI: I checked each item in the package to see what each would cost separately. I only searched on Amazon. The total came to $1297 - without the bag; the description here is too vague to match it. 
8502 Nice 
8503 really GOOD DVR FOR THIS MONEY 
8504 Love love love this!!! Nice price, great product, easy to use. 
8505 I love the camera but it is missing a very important attachment piece. I can t use any attachments because one screw is missing. 
8506 As long as you re on a flat surface it works perfectly. I wouldn t recommend usage on carpet or any rough terrain. 
8507 Great deal..look very professional. 
8508 great deal, not sure why so many others are selling the same kit for $50 more, oh well 
8509 Only thing is I thought it would be assorted but they are all one design. 
8510 Love love love!!! 
8511 B 
8512 Good price, I think the quality of the picture are fair. I was very happy with the results. 
8513 Nice 
8514 Bought this for my new Canon camera. Hold a charge well. 
8515 Absolutely love this and for the price and all I will have to do is remember to take batteries! 
8516 Operates as described and expected. Excellent zoom. 
8517 Seller was very good to work with. I was very pleased with my purchase. 
8518 I like it 
8519 Comfortable sturdy strap but hard to get used to how my camera hangs. 
8520 Did what I bought it for 
8521 This seems to work as good as the original that came with the Nikon 1. It is quite compact and came quickly when we forgot our original charger on a trip. 
8522 They worked great and even lasted longer then the go pro battery! 
8523 Just what I needed and a great price 
8524 Bought this to use with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Works perfect! 
8525 Well made, comfortable on the wrist. Detachable clip makes this even handier. Love the design too. I ve also been using Optech s larger model wrist strap on my Mirrorless Fuji X-T1 on three trips, and their products are very well made and the most comfortable straps around. 
8526 Well made and works perfectly. 
8527 Works ok. But will not connect to wifi 
8528 great product 
8529 Has a defect. A line straight across. I ll keep it only because I got it on a great deal. 
8530 Great camera but far too complicated for a 73 year old man such as me. 
8531 VERY GOOD 
8532 Item delivered on time, was as described and a very nice product, packed good would rate A+ all the way ! 
8533 Great addition to adjust white balance which everyone should know how to do. Folds nicely to fit in any bag. 
8534 Love it, takes great pics. 
8535 Nice mount fits the camera perfectly. 
8536 great. 
8537 Great camera case! I love the color (brown leather). It is so fashionable. 
8538 I lost my original lens cap somewhere in Yosemite! This is exactly like my original and I received it quickly. 
8539 good 
8540 Don t waste your money on this battery grip for the Sony a6000. It is a piece of junk. 
8541 I have not found a better charger for the price n 
8542 The adapter ring does not come with the filter retaining ring so another adapter ring has to be used to hold the filter on the camera lens. It holds the filter on the camera lens as per it s purpose. 
8543 It s just a not good product. It s cheap to the touch. 
8544 Perfect accessory for any lense 
8545 I love this lens. Fast shipment. Thanks 
8546 Great 
8547 I ve tried this out alot and i really like it. the quality is really nice , both the 720p and 1080p. Learning how to use it is incredibly easy and painless. I got this is as a promotion for a review. 
8548 I like the item but when I received it and tried putting it together, the stick will not screw into the part that holds the phone. I cannot use this item. 
8549 What a joke! No way to save your videos to a PC. The only option is to use THEIR cloud storage for $99/year MORE! No thanks as they SHOULD allow US to save OUR videos! JOKE RIP OFF PRODUCT!!! 
8550 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
8551 The instructions are terrible. We still can t figure how to make it work!! 
8552 This is just awesome! I will definitely recommend it! Very satisfied :-) 
8553 Used this mount to record a few videos while I was driving and it did a really good job. It s solid and worked great on the dashboard and the windshield. If you re looking to make mobile videos, don t look past this mount. 
8554 My mother in law requested this for her birthday to store her new Nikon camera and all of its accouterments. It holds everything and is a reasonable size. Plus, the backpack style is much easier to tote around than the shoulder strap version of old. 
8555 Everything works well. There are a few places some of the plastic fittings aren t perfectly smooth, but you re paying $25 for a ton of parts. 
8556 Works perfect 
8557 I am loving this camera!! I got this to upgrade from my T2i and I am very impressed. Pictures are really clear and great. The camera is bigger but I m getting used to it. I am very happy I went with this one. :) 
8558 Products are the same quality as the originals. However, these come at a very affordable price that everyone can afford. Wouldn t hesitate to buy again if i get another gopro. 
8559 pretty good camera 
8560 This was advertised a product with the Canon camera I purchased so I wrongly thought it would fit the camera and it doesn t. Much too small for the camera I bought so it is useless to me 
8561 Very cool for it to geotag the pictures taken. I love it! 
8562 The hood is OK. But when removing from camera it comes off together with the protective lens. 
8563 I really love my Rode VideoMic I shot a whole documentary using this microphone. I am thinking about upgrading to the pro anyone want to buy my gently used Mic?! Lol all jokes aside, this is a wonderful microphone and makes a big difference when you use it 
8564 Even though the original battery seems to last forever (next to no moving parts on the camera), it is always good to have a backup battery. This one is indistinguishable from the original battery, and works great. 
8565 I used the narrative to clip to capture moments with my family all over Japan and came back with many deeply satisfyingly memories that I couldn t have preserved any other way. 
8566 Best cheap LEDs 
8567 Excellent product - very pleased with it. 
8568 Love this camera backpack. Recommend it to everyone I meet. Perfect for traveling. 
8569 I use the MeFoto with my Canon 5D Mark III. Love it! (Fits nicely in my Packsack ) 
8570 Quite remarkable for the price. 
8571 very good day or night, also good price. this is my fourth dash cam .this one i like the best. but the question is, how long will it last? 
8572 It is excellent, 
8573 Life saver for me. Eliminated worries about my elderly mother getting out of bed at night with me knowing. 
8574 Perfect screen protection. Fits well and recommend you use it right out of the gate to protect the screen. 
8575 Meets my needs at the lowest price available. 
8576 From what I can tell, it is a real Fuji battery and powers the camera for the same length of time. We got this as a spare for when we are in the field for an extended period. Works fine. 
8577 excellent 
8578 Just as advertised 
8579 Lightweight, compact. Takes great pictures. 
8580 Battery 
8581 Does the job and great value for the price!! would recommend... 
8582 Very nice! just was what i needed. it is made well and works to keep all the parts in one place. thank you! 
8583 Doesn t seem very secure even as tight as possible. Getting a bit of shake from the joint on the clam shell to the arm. 
8584 The only problem was the host of extra charges that added over 15% to the first cost of $74.99 so that the total first cost to me was really $87.23. 
8585 The worse tripod I have seen. Too short, not strong, looks like kids tripod. I returned it. 
8586 The only complaint is that the lens hood is very loose. The lens is wide and sharp. 
8587 This case provides good protection for the camera. 
8588 works great 
8589 This camera meets & exceeds my expectations of a point & shoot camera. 
8590 Easy to use.. Just plug it into the wall.. Didnt ruin my battery. 
8591 Everything was good. 
8592 The camera worked ok but upon playback the colors were washed out, no matter what settings I had it on. Returned 
8593 I agree. Not plug and play. And even after figuring out the setup I never could get my NVR to recognize it. 
8594 the Falcon works fine I m very satisfied with this product 
8595 GOOD PRODUCT ! 
8596 muy bueno exelente 
8597 No heavy, easy to wear, nice. It great For the drome. 
8598 These work perfect for my small LED lights and Strobes. I have 6 of them and use them all the time :) 
8599 Nice. Handy size, neutral color, good texture for most any fine or delicate work. I m using it for guitar maintenance, but I may get another one for greasy/oily stuff, cars, bikes, guns; this is a handy product at a reasonable price. Beats using a yoga mat... 
8600 Definitely exceeds my expectations, this Nikon D5500 is a great camera, I am very happy, easy to handle specially for novice like me. 
8601 Happy with the product, does what I intended it to do! Love that you can string the cap to camera for easy impromptu photos! 
8602 Good 
8603 Simple to operate, easy to transport, the price was great. A good second camera to my SLR 
8604 Bought this for my Lumix DMC-GM5 camera and glad I did...grip is firm and secure and makes holding the camera that much more comfortable. My wife liked it so much she took it for her GM5...so now I have had to order a second one for myself!!! 
8605 very happy ...fast delivery...ready to use.. 
8606 Easy point and shoot, quality product. Gone are the days when I photographed with all Nikon film equipment. Easy to slip in your pocket and with a 32 gig memory stick you can take a years worth of pics. 
8607 Looks great on my mantle with 3 5x7 pictures from my granddaughter s wedding. I previously bought a similar frame that was too big for my space which was returned. This one shows off the pictures and is compact and beautifully made. 
8608 I have several Fotodiox adapters and they all fit perfectly, and so far they all allow focus to infinity. This one actually will focus past infinity. That isn t a big problem but you do have to actually focus at infinity. 
8609 Fits well, Looks good, Camera resolution NOT crisp. Prying out the old led bar and installing it in the camera unit was a little challenging. It gets the job done, and I like the position of the camera. If the image was more crisp it would be 4 stars easy. 
8610 Works great, easy to install 
8611 Did not work seems like not charged even after plugging in. 
8612 I purchased this and it works just fine. Found that I hardly use it though. 
8613 Great buy 
8614 Piece of junk! Battery lasts 10 minutes! Useless piece of equipment! Do not waste your money! 
8615 This lens had a bubble 
8616 Cant make a difference in photography, but looks defective. 
8617 good , fast shipping , that s great :) 
8618 They are for spares. 
8619 I loved this product bc it griped on my iPhone and did not fall.Aslo the selfie stick can adjust to your phone size. I have not seen no flaws yet.my rating is a five star. 
8620 If you re looking for a cheap tripod- well. here it is. Construction is a little flimsy, all plastic. It s alright but I d suggest just to have light loads on this one. 
8621 good film 
8622 very poor quality lens filter coloring on the glass was uneven when they arrived and the threads did not match up to the lens very well at all. 
8623 Good for a back-up. Not as well made as am original. But does work. 
8624 Excellent value, responsive and easy to fly. First drone I ve owned and will buy the XW8 FPV next. It s also great fun to do with you family. 
8625 Doesn t work. The gimbal catches 
8626 Love the quality of the pics and the range you get with this lens is amazing 
8627 Amazing. It has all I was looking for in a product like this. Very recommendable. 
8628 received as advertised but have not yet received my stand 
8629 AMAZING for the price. I mean it, you won t find a better reflector out there for this price 
8630 These work fine and the car charger is very convenient. However, they last about half as long as the original camera battery. It s not a big deal if you always have a spare fully charged battery, but carrying multiple batteries around on vacation gets tiresome. 
8631 Good quality, very relaible 
8632 Had a back room area in our office that frequently had staff during auto-arm times. This let the staff know the alarm was auto-arming. Easy to install. small form factor. very pleased. 
8633 It s a lens cap. Does what lens caps do! 
8634 It s a battery 
8635 We are using this camera everyday on our trip to Europe and it is easy to use and the pictures are wonderful. 
8636 Great product! Fast shipping!! 
8637 Stand was broken when I got it, completely useless 
8638 The mini usb port have 10 pins and doesn t work with most of the cameras. 
8639 Needed a cheap waterproof camera for vacation and this sufficed more than well enough. 
8640 excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
8641 Great little lens. Used it a lot and it is made very well. 
8642 great camera for the price 
8643 Great seller, fast shipping, good product, thank you. 
8644 Works like a Nikon coolpix should 😏 
8645 With this I seldom need a lens cap. Works great. 
8646 Fine product fair price 
8647 Everything I expected! 
8648 Works great to replace original lens cap. 
8649 Came on time and intact. Very fast and power quadcopter. Will buy again. 
8650 I can t write about the function of the product except that I was not able to use it for my purpose. 
8651 Works Great! 
8652 Great easy to use 
8653 Makes a PEN into a pocket camera. 
8654 Fits pretty good. No hanging edges of the ends of the screen so the cover won t pill off easily. 
8655 Disappointed worked but didn t switch from day to night for reading plates had to climb post each morning and evening to change setting. Ended up buying different camera will find a use for this one somewhere else or resale 
8656 This was exactly what I needed and was afraid I would never find. Thanks!!! 
8657 Very nice ! 
8658 good quality and both the car and home chargers are handy. 
8659 The worst I have ever bought. 
8660 Nice worth the money would buy it again 
8661 Very Pleased with this item 
8662 Just what I needed the Nikon D5500 does not provide the Hot Shoe which is sad since you pay so much for the camera. 
8663 Works great with my Canon600EX 
8664 The pen is great, it takes clear pictures and great 720p videos. Over all a great pen. 
8665 I could never get the cameras to work while i was away from home. Hired professionals to connect the cameras -no luck. Planning on returning all items. 
8666 Has its tiny flaws, but does the job. 
8667 too bulky 
8668 Great quality - thank you! 
8669 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
8670 Quick charging, great price, a little inconvenient that charger plugs directly into power point with no lead/cable, but great that you can also charge in the car. 
8671 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
8672 Great pictures but the video don t work good. 
8673 It is a good camera, nice pictures 
8674 great quality 
8675 It s a GoPro BacPac that as indicated gives you the extra time needed. Easily attaches the camera and extends the life almost twice of the battery. Fits perfectly into the extended housing and easily charged. I purchased two and glad that I did! 
8676 Charged up nice. No problems! 
8677 It is extremely convenient for me to be able to see the comings and goings of employees,lots of functions I`m interested in just like timely recording,motion detection alarm,night vision,PTZ curise etc. 
8678 we are trouble with Nest on the phone have to use pass word every time I want to see it 
8679 It is not user friendly for use. would like to talk to someone about it. please help. 
8680 working as intended 
8681 Really helps with underwater color. Stayed on the camera without a problem. Cotton safety string that catches lens in case the lens falls off the camera is flimsy and broke quickly. Will need to replace with nylon fishing line. 
8682 How do you love a charger? The merchandise is working fine. What I needed. 
8683 I had to return twice because two of the three lenses did not fit the camera. 
8684 Great to have spare; works great. 
8685 very good 
8686 good product 
8687 Camera is decent but the software is flat terrible....Sucks to setup and is also awful at motion detection.....It alerts for flies and bees but doesn t do anything with the person doing jumping jacks in my driveway. FAIL 
8688 I use this with a Vivitar 85mm 1.4 lens on my Sony A7ii. Works perfectly. I m getting another one for my 35mm manual focus lens just so I don t have to switch one out all the time. 
8689 Sick!! Works good 
8690 Fit perfectly. 
8691 We were able to see our home beautifully while on safari in South Africa - amazing! 
8692 Very bright! Love that you can change the warmth and the dial down the brightness. Takes a ton of batteries (AA), but to be expected. At full brightness, mine lasted about 2 hours. Great for fill light in photography. 
8693 Good quality 
8694 Sturdy and compact, everything I wished for. 
8695 Bought two for kayaking to keep cell phone in, they work great had for about a year now. 
8696 Works great. 
8697 Thanks 
8698 Arrived on time and is a good value. 
8699 It s a good starter to get you used to your GoPro and a lot of the accessories. Would definitely be considering upgrading after you have gotten use to them. 
8700 I love this camera. This package deal was a great starter kit. 
8701 Very visible on water and helps floating the camera its attached to. 
8702 Just what I wanted 
8703 Who need s a Gopro 
8704 Very good camera, it works great and very easy to learn to use. Takes very good pictures and it takes them fast. 
8705 Fits!!! 
8706 works well and secure all though sits a little low but works ok. Thanks! 
8707 It installs and operates quickly and without issues. The jumper to set the sensitivity is explained well. One thing I noticed, it does not seem to act as a repeater for the Z-wave signal. Is there a way to force it into repeater mode? 
8708 Missing item. I don t have the stand. 
8709 Very good overall experience. Easy purchase, fast delivery. Would recommend. 
8710 great extra battery 
8711 Not as strong as the GoPro branded mount. This is more like a mount for GPS or car-smartphone holder, but for mounting a action camera to a smooth surface that isn t subject to winds this works great. I would not use it outside, however. 
8712 It was just what I was looking for. Plenty of space for batteries and other accessories. 
8713 I love it ... It does what i need 
8714 charges well 
8715 Horrible device, mine came broken, it doesn t record my voice it only records a faint hardly noticeable noise and I haven t gotten a refund because I haven t gotten around to it 
8716 Works just liked it s supposed to. 
8717 The charger worked perfectly for my Canon 40D. I was impressed by the fact that the charger included an adaptor for the car. 
8718 Went out of control and crashed! 
8719 Not as heavy duty as I d hoped. I think it s a nice tripod. 
8720 This is positive feedback for Beach Audio. Great, great customer service. This company cares about their customers and with so many complaining about dealing with poor customer service I want Beach Audio to get their kudos. A++++++ And we love our cameras too. 
8721 Pretty decent accessories and most of them are useful. KILLER price and now I have a case to store the camera in also. 
8722 I didn t have to wait too long for it and it worked perfectly. Thank you. Now if I can get my order for cat med for fleas!!!! 
8723 Camera only lasted for just over a month of use. Can t return it now because order is over 30 days old. I guess you get what you pay for. 
8724 its cool 
8725 Very impressed with this camera! Custom white balance is a welcome change, underwater macro is superb, and the new microscope mode is insane. Still need to try out the time lapse/stitching settings, but have seen some first had results and am excited. 
8726 To use as a wrist strap, opening larger than we thought. 
8727 junk. to much set up and pain in the ass to put together. i want my money back 
8728 I like this lens for how cheap it is. You get a lot of bang for your buck. It s my go to lens for board sports. 
8729 Lifesaver for the camera if landing on rough terrain. Snaps on and secured with 4 (included) zipties. 
8730 It works OK. 
8731 Good 
8732 Good product for the price, works just as good as a go pro for a fraction of the price. 
8733 It was shipped quickly. Put batteries in it and put the cassette in it and it worked perfectly. 
8734 The software sucks. The fingerprint reader is terrible. Highly NOT RECOMMENDED. 
8735 Good quality picture, alot of fun 
8736 good 
8737 Great adapter for my vintage Pentax lens. Just screw it on and forget it. Works with Metabones Speedbooster also. 
8738 Great product, easy set up. 
8739 AAAAAAA++++++ 
8740 This has been a great little speedlight. My only complaint is that the batteries drain VERY quickly. It uses 4 AAs at a time. I have gotten in the habit of carrying spares with me, but batteries are not cheap. Overall, it s a good product. 
8741 I did not buy it. 
8742 Awesome Product. I have an LG G4 and it fits perfectly. Easy to Set up and get it going to shoot some nice video with the phone! 
8743 I have taken photos in complete dark with my Nikon D5500. Photos are very good and i have observed that intensity of flash is not varying with depending upon the darkness 
8744 Fast service. Nice product 
8745 Great little lens for the price.. A little distortion on the edges. I shoot real estate and it works for me. 
8746 a little flamzy 
8747 .but works loks like some parts may begin to give up soon 
8748 After shooting 1000 s of photos, I now know when to use it. When I do, pictures turn out great. 
8749 excellent build quality, lots of light. really great buy for the money. I bought three and a boom stand so I could do a full 3 point lighting set up. great for photography and videography. 
8750 i give three stars because the clip on the LCD screen side arrived broken. clip arrived broken. 
8751 Very easy to follow instructions, fits perfectly! 
8752 Love my gadgets thank you 
8753 fantastic lens at a great price 
8754 Works great. Love this battery charger. 
8755 Awesome pack that hasn t let me down. I may end up replacing it with a bigger Lowepro but for now it s been really great. 
8756 I am new to recording videos using a GOPRO and was looking for a good Kit to get me started on the right foot and I m glad I landed hear. This kit gave me lots of versatility to record a variety of videos. 
8757 Smart purchase. Biggest bang for the buck. 
8758 works well can adjust apperture 
8759 Is beautiful bag. 
8760 Works well and very durable. Must of crashed it at least 100 times and haven t broken anything yet. Longer battery life would be nice, but for the price you can t beat it. 
8761 Love this lens. Good build quality. The pictures I take come out very good. Buy a lens filter for it. 
8762 This is a good choice for zonal or hyper-focal pictures especially macro. 
8763 Arrived on time and as described. Works perfectly with my Go Pro Silver 
8764 all the features of its big brother in a compact size! excellent quality pics and video! 
8765 Just what I needed to mount camera on handlebar. good quality and camera feels secure. 
8766 I took it on vacation. It is very light. It is very strong. It is very stable. 
8767 The sharpness, rather better say non-sharpness after using this ND filters is terrible. I tested on high shutter speed, tripod mounted. The images is not usable. Buy expensive good quality filters or don t buy at all. 
8768 Love it! Kids love the picture printing. Eady to use! 
8769 It works as it should 
8770 Luxurious cover 
8771 it is awesome..I use it often 
8772 6 months later and still going strong! 
8773 Pretty good for the price. Takes a little time to get the cover on the camera. I wish there was some kind of instruction guide though. I could be doing this entirely wrong. 
8774 So far I have traveled to Israel, NYC (4 times), California, all over Florida and New England. Jets, Taxis, enormous walking, etc. This bag takes it all while still looking brand new. I just can not find any faults with this back. Sturdy, elegant and comfortable. 
8775 cheap crap- but I paid cheap--- you really need to get a TALLER tripod 
8776 Wonderful bag! Does not look like a camera bag and there is room for everything. 
8777 Cheap quality build and color is off 
8778 love everything especially the bag and head mount, however the gopole is really flimsy and i ended up buying a real gopole. but you cant beat it for the price! 
8779 Nice little bench top tripod - reasonably stable with camera and close up lens attached. 
8780 Great camera...night view is beautiful..is like daytime...recommended anytime.. 
8781 Work the first time coming out of the box. The next day? It stopped working. 
8782 please watch out. Mine was totally defect. I could not use them for my vacation. Returned them. 
8783 I m using this for my XIRO Xplorer quadcopter. Plenty of space for everything and more, plus plenty rugged for its price point. 
8784 perfect 
8785 The pole smells like metal and rusted after only one use. 
8786 flimsy 
8787 Great 
8788 The filter doesn t fit into my P Series holder, but works if I hold it up in front of the camera. Love the cool effects. 
8789 Delivered on time and it was exactly what I expected. 
8790 pain to use 
8791 For the price, it can t be beat. Since I already owned three of them when I ordered this one, that should speak for itself. 
8792 A & A makes very high quality products, and this nicely designed and well made strap is no exception. Flexible, strong and very comfortable. Highly recommend. 
8793 My cat chewed the cord into on my other charger, so I like the fact there is no cord, and it works just great. 
8794 Works great 
8795 :Lens was as advertised but it was supposed to come with three filters and there weren t any. I had to buy filter to protect lens. 
8796 Great price and quality. Good resolution with lots of features. Close up resolution could be a bit better. 
8797 Perfect fit for Sony RX100! 
8798 Works well! This case had enough room for me to store my camera as well as the charging cord. 
8799 sharp lens with great price. The lens gives great balance to my D800 with battery handle. 
8800 Poor video view and it don t have a HDMI on it 
8801 Battery seems to have trouble linking up to the Leica charger. I finally got it to charge and looks as though it charged fully. 
8802 Great camera, timely delivery 
8803 Sucks no other word to describe this item. A good looking watch I ll give it that but everything else sucks 
8804 Excelent 
8805 did good. did what i needed. 
8806 Great case for my camera. Fits my Canon very well and its a good quality. 
8807 I love this camera. Now I want to get the next lens up for the ability to zoom. Images are crisp, color is beautiful. This is a step up from my last camera and will be going to East Africa with me. 
8808 good 
8809 These reviews are clearly not written by real users of the product. Just read them and you ll see. 
8810 This lens is AWESOME. Pictures are amazing. Great purchase. 
8811 Excellent photo backpack. Very well priced. 
8812 Everything was fine. 
8813 Found out it is spring operated instead of battery.I don t know how long timing spring will last. Also took almost2 months for its arrival.it also rotates west to east,wrong way for tracking the heavenly bodies. 
8814 Works as advertised 
8815 Works great 
8816 I use this on my Manfrotto Mono-pod. I use it to hold my light. Strong and durable,and flexible for sure. I use it at all my parties and now I can t live without it. 
8817 The string that attaches to the camera is so thin and weak that a strong gust of wind will threaten to snap it. I lost my camera on a particularly rough dive this past winter when the string let go. 
8818 Okay for the price ... It had oil or something weird on it when I got it: It s pretty sturdy, though I d suggest finding something better if you have money to spend. 
8819 Exactly what I was expecting. For a domestic use it is hihgly recommended. 
8820 Perfect Fit for my tripod. 
8821 Excellent, as described in the publication I received, the delivery was fast without mishap, satisfied 100% 
8822 Great product , Nice and lightweight for hiking ! 
8823 excellent 
8824 Love this case, fits my SX280 like a glove and keeps it safe and ready. The soft inside keeps the screen from getting scratched too. 
8825 I bought it as a backup battery, I have no idea of the quality, but the price is worth the gamble. 
8826 Perfect 
8827 I bought this to go with my Concept2 SkiErg. Works like a charm. 
8828 It works just fine. 
8829 pros. easy setup, provided e-mail uploads. multi cloud service connectable dropbox. picasa. etc. motion sensor on/off cons. TN pannel. can t hanging - no wall mount hole. 
8830 AFAITH® Professional SLR Camera Tripod Monopod... was a gift for my daughter and she loved it 
8831 Great price 
8832 Amazing quality 
8833 fair price 
8834 It s good, but hard to keep fixed in the right position. 
8835 As expected 
8836 Works like a charm on nikon d3300, timelaps, or shot photos without touching cam, like on/off button. Took me a moment to understand it all but not long, was my first of this kind 
8837 Completely made of plastic. Feels like a knockoff. Returned it immediately 
8838 Sturdy, comfortable. Works with Canon 5D and 1Ds and Sony A77 and a99. 
8839 Excellent product. Seems to be a durable and well constructed. Bluetooth did not work with my phone HTC 1S. Would not activate camera button. After installing Camera 360 app (awesome app) worked great. Glad I purchased this item. 
8840 So far the charger works well and the batteris seem to have a decent life 
8841 An absolute bargain. I use with my Olympus OMD EM5MII. Now I don t have to live in fear of losing one. 
8842 On 2nd battery, as first wouldn t charge. Still having problems and getting &#34;check battery pack&#34; message. This is after actually reading the directions that state that the battery needs to be fully cycled several times. 
8843 Panasonic is a top tier Li battery producer. I got these on 8/26/2015, with expiration date of January 2024. That s 8 years which is perfectly fine with me. 1/2 the current price of EverReady at retail. 
8844 Excellent product 
8845 Works wonders. My gear has never been more clean. 
8846 I love this camera!!!! It takes great pictures and the battery life is great!!!! 
8847 Used it at the beach, kept my cube clean and dry. 
8848 Great set of accessories for an awesome price. 
8849 works great just be careful taking ur phone out as my first one broke like this but other then that works as its supposed to will recoomend to others 
8850 ok 
8851 It s all ok! 
8852 Auto focus broke after 2 months of use. Cost me 20$ to ship back to get repaired. Luckily it s a 6 year warranty. We will see how it is when I get it back, and if it holds up. Other than that it s a decent lens. 
8853 love them, they are definitely a detouring device 
8854 Love it! 
8855 Received by USPS and it is decoded as it charges using Olympus Charger BCN1. Non decoded battery do not charge on this device. 
8856 Nice syma 
8857 The accessories are quality accessories! They all work quite well, they are a little harder to screw in because they aren t made my go pro, but you can t go wrong because of the low price. 
8858 So far these are great and a fraction of the gopro cost! I am using these for a SJCAM M10 camera. Works just fine. Seems to be high quality too. 
8859 First one was blurry and unusable. Had it returned. The 2nd one works just fine. Picture quality is not super, but it does the job. 
8860 its small its kinda cool it works. its a small very cheap toy. really. 
8861 I purchased this to replace a lost lens cap for my Canon 58 mm lens. It fit the lens perfectly and came with a very nice microfiber lens cleaner which I really appreciated. Arrived quickly and safely packaged. Would definitely recommend. 
8862 what exactly is high resolution about these pieces of glass? I threw out the cheapo case and two of the lens... I only needed a protective lens. 
8863 A great compact high resolution camera loaded with features. Small enough to slip into your pocket 
8864 Look great and can t wait to try it out. 
8865 Great value for what you pay for. The vest on its own is 40.00, at the store. Yeah, it s not the best quality, but it s also not bad. 
8866 Excellent photos in low light and great videos. A winner 
8867 Solid product. 
8868 I am pleased as usual with sony products,that is why i am a repeater customer.keep on that track and quality level and like arnold says,I WILL BE BACK.107-4228565-2601021 
8869 work wonderfully they are able to charge in the official Nikon charger that came with my camera D3200 and provide the same photo time 
8870 What a pain in the ass to get on but worth it. Snug tight fit. The adhesive strip for the collar doesn t seem to want to stay on. Maybe it was my fault since I didn t clean it thoroughly, I donno 
8871 Perfect fit for my camera. Easy to install. 
8872 It works fine 
8873 When I used it the water went there waterproof Case do t buy This 
8874 Great item. All of the family love this. Easy to use and made well. 
8875 just as described 
8876 I bought this to monitor my Whole House Humidification system in attic after a bad experience with a leak. It was a little difficult to set up but support was superior to others and works fine. 
8877 I like amozon. 
8878 Im happy with this monopod, perhaps looking back I might have spent the money on a really sturdy dedicated video tripod..... As getting perfectly still shots is still a little tricky with this. The S6 head is great! 
8879 good price and product. 
8880 works as expected 
8881 👍👍👍👍 
8882 Good product! 
8883 This is a great tool to use selfies on a party I went to we took 4 pictures until we got the right one...when I bought this I took a selfie of my self in 1 picture and it was perfect 
8884 did not focus waste of time and money 
8885 We needed this! 
8886 Works great. Cant beat the price. It was exactly what I was looking for. 
8887 Its been a week and i feel the camera is Awesome. We used it as novelty item for our party and all our guests loved it.. Buy one for urself and I m sure your guests will be impressed.. 
8888 Fits my blackmagic pocket cam but does not focus. I have a 50mm 1.8 stm canon lens on manual and it will not focus??? 
8889 I like this camera, I can watch my dog when I am away. The night vision is good. It rotates and tilts well enough and was up and running very fast. I will buy another one for my front door. 
8890 Aweomse price for a fun toy 
8891 Greatest little camera. Takes wonderful pictures, love the zoom, and it fits in my purse so nicely. Wonderful for traveling when nice pictures are in the plan. 
8892 The description states FI9826W but I received the FI9821W refurbished which is much cheaper and does not have the zoom function I expected to receive. 
8893 They don t stay charged long... Very disappointed.... 
8894 It is a little loose on the gopro, but holds it secure enough. The camera can still slide a small amount in it, but it hasn t fallen out of it yet. It would be nice if there were a way to tighten it more. 
8895 Works just as described by seller. Shipped promptly and was ably to enjoy & use for the trips I had planned! Perfect addition to my GoPro collection. 
8896 It works as designed and seems like it will last a long time, for the money. 
8897 It works well with my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera; now I will not be worry if the camera battery becomes discharged. 
8898 The WiFi receiver isn t so great. I can connect a phone, iPod, notebook to WiFi in the same place where this camera struggles to get a connection. 
8899 Did not fit my camera at all and when I asked to return it, they just asked me why and didn t allow me t 
8900 Very disappointe 
8901 Worked great, no problems at all. 
8902 It hold s my Iphone 6plus really good, love it. 
8903 GOT THIS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE SHE SHOOTS YOUTUBE VIDEOS AND IT LOOKS AMAZING !! QUALITY OF LIGHTING IS SOO MUCH BETTER AND THIS LIGHT IS SUPER EASY TO OPERATE ! 
8904 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
8905 even with warming filter it is still very cold. mounts are very fragile and loose. barndoors do help and the stands are decent. you only get three filters.for the price they work but don t expect them to hold up to a lot of abuse. 
8906 Cheaply made but gets the job done. Works well with an iPhone 6 
8907 very nice,better than i thought, 
8908 this was a steal of a deal. I was not sure if to trust the seller, but the lens was brand new, no faults and still taking good images. 
8909 Work as expected. Really fun to use. 
8910 I learned the hard way that this camera is not good at action shots. 
8911 Couldn t use them. my camera died. 
8912 save your money!!! Please dont buy it! 
8913 Well made and reasonably priced, very satisfied. 
8914 didn t work with my technology 
8915 Good deal 
8916 Great filter, works just as expected! 
8917 The product works well as claimed. 
8918 great item, very good for my a6000 
8919 really great camera, still reasonable weight. 
8920 The product is very good. Have had it for about a year now and has worked well. Had to abandon the Comcast router for another to keep the cameras from dropping out constantly. Picture quality could be better, the HD cameras might be the way to go. Hope this helps. 
8921 It s ok. The quality is not great but I didnt pay as much as other cameras. The battery did run out a bit quickly, had to switch batteries twice in our 5 day vacation. 
8922 Works great! Excellent customer service and setup too! 
8923 latching mechanism popped off and was lost the first time i used it! 
8924 As expected 
8925 Batteries can in good time. They work perfectly, and were a steal at the price. I will definitely order from this person again. 
8926 good price 
8927 nice 
8928 Excellent product, happy with the purchase. 
8929 Excelente 
8930 This was the size recommended but did not fit my lens 
8931 Came just as advertised. All moving parts work smoothly. Nice and light if you have to carry it any distance. This might be a small hindrance on a windy day but altogether happy with my purchase. 
8932 Awesome camera, so much fun! 
8933 Very good 
8934 Great drone , fast shipping 
8935 Very pleased 
8936 Does the job 
8937 excellent service, product works as described. 
8938 Good price compared to battery stores 
8939 Works great. 
8940 Heavy duty case. Used to secure my GoPro and accessories. 
8941 Just ok 
8942 Nice! 
8943 Love this camera. Easy to use. 
8944 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
8945 Lost the charger for my camera. Perfect replacement and cheaper than ordering original! 
8946 just ok 
8947 Good quality. 
8948 Lost my GoPro while whitewater rafting, as I relied on just this head strap to secure the camera to my helmet. Should have had an additional chin strap and &#34;floaty&#34; back door for some redundancy. 
8949 This set-up is exactly what I was looking for and at a great price. It works great with my D5300 and the off camera remote is an awesome bonus. 
8950 Nice kit and well built except for the &#34;selfy stick&#34;. 
8951 the camera harness is exceptional! I can hike, hands free and have my camera at the instant ready. Many thanks. 
8952 No problems, fits perfectly as described. Check your lens first to make sure you know what you are ordering. 
8953 Great product. 
8954 The camera is surpsingly small and excelent recording with good sound quality 
8955 Good product for a good price 
8956 Rainbow colors add really cool artistic touch to photos! Would definitely recommend this! 
8957 i love the style, color and size of this Digi Bab....will come in handy for small items when i go biking or kayaking 
8958 A lot of bang for the buck. Easy setup with the available app. Great day and night picture. 
8959 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
8960 Poor quality all the way around vision is blurry and the audio pretty much don t work unless you re right on it!! But you get what you pay 4.:-! :-\ 
8961 I received my go pro filter in a timely manner. It fit great and it was everything I expected. 
8962 Great Product.... made of real good material well thought out. 
8963 Good camera easy to Operate The remote is not that great interfere with the TV if you have Samsung and accessories are not that strong I already had two broke 
8964 Camera video quality is great 
8965 To sum up my experience. This is an awesome easy to use and very versatile webcam that just works. I love the movement and sound detection. 
8966 one word, perfect! 
8967 Came as described 
8968 Would have been better if you could see the picture you want to take through the camera, The case blocks your viewing ability. 
8969 OK it all! 
8970 Great charger 
8971 Love the easy of start up & using this camera having never had one prior. wish we would have got an upgraded model to view video directly on camera. works great; used biking, hiking, rappelling & in ocean. 
8972 I still have my old camera. Love the fact that I found this. 
8973 CAMERA WASN T AVAILABLE AFTER ORDERING AND CAN T GET A REFUND FROM SQUARE TRADE!!!! 
8974 Works Like A Charm! No Complaints Its Fits Just like the factory unit 
8975 Great add-on a must for any lens to keep the lens cover close! 
8976 Love these, 3 settings: normal, small pet, large pet. Easy to install & connect. 
8977 these come in very handy when I do a quick change of lens 
8978 Horrible camera. 
8979 Pretty much what you d expect. Works fine, not elegant construction, ask me in a year how sturdy it is. 
8980 Good image quality, battery life is short so I bought rechargeable batteries 
8981 Zippers no good both have broken off. now I need a new bag 
8982 Does not appear to work unless plugged directly into router. I have asked how to get it to connect on its own without the ethernet cable but received no response. 
8983 Gave it as a gift and she loves it. Sturdy construction and very roomy. 
8984 wrong cord 
8985 Great product and a great price with fast delivery. 
8986 Very good quality, especially the velvet on the back of the strap that keeps it from slipping off the shoulder and adds comfort when hung around the neck. Colors are very vibrant. 
8987 Nice beginners kit. We use it for green screen videos. Works great. 
8988 Convenient and protects well. I m glad I got it, especially since the camera does not have a lens cover. 
8989 Perfect companion to camera. 
8990 Great product with long range capability. 
8991 Great for keeping my lenses clean 
8992 Used in many of my bags and protects all the equipment. 
8993 Works exactly as advertised 
8994 Very high quality camera bag with a ton of space for extra lenses or multiple cameras. Exceeded expectations! 
8995 What can I say. this table tripod is so sturdy it can hold my Canon 70D with a Canon 70-200 2.8 IS II with the tripod attached to the lens. This tripod is always in my camera bag and very helpful when in the field. 
8996 excellent camera, meets all functionalities, all good quality fittings 
8997 The price and quality of the camera is great. 100% recommended this item 
8998 In love with my camera 
8999 Very good camera 
9000 Excellent product and accessories. 
9001 VERY short range!! 
9002 like advertised! I was able to fit in far more number of accessories than i expected. The medium case makes a lot of sense size wise unless you are working for a production media house. :) 
9003 Works great on my a6000 and a7ii. No batteries to go dead. 
9004 This bundle is wonderful. It has everything one could ever need for learning how to use a DSLR. I am still learning so much and this kit covers all of it. Absolute best starter kit one could ask for. 
9005 It s all ok! 
9006 I do love this camera, so does my wife, very easy to master and such high quality images. Expensive for a small camera but definitely worth it. 
9007 Works well and comes in handy. 
9008 Love it & great for beginner. Travel friendly. 
9009 Very nice bokek lens. 
9010 Great product. Arrived In 2 days. Gave it a &#34;once over&#34; then closed it & held it under water for about 10 minutes. Upon inspection the inside was dry. Definitely a smart investment for a minimal price 
9011 Works great. The only tip try fixing the right angle and check a pre video of it, before jumping into your board. It will save you some dissappointment time. 
9012 Very good product, great deal for the money i pay, 
9013 As advertised 
9014 Shipped quickly and was as expected 
9015 Great product! The product arrived quickly with no issues. 
9016 Worked fine have purchased these before 
9017 Versatile and small. Not heavy at all,but can hold alot of weight if need be. I have put a light, a receiver,and a mic on this piece and it has not let me down. 
9018 works great and fixed issue of camera not staying on :) 
9019 This camera is great, the goodies that came with it are awesome too. It survived a direct hit from several water balloons, shaving cream, and a few high speed drops while filming an event. Great point and shoot with the flexibility of an action camera. 
9020 Shipping was incredibly fast and arrived 2 days early even without prime. Both batteries work and everything is correct. Nothing much complicated about this. They are batteries. Either they work or they dont. 
9021 Stiff on the neck 
9022 as expected. 
9023 Great buy. More batteries life. 
9024 Purchased this during Amazon s anniversary sale. Works as intended, it seems to be well built out of some solid plastic. I ll trust that it will hold my camera just fine. It s not the greatest stabilization, but way better than just hand holding the camera. 
9025 Very good. 
9026 Great binoculars for birdwatching. 
9027 It was no problem to use or appearance. 
9028 Just what I wanted! Thanks. 
9029 I got this for my sister for her birthday. I can t believe the amount of accessories that came with it! Was way more than expected and I know she s absolutely going to love this! Also shipped super fast! Thanks! 
9030 Excelent product 
9031 works well 
9032 I love the album...it is exactly what I wanted. Gallery Leather has earned 5 stars from this satisfied customer. The service was prompt and the delivery right on time. Thanks so much. rpb 
9033 WOW WHAT A CAMERA! Panasonic Lumix DMC-ZS45W FULL STEAM ahead. A great travel zoom camera MUST.Wifi \ 16 MP \easy upload\ video perfect. 
9034 GoPro 
9035 the size is suitable for small jobs but I would like the power of the lamps was better. 
9036 Surprisingly versatile with a firm grip. I much prefer this set to the OEM Sony backpack mount. 
9037 great 
9038 Price was good, and the cable works just great with my camera so no complaints at all. Looks like it s good quality too. 
9039 Picture quality is great and is easy to use. Convenient size making picture taking in close up situations easier than pulling out the SLR. 
9040 Good scope. Easy to set up and use. Better optics then the price would suggest. 
9041 Very easily to use and small enough to carry around with you on trips. 
9042 Perfect match ! 
9043 Exact replacement. Needed a good additional battery for outdoor travels! 
9044 Perfect 
9045 The charger came in ahead of promised date and was as advertised 
9046 It is a very good deal for the amateur photographer. I love the pictures that it takes. Very simple to operate. 
9047 bought it for my daughter, she loves it. 
9048 Excellent product 
9049 Fast shipping! Items came as I expected. Good quality and I definitely will order from 47th again. 
9050 these stands are very light, appear a little delicate, but with good handling are fantastic 
9051 awesome! 
9052 I love this products and ill suggest any one who do diving to buy. Its really nice 
9053 As ordered. On time. A bit awkward to use. Not as useful as I had hoped. 
9054 Return it 
9055 The ring does not work at all !! It is not possible to focus properly with any FD-lens, probably due to the inserted ekstra lens in the adapter. Waste of Money ! Frank Visti 
9056 Solid little camera extension, I used it with a GoPro 
9057 These batteries seem to work well. The battery that the collar came with is still working fine. I will be able to comment more after I have used these. Thanks! 
9058 Added some life to a laptop we were ready to toss out. Fits perfectly and seems to hold a charge reasonably well. 
9059 Too small for the camera models suggested. 
9060 Seems to be working fine 
9061 Great photos but there is a long lag in video recording. 
9062 Great camera for a beginner like me :) 
9063 The case it self was very nice but there was lots of delays 
9064 Great Value! 
9065 I think the Note about no hard drive should be up at the top. I know this is intentional to sell a system cheap. 
9066 pleased with the order.:) 
9067 Isnt last as long as the Sony battery. 
9068 Way too big for this girl. 
9069 Not pro quality but a good get by. Mine was missing the cleaning cloth. Sharpness a little weak on the edges but very usable. 
9070 this gooseneck is worthless, it is almost impossible to twist (massive grip between the joints) and any flexion or shortening (separating the joints) causes them to fracture. Boooo! 
9071 Look real and your nosey neighbors will look like dummies! 
9072 Camera worked well in &#34;live&#34; mode, but failed to respond in &#34;motion detection&#34; at any setting on both cameras I purchased. Easy to set up and a great clear picture, but I purchased them for the motion detection feature and cannot get it to work after a month of trying. 
9073 Excellent product. Great construction. Put this on my bicycle along a 12 mile trail and it was perfect. No complaints. 
9074 Works as described. Forgot it s there after a few days now always have a record of all activity. 
9075 very nice~! 
9076 It is very well made and versatile. I use it for a compact camera bag with space for extra batteries. I took it on a cruise and it was rugged and did an excellent job. 
9077 Works great! 
9078 I received it earlier than expected which is great! It works really well, I had it on the side of my car for the first time and it stayed on. Good quality and price! I will buy it again with my second GoPro. 
9079 Well made bigger than I expected. I will order a scene set for more bounce work. Shipping was slower than expected but was reasonable. 
9080 Product arrived very promptly, great pricing for a beginner set. I couldn t be happier with my purchase! 
9081 Love it! Does everything it says. Great price 
9082 Perfect... 
9083 The leg post will not work after a few uses. The locking mechanism is cheaply made and, after a short time, will break. I can only use it from a sitting position now - not standing as the legs will not elongate anymore. Very disappointing. 
9084 Sent this back. I m not a rocket scientist. 
9085 Excellent product,quick to charge two batteries in about half the time of the charger that came with the camera. Has a screen that tells the amount of charge the battery has and how much more charge is needed to get a fully charged battery. 
9086 Super clear, Decided on 12 over 10 for Colorado trip. fast shipping 
9087 Mainly plastic but it does hold a small camera on a bike very well. Does the job. 
9088 5 years later still working perfect. only downfall is the battery level reading is inaccurate 
9089 I really like the price but I was really surprised by the quality of the product I thought it would have been a GoPro product by looking at it 
9090 Very good 
9091 The remote did not work with my canon 5D as indicated. 
9092 Love it! 
9093 I gave it as a gift. It s OK. 
9094 works fine. it seems sturdy enough. 
9095 Tried it on my car and didn t scratch or fall off! 
9096 One of the two I used broke on the prongs 
9097 Good color, great wide angle view, it worth the money! 
9098 we used it twice and one of the propellers stopped working. don t know how to get ahold of anyone for parts and if there is a warranty 
9099 pretty sure this is copy write infringement... or at the very least toeing the line. http://store.froknowsphoto.com/ 
9100 Returned the product. Items were missing from a sealed box. 
9101 first one was not connecting wireless to phone or ipad. was on phone with tech support for 90 minutes and they couldn t get it to work. Will try a replacement. Software would not recognize camera and connect. 
9102 fits right! 
9103 Perfect replacement for GoPro Hero 4 Silver case. Original was cheap plastic which broke in no time. Be sure to add some threadlock to the screw that holds this part in place. 
9104 Worked perfectly as described!!! 
9105 Got all my solar lights going again without costing a fortune. 
9106 works fine 
9107 The add listed this as a Panasonic Lumix charger. It is a GENERIC charger that barely even works and it is so bulky it won t fit into my small camera bag like the original Panasonic charger did. 
9108 Great product! 
9109 Battery function does not work cannot seem to charge battery. 
9110 Excellent 
9111 This is another product that I got for my trip and I can t say enough about it. I m in love with this camera. I got if for myself as a gift for my birthday and it works great. I m so glad that I got it. 
9112 Can t get it to work. It works maybe once out of ever 20 clicks if I hold it right up against the camera. I m using it with a Nikon D3200 
9113 Great product and Amazon customer service is top notch. Thank you 
9114 Works fine, indistinguishable from the original. 
9115 Never lose your cap again--such a simple idea, works great! 
9116 Missing half of what s in the listing 
9117 Really good product , especially using it to hold the baby monitor. 
9118 batteries as advertised mor power than factory battery 
9119 kept me from losing my GoPro camera while snorkeling in the Virgin Islands! 
9120 Called for customer serviec and spoke with Walter. Made it a breeze to set up. 
9121 Best security cameras. Better than I expected. Set up was such a breeze. Customer service is wonderful! Had th3se for a few months now and I couldn t be happier!! Getting ready to order 4 more cameras. 
9122 Very good product and really does look like a TV or computer is being used. 
9123 This camera works pretty good 
9124 Amazing device! Must try! 
9125 flash is great, remote not so much. go with the flash only kit. 
9126 All good. 
9127 I bought this screen protector and was excited to use it. I put it on my D7100 and it s immediately cracked on the right corner. I m terribly disappointed with this product and I will be returning it immediately. 
9128 Good cleaning cloth for my glasses. It does require hand-wash which maintains it. 
9129 I havent dropped my GoPro in a lake or the ocean yet- so I will update my post when I do. It looks great on my camera tho! 
9130 its good for protection but its restrict the movement of screen for selfie etc 
9131 really pretty good.... 
9132 Comes with a pricetag however much better than friction mounts that looks like this at the fraction of the cost. This arm will not drop your monitor or camera any time soon. 
9133 I was very disappointed the case will not hold the camera. I would like to contact the seller.I am satisfied with the camera. 
9134 Would have given it a five star review after the first handful of wearing. Only four one as it is not quite as effective but still helps. 
9135 Great replacement. Fit great. 
9136 Great little device that simplifies password hassels, well made and fantastic quality 
9137 Nice product. Liked it a lot. 
9138 Handy, but the clip broke from me picking it up without even touching the clip... But I ll cut it some slack for the low price. 
9139 Two thumbs up! Very happy with this lens! 
9140 Happy with this 
9141 Charger and batteries work great! 
9142 Shipped fast, worked as anticipated! 
9143 Pretty poor quality. It doesn t hold the flashes secure. I had them fall out a few times and it broke after just two days of use. I cannot recommend this 
9144 I love the camera, it gives me great pictures, many choices and easy to use. 
9145 it was a gift he loved it 
9146 I had the same product when it was produced by pentex 
9147 great in the garage but not so much in active living space. 
9148 After a few months, it doesn t satisfyingly click into place. And when you put it on backwards it doesn t stay in place really well. Overall, does it s job well. 
9149 Very useful!!! 
9150 Love it 
9151 very easy to use, fast shipping. 
9152 Top of the line! What more can i say! 
9153 All ok 
9154 small compact, only negative is the center column, Worked great with it down and a good ball head. I am 5 5 so the center column was down most of the time. I liked the retractable spike in the feet. 
9155 Camera takes very nice pictures and video. The lens that is included is amazing. This package deal included everything that I needed to start out. 
9156 Excellent customer service. Great cameras. 
9157 I have big wrist and it fits well 
9158 I love my Nissin flash. This thing has great power for the size. The zoom operation is a bit funky though. 
9159 Cord is a tad short but the device works very well. Pretty straight forward. Make sure to pick up a pack of AAA batteries before ordering. 
9160 Perfect 
9161 threw charger away kept batteryfor clickers 
9162 Works well except the light is substandard. 
9163 Great case for XQD cards 
9164 excellent item, solved my problem 
9165 [[ASIN:B004BDNJZA Jill-e Designs 022738 Clutch for Camera (Red)]] 
9166 Works exactly as expected. Christmas morning pictures last year turned out awesome! 
9167 Charger works great.. on occasion it will report that one battery isn t fully charged, but when you remove the &#34;full&#34; battery, the other then immediately reports as being full. Good enough. 
9168 Camera is easy to use but a lot of that power goes to waste when you cant process RAW images...Canon s web site blows when it comes to downloading codec. 
9169 easy to set up and excellent quality great customer service 
9170 it s small and perfect 
9171 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
9172 I wish they sold this case without the foam, but the case isn t that expensive so I just threw the foam away. 
9173 Highly Recommended! 
9174 A little on the big side got to use at an angle but does get the job done 
9175 Just as described , works and feels wonderful on my camera ;) 
9176 GRREAT!!! 
9177 super cool 
9178 For the cost I expected either an aluminum lense hood or one of the fouls back rubber types. What I got was a thin plastic hood that looks like it could break easily. I ll have to be careful. 
9179 Excellent lens for the money. 
9180 Performs very well. Carry it with me most of the time. 
9181 Total pain in the butt to set up!! 
9182 excellent item, solved my problem 
9183 seem to work great. 
9184 Really nice lens. Great quality, smooth focus and very sharp. Works with my fujifilm xe-1 
9185 One of the best values you ll find in a camera accessory of its type but be prepared for sparse and poorly written instruction that truly have to be read with a magnifier. 
9186 Arrived on time and worked great!! 
9187 Not quite up to the Olympus branded original battery but low price; I carry 3 in my camera bag - never w/o power. 
9188 i loved it...... until it got lost in the ocean witch was NOT the proudcts fualt 
9189 so cute and so portable. :D 
9190 I liked all the attachments but only a few of the fit my gopro 4 
9191 Worth the price! 
9192 Great camera for our school. These are &#34;little bit&#34; wide angle so they work great in ceiling tiles. We used mostly these and couple of the regular UVC s and Pro s for a small school installation and it works great. Yet another awesomely useful hardware by Ubiquiti. 
9193 It worked great to charge my camera. Recommended. 
9194 Was not what I expected! 
9195 Great 
9196 Considering the price of a Hoya CPL filter, this works great, cuts glare, enhances colors, makes the blue sky more blue and the clouds stand out. 
9197 Shipping is fast and quality is good 
9198 it s alright 
9199 helps with my photo work 
9200 great seller,nice product,for now it works well 
9201 It seemed to be a fine product at a great price. However I returned it because it wouldn t work with my intended lens. Great service by the seller. Was not his fault. 
9202 It does mostly what I want. It takes some figuring out but if you read the Q&A below it s doable. Still trying to figure out how to set the time, but for what you pay, it s pretty damn good. 
9203 Just got mine today it feels good in the head but never tried and water oh and plus the wrist strap is too small and is weird 
9204 Great little pack for those long trips and vacations. 
9205 Product was described to work with go pro camera mounts. The mount would not tighten to secure the go pro. Reached out to the seller with no response. Extremely disappointed. 
9206 The eTopxizu go pro is awesome. I couldn t use the jaw clamp on my bike but put a quick release self adhesive clip on my bike and works great very nice setup. 
9207 Easy set up and easy to use! I love the ease with which I was able to install this camera and the clarity of the picture! 
9208 Works great on all of our apple products. The price was amazing for the the amount of cloths you get. I highly recommend this product if you have any electronic that need a soft cloth. I will be buying more when I need them or for a gift. 
9209 Great Product! I used this for a Tough Mudder and has no issues with it falling off, slipping, or bouncing around. Very Comfortable product as well. 
9210 Awesome Camera... small and the quality...is great 
9211 It works fine not the best picture at nice. I found another camera that 800 tvl and $1.50 cheat. With way better picture and much better night view. I would not buy this one again 
9212 works great plugged it in and mount the sensor that s it 
9213 GREAT CAMERA FOR THE PRICE. KEEP IT AROUND MY NECK ON MOTORCYCLE TRIPS FOR THOSE UNEXPECTED MOMENTS............. 
9214 nice 
9215 I am happy about this battery. Works good. Thanks... 
9216 Works perfectly. Why anybody would spend four to six times as much for the branded equivalent is beyond me. 
9217 Horrible what a waste of my hard earned money is all I can say! I did not even want to give it a star pretty sorry! 
9218 This doesnt even deserve one star. 
9219 Solid build, sharp design & perfect match! 
9220 This case was okay when new but, over time, the inside lining started to fray. Some of the lint got into the camera and damaged it. The camera lens can no longer zoom. 
9221 Purchased without a hitch, but never was able to register as the camera I purchased this for was a poor quality camera that arrived damaged and was returned. 
9222 Exactly what I wanted to toss into my camera bag. Makes setting a white/grey/black balance in variable lighting conditions easy. I like to shoot one picture at the beginning of a series with these cards visible. Then when I get into Lightroom/Photoshop I can quickly set my white balance. 
9223 This is from a very fine German firm Schneider. I have been to their factory and seen their works. They have been one of the finest lens makers in the world for many years. There is a noticeable difference between this and other filters. 
9224 Works perfectly, very durable. 
9225 The charger works well, but very disappointed that caps are not on the batteries in order to prevent them from shorting out in camera bag. I liked the tripod and cleaning kit that came with it, however the battery caps are more important. 
9226 Motion trigger is pretty good. Lightning trigger is rubbish!! 
9227 Great picture frames. Used them as part of a centerpiece. 
9228 The swabs were different sizes and all it did was smear cleaning solution on my sensor. I ended up having to pay to have it professionally cleaned anyway. 
9229 Nice photos 
9230 Just what I needed. 
9231 To much to adjust. Head locking device does not hold the scope tight. The screw that tensions on the scope mount fell out on my first back packing trip. Also a little heavy. 
9232 awesome 
9233 the battery arrived two days later than expected. for whatever reason, the batter charge only lasted 1 day before having to recharge it again. Now after one month, the batter is no longer chargeable. 
9234 The quality of this I thought was going to be cheep. I was surprised very sturdy well worth the money! 
9235 I use this bag for my Nikon D7100. Plenty of room in the bag, without being bulky. A great bag for the price, I highly recommend it. 
9236 The GOBUDi stick totally met my expectations. It s got a nice and practical design. Couldn t expect any better for this prize. 
9237 Good and useful 
9238 Received replacement, worse than the first, all the unit does it vibrate, then shuts off, then starts to continuously vibrate again without any input from the remote, remote is totally useless. Starting to believe that there is no quality control or testing before sending these products out. 
9239 Havent tried them out yet. Got them for vacation. But tried my friends and ig these work as well they will be great. 
9240 Blocked out too much light. Couldn t see much with it and when I returned it I had to pay the shipping 
9241 Product received undamaged and works as expected. 
9242 Perfect for camera. Great space for several attachments 
9243 cool 
9244 The instructions on disk do not go well with this clock. The buttons are not labeled the same or even close to what is in the instructions. I don t have the time to decode it. I wouldn t make this purchase again. 
9245 Great Product, just wish they wouldnt put any lettering on outside but can easily be removed with sand paper..Great Price 
9246 Excellent camera! 
9247 Very happy 
9248 Nice camera for it size and cost 
9249 I was looking for a better camera for casual family shots as my old one took so long to recover between shots. This seems to fit what I need in a simple to operate mode. It was also in the price range I was looking for. 
9250 Rated these 2 stars because although these are really cool. They are not HD. They aren t worth this much money if they are claiming to be full 1080p HD because they aren t high quality. 
9251 GREAT CAMERA EVEN DURING WINTER IT CA DO IT MAKE GREEN TREE COLOR 
9252 this camera software is not good , and setup is not very ease , after some figuring out got it to work but would not buy again , the camera specs are good but the app to operate on mobile app is not, remote view away from home gives trouble 
9253 Came missing parts. 
9254 Much larger and bulkier than I thought it d be. 
9255 Worked perfectly with my Sony Xperia Z3 phone. It succeed my expectations. Will recommend to my friends 
9256 Received exactly as described. We are still working our way through figuring out how to use all of the attachments! 
9257 Excelent product 
9258 [[ASIN:B00OV9IB2A Spy Tec STI_ZIR32 Surveillance Cameras]] 
9259 Keeps me at ease, took a lil bit of time to learn but got it down! 
9260 Awesome 
9261 Amazing tripod head, works great! 
9262 I used these in my Nikon camera and have had excellent luck. I see no difference in battery life between these and the factory original. I think these actually have more milliwhatevers than the factory one. 
9263 So worth getting the bulk pack instead of buying them individually. You save money and have lots of film just in case :) 
9264 Great lens. Can not beat it for the price. 
9265 The plug was obviously corroded before it was shipped out. I should have taken the other recent reviews at face value. 
9266 Batteries arrived quickly. High quality product. Everything in order. Highly recommend. 
9267 Great 
9268 Working good but not very easy to install on flash. Size for standard size (not small) flashes only. 
9269 Fits the Canon powershot SX60 well. Light and certainly fit for purpose. 
9270 Works great, took a while to realize if in the locked position, the camera does not recognize it. 
9271 rec d as promised and as advertised 
9272 Good enough for me. I haven t used the Nikon or Sigma wide angles so I can t compare, but this one has F/2.8, good autofocus and is wide enough for interiors and landscape. 
9273 Amazing product. We ve used the heck out of it since we bought it! Took it on a vacation to south Florida and it helped us make and remember more memories than we ve been able to before. It s a great buy I highly recommend. 
9274 A wonderful pocket camera. 
9275 Solidly built. Haven t figured the LCD display yet. The remote is line-of-sight, if you re off by a couple of degrees it won t work. 
9276 Small one isn t as small as I hoped and the large ones are huge. Well enough made and will protect the lenses. 
9277 Great Value! 
9278 convenient. Adds a lot of life. 
9279 awesome case. very well made and solid. love it for my camera lenses!!! 
9280 Case leaks you get what you pay for 
9281 This monopod is light, extremely strong and stable. Wish I d found this sooner. 
9282 It was the best GoPro on the market.. Do your research. 
9283 what was advertised as a &#34;kit&#34; containing mini tripod and micro sd card, was just the case. 
9284 bought it as a gift ...need an accessories bag for all the stuff! 
9285 was very satisfied with the product,work excellent with my camcorder. 
9286 WIFI is iffy, would be better with Bluetooth or screen mirroring technology. Hard to use if you have large hands. 
9287 Its a great battery but its a high price is there a OEM cheaper ??? 
9288 Great deal for price. 
9289 I tried other suction cup products but this is the best one. Holds firm driving on pretty rugged roads. 
9290 Works like a charm with my Nikon camera when i went ziplining recently. Very sturdy and well built. 
9291 Arrived broken! 
9292 Fast delivery and products were as advertised 
9293 Used it a few times already, great audio. 
9294 Best lens you can get. One of the sharpest if not the sharpest. 
9295 Thanks!!! 
9296 Stopped working and I waited to long to return it. 
9297 Great price. 
9298 Exactly what I was expecting. Thank you! 
9299 Does the job but overpriced! 
9300 Have only been using this camera for about a week. I was using a D7100 which I love. The D750 allows me to take full advantage of some of my older &#34;pre digital&#34; Nikon lenses. Its early but so far I love this camera. 
9301 Excellent mount 
9302 This may be cheaper than the Canon brand but it works great! I love my knew lens hood! 
9303 Pretty new, so no qualitative evaluation I can provide yet. Looks good and worked perfectly so far. 
9304 When I bought this as a stand alone wireless camera and it was no such thing. This camera is an add on to a system that has a special screen and receiver. 
9305 Good 
9306 App wouldn t work. 
9307 highly recomend it. It works great with my nikon d3200. 
9308 This didn t last very long. I purchased it in mid Feb 2015 and had to replace it by August because i it was very dim. It started out ok. 
9309 It s out of this world it is unbelievable lens every shut I take the pictures come out beautiful so I recommend whoever buys his lens they getting their moneys worth and that s all I have to say 
9310 A perfect replacement. 
9311 Good product. Very happy with purchase. 
9312 Tip kept coming off and was lost after the 2nd day. Poor quality, junk. 
9313 very good and fast service would order again 
9314 Just had it professionally installed for it to not even work! it looked legit and brand new so never thought about asking them to test it first. 
9315 I really love the soft focus and star filter. Very high quality for the price and I highly recommend for amateur/hobby photographers. 
9316 Very hard to pull the spring open to fit my phone in it. 
9317 Top seller, very impressed with prompt delivery,item as described by seller, recommend to all. Thank you, will buy again. 
9318 As expected 
9319 Used on Alaska cruise. Very satisfied. 
9320 Cute unit, PA crap, NO WHERE CLOSE TO 100 watt power 
9321 Nice camera. Takes great photos and also nice videos. Used it on a trip to Ireland and lots of people were envious of me when I started taking videos of people dancing in an Irish pub. 
9322 Great affordable camera grip for videos 
9323 love it 
9324 Perfect fit and excellent value 
9325 good price 
9326 Very expensive but very well made and a must for leveling cameras on tripods without a leveling bowl. 
9327 these clips are so strong they will take the him off the side of our screen if you pull them that hard. So nice to be able to get the screen as tight as I want without having them pull off. 
9328 Works like a charm! I was previously using my canon flash without this hot shoe adapter and it would not make a good connection when I changed my angle and not flash. Now, works perfectly every time. 
9329 Light yet burly. Great for extreme skiing. 
9330 The concept of great, but after receiving the holders, I discovered I have to remove the lens cap first, if I want to add or remove the lens hood. 
9331 very good 
9332 Perfect size. Good quality. 
9333 Great customer service! They will strive to take care of you. Solid construction. A great value for the price! 
9334 The product came quickly and works as it should. Run time is the same or maybe a little longer than the factory battery. 
9335 It works really well. Went and bought another. 
9336 It does not work 
9337 the ac adapter is broke and they just keep telling they are out of them to wait. it has been 3 months 
9338 Focus pretty fast and quiet. 
9339 Can t tell the difference between this and a regular tv picture from the outside of the house. Great job whoever invented this thing. 
9340 Work good 
9341 Pictures look great ! 
9342 Light weight - but very good distance vision capability. Easy to adjust. 
9343 Works great. I like using this better than my helmet mount. 
9344 Love it! It would be five stars if it had longer battery life. Tons of great functions, apps and more... My best camera ever! 
9345 Even has night vision in the house Easy to install Had to buy 100 ft extension cables to use outside 
9346 great! 
9347 Decent quality. The best part is that most of these items are small and easy to put into your camera bag without taking up too much space. 
9348 its works fine. 
9349 It was late but that s my only real issue with it. I would have liked it if it came with a fur more extra screws but for the price it s okay. 
9350 Lots of room for lots of accessories and the cam - good product. 
9351 Fast delivery, easy to put on and take off. Use it mainly for lense protection 
9352 Exceptional 
9353 Fast shipping works excellent 
9354 The charger works, but it is very difficult to attach it to the battery. The first time I tried, I broke off the little plastic part that is intended to hold it in place. 
9355 was the right size, worked great. Have had it for almost 2 months, and it quit working. paid $138 for a monitor to work for 2 months. It is past the returns 30 day window so amazon is saying no refund or exchange. Very unsatisfied. 
9356 Some parts broke after use , some are working ok 
9357 good choice well worth the money. 
9358 huhh, it s alright tiny! 
9359 Worked great with our Intvo a camera. We dove at Key Largo, Florida and recommended the floats after a fellow diver dropped his GoPro while climbing back into the boat. 
9360 Nice lol gadget 
9361 Always the highest quality for the price. 
9362 Everything you expect from Domke. Well made, well thought out, reasonably priced. I have half a dozen Domke bags, have for years, and no other bag has served me nearly as well 
9363 This is the best camera I have ever had. So easy to use, I love the instant pictures. Fun to share with friends. Love it. 
9364 Excellent 
9365 Works ... its just a battery ....... Not prime rib dinner ! 
9366 I am using it on a flip flash bracket. It s the perfect length! It s holding the flash very well and I have yet to have any issues after using it for a few weeks. 
9367 Item arrived as promised. Batteries and charger work great. The cleaning supplies are a good bonus. The price is great! I recommend this product to anyone looking to buy extra batteries for their camera. Works great with a canon rebel t3i. 
9368 This is my first flash and it is perfect! 
9369 It was good as it was supposed to. 
9370 did not work, returned 
9371 Perfect camera. Takes excellent pictures. I have been able to capture birds in flight from quite a distance, which is exactly why I purchased the camera. Shutter speed is exactly as manufacture describes. 
9372 Suction Cup is amazing the arm is very versatile! 
9373 Quality just wasnt there, Returned it. 
9374 Good product for the price. 
9375 terrible 
9376 Product was as advertised. 
9377 Enjoy thid item 
9378 Beautiful beads. I absolutely love them, actually want another set. Thank you. 
9379 Works just fine and is easy to use. A good purchase. 
9380 Fits all my stuff, just a couple inches more would have made it great. 
9381 Best camera purchase yet! 
9382 One of my six units quit working after only 3 weeks, I contacted the seller and they said to send back the intercom that doesn t work at MY EXPENSE. 
9383 It works, but I m not blown away. I like the form factor. GREAT size and VERY convenient that it folds away. 
9384 Very good service I m happy 
9385 Leaking - will be returning for refund. Maybe I just got a dud? 
9386 Very nice comfy strap. 
9387 Very good product 
9388 Keeps my drive protected. Has room for papers or anything else plus the cord. 
9389 It is more than I expected 
9390 Just what I needed to convert my mount for my contour 
9391 works great. 
9392 This camera worked one time, first timeIhave been disappointed with an item I bought on Amazon. 
9393 So nice to have when out and about, can carry around neck without bulk, or protects camera when putting it in a bigger bag. 
9394 Essential tool for serious photographers when editiing their photos either on Mac or Windows. Sensor is much smaller than on previous versions and technical support is outstanding. 
9395 Great product works with my mobile phone remotely great just wish it was HD 
9396 Should have known better, for the price, it is exactly what I should have expected. 
9397 The Q-See cameras I installed are working great.I believe everyone should have them at their residence. Q-See products deliver what they promise. 
9398 I ll never use a sandbag again! 
9399 Nuce 
9400 Thank you 
9401 Great service. Works well and easy to take on trip. 
9402 With this bag I am actually using my camera more. I can get my camera out and put it back without ever setting the bag down. I prefer this over a backpack style bag. 
9403 Helmet mount worthless so much for getting footage of Sturgis don t waste your money buy a gopro 
9404 Excellent lens. Perfoms as stated. 
9405 Works great. i might have to get another one. 
9406 This is junk 
9407 I got this but soon realized that, I don t typically want to share a photo with anyone/anything before editing it a bit in Photoshop. So...not really using it at the moment. I did a small amount if testing and I had no problems with it. 
9408 Worked great. I mounted it on a vertical bar in an aerobatic airplane when I had my first lesson doing spins, rolls and loops. If is stays in place doing that, it should withstand most bicycle maneuvers 
9409 quick delivery perfect quality 
9410 I no longer own this camera. It has a propensity of shutting in mid use. 
9411 This is the second unit I bought to give as gifts. Copter can take some crashes without any damage, For the money I think this is a good deal for the price.. 
9412 Absolutely worth every penny! 
9413 The Monopod Tripod Mount is a perfect product for mounting you device on a selfie stick or any type of tripod. It is a perfect accessory for capturing those memorable moments in life. I love using it on my selfie stick to create family videos. 
9414 Works great!! Unfortunately, it doesn t come with the &#34;J-Hook&#34; so you can mount your Go Pro Camera. (I have a Go Pro 2) Not a big deal though. There are plenty of places that sell it on Amazon. Fast shipping. Good pprice. 
9415 i Received a power2000 charger XP-333-29 with four 2900 MAH rechargeable batteries, which is a good deal, Although I did not receive the one picured in the ad, I am satisfied as I said before, and no further action need be taken 
9416 Does exactly what it should and does it well. 
9417 Works just as described by others. See the Flickr pool for this lens for examples of what it can/cannot do. 
9418 Great product! 
9419 Great product. Been working on 16 CH system with no issues. A+ 
9420 using for my 10x nd filter 
9421 Too thin 
9422 I like this product and will buy again. 
9423 This is a great lens cap. Ruged material and fits my canon SX 40HS perfectly. I highly recommend it. 
9424 These are pretty cool, great picture, easy install. The toggle adjustment switch was just a little problem getting into 1/2 conduit sleeve to hide in gang box outside. Otherwise, happy with purchase! 
9425 I love the filter, but find it difficult to get on and off the lens. 
9426 There is only one word for this product.....AWESOME! 
9427 Convenient, inexpensive and easy to use. 
9428 Glass was flawed with a discolored spot within the middle third of the filter. Rendered unusable. Should have been a rejected product. 
9429 This adapter is a great buy. I allowed me to really explore my camera and what it can do. Before this purchase I had to rush and get pictures taken before the batteries ran down. Now I can take my time. 
9430 Great package of accessories for the GoPro! 
9431 really good buy and excellent transmission capabilities, made four odd lengths from 100 
9432 great for small scale usage 
9433 just nice to have a back up battery. 
9434 This tripod would not seat my camera firmly against the base, effectively making it useless. The screw to attach the camera was did not have long enough threads to pull the camera tight. It wobbled like crazy even when screwed all the way in. This was with my Pentax K-50. 
9435 Quit funtionjng after a week! 
9436 The video sunglasses mp3 
9437 Is not working. 
9438 They never worked I m so upset, I ve bought different spyglasses and have worked well, but this purchase was sadly a mistake. 
9439 Thank you! 
9440 This charger is like none other. More powerful than even the product instructions describe. A must have!!! David 
9441 Works Great just as it should Thanks 
9442 Worked perfect 
9443 A lot better than using plus filters. Able to use on all lenses. 
9444 so far, so good. came very fast. 
9445 Very fast delivery .. It s my husbands 60 th birthday present 
9446 He hasn t seen yet but I m sure he will be thrilled 
9447 Really Handy to get extra batteries. So small and easy to store. 
9448 Works as Expected. 
9449 Arrived with a broken plastic clip rail, so I had to tape the battery in while it charged. 
9450 nice quality, works great 
9451 Works as advertised, works fine. The picture above shows the wrong connector, its actually silver and fits fine with the Nikon D3100. 
9452 Takes great clear pictures. Takes a bit of work to figure out all the settings. 
9453 Super great bag, Solid and well padded. It does come with a shoulder strap. Compartments for other accessories as well. 
9454 Easy to use, Very light , all weather functional , nice video quality 
9455 Excellent. Just what I needed for the look and feel. See Ba Ba Black Sheep, for yourself: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wpBifyjcsSE 
9456 These work great and price is right. 
9457 The motion sensor doesn t work at night, so it won t record until ur literally waving your arms Update: 6 months later The recording device crapped out. It no longer records or functions. New rating would be 1 star 
9458 Good camera system 
9459 This is the second time I have bought this assortment. Still 110% pleased!! 
9460 Great case, hard to keep GoPro protected 
9461 It is inexpensive, attaches easily and does the job. 
9462 works fine if you want to carry that much weight. the housing where you place the batteries though looks & feels cheap like it can break any minute. 
9463 Haven t had to use it. 
9464 I purchased this monocular for my husband. He loves it. He only has one good eye so binoculars are not useful. This Polar Explorer is perfect. Also, it was delivered as promised in perfect condition. The price was right. Will definitely use this supplier for future such purchases. 
9465 Nice bag, bought it as a gift for my wife for her new camera. Very happy with it. 
9466 Fits fine on a my Fujifilm pancake lens. 
9467 Not as described at all. Seller did make up for it! 
9468 Ok 
9469 Hoya filters are very reliable. Have several Hoya filters and have always had great results. 
9470 Excellent 
9471 The hood doesn t fit properly on my Pentax lens. 
9472 I am still trying to figure out why I bought this. It has all kinds of fancy programs that I will never use and some of my outdoor picks haven t captured the detail correctly. Personally I don t leave a camera outside all night to take star pictures. 
9473 I use this tripod and phone attachment with my iPhone 6. It is easy to attach to the back of a chair or to stand on a table. It s lightweight and easily fits in my bag with the legs flattened together. 
9474 NO WHERE in the advertising did it say for GoPro 3 or earlier models. Does not work with any GoPro 4. Huge disappointment. 
9475 perfect for the Phantom and accessories 
9476 Good purchase. Same as other more expensive camara, but for way less. I recommed it. 
9477 Good camera for the price. 
9478 works great 
9479 good product 
9480 very compact , great resolution for a kit lens, 
9481 The frame lasted as long as the time that it was too late to return, 
9482 Very well made for the price. Panning is very smooth because they have added grease to it which you can see and slightly hear when panning but that is fine with me. 
9483 Great deal, I wanna order more 
9484 Unit does what it was designed to do and I like it a lot. Was a bit disappointing with how weak the edge support is, but overall works fine. 
9485 Excellent package! Get it!! 
9486 Sold to a friend, still work till this day. 
9487 It s a great case. I can fit a lot of basic accessories in it. Definitely nothing too long though. 3 way fits in it. The material is good quality. No need to purchase the expensive one from gopole. 
9488 Premium price for a good product. I bought the lanyard kit to hold this unit. I feel a fair price would have included the lanyard/ mounting kit. 
9489 Too complicated for me. I thought it was Wireless so there would be no wired connections 
9490 Only wanted one set of two but must have double ordered as I got and paid for two sets 
9491 very nice! 
9492 works as described. 
9493 We are very impressed with this system. 
9494 The Nikon binoculars are excellent. The optics are clear and offer sharp magnification yet is easily handheld for a steady image. Low light performance is great. The rubber finish provides excellent protection from bumps and moisture gives a secure grip. A really great product. 
9495 helpful 
9496 The tripod is very very cheap. The monopod is fairly good quality. 
9497 It fits perfectly in my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera and the anti-reflective feature works fine and now it is easier see the screen without any light glare. 
9498 Sony recommended website product for a6000. Fits the LCD screen perfectly. 
9499 Timely delivery - they fit 
9500 Have wanted these for years now have them can see what I haven t been able to also easier then a telescope 
9501 Nice and easy to use 
9502 exactly what I needed. 
9503 Terrific quality backdrop. Love the fabric quality! 
9504 This specifies that it fits the Canon PowerShot SX60---it does not. I m hoping that I will be able to return it but have had no response to my inquiry from several weeks ago. 
9505 This is a great, lightweight tripod, for a great price! 
9506 Great deal fast delivery, will buy again when I need more, very good quality! 
9507 Very useful. A little less on the product material quality but for thw price, it is totally reasonable. 
9508 Very well crafted using high quality leather. Good protection and elegant case. A+ 
9509 My gf loves it! Get this one beczuase it has bigger films = bigger picture! :D yay! 
9510 Good product just have to be careful will fall off some belt loops 
9511 arrived in great condition 
9512 Convenient, does what it is supposed to do No problems 
9513 Excellent waterproof case. Hasn t failed me. 
9514 Great functional product but overpriced. 
9515 Product was as advertised. 
9516 Great Product, Just as Described!!! 
9517 I was really impressed with this unit. Very bright. 
9518 Loved the product 
9519 I love them, and the price was a lot less than what I shopped around for. Thank You. Dotty Shartzer 
9520 A good product.. My husband uses when taking pictures for ebay store. 
9521 only worked once or twice 
9522 Awesome and beautifully colored 
9523 The one I received was not silver like the picture but part black and part silver. Was not really happy about that. Should have been all black or all silver. Not a mix 
9524 its a basic bag, replaced it shortly after I got it with a pelican case, this is okay for a cheap camera when you need to save space. 
9525 Camera and associated app work great. I can control the camera rotation remotely and zoom in. I am also able to call the animals over the two way communication. 
9526 Such a cute case I love it so much! Ive had this for a while and it protects my camera. It looks as good as new! 
9527 We have mounted these on a car, been in pools and a lake, zip lining, mountain biking and given the pieces some abuse and nothing has broken. Happy with the purchase and recommend. 
9528 It works good on iphone 5. But i want one for my Lenovo tablet yoga 2 13 
9529 It dosen t work well on the Lenovo tablet and I returned it. 
9530 Ok 
9531 Used about 6 months. Still works good. Only issue is plug in for Google is no longer supported. 8/2015 
9532 Plastic. Cheap. Threw it away. 
9533 Got it Fast! All the items were as noted and loving the little tripod :) what a nice set! Totally recommend you will enjoy. Thanks :) 
9534 AAA 
9535 Works just as described. 
9536 Perfect replacement for OEM Nikon caps. 
9537 Using these with the Envy strap and Uni-loops. Works great. Quick release function is valuable to me. Have been using this system for 15+years, have not had a failure, very little visible wear. 
9538 The best tripod in the price range, you ll get something like this for no less than $300 in another brand, so yeap the best tripod for the money, really solid and usable 
9539 Delivery on times, it worked on my Cannon Camcorder ! 
9540 Quite clear for a cheap fish eye. Fun to play with. With DSLR video, definitely have to watch out for and overexposure at all, any blown out bits are lost even more so with this lens. 
9541 Good item. 
9542 DUDE. This lens. I ve gotten so much use out of this little lens. Night shots? No problem. Portraits of your drunk friends? Got it. Crazy cool lighting/bokeh effects. Absolutely. Super versatile lens for a super nice price. Do it! 
9543 Very good case, wheels work well, zipper a little sticky in one spot but will work itself out I trust. Not a ton of padding or weight, perfect for stands, sliders and tripods. 
9544 Works Great 
9545 This is an excellent case. Very strong study construction. I feel secure in knowing this is protecting my expensive equipment 
9546 Everything about the description of this product is miss leading. Will not purchase from this seller again. The light does not come with AAA batteries and it is only one light. 
9547 Great quality and amazing price !! A small price to pay to protect expensive lenses! 
9548 Didn t realize this existed 
9549 Worked perfectly on my telescope for alignment and leveling. 
9550 It reflects very well. 
9551 Awesome so far... A week in, but best camera strap I ve ever own. 
9552 Essential accessory for framing pictures with a DSLR 
9553 not to shabby, i know this was stupid but if you want this to last please don t take this stick underwater especially salt water 
9554 Does not come with flash 
9555 Great for protecting electronic devices when you re in electronically hostile environments. 
9556 The camera works well enough for the price but the monitor want cut on ..so I just got it hooked to a TV .. 
9557 good stuff 
9558 Everything exceeded my expectations. My friend really loved it and she was able to shoot a wedding that weekend. Keep up the great work. Will be purchasing from again. 
9559 Glad to have them...so useful! 
9560 Arrived on time and as described. I never knew what these were for until I took a photography class. Now I have to get a better tripod so I can take photos of moving water and lightening. Now I can take more art-full pictures. 
9561 tripod will not hold the camera 
9562 Great Product, helps keep all my devices clean 
9563 Delivered on time and fits like my original plate. Feels well constructed. Haven t taken it out for any rigorous shooting yet but it s exactly what I was hoping it would be 
9564 Rotors broke after first use. Charger cable cannot be decoupled so I haven t been able to charge the copter. 
9565 does not work ? 
9566 The TTL function on one of mine doesn t work. Didn t realize till after return window was closed. 
9567 Great transaction and useful bundle - love the camera! Thanks! 
9568 Great kit for flash photo. It creates great atmospheres for your projects. 
9569 Pretty rad deal for a great starter pack. Works well and does what it s supposed to do. Recommended. :^) 
9570 These are perfect...exactly what I was looking for to clean my screens. They work great and are large enough that they don t bunch up in your hands. A couple of swipes and the screen is clean! 
9571 it is a great camera but the lens broke on it 
9572 Very Good 
9573 It s good!! 
9574 I ve used these for my glasses, laptop, phone, and tablet, and I have to say that these cloths are absolutely fantastic. They work well after washing, too! Would definitely recommend. 
9575 Works well. I was able to adhere to side panel of window and get closer to the glass, as you can remove the bulky harness from dropcam. 
9576 Works perfectly. Kept our camera secure on the dash. 
9577 Excellent adjustment range and height for table top use. Very stable and sturdy. This a the best tripod I have ever bought. 
9578 Love it! No more losing lens covers! 
9579 Great Product 
9580 So cool and very amazing camera,I love it sososo much and take many beautiful photos to my friends 
9581 Great little camera at a great price, came with factory packing and am very happy with it. 
9582 Razor sharp views. Star test best I have seen. I ditched the stock diagonal though. 
9583 Love em.. 
9584 unit arrived with loose plastic pieces inside. I had to take cover off to discover what was moving aro0und inside. 
9585 Works Great, as advertised 
9586 Just what the doctor ordered! 
9587 super good tripod. especially for the price 
9588 Battery not detected by Nikon D5300. It was also slightly thicker than OEM making it harder to install/remove from battery tray. Rapid blinking LED when trying to charge with OEM charger. 
9589 Ordered this product for my granddaughter because she loves takin pictures and its time to restock for the school year. 
9590 works great thanks 
9591 Excelente 
9592 using it with my wireless intercom. worked as expected for a great price 
9593 Love this case! 
9594 Received shipment missing the wall charger. However, the batteries came fully charged and worked well. Returned item. 
9595 May not be the cadillac of binoculars but for someone who wants great distance with very good clarity and does not want to break the bank - these are a winner. 
9596 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
9597 I bought two extra cameras to go with the GE Wireless Color Digital Home Monitoring Camera LCD Monitor Security Kit 45255. They paired up great with the reciever. Going to buy a 4th, just to see what our dogs do when were not home :) 
9598 Awesome case for the price. Used it for my knife collection. Very high quality 
9599 Garbage and really messes with your camera I can t even use it 
9600 had problems getting it to thread with my UV filter but after a few tries it fitted 
9601 awsome camcorder for the price, easy to use and much smaller than expected, great battery life and well worth buying extra batterys for longer use. if your also gonna take alot of pics with it I found its best to buy a good hd card for good clear pics. 
9602 Excellent package. Coming from a Canon to pro Nikon is proving to be challenging.Having trouble with misfires when taking photos 
9603 Takes great photos - nothing spectacular - but brought this camera with my on a trip to Venice Italy. Did the trick and if I lost it on my travels it would have been no big deal. My keepsake photos from the trip are gorgeous. 
9604 Great camera for price!!! 
9605 worked for my basic needs 
9606 I bought these to use with my backup release plates. They help to tighten the plate easier. No tools required. 
9607 Awesome!!! 
9608 Thank you! This came exactly as described, very quickly. Overall wonderful experience 
9609 Fantastic little thing. Built well and the head is more secure on it than my legs. Perfect for any tripod without a bowl or other head leveling options. 
9610 Great product. Works so much better then others I have tried. I m very surprised that I didn t have any problems.Easy quick and simple.The cloud is kool. You don t need a memory card. 
9611 I love this camera pictures are excellent I love my purchase. 
9612 Forgot this back in my hotel room so I have yet to field test. Seems to be a quality product so far. 
9613 Doubles your battery life. Easy to use and it comes with 4 back doors for new and old cameras. Comes with carrying case too! 
9614 poor picture quality not worth it. save your cash. 
9615 I can t live without this thing. Looks like Tupperware, works like magic. Love the straps at the base that keeps it from falling off. 
9616 Could never get it to work with SmartThings. 
9617 I needed a mount that can support a gopro or contour when recording video while driving and this head exceeded my expectation. I was also able to use a Sony A6000 attached to this ball head without fear of the camera coming off the mount while driving. 
9618 Works well. As noted previously, a little blurry around the edges. 
9619 Dont waste your money 
9620 They do what they are supposed to do, also very corrosion resistant. A season in the pool, and they have yet to show any shots of corrosion starting. 
9621 Nice build up .value for money.unfotunately its not combatablr with my canon eos100 
9622 worked well for NEX 6000 
9623 The lens caps fit perfectly and seem to be of good quality. I am satisfied with this purchase. 
9624 One notch too expensive (99$US), but its the only show in town that works snug and solid for the lenses used here. 
9625 Using this with a SONY A7 and things function as well. The lenses work manually fyi those who might not know. 
9626 good 
9627 More sensitive than expected. Cranky mssg. set up, once set it works. I use it in an area with less shadows from bright windows in the day - that said, because as I said, it is that sensitive. Beat it at the price, I do not think so! 
9628 Ok 
9629 Exactly what I expected and wanted. Based on others feedback of the savage swatches, I do agree the actual paper was lighter then pictures but it s close. I d say it s just not as rich. Good quality and packaged to support the large heavy roll. 
9630 good price and product. 
9631 Don t waist your money 
9632 did not work need original lamp 
9633 too small for the olympus tough TG-860 
9634 Got them in only 1 day worked good 
9635 Good camera just a bit hard to edit the file format. 
9636 works great, delivered quickly! 
9637 nothing much to say about this one, it s a lens cap that fits. 
9638 The detector installed reasonably easily and has been working very well for the last 2 months. 
9639 THIS DOES NOT WORK. Its super cheap, and it doesnt work. At all. 
9640 Exactly what I had ordered and expected. 
9641 Good! No problems. 
9642 Came quick and is fun to use 
9643 couldnt get this to work. great design but wont work. 
9644 Can t believe how much gear I can get into the bag. I think it will be a great addition to my photographic equipment. 
9645 Amazing camera! Super easy to use love it:) came in great condition 
9646 it is ok, nothing special. it looks used, was not as new 
9647 So cute & fun! We re having a blast capturing memories with this awesome camera! 
9648 work ok for my CCTV cams 
9649 This case is great to keep up with everything, since the goPro does not come with a case I usually just kept it in a plastic bag and did not have a central place to keep it. So now I store everything together and it is great to travel with. 
9650 Well-ordered this battery as a backup for my Sony point and shoot camera. But this little guy just stopped working. Has just over one year. The original battery that I have still works. Will not buy again. Waste of money. 
9651 great lens! DOF & low light gem 
9652 Great set! 
9653 Works well. I use this with the underwater housing and swim with it. Stays nice and tight. 
9654 Works well as a trainer for a better quadcopter. Its very fun to use but the camera stopped working after about 2 flights. Looks like it was supposed to take OK video but it broke after an hour of owning it. 
9655 cheapest good cable and it works great 
9656 very very good 
9657 great deal 
9658 Works great with my Nexus 7 ii and the phantom 3 pro controller. 
9659 Great product at good price 
9660 awesome 
9661 WILL NOT STAY ON-LINE. DLINK SYSTEM IS HORRIBLE. CUSTOMER SERVICE SPEAKS HARDLY ANY ENGLISH 
9662 Does what it s supposed to do. Simple as that. 
9663 PERFECT 
9664 Everything that you would expect about this waterproof box for the GoPro 3 is exactly as it should be.It s an exact match to my official Gopro case. I would order again if I need another one. 
9665 It s good 
9666 Excellent item! 
9667 Corners match size but sides are concaved and do not fit. 
9668 Not ok you can see black parts on the videos and pictures due to wide angke 
9669 Great Product 
9670 great 
9671 I ve used it for a more than a week and it is excellent! Even able to check in while on the road and speak through the camera -- using it for elderly parents as a monitor and it s fantastic. Night time vision works -- all very good. Excellent! 
9672 Great product! Very easy to set up. 
9673 Good to have a working remote again. Took a second to figure the pairing out, but it works well. 
9674 I shoot formal and concert events and this battery worked great for TWO long events (6-7 hours total) and still had power to go. I own 2 of these just in case but I couldn t believe how long this one lasted. Highly recommend!! 
9675 Be very careful I ordered this and missed the return date by 1day. This item stop working with in the fist week of use!!!! Only a 30 day return window! 
9676 Great camera. The design is improved over the dropcam. Better mount and software. 
9677 To small in length in my opinion. Looks weird when you a wearing it. It s just really small and but pops out on your back. 
9678 terrible. doesn t fit fuji battery or batteries that came with it, which were both dead. 
9679 Brand new in the Canon box. Good and solid lens hood. Great seller. 
9680 Don t buy this bag, the straps break easily and it s poorly-made. 
9681 Amazing lens, it improves the quality of my pictures and add fantastic effects on them. 
9682 Just learning how to use this camera, but so far it meets expectations. Easy to use but has a lot of settings enhance my photography. Perfect first DSLR camera, especially since older lenses from my dad s camera will fit. 
9683 This cleaning kit is really good and a great value! 
9684 Does the adapter ring come with this kit, if not this is impossible to assemble without it ref; Es-470 lite and soft box kit, I need help Very nice kit 
9685 This is a great little camera. The LCD makes it easy to see what you are doing. Only big issues are the battery life, but you can buy a battery pack and double the time. It is fine. 
9686 I like it 
9687 I think this is really solid, I used it on my vlog - you can see footage of it in use, even underwater: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jl-lKaFfe4I 
9688 Great camera --- transferring pictures from camera to cellphone or computer is a snap 
9689 Very Good Product 
9690 It is well constructed.. If you carry a camera and one lens or flash, it would work great. I normally carry two lenses and a flash. The bag is to small for that. 
9691 Selfie stick does not fit properly 
9692 Reliable 
9693 Makes handling longer lenses much easier to handle and when using the video function I can improve how steady I hold the camera. 
9694 the best product 
9695 Really pleased with it 
9696 a pretty good case. I love it. 
9697 If the camera lens on your phone isn t in the middle of the phone it doesn t line up. Even if it did work well it isn t worth the price. 
9698 Didn t work as advertised, there was no sound and it wouldn t record. Returned for refund. 
9699 Very pleased with this product. Up until I got this for my Canon 3ti, I was extremely disappointed in my indoor pictures with this camera. WOW! what a difference this flash attachment has made. Just wished I would have found it a year ago! 
9700 Great buy! Hope it holds up 
9701 good pics, but didn t realize unitl I received it that it required AA batteries. As result, it doesn t last long with constant use. 
9702 A very good middle gray for photography. Great product and got here on time. 
9703 this unit works just great, better than the original one I had 
9704 Great straps. These distribute the load much better than the straps that come with most cameras and the padding and stretch helps a lot too. Easy to snap on and off as well for tripod work. 
9705 It s not universal if the platform is too small to fit even the smallest DSLR. 
9706 Not much to say, it works great protecting my new lens and it s a great price. 
9707 Great little camera, the only thing I do not like is it sends an alert every time there is moment in the room, however by the time I receive the alert, there is nothing in the room anymore. Trying to get this fixed. 
9708 does the job. exactly what I expected it to do. 
9709 No útil 
9710 Unfortunately overpriced.... but I purchased one and fixed up my Phantom 2 Vision + good as new. 
9711 When you have an older camera and you lose cords or other pieces, it can be frustrating to find a replacement. In this instance, it was no problem and this Battery charger is the perfect replacement. 
9712 I love them they are very nice 
9713 bought it and the problem moved away 
9714 Great camera bag pack for a small trips 
9715 Used for our cruise and it was perfect! If you have any doubt cast it aside. 
9716 Just what I wanted 
9717 Excellent body or vehicle cam for the price. Remote and all the mounting accessories complete the package deal. 
9718 Slim profile. 60mm+ length is ideal for vertical orientation support. Well machined surface and contours. Construction seems robust enough. A great value when compared to similar QR plates costing 2 to 3x more. 
9719 This camera goes through batteries way too fast. It is difficult to change the settings and switch from photo to video, but very easy to accidentally delete your photos. 
9720 No memory card in packaging 
9721 This lens hood does not fit well on Canon EFS 18-55 mm 3.5 -5.6 lens. Buyer beware. 
9722 Extremely tight fit. Had to force it on the flash unit. It works otherwise. 
9723 I absolutely LOVE this camera and the company shipped extremely fast. 
9724 I reserved the the battery pack and itself works fine but I reserved the baking for a go pro hero 3+ and it does not fit onto my gopro hero3 white housing. 
9725 Good Design. Once balanced overall feels good. Very solid construction. Most definitely feels like a durable product. Price is more than fair 
9726 Works Fine 
9727 Bought a used Nikon Coolpix S3600 to replace a broken point-and-shoot. Picture quality and features are excellent for a point-and-shoot. The only negative I ve found so far is that battery life is average compared to other battery packs for other cameras that I own. 
9728 Catch broke off first time I opened it do leg would not extend. It also did not mount camera on the level. Not fit for purpose 
9729 Solid construction. Very sturdy and included an extention section to extend it s reach. Works great to hold my camera equipment while working and tinkering with remote cameras and FPV equipment. 
9730 Big bag - holds all my gear with room left over. Seems sturdy enough! 
9731 Great thin pen, writes wonderful no skipping and the autopoint touch screen end worked on my broken phone screen when my fingers would not do it. I would buy this and give as christmas gifts, graduation gifts or any gift. Highly recommend! © 2015 Jackie Paulson 
9732 I really liked the camara 
9733 Works great 
9734 Nice looking however the batteries we are going through is ridiculous! We have bought rechargeable now yet we are recharging every two days? 
9735 Good 
9736 Great! 
9737 Works fine The battery that came with camera didn t last very long at all. but now I can charge and has a long life. 
9738 I like the slik quick release plate system. It is a very solid mount on the tripod even with heavy long lenses and spotting scopes 
9739 This is such a great tiny adapter...that works amazingly....Love it and would recommend! It is tiny but it works!!!! 
9740 Broke the side door within 3min of opening the package. 
9741 Excellent 
9742 exelente producto gracias 
9743 Perfect, as I expected 
9744 These adapters fit the Sony a3000 and the kit lens perfectly. These even have the Sony logo on them, they look exactly like OEM ones I also have. 
9745 Was delivered in time it work fine satisfied 
9746 Excellent camera for the price takes great pictures! 
9747 I did not buy this 
9748 I like the camera but didn t came if a book to show me how run the camera plus itthought it came with a card. 
9749 This is a very lousy product for the price. The image during the day is to overexposed when recording and the unit itself lasted about a week and a half before it died. For 140 dollars you can get yourself a way better camera than this marked up Chinese junk. 
9750 excelente 
9751 A very sturdy, lightweight tripod that works best with smaller cameras, and easy to operate. 
9752 Excellent. Works well with all my sunglasses. 
9753 Too Loud. No Volume Control. Otherwise, works as expected. The lack of volume control makes these useless to me though. 
9754 Didn t work -_- 
9755 Very strong magnet...stays put and gets the job done... 
9756 I love it!!! It fits well with my fujifilm camera and it s adorable. I would totally recommend it. 😍 
9757 Perfect fit. 
9758 Works great 
9759 Nice bag 
9760 Does the job exactly as advertised 
9761 Good lenses and a great company. I look forward to my next purchase. 
9762 Excellent merchant. Items ordered came exactly as listed. ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! 
9763 classy and small enough to carry in purse, lap top carrier 
9764 Works Great 
9765 Fantastic camera. Good quality and comes with a lot more things in the box than my fathers go pro did. Battery life is good and the camera is easy to use. Especially with the remote. I will never buy another helmet cam without a remote like this one. 10/10 
9766 it broke the first time I wanted to use it, bad quality. 
9767 Worked exactly how it s supposed to. 
9768 Good cameras that are VERY easy to install and operate. Great price too. 
9769 These products were reliable and affordable. I recommend buying it. 
9770 this is a fraud, doesn´t work, dont wast money buying this crap 
9771 This reflector/diffuser is perfect. Frame is sturdy and easy to assemble and disassemble. This is quickly becoming my go to lighting tool. 
9772 My go to lens. 
9773 Replaced the battery in a small cordless screwdriver, and good as new! 
9774 affordable and does the trick 
9775 Stopped working after a couple of months 
9776 Delivery was really fast and the lens seems to work great, but it was not clean and that is the only drawback. 4 out of 5 stars! Thanks! 
9777 Much better than the ones I purchased from someone else before. It is also better than the original Panasonic battery 
9778 Nice knock-off and good price - can t wait to take it underwater in Cozumel in October. 
9779 It fit my lens perfectly!!! 
9780 Nest Cam protects my private space/life to a certain extent. Those who prey into other people s life/business are less likely to act ruthless when they know they can be caught in camera. 
9781 As advertised. 
9782 I love it !! its excellent quality and versatil. 
9783 These won t keep a decent charge, won t power anything that has a motor or flash. only good for remotes... very disappointed with them. 
9784 Picture quality not so good unable to view objects when digital zoom, picture real grainy at Nite 
9785 [[VIDEOID:faa7d83e1f0a9dd702f4f483ad2daa85]] Grip works great for me. Not too heavy but does t feel puny like a selfie stick. Probably best for GoPro sized cameras. I tries to put the Panasonic GH4 on it and it was too big. Quick release works great- no issues with mine. 
9786 My GoPro didn t sink. Count it! 
9787 Mom loves her 
9788 Nice and simple to installed 
9789 Convenient way to clean your keyboard. Seems to be pretty effective, at least compared to compressed air. I haven t compared them directly, so I can t say for certain, but this seems to get the job done. 
9790 Works perfect just as described! 
9791 The program sent with this scanner does not work very well. I have to keep opening and closing it to get it to copy the pictures into my computer. 
9792 good product. design needs improvement already broke one trying to unattached it. 
9793 It s good enough to give the original battery time to fully charge. 
9794 It doesn t zoom in as much or clear enough. 
9795 works great, highly recommend! 
9796 the package was good it was all amazing 
9797 it did the job as decribed 
9798 Great product, highly recommended , simple set up and excellent viewing video. True WIFI operation. 
9799 Looks like a nice product but the (3-D) part is a stretch. Just a raised bump around the edge from die cutting it. I needed something thicker 
9800 Zipper pull was off when it arrived and it is VERY small. I should have gotten the medium size. But this is good for taking a limited amount of accessories. 
9801 This was a gift for two young girls, age 6 and 9. The nine year old turned 10 recently and they used this booth and disguises to have for a sleepover and party; I ve been told it was a blast! 
9802 Purchased for a friend s D3200, He loves it 
9803 Henry at FosCam support was very patient as we worked thru some setup issues. The camera image looks great and I am very happy with the purchase.Thanks again Henry. 
9804 The items are great. Unfortunately, I ordered the wrong part number DNS the battery does not fit. I m not sure how to request an exchange. 
9805 I have bought several of these wireless IP cams. The Loftek and the Astak. This is by far the best one. Great picture quality, easy set up, DDNS built in so you can view from outside your network. Will by more. 
9806 my all time favorite camera. I think it is a little better than the mini *. But it works great! 
9807 Amazing package! You ll get everything you need!!!!! 
9808 Serves the purpose well. UV cleans relatively easily. CP without distortion but not particularly smooth and a bit touchy to screw on. Haven t used the ND yet. Overall very good for the price. 
9809 Very poor Quality 
9810 It s great for the price but I ordered black and got a white backdrop. I don t even have time to exchange it so thanks, I guess I need to find another option quick. At least I have a white back drop for future use. 
9811 I ve used this item once so far and it seems to be just what I was looking for. Thank you. 
9812 Battery never worked so haven t been able to test it. 
9813 Great assortment of accessories for Go Pro at a good price. Way cheaper than buying separately. 
9814 Looks good, sturdy material and will work well. Looking forward to using it 
9815 Excellent product !!! Does the job perfectly, Big enough to picture almost everything, even an open carriage THANKS!! 
9816 It s a screw for God s sake, it works as described and expected. 
9817 A wonderful product! I love being able to capture portraits of strangers for a project I work on and give them a print as a thank you in return. This stuff is great. 
9818 These are awesome. They slide a little rough and occasionally get stuck, but if you have patience, they are well worth the money. If you re just doing a bit of macro shots, don t buy the expensive stuff. These work just fine! 
9819 So far so good 
9820 Very quick delivery and easy to set up. 
9821 wrist strap came off 
9822 Great product 
9823 We re so pleased with our purchase. Perfect camera bag for our camera, the stands are easy to use and sturdy. Everything in our starter kit is just what we needed.. Thank you again Amazon!!! 
9824 The kit is good , but the selfie stick broke the first time it was used. i hope the rest of the pieces last longer than it did. 
9825 This camera does a great job. After initial setup, I had to change routers and their customer service walked me through the setup revisions. 
9826 Very, very good picture--but a bit slow 
9827 Fast shipping and this is an overall excellent camera. 
9828 This seller sent me a bunch of useless filters but not the lens cap as advertised. Wont recommend it. 
9829 Worked better than I thought and it kept my camera from going to the bottom of my pool. 
9830 bit small...but works 
9831 excellent value 
9832 Cleans me screens and glasses. Can t ask for anything else. 
9833 Worked Great. Amazon was the only place I could find a replacement cable. 
9834 Very convenience, but the sound is terrible 
9835 Solid! A few people complained about set up etc but I think this ting is just phenomenal! I am SUPER happy with the purchase to the point that I keep it in my trunk along with my lights at all times! No extra weight or stand bags needed! 
9836 Exactly as described and good delivery time. 
9837 I had a similar experience. Although I purchased this camera a few years ago, as a birthday gift for my son, we barely used it 3-5 times. The &#34;on&#34; button does not work, and the &#34;play&#34; button remains lit, but nothing plays as the screen is black. Totally disappointed. 
9838 Easy to set up and install. Works perfectly for our monitoring purposes. Highly recommend this product. 
9839 The best camera and value package on the market. 
9840 I tried several different types of straps and the head strap seems to work the best. The only downside is that when I take it off, I end up with unsightly &#34;GoPro&#34; hair. 
9841 My daughter loved 
9842 Came fast and worked great! 
9843 Really like this kit, but I would prefer for the flat pen to be squared or in triangle shaped as it would do a better job when cleaning both the viewfinder and the LCD screen. Other than that, perfect. 
9844 A terrific camera. While physicallly small and easy to use, it is packed full of state of the art features. Extremely pleased with it. 
9845 I don t know how I m suppose to rate something if I haven t took it out it s box yet.this why I gave 3 stars 
9846 I am very happy with the build quality of this little tripod. Tough, stable. A real tripod in miniature. Fun colors and multiple uses. 
9847 Can you tell me how to activate the function &#34;Image size&#34;? This function is currently disabled. Thank you 
9848 Great kit for the price!!! Everything fits, nothing was broken, and it arrived quickly!!! 
9849 What a great packaged deal! Fast shipping. Have not any problems at all. Phantom is a jewel to fly. Pics and video are superb!! Buy with confidence 
9850 Excellent underwater all purpose point and shoot. Camera is easy to operate and takes great pictures. 
9851 It is a nice piece of equipment for a reasonable cost! I m a photographer looking to make a transition to video / short films for myself and my clients. Excellent customer service, too! :) 
9852 Worked great for GPS units. 
9853 Seems to provide the protection I was seeking. 
9854 very good I love it. 
9855 They simply don´t work. I want a refound. I already tried to do EVERYTHING to make them work, i tried in different areas with different internet conexion. The light always stay yellow and never changes to blue. 
9856 They are huge-- listed as compact binoculars, they are anything but compact. 
9857 Awesome bundle package. Camera is great and has many useful settings. Easy to use right out of the box. Comes with a wide variety of accessories that are all very useful. 
9858 fits the bill nicely 
9859 I love this GoPro, and I use it all the time, especially when on vacation down the shore. 
9860 Nice 
9861 Does the job, creates some great photos. Only reason its not a 5 is because I have a b and w 
9862 Good Product Works as expected 
9863 Great lens! It rained the day I bought it, so wanted to try out some rain droplet macro shots. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do! 
9864 great product 
9865 Ok seems a bit flimsy..but ok for the cost...good number of pockets... 
9866 Did not work at all. Gave a two star because the return process was easy. The price seemed to good to be true and it was. 
9867 I m very disappointed with this strap. It s super cute in the picture and looks long. I got it in the mail and extended it and the tiny black string is so small and is longer then the actual strap. 
9868 Didn t work. Don t buy it. 
9869 Work great 
9870 The camera lens is great. I take a lot of large group photos and this lens is super wide. Picture quality is also excellent. 
9871 The product IS GOOD, well made, but it does NOT FIT Manfrotto 501PL Quick Release Plates, unfortunately. I ll try the longer version with less threads on the tip,maybe they work. 
9872 Not well made and it take long time to charge. 
9873 Don t buy unless you don t mind your SD cards falling out of the slots with the slightest jarring. This won t protect your cards as they get bounced around inside the case. 
9874 A little smaller than useful. 
9875 Very good for multiple attachments and rigs. Screw slightly loosens easily no matter how tight you make it. 
9876 Cheap quality 
9877 Very nice 
9878 works for me 
9879 Great buy ... Works great 
9880 I love the Binocular, but what is up with the stupid rain guard on these things? Come on Nikon, it cant cost you that much to include a rain guard that fits. Bought a vortex rain guard and it fits nicely. Everything else is gravy 
9881 Inexpensive and the quality shows. I would not recommend this to a friend. 
9882 very bad. I did not use it. the power is gone after a week. 
9883 Great camera! Replaced an older Nikon model that could not handle newer power hungry lenses. 
9884 Just want a listing of whats inside and how to use each item 
9885 very nice dvr 
9886 Everything came as it is shown. I have not had any problems. I would recommend buying a separate selfie stick, but it works for the price. 
9887 very nice! 
9888 Wonderful flash. I dropped it (on accident of course) And it s still alive, lol. The output is fabulous and definitely saved the outdoor wedding that got moved indoors due to a t-storm. 
9889 Using in Costa Rica now! Great solution to running out of power in the middle of fun. 
9890 I bought this little camera for my Grandson and he loves it! It s simple and shoots pretty OK video. 
9891 Geat so far. I m glad I bought it. 
9892 Seems to be a comprehensive plan at a good price. 
9893 Great i recieve my package own time 
9894 the lenses doesn t fit, and im so disappointed because thats the only thing in the bandle that im so excited about, it say s for instax mini 8, but its small!!! 
9895 sometimes glitches and shows door open when closed, have to open and shut to reset. 
9896 Both caps look and feel very durable. Great price for generic replacements, and both fit snugly. 
9897 great for the price! 
9898 This is a good point and shoot camera for basic needs. There aren t a lot of controls on it, but it does take rather nice pictures. Recommended for simple photography situations that don t call for the need to adjust every last setting. 
9899 Works good with my Nikon camera! 
9900 Not bad for the price, so far works ok 
9901 Never worried about my camera floating to the bottom of the ocean. 
9902 good product 
9903 Perfect!!! 
9904 Great value! It exceeded my expectations. 
9905 Exactly what was needed. My son took the camera on vacation; I ordered the adapter and had it sent to their location. They arrived Sunday and it was delivered Monday. Excellent 
9906 Great easy to attach to the go pro and it latches it very tight 
9907 love it 
9908 Long battery life, used one battery continuously for 2 hours and 45 min. 
9909 Excellent case! Holds all my FPV racing accessories. And the hard shell keeps everything inside secure 
9910 Bought thid for our teenage daughter in addition to the camcorder. She absolutely loves this as it adds a rotating viewfinder to the existing camcorder. Construction is sturdy and installation is super easy! 
9911 worked & fit great on our Pentax. 
9912 More than happy. 
9913 Thanks for the fast shipping and they are so real looking. The only thing is they don t blink red except when I first put them up. I put new batteries in each one also. 
9914 great case also 
9915 I use the binoculars for birding nearly every week and daily during migration time. The binoculars have great optics are durable and comparable to others that are 10X more expensive. 
9916 excellent product. 
9917 Love this dash cam! The only thing I didn t like was the set up, but like any dash can setup it is a bit of a hassle. Besides that, it records crystal clear video with useful features that other brands doesn t have. 
9918 Great product! Very sturdy and does just what it says 
9919 [[VIDEOID:de691885db9775e4f408d9229f84434]]Great tripod product for light and heavy cameras. Working with the company is a delight. A problem arose and they immediately addressed it and sent a replacement. Not only is the product top shelf but the customer service is outstanding. 
9920 Works like a champ and it quite a bit cheaper on the wallet. 
9921 Need to be an expert to use it. Still working on it. Positive. Gives unexpected result. 
9922 Do NOT ever purchase non-Nikon batteries, I did. I will always buy real Nikon. 
9923 Sister in law loved these for her new camera 
9924 Worked well for the first couple uses and then the calibration got messed up. I suggest getting a small wagon for moving it around, as it is a bit too heavy for my back. 
9925 One of the lights will not turn on, I was also missing the camera stand from my delivery. The quality of the product is on point, besides these few hasseles I would buy the product again. 
9926 I purchased this T-ring adapter for use with my Nikon D7000. It is a perfect fit and works very smoothly. Great value too. 
9927 The camera overall produced excellent pictures and excellent video quality. I don t recommend people with really shaky hands to handle this camera though- Other than that- The price matches the value and I m happy overall with my purchase. 
9928 Great for powering field monitor. 
9929 Everything that I needed to run my camera with efficiency. 
9930 Recommended 100 % excellent product 
9931 Absolutely a great value. Takes really good pictures and has great slow motion video that we use for analyzing baseball swings. 
9932 These are fantastic. Does the job. Very clear not blurry. Very Very satisfied.....Well built. 
9933 nice gift 
9934 We actually replaced the first one because it wouldn t update and when we received the second one it wouldn t update either!! 
9935 Easy to use, arrived sooner than promised, looks great 
9936 didnt fit my canon EOS 5D. Sent back for a refund 
9937 Great quality product and even better service, will help support this business for future needs. 
9938 Worked as expected. 
9939 Received item quickly and love it! 
9940 Looked good but I didn t like how the gopro mounted to the pole- I would prefer it to screw in 
9941 Excellent product. I love it. 
9942 Exactly what I needed. I lost the original, these are great 
9943 Arrived quickly! So far it seems to work....just got it today we ll see in about a week or so if it really works 
9944 Just as described 
9945 For all the stuff this comes with this is definitely worth it. The case is a good size I have the L830 and I can fit more than just the camera :) 
9946 Great. 
9947 Great 
9948 excellent product. 
9949 My bolts from my GoPro were easily moved and loose so I got these and they actually give me a better quality video since its not easily getting bumped out of location 
9950 Charges the batteries quickly and fully, and the design means it takes up a minimum of space. Came on time. 
9951 Great & saved me soooooo much money!!!! I can buy almost 4 of these for the price of one of my Nikon flashes 
9952 Loved it 
9953 god 
9954 Worked as expected. No issues. 
9955 Works well. 
9956 I like this camera. 
9957 Always have trouble with it falling off when I m under water 
9958 Henry Was a great help installing my new Foscam camera. very knowledgeable about the system and fast. Totally satisfied. 
9959 Too bad it s not a constant aperture! 
9960 Wife set up without cable, and very fast connection to wifi network. live video is very smooth. will recommend to friend who wants to buy cameras. 
9961 Works great. Use this if you don t need the waterproof housing. Speakers aren t covered either. 
9962 Bought these with the Nikon Coolpix waterproof camera. Tried strap out in pool first and it works great. Definitely get these with the waterproof camera. 
9963 these have never failed me in the field, unlike some named brand models that cost a lot more 
9964 Its was great. Super awesome! 
9965 Great for my cine lens 
9966 The controls are pretty slow, and I can t get any videos to work, not even .mp4. It s supposed to play .mpeg4, which I think is the same? But since it wasn t super expensive, not bad. 
9967 Great pictures and great price. 
9968 Great product, exactly as we expected! 
9969 Well constructed, strong elastic, good fit- I m delighted with my new bino harness. I wouldn t hesitate to recommend this make. 
9970 Good value for a versatile mid-range zoom, complements the Nikkor 18-55mm found in many bundles. Autofocus can be a little slow, but it s fast enough for my general usage. 
9971 A bit of work to take apart the devices to program, but once done works very well. 
9972 we watched our home movies we hadn t seen in years. very impressed and very happy!!! 
9973 Do not buy. 
9974 Some of the things are a little hard to tighten down and will need to get an allen wrench to get it tight. The follow focus is also REALLY bad and doesn t work at all. Overall, it s really heavy but is pretty good. 
9975 Not good at all 
9976 The color of the camera was a bit darker then the picture but I love it! Still trying to figure out which settings work best in the lighting. Love having pictures instantly! 
9977 This is one of the worst tripods ever it cant even hold my cameras weight and it contains really cheap materials do not recommend anyone to buy this unless you are in really desperate needs 
9978 junk customer service not patient on the phone for almost a hour after getting it up and going soon I hang up it stop working sent it back could not get it to work I m not even giving it one star sucks 
9979 Superfast shipping, great! 
9980 Great item!!! 
9981 I can fit three of these stands in a normal-sized suitcases and still have room for clothes. They are very light and fairly durable. 
9982 Great for dental Lester Dine sells this camera for twice as much With a few accessories and &#34;support&#34; It s a rip off from them At $280 it s a bargain!!! I use it for dental photography 
9983 excellent product, excellent seller 
9984 Great gun mount... Now I can remember what I shoot. Simple but works really well, easy on and off ...but does not move during recoil. Fits on my shotgun and my Rifle. Has not moved, slide, or turned. Absolutely love it. Highly recommend. 
9985 These batteries are not worth the price. After shooting about 24 pictures they are dead. I bought these to have extra batteries on an Alaskan cruise. Little did I know I would have been better off not purchasing these. Don t waste your money. 
9986 good 
9987 Securely holds the camera and it won t slide off your head, but it hurts your forehead after awhile of wearing it. 
9988 I purchased the DMC-ZS40S Digital Camera from America Cameras through Amazon.com and was totally pleased with the quick delivery! The camera looks great and I m looking forward to using it. 
9989 Almost everything about this is pretty great; the neck stays put, the clamp is super strong and adjustable... but none of that matters since the brittle plastic clip snapped into 3 pieces on the second use. avoid! 
9990 Works very well and arrived quicker than expected 
9991 Ship faster that expected I would definitely recommended 
9992 not at all worth it. do not buy useless product. display quality is very poor 
9993 Light is great but they did not ship everything that comes with the light. Missing a vital piece. 
9994 Great quality case, perfect for boating, kayaking, and snowmobiling. I use it to keep my phone, wallet, and keys safe and dry. I have tested by swimming down 10ft with the case empty, not a drop inside. 
9995 This camera is great! I have not used it much but it has served me well for what I needed and still works. have had it in the water and all good! 
9996 Great pictures my daughter loves it 💯!!!!! 
9997 So fantastic! I bought this for a wedding, which was full sun and also indoors. It balanced the light wonderfully! Came in small package so it was easy to take in my camera backpack. Would definitely recommend 
9998 OEM Smart battery works great and fast shipping. 
9999 The included mounting accessories do not fit the GoPro Hero 4 housing. 
10000 Holds extras with my camera and it looks really nice 
10001 This kit is awesome! It s such a great deal and I love everything it came with!! The selfie mirrored lens is awesome!! The case is great quality! 
10002 The films were received some films packages were not working. 
10003 Just like the original 
10004 works 
10005 Not work 
10006 I have mixed feelings about this product. Although easy to assemble, the bars are so lightweight that on my first use, it bended, almost loosing its shape. I don t recommended for outdoor use. 
10007 Good but too small for a regular size hand and is also not high enough from the camera when mounted on. 
10008 Excelente 
10009 Very good product! No comments. 
10010 Great product, and customer service. Thanks to Henry! Very easy to use 
10011 this product does not work for the canon g12 camera 
10012 Nice 
10013 Very satisfied. 
10014 Product works but batteries are have an awkward fit and seem like they have poor quality. 
10015 exactly as expected. Wish the body was a little nicer as I would like to do some star shooting but a great first DSLR with lots of accessories. 
10016 it s nice off a 3 days ! after oleo phobic Coating start disappear - and all screen cover by smudges ! it s not first time - it s always happens :( 
10017 Works perfectly. As expected. This is a must have if you are in need of a quick release for a camera and a Promaster tripod. 
10018 Very disappointed with these filters. The threads do not seem to line up properly and they are difficult to get on and off. In fact, the uv filter actually fell off my camera as I was taking a picture over a cliff in Portugal! 
10019 This flash is the bOmb, Works insanely well without ever missing a beat from my receivers or off camera, slave or on camera works perfect everytime.. 
10020 The cameras were not uniform, some were hard to wind and didn t indicate 0 pictures left. I was not happy with the quality of pictures. 
10021 Cheap and works like a charm!!!! 
10022 It was delivered rapidly, and I m able to use it with ease. It is lightweight, and that s a plus for me. 
10023 Excellence product I would recommend it to all of my family and friends 
10024 Well equip will put to use 
10025 Use this on my Nikon D3200. Very happy with this flash. Good value. 
10026 A+ 
10027 Most of these have had good reviews. I returned mine, it would not power on. I would have replaced it, but I found a less expensive one. (I am paying for that now) 
10028 Excellent very responsible recommend 
10029 Looks fake and has to be eye leaves to work- we have it tilted up on a shelf but then it looks even faker. Very unhappy, especially for the price!! 
10030 it worked fine 
10031 I bought this set to take my GoPro to a rafting trip in Colorado River at Grand Canyon 
10032 I wasn t disappointed at all. I used the head strap and it worked beautifully. It was sturdy during all the crazy rapids. Highly recommended. 
10033 At the price range, it is a very good deal. 
10034 Workable for the price. Never be a rock but a decent stone. Any less than a hundred bucks! 
10035 No comment. 
10036 Works fantastic! 
10037 Used this on a photo tour works very well to keep your free 
10038 Fits great over the UV filter that comes with the Phantom, much easier to put on than the gimbal lock provided by DJI. Note: if you are using PolarPro filters, this cap will not fit. 
10039 Great service and timely delivery. Tape color matches photo. The tape is not as effective in sticking and holding down cabeles as other gaffers type tape I have used in the past, across differnt products and brands. It does not leave any sticky residue, just as they promised. 
10040 It will be great if it can also hold the phone in a vertical way 
10041 Great camera, the only problem is you can t see the recorded videos on it without an external device. The strap is garbage it doesn t stay on arm or hand. 
10042 love it 
10043 Wish I could get a refund. Used in 5 times And still couldn t get it to work right 
10044 Good and solid 
10045 Works perfectly and the price is right. An essential part of an inexpensive door key card access system. 
10046 Stuff didn t come on time and tripod doesn t work with camera 
10047 Used it a couple times. Sometimes it takes a few clicks to get it to work even if just connected a few moments earlier. Overall though its nice for group and night sky shots when I can t/shouldn t mangling hit the button. 
10048 Very nice lens as expected 
10049 I keep my Nikon D600 on it with an extra 80-200mm lens, battery charging in the camera space! If you have more than that you need the bigger size! I will be ordering a bigger one for the times I take everything, but this is a great day pack! 
10050 pricey but still ok 
10051 Great for travel, fits all of my current gear. Fits all of my lens, camera body and speedlights and other gear. 
10052 great shipping and product... works great 
10053 the round silicon cover for the naked gopro lens leaves a smudge on the lens that must be wiped off before use after storage. 
10054 batteries no good. cheap. won t charged. 
10055 Pushes out 8.4 volts... that s all I need. The OEM one is just the same? My concern is the plug end snapping or shorting, however, it is a standard issue plug...MQ172-3SA-CV(50) ... if it breaks. I hope the converter will hold up? 
10056 Not a bad setup for the price cameras are pretty good but seem to get a little blurry at a distance of 40 feet but overall system is good for the price 
10057 It works great, and I did not have to wait! It even came with a car charger. 
10058 OK 
10059 Good quality 
10060 Rear view mirror is dark. Can use a clearer mirror. Needs a better rewind feature to see previous recording. 
10061 Great off camera flash cord. It takes a little effort to install at the flash and camera ends so thst they are pushed all the way into position and locked 
10062 It s okay. Not very sturdy. 
10063 Took this camera on a recent trip to the UK and it was fantastic. I would highly recommend it. It is light, fast, and takes wonderful pictures. It also holds a charge for quite a while. 
10064 Loved it 
10065 I put one of these on my Polar on Saturday. I was already lifting and peeling at the corners a couple of days later. Good thing it came with 6 of them. 
10066 Very simple to install and operate, cameras are not very clear at night time. 
10067 Well built, everything I needed at a great price. 
10068 Great item for my GoPro. Give me infinite axes for moving my camera in any direction. Seems to be of good quality. I m pleased with it. 
10069 Very professional looking and sturdy. Easy to fold and place in carrier bag. 
10070 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q5P26ImmSzI 
10071 Gopro did not work. Headband is of no use to me 
10072 It s to confusing to use and it even says it s a video recording device. A waste of 100 dollars. 
10073 It works as expected. Cheap and good value 
10074 Perfect for the office. I especially like the calendar, no more paper calendar pinned on my cubicle wall 
10075 freaking love it..... 
10076 Used this to replace an old VISTA15P that came with the house. Came with instructions and latest firmware. 
10077 I bought a package of items offered through Amazon. The package was to include a scope, mount and TWO flip back lens covers. I only recieved one lense cover not two. 
10078 System worked better than my original - nice refinements in the user interface - the new, Zsight app is great - cameras better clarity, resolution than those of my original, Zmodo system 
10079 is exactly what it said it was. Just the perfect size for attaching to my hiking pack shoulder strap. 
10080 like original. works perfectly. 
10081 Good Seller. Fast Delivery. I am very unsatisfied with the camera. Since first day the external color in one side (on the pool). I managed to keep it safe but ... 
10082 Better the OEM. Better price, love these batteries. 
10083 Very good set to get started with some studio photography. Items came as described and everything assembled and worked well. I like the carrying case for the bulbs and the umbrellas. It would be nice to have something similar for the stands. 
10084 Great product especially for the price! Super light-weight and easy to use. Good quality for the price. 
10085 Alright quality but very very cute 
10086 Everything was as advertised. Great camera, great experience. 
10087 Very nice lens with plenty of zoom. Auto focus work very well. 
10088 Just what I needed. Thanks 
10089 Tripod is very sturdy. All the benefits of a more expensive tripod without the big price tag. Thanks for making an affordable tripod for the small self-starters out here! 
10090 The batteries were very good, hold charge long time. The amperage is better than on the original JVC, but can t confirm this with tests. Overall, good product! 
10091 A great little camera, but the menus can be very difficult. Once mastered, and set the way you want it, the camera is excellent. 
10092 Looking at old slides to have printed to pictures. 
10093 I purchased the film for my babyshower 
10094 Buying the film was a great idea I placed the camera and let my guest take pictures 
10095 I have some many pictures and didn t even have to take them myself 
10096 Not right one. I ordered EN-EL19 
10097 I bought this as a companion gift to go with the camera. It is a really cute set, nicely packaged, and I am sure the 11 year old will love it. 
10098 Purchased for my son - he absolutely loves it. Shipping was super fast and item was exactly as described. Thank you! 
10099 thank you 
10100 Awesome Product! Will buy from them again in the future! 
10101 I love this flash. Super well made. 
10102 Great camera. Excellent picture quality. Battery life not great but not as bad with the right settings. 
10103 Henry was extremely helpful when I had difficulty connecting to my camera wirelessly. Works beautifully now! 
10104 Hard to put on 
10105 awesome 
10106 This is by far the best selfie/tripod stick ever. I have a friend who uses the go pro stick and he is jealous of my CamKix. I would definitely recommend this to any one with a go pro. 
10107 Everything seems OK quality, but received a non-functioning 52mm adapter. Seems to be a 55mm adapter that came with it... How did that happen? 
10108 Was a gift. 
10109 Very nice size and there is room for the extra battery...for my canon sureshot 
10110 They seem to run down fast, but there s 10 of them! 
10111 dead useful 
10112 We love our lens! It takes great actions shots during soccer games and great for scenery too! Thank you 
10113 A little bulky but does the job great, doesn t feel like it s going to come undone at all! 
10114 doesn t fit the lens. I l have to return it 
10115 Arrived fast. Seems better than OEM charger. Battery seems good, too, but it is early. 
10116 a must need if u are doing slingshot style 
10117 Worthless. The 1st-time ring is not loud enough, and then from the 2nd-time on, it just makes a quite clicking sound that is hardly hearable as if it had not power- but it was directly connected to a power source. Wasted my money. 
10118 works perfectly. for the price very good 
10119 Works great, but the picture may be misleading. It only comes with the 18&#34;, and not the set of 5 which is on the photo. 
10120 small and convenient! light weight and keep your GoPro secure in place. Highly recommended if you only have one GoPro and not a lot of accessories. 
10121 I will always buy Wasabi batteries. Very happy! 
10122 Does what it should, notify me if someone enters house while we are asleep. Would be nice if the arm/disarm was quieter, but can t expect that for the price. Covers a wide area and triggers over 30 away (max distance across room, could trigger further but could not test). 
10123 Being waterproof is the best thing ever. I’ve taken this on the river and dunked it intentionally and accidentally and it’s been marvelously dependable. Love the photo time lapse as well! 
10124 Nah... Even as a toy this is too expensive for what it is. For one thing it only works at the highest zoom level because at the lower levels you would start seeing black corners creeping into the picture. At either zoom level the distortion is too noticeable. 
10125 Thank you, it is perfect!! 
10126 Product was as advertised. 
10127 best product 
10128 Good size for my cameras, great design, very practical, well built. 
10129 excellent product. it was what I was expecting. 
10130 Very nice tripod for the $. 
10131 AC Adapter died after 1 year 
10132 This came in 2 days. Thought I would let people know how to unlock the locking mechanism as some people are unhappy with the product because they don t understand it. To unlock the plunger push down on the metal disc beneath the plunger. This works great. 
10133 Works great with my lenses as stated by others when fully expanded and shorter lenses zoomed out it will show up in your shot just collapse to second or 3rd depth and should be fine. 
10134 The foscam app will not connect to any of my devices. have lost 90% of the use for this camera 
10135 it works very good. 
10136 You get what you pay for! 
10137 Good Quality and very sturdy. Disregard any negative reviews, they did the job just fine for holing my green screen to the backdrop support system. 
10138 Sits by the back door of our cottage. Great for keeping an eye on the dogs, 
10139 Should be able to trigger video recording 
10140 Takes WONDERFUL photos, and the video is great as well. Get a few extra SD cards, make sure they are Class 10. Incredible ZOOM and super sharp images. I could not have asked for a better camera - video recorder. And you can take stills while it is recording video. 
10141 Worked well for me to recharge my camera battery while I was in Vietnam in june. 
10142 So very simple to setup and use...well done! We ll be using this under Windows, MAC and Linux but so far I tested it under Ubuntu 14.04 and it was refreshingly simple! 
10143 great product thank you 
10144 These screw adapters are as advertised. They re well made and fit flush in the machined photography bracket I m using. 
10145 Love this lens. Not as fast as some, but it s priced accordingly. Decent build quality and works great for video with the stem motor. 
10146 Using for external battery/charger for iPad/phone.. Just fits. 
10147 I Love all the X-cel series of eyepieces. I purchased all of them! 
10148 Awesome camera. I would give it 6 stars if I was able to zoom in, but nonetheless with 1080 p and 60fps, this is a good camera for all sports activities. 
10149 DO NOT BUY!!! Dropcam was great, Google cheapened and ruined it. Dropped resolution to 720, and the network drops off 8 or 10 times per day, even cust.. Support will tell you that nest(Google) ruined their company. Be fore warned, find a different camera! 
10150 Powerful but very inconsistent performance, ttl will at some times tend to over/under expose, not very reliable but good third-party flash for the money 
10151 Tamron 150-600 fits well with lens hood in storage position. 
10152 I like this camera but use something else for night photos. 
10153 Same as Canon preformance 
10154 Works great. 
10155 Setup way to complicated for the average user. 
10156 Excellent !! 
10157 work Fine excellent!!!!! 
10158 This did not fit the battery to the camera I own even though the listing says it will. 
10159 Great deal ... fast shipping ... exactly what I needed. 
10160 Very good!!! 
10161 Original equipment that fits like it should! 
10162 Great Product. High Picture Quality. Though Screen Resolution is not that good but Photos are of very good Quality. Fast Shipping. 
10163 Nice compact diffuser, easy to install and in testing does a nice job of evenly illuminating a scene. 
10164 Thrs no intraction how to use it 
10165 Great! 
10166 Works as advertised. Just make sure you re buying the right one. Nikon makes two nearly identical lenses with different hood mounts. This hood goes straight on, it doesn t twist on. 
10167 Picture quality is poor, no way to save or review video.. only a live feed. 
10168 One of the BEST deals I ve ever gotten on these batteries! 
10169 Great little camera for the money. It don t record but will take pictures. These pictures aren t great quality but again for what your paying a good value. 
10170 it dosent support P2P 
10171 Birthday gift for my daughter, she seems happy with it. 
10172 Works perfectly to charge our Nikon D-600 camera battery. 
10173 perfect price for getting the job done! thank you! 
10174 Great product 
10175 Doing what it s supposed to do! 
10176 Allows for lots of applications. I use it for my band s gigs. 
10177 It didn t work 
10178 Used many times and am very happy with the compact size and versatility of this tripod. Well worth the cost. 
10179 Good product; timely shipping. 
10180 If you are looking for an inexpensive, but trustworthy tripod! I could not recommend this one enough! I thought that if I bought something cheap my camera would tip the whole thing over but that is not the case! Definitely get s the job done! 
10181 A gift-what was requested. 
10182 I am new to whole quad copter and was looking for a cheap quad to learn. This thing is perfect for that and very sturdy. I can t even count how many times I crashed it and it still kept on working. Great bundle and great value. 
10183 AmazonBasics 
10184 Nice scope, though the tripod doesn t hold the weight of the scope and is useless. Otherwise it s a nice setup. 
10185 Works well 
10186 The charger works very good with my two different nikon cameras. The packaging was perfect because it wasn t too big, just the right size and it came earlier than i expected so good job Amazon. 
10187 Using it on Nexus 7 II. Works great! Good quality. 
10188 It s a bit deceptive in size, I m 6 1&#34; and I have to bend over to adjust the Camera. Works ok, but I would need a taller Tri-pod. 
10189 Works as intended. Use on my recent snorkle trip and also to simply to hold up my go pro. 
10190 This enclosure has a nice finish and strong construction. 
10191 Great Product 
10192 Does exactly what it says. Simple little product that keeps me organized 
10193 just ok 
10194 video footage is always grainy and low light no matter what is done to adjust. Big Big waste of money. This is just an overpriced vivitar!!! 
10195 Actually my daughter loves them! Got them for her for her birthday. She leads hiking tours and whale watching tours in Juneau, Alaska. She really likes them and they help her spot birds for the tourists. 
10196 Arrived quickly and just worked great immediately. This is a terrific tool for the price. Wish the Sony had an infrared receiver on its backside, but this is really easy to use. 
10197 Great product 
10198 Love all the different clips and straps 
10199 Small enough for your pocket 
10200 I m using it with the I-phone adapter to record fly fishing casts and it works extremely well. Completely stable and tall for the recording and light and compact for moving and storage. Great value. 
10201 Worth every penny! Buy it! Love that the camera compartment can be removed. Leather is awesome and it works great! 
10202 Really loud! when your battery is low. I left it on my battery overnight and it only used .01 of a volt in 24 hours 
10203 Perfect lens for portrait photos 
10204 I purchased for my daughter, she is very happy with the purchase 
10205 Of course the day after I ordered this I found the original one, but I did keep this one. I tried it out and it did work and saving it as back up for when I lose the one that came with my fuji camera. 
10206 Thank goodness someone is still making these !!!! Thanks ! 
10207 Exactly the item I ordered and it came new and box as promised 
10208 My blender came without velcrow to attach -_- it s useless. 
10209 Camera was very grainy with my security system. Could have been my system but the 800 tvl from this company is clearer. 
10210 Nice product. Makes viewing photos easy, can brign them up on my smart phone and send right away. Can also use the smartphone to take the pictures. 
10211 work very good days and night can see very clear i recommend it 
10212 worst flash i ever used , doesn t work with d7100 in wireless flash trigger mode and the quality of the light in hot shoe is too bad 
10213 Works well. 
10214 Pretty cool lens, great value for the price. Couldn t believe it actually had metal mount! 
10215 A sharp, compact prime lens that does depth of field shots that the 12-40mm zoom lens cannot readily do. 
10216 Haven t used it in the field yet but first impression is this is should be included in the box. 
10217 High quality precision, travel ease, exceptional overall design 
10218 Great I love this I ve had fun with it ever since i got it it also came fast 
10219 It works fine. Very pleased. 
10220 The mounts we re exactly as advertised and connected to my camera with ease. Good quality and nice clean look. One Mount clip missing when the package arrived, I contacted PolarPro and had a new one shipped to me the next business day. 
10221 Guess what - it charges two batteries at a time, works fairly quickly, seems to stop when charged (when I forget them in the charger they never get warm). That s what I was looking to buy....would buy this product again. 
10222 Works well 
10223 the design is cute, I just wish taking it out and putting it back in was easier since i have to take it out to check the amount of film i have left and to replace the film and batteries. 
10224 Did not blink after installing new batteries. Tried another set of batteries, same problem. I looked at the camera during the day and night several times 
10225 I have found this back pak easy to load/configure and is quite versatile. It is easy to carry and offers good protection for the contents. 
10226 Perfect fit. The lens I had bought should have come with one of these, but for the price it fills the bill. 
10227 Good 
10228 Didn t work consistently. Had to return. Thank you Amazon for a wonderful return policy! 
10229 I love this perfect size tote for my DSLR and nifty fifty. This way I ll never miss a moment. Very roomy for keys, cards, and phone. It s also stylish which is the less important use, but it s definitely a perk plus. 
10230 Works just as good as original battery. 
10231 Very handy backpack, nice size. All my camera gear fits, along with chargers, notebooks and iPad. 
10232 they worked great. 
10233 Works very fine so far. Attaching strings should come in very handy for people like me. :) 
10234 this is a great drone for beginners! worth the price for what it is! controlled by an app for your phone! buy extra batteries and props with this product 
10235 Could not have ask for more , great deal everything as discribed. My only problem was self created. Ended up buying a camo cam could have used a better shoulder strap 
10236 But this product was everything that I expected and more. Great seller, quick shipping. 
10237 The selfie stick is cheap not worth it in my opinion. The other gadgets worked fine 
10238 Works great and I got them at a discount compared to local stores. 
10239 This product is amazing and at very low cost. Most importantly, the live customer support was extremely helpful in solving a problem I had in getting all my cameras recognized. Very special thanks to Alan ( badge id# AR004639) at D-Link Customer support (877) 595-6935 
10240 This is the perfect tripod for carrying inside my small camera bad. It opens and collapsed easily but locks into position when the legs are extended and given a small twist. 
10241 Best sensor cleaning swabs available. 
10242 Is it a nikon battery? NO. Could I tell the difference? Not really.. I am skeptical of off brand batteries but this one is just like OE, for 1/3 price. Used in D800, and performance was comparable/identical to nikon batt. 
10243 Good Deal! 
10244 Had me excited to shoot again 
10245 Great camera, use it to keep an eye on my dogs while I m away at work. 
10246 Wonderfully exposes image with good dynamic range. Even though a lower resolution than my other cameras, the picture looks far better due to better exposure, dynamic range, and colors. Lens is distinctly wide angle compared to my other cameras, too. 
10247 As others say, rubber on product smells like toxic waste, after washing ten times, spraying it with armour all, I can stand it. Nice product if it were less toxic. 
10248 So happy to have an extra battery since our other one kept dying on vacation. We ll get a lot of use from this. 
10249 Kit arrived on time and was exactly as described. Very happy with experience. 
10250 This lens is fun to use although I still keep my other lens handy. I am satisfied with the quality and value for the price. 
10251 Lot Heavier then expected. 
10252 So far great! 
10253 A very simple review: this is now the only GoPro mount / accessory I take with me when I m hiking, biking or on the water. Versatile, simple, reliable. Excellent. And handy as a tripod too. 
10254 Very good! Thanks 
10255 This quadcopter is the most fun I ve had for under $50 in years! 
10256 Stay away took 12 hours still won t able to fixed 
10257 doesn t fit if you have the lens hood in place unlike original 
10258 too small to use 
10259 Works with my d7000, v1, and d70 (and i assume the rest of the nikon lineup), and is cheaper than the nikon version. 
10260 Great product. I am very satisfied of the quality of the pictures. Soo happy to have the camera definitely purchasing again. 
10261 Very good camera strap with the ability to quickly disconnect the strap from the camera. Just what i needed. Good quality at a very good price. 
10262 Works great, small profile. But... You must have camera shutter set to timer/remote mode first. Instructions fail to mention that. 
10263 Soooo cheapy, we went to extend it and one of the poles came all the way off, one wouldn t open (stuck inside tube, tried to remove it with tweezers but it bent--- with tweezers!) very low quality, don t waste your money! 
10264 Not a bad deal. 
10265 I really like the case perfect size perfect color 
10266 Not suitable for a 6 individual. Sling strap when adjusted to max length is too short. Camera rides high (under your arm) and cannot be raised for shooting because of the short straps. 
10267 easy to configure! 
10268 its ok 
10269 Nice backdrop! 
10270 Super helpful! Used it for my camera and sure enough, works great! :) 
10271 Awesome camera. I am a dslr user and needed something to replace my huge amount of gear. Resolution is what I expected but of course not as high as my Nikon d800 s But definitely a fun and powerful camera in terms of performance. 
10272 Sometime it will not work 
10273 Great product. I will continue to buy Olukai for all of my sandal needs. 
10274 I waited to write a review until I used this product for meany months, its fantastic and illuminates my light box fantasticlt!!! Absolutely fantastic packaging and everything came fast and works great!! 
10275 Holding up well. 
10276 It is an awesome product! Sets up easy and has a great carrying case. I love it!! 
10277 A must have for your telescope. 
10278 vibrates way too much to use for camera 
10279 Camera still doesn t work. Don t know if it s the cable or camera 
10280 Very versatile. Easy to use. Finally can take family photos without accosting a stranger... 
10281 Buy a go pro instead 
10282 Cool 
10283 This works very well. 
10284 A++++++++++++ Thank you !! 
10285 They are perfect for a cell phone, tablet or eye glasses. They get all the fingerprints and oil off without a problem. 
10286 Easy to use; good pictures 
10287 I use this unit with my Nikon D60 DSLR and it works perfect. No problems and less expensive than the Nikon counterpart. 
10288 excellent service the Bobber works really well in the water great product 
10289 This is a wonderful case, I loved it so much that I bought another case that was just a bit smaller. They are both very strong and practical. This is a great tool and I m happy that I purchased these. 
10290 Easy to use 
10291 Works as expected, and much cheaper than the GoPro brand one. I only wish it somehow floated right side up... 
10292 This works well, turns off when done, and the price is right 
10293 These things are a blast and cheap enough so it really doesn t matter if you destroy it.. Yeah they are very durable Also found that if you want to fly it outside, push in on the left stick, makes it more aggressive. 
10294 Works well with small camera at the beach. Seems to be well made. 
10295 product as advertised. 
10296 There s nothing really special about it but it will get the job done. I wish there were cuter, more stylish options for DSLR sleeves but it is what it is. 
10297 It works as expected. 
10298 Very helpful 
10299 Other than one brief Bluetooth dropped connection, this selfie stick performed flawlessly on our recent trip, in both cool and hot, humid conditions. Definitely a solid, affordable purchase! 
10300 It works and I like it. Cheap in cost, but feels sturdy. 
10301 Had some problems with it. I usually use my Nikon D-5100 but thought I wanted a smaller camera that I could carry easier. Guess I expected the photo quality to be the same as the digital SLR but was disappointed. However, Amazon let me return it without any hassle. 
10302 Awesome high quality product. It said USED with cosmetic damage but its not noticeable 
10303 I used it for all of my Music Videos. Youtube Search: Jeremy Crescendo 
10304 Excellent Product. 
10305 Not for original go pro 
10306 I love this flash. So excited to finally own one. 
10307 I have yet to have an issue with it after a few months of owning. Taken hundreds of photos with it thus far. No complaints. 
10308 Nothing better than these. Recommended. 
10309 Works great. Always good to have plenty standby power and charging 2 at a time makes it much quicker. 
10310 really hard to get a signal. A waste of money 
10311 Works well - very satisfied with Amazon transaction/service. 
10312 I was very pleased with this product. Was a little worried that wouldn t actually be compatible with my camera but everything worked really well. Thanks. 
10313 Used these to clean the inside of my windshield to get rid of that weird haze that builds up. Worked perfectly. Hard to handle in that situation, so I wrapped them around another towel so I could grip them better. 
10314 The selfie pole is flimsy but overall there are plenty of attachments for great angles. 
10315 The best way to take your GoPro out on the water. 
10316 Allows me to charge three battries at once when I use the power adapter. If I try to just use USB - will only charge two. 
10317 Works great! Speedy shipping 
10318 All good stuff,, but the packing really bad!! Card boar was tear,,, n weak!!! 
10319 Came quick and works great. 
10320 Really like the camera, the lense size is double what we expected. Picture and video quality is amazing. Very confused by the fact it s made for European outlets though. 
10321 This camera has served me well for a long time. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good quality, no nonsense camera. 
10322 Very good quality, I m pleased. 
10323 So, ordered the standard housing 2.0, but unfortunately received the dive housing 2.0. Did not even realize this until I was already on the dive boat today. Will update product review once proper product is received. 
10324 Excellent quality! Very happy with the purchase! 
10325 Great product. As advertised and of super quality.... 
10326 exactly what i expected! i love this set and i definitely recommend it. 
10327 Best Charging System for all GoPro batteries including other manufacturers. 
10328 Great Value! 
10329 These dont even hold a charge as lonh as my original 2yr old battery 
10330 It s a cheap lense hood that fits well and gets the job done, not much else to say. 
10331 Perfect Fit! 
10332 Started looking for a camera I liked with a good zoom lens 5 years ago. This camera is exactly what I was looking for. Glad I waited. Love this camera! 
10333 Great accessory bought two :) one for me and the other for my daughter in law :) 
10334 Excellent product. I solved a problem with a camera at nights. 
10335 Great item works great!!! 
10336 I love my new iPad. It is easy to use. 
10337 Will return to seller. 
10338 Works great. Charges 2 batteries at the same time. Like all great devices it uses a micro USB. Very pleased with this product 
10339 Great for the price! 
10340 LOVE LOVE LOVE!! Camera is Excellent and my husband loves it all!! 
10341 Fast delivery, Items exactly as described. Good place to purchase your add-on s for camera security. 
10342 i have other cheaper ones that works as good 
10343 Ain t nobody got time for expensive go pros. Go cheap and buy more. Works great can t complain and for the price it s insane. 
10344 The underwater pictures are better than those that are not. Resolution is low - but bought it for them to rough around with. Will buy nicer one when they are a bit more gentle with these things. 
10345 Fits my camera perfectly 
10346 will USE THIS RECOOMEND THIS 
10347 The remote doesn t work with my Canon Rebel t3i EOS 600D 
10348 Very nice portrait lens good price and fast shipping 
10349 Works great 
10350 best bag for short travel 
10351 Purchased this as a gift and the person loves it! 
10352 Worked great. Fits my hero just fine and is water tight. 
10353 Everyone has a plan till they get punched in the mouth. - Mike Tyson 
10354 great started drone, good price, high quality. 
10355 Works very well makes it handy to do angled shots. 
10356 Works great, good price. 
10357 thank you 
10358 Camera works amazingly; takes great photos, although the quality of them varies a bit in low light. 
10359 Charger works great and is simple to use. 
10360 What a great camera! Because of how I have my home wi-fi set I had to use their customer service. Wow is the only way to put it. They were very responsive and offered the highest level of service I have seen in a long time. 
10361 I haven t used the flash as yet, but I have demonstrated it in practice It works as well or better than the ones costing 5 times as much 
10362 Higher capacity than original battery, and support all functions. Charged it fully, so lets see how long it can last and hold a charge. 
10363 I was worried about ordering any electronics from online, but I had nothing to worry about. It was excellent condition!! Works beautifully and gets the job done!! LOW priced and fast shipping!! Feel safe when ordering from this seller!! Thank you!! 
10364 THE YN600EX- RT FOR MY CANON 70D PERFORMED GRATE, I DID A 60th BIRTHDAY PARTY THIS PAST WEEKEND WITCH RAN 7 HOURS AND THE FLASH WORKED GREAT I USED MOST OF IT S FUNCTIONS. IT PERFORMED JUST LIKE THE CANON VERSION ONLY CHEAPER. 
10365 Best film ever made; now it s about the only film made. 
10366 Does what i need to do perfectly! I bought this camera just to start making youtube piano videos. For an &#34;entry level&#34; GoPro this is remarkable! Check out the video I made with it! https://youtu.be/c2IH5HMuC5Y 
10367 best way to shoot macros! 
10368 Did the job 
10369 These guys are the best! Shipped case super fast, and it is a great product! 
10370 Received as described and prompt shipping. Great price and high quality. 
10371 Looks good. That s where the goodness ends. Boom arm to pole connector does not really hold: loaded, the whole construct slips. Consider looking elsewhere. PS.: while not excluding a &#34;crooked hands&#34; factor, this particular design does not work for me. 
10372 Exactly what was advertised. 
10373 I just received it,hopefully it will be fine 
10374 The lens is pretty darn good. Almost the only one you d ever need considering the iso range available on the unit. Still figuring out the rest of the settings 
10375 My friend told me that her husband loved these pajamas! This is what she said he wanted for Christmas. She loves that they are so soft. They were given as a Christmas gift. 
10376 Ok for price 
10377 Straight from the mother land (China) 
10378 Requires a VERY high internet speed. My DSL was maxed out and it still did not function. 
10379 Best purchase I have ever made. 
10380 Just what I needed to get my laptop to talk to my Nikon. What is that funny little Nikon connector called anyway? 
10381 It is so much more substantial than the one that came with my camera...Fits better and is made sturdier. 
10382 I only received two lens not three. 
10383 very nice, I bought it to have in different places in my house car and my husband took few to his office i just wish they were a bit bigger. 
10384 I love it. 
10385 Awesome 
10386 lots of problems, wouldnt buy it again. 
10387 You have to charge this thing everyday...complete waste of money. First item arrived damaged, return was easy but still not worth the money. Going to be putting into the trash. Only recordings I have gotten are when I first place it onto the wall. 
10388 Bought this for my 12 year old niece as her first digital camera. This camera takes crappy pictures 😕. Not worth the purchase. 
10389 A very nice product. 
10390 Love it! 
10391 Quick & easy setup. Just be sure to plug it in to your computer FIRST, then plug it into the wall outlet. This is my second camera. I am going to order a third. One for home & two for business. 
10392 I love it so much I never expected to run out of film so quickly ahaha 
10393 love this backpack holds a good bunch of gear fits well to wear and the laptop area is great 
10394 Gave this as a gift for a fellow photographer. She loved it! I wonder if this name brand is as good as the other manufacturers... 
10395 Great product! 
10396 ok 
10397 fits nicely into the pack. 
10398 Motor and gears break easily. Must order parts online. However, they are easy to replace. My son loves the copter. 
10399 I m very happy with this product! 
10400 Exactly as advertised 
10401 Looks like the real deal. Love it. 
10402 Sorry- had to return it. Much too small for a 50mm full frame lense. 
10403 I gave it to a friend 
10404 Awesome Handle! About the cheapest you can buy from anywhere and it s built VERY well. 
10405 Really happy with this purchase, amazing camera for a reasonable price. I don t use everything from the bundle but it was a great deal. 
10406 Not well ventilated. 
10407 very good 
10408 Good item 
10409 Excelente producto!!! 
10410 Seems to work perfectly with the Lee Holder and my 105 mm polarizer. Good quality, and while it costs much less than the Lee, it is still overpriced. Lee products, but especially their accessories, are CRAZY expensive. 
10411 Get it out of the box and you are ready to use it. Just synchronize, via Bluetooth your phone, and you have your shutter working. 
10412 Nice camera easy to use and get started quickly 
10413 Does NOT do anything 
10414 very useful for outdoor carrying 
10415 Outstanding product which does exactly what it says it does. I purchased these cleaning cloths strictly for cleaning my eyeglasses because I don t care for the smaller cleaning clothes. So, my 2 concerns were (1) cleans glasses well and (2) adequate size. These cleaning clothes met those 2 concerns. 
10416 I love it. Very comfortable, durable, and for the price is amazing I managed to attach it along with my neck band and use both actively. 
10417 A little flimpsy but works pretty well 
10418 Very easy to use and takes terrific pictures 
10419 Great buy and great company 
10420 Husband loves it. He said he wont use everything but atleast he has it when he needs it. 
10421 Perfect 
10422 Quite sturdy. 
10423 This is a great value if you need to record a long segment. It s crazy that it even comes with a cigarette adapter, which I doubt I ll use. 
10424 Suks 
10425 I will do the job.. not the best tripod but for the money it s good enough for my purpose’s. 
10426 Loving this camera!!! There was a mix up with the flash, but Photo-4-Less was quick to respond to our request for a replacement. Waiting for it to arrive. 
10427 This was a great deal. I only needed the charger (I lost mine) so getting the two batteries with it was a bonus. The charger works great. The shipping was really fast too. I had it within just a couple days. 
10428 Broken product was not what I expected to be 
10429 poor image quality 
10430 Nice product at a reasonable price. 
10431 Bought for my son s Go Pro because his somehow broke. He loves the color and is looking to replace whatever he can on his GoPro case with parts of the same color. Recommend. 
10432 Love this sports cam it s so clear and love how it works on wifi, to me why spending 400 on a go pro when this one can do the same to me even better, thank you for giving me the opportunity to get this product in exchange my review 
10433 Works great with Nikon D3300. 
10434 Great screen protector for camera LCD s. This product is easy to size and apply to the LCD screen. It holds fast but can be removed without leaving a residue when it s time to replace or change it. 
10435 It works. What more can you say. 
10436 Awesome 
10437 this is the perfect case for my camcorder its sleek, comfortable and I was able to fit all the accessories into it and still have room left over for id or credit cards. I love this case 
10438 The camera looks just like the picture, but I am a bit disappointed in the way it does not focus well when zoomed in from a distance. Also find the transfer of pics to phone a little cumbersome and slow usually. 
10439 With every shot from a 12 gauge the camera would move completely out of the way or at one point even managed to fly off. But good for fishing and other random projects. 
10440 It needs more compartments to put the accessories in. 
10441 Best beginner quad out there!!! 
10442 nothing to write. It comes with hardly no instructions or service manual. camera have a narrow scan width & it will not take a sata hard drive smaller than 500 GB. Sorry but I would not purchase another one. 
10443 The charger does what it is supposed to do. We are happy with that and that the price was right. 
10444 did not work. I have to return item. 
10445 I m a photographer and I love these. Great 
10446 Great Camera, bought for my 12 year budding photo journalist. She can t wait for school to start so she can help with the school yearbook. 
10447 It s excellent product I really like it 
10448 The housing can go with thwe other compllement for the tripod 
10449 As described. 
10450 Works as described 
10451 great. 
10452 This is a superb lens, and a very useful macro. 
10453 I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how big these are. There are six individually packaged cloths, so you can share them if you want, I intend to buy more for stocking stuffers. They work great and are easy to keep clean. 
10454 fast and sharp. Great quality. 
10455 Absolutely love this camera! The color quality, sharpness and quickness in capturing the images surpassed what I expected. It s worth every penny. The instant gratification of having the photo and sharing with friends and family is totally special. 
10456 Nice little lens. This does everything i need it to do. 
10457 Excellent gear, very well crafted! The grip for the camera is a little flimsy though - Go with this grip in this package instead. Great combo. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00S4NB2IY/ 
10458 Just what I needed. 
10459 Love my new camera!! 
10460 as described. Thanks! 
10461 Danny was excellent at fixing my camera. I do love my camera. 
10462 works great and great price 
10463 Does exactly what it is designed to do...Works great for me 
10464 Panasonic FZ series is so much better. I had high hopes for Fujifilm but they do not compare to the clear and sharp images of Panasonic - even if you go back a few model years. 
10465 Nice case and extremely sturdy. Doesn t quite accommodate the remote for the phantom 3, but 5 minutes with a knife on the foam solves that. It s a big case but between the remote, phantom, power supply and two batteries it gets a little tight. 
10466 Great! 
10467 Fits my Nikon with 18-200 zoom perfectly. Plenty of extra pockets to carry other essentials. Love it! 
10468 Holds like iron. Pleased. 
10469 I purchased many sets of camera straps from OP/TECH USA, and finally this one met my expectations in terms of strap length because I prefer to carry my camera over my shoulder and I don t like to hang my camera from its bottom but from its eyelets. 
10470 Keeps items inside safe and dry. Case is durable and feels solid. Usuale pelican quality. 
10471 Works as promised 
10472 I just got this product and it s not charging 
10473 I m so disappointed hope will refund my money soon 
10474 I used this for a time lapse sequence on my old D70s. Worked just fine. The customer loved the sequence used in a commercial spot. 
10475 Shotty. Didn t work 
10476 great product. I d rather it had a len protector included. 
10477 a must have 
10478 EXCELLENT!!! 
10479 Nice lighting. 
10480 Using a variety of leica camera R8,M6ttl, digilux, T series and monochrome this unit good with all. Along with leica tripod proves very useful. 
10481 Batteries work well and charge fast, no complaints. 
10482 Works well, does a good job protecting the glass. 
10483 Like it for a small bag. 
10484 works great for my motovlogs no problems at all 
10485 Don t buy the cheap mounts. Buy the GoPro original. It s worth the additional cost. I rode over 2300 miles on my Harley with this attached to the front fairing and it worked great. 
10486 bought this for my wife. She absolutely LOVES it!!! 
10487 Fits well, although it isn t reversible on my tamron lens, I suspect it may be on other brands. 
10488 my brother will like it thank you 
10489 Great kit with accessible price. Definitely would recommend it! 
10490 Great; strong, reliable, compact easy to set up/break down...what more could you ask for. 
10491 I m giving this 5 stars because my boyfriend likes this. I bought it for him and he seems to be pleased with the way it is working. 
10492 I love it however it is a little bit tricky to get off. 
10493 Great！ 
10494 I own 2 of these and they get a lot of usage in my business. Very good quality. I swapped out the traditional 3 position heads on my Manfrotto tripods and now use these exclusively. 
10495 As advertised. 
10496 Fast shipping and fits perfect on our Sony camera 
10497 love this background, it photos really well. I use it alot 
10498 Fits the lens perfectly and adds some scratch protection for the front of the lens. 
10499 Was in the market for something affordable and useful; this product provides both! As a new photographer I am very pleased, and recommend to anyone who is starting out! 
10500 Charger worked perfectly with my camera battery. Have not used the car charger yet, but so happy to have one while traveling. 
10501 Works great 
10502 The case itself is quite small. I had expected a bit larger. But it does hold my enough gear for my ski or boat bag. Pros: good construction, enough space for some gear Come: quite small If you need a small gopro session case this is for you! 
10503 Way too many features to remember how to use them. As a point-and-shoot camera it isn t ideal. 
10504 Absolutely outstanding 
10505 Worked as describe would get it again if I needed it. 
10506 Charger has bad ports, will kill batteries charged there. Was good for a little while (4-6 months?) but then it killed batteries. It took me a while to realize it was the charger, not the batteries failing. 
10507 Easy connection (Android), images are clean and color true for a little portable printer. Zink paper cost is reasonable. 
10508 I can no longer live without my Benro. I love it. 
10509 So enjoying this selfie stick for my videos and for photos! 
10510 This works well for my Ebay pictures. 
10511 This will only fit an iPhone without a case. Too small to hold iPhone with case. 
10512 came fast, good price, thanks! 
10513 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
10514 Innovative! Does what it says. Convenient, compact. Also useful to diffuse light for macro shots. 
10515 It was just what I expected and needed 
10516 Quick turn around. What I expected! 
10517 Thx 
10518 This backpack has tons of room for all my camera and accessories. It s well constructed as well as padded. A bit I n the big side but still comfortable to carry. 
10519 Bought this for my grandson that turned 13 and it is prefect for him. A great beginner camera and easy to use. 
10520 I ve had this charger for many months now and continue to be satisfied with the operation. 
10521 I used it less than five times decided just stop trying. It was so hard to figure out what I was hearing. I wish I used it sooner so I could get my money back. Don t waste your time and money on this device! 
10522 After looking everywhere for these batteries, my dad lost hope that he would find batteries for his Canon DSLR camera. When I heard him lamenting about this, I suggested that I look on Amazon. Voila! Problem solved! Thanks for making my 90 year old dad a happy camper. 
10523 Everything it s supposed to be 
10524 Works great with my Panasonic HC-W850K Digital HD Camcorder 
10525 A very handy lightweight pack for a single lens and camera and accessories. 
10526 Not happy at all! Drops control link sometimes less than 10 meters. I find it not reliable at all. 
10527 This works perfect for my Canon SX530. An excellent product. I recommend it highly! 
10528 as described. Works well on my camera. 
10529 I love my camera! I keep it in my purse! I never use my big Canon anymore! 
10530 To be completely honest, the item was flown one time and already needs replacement parts 
10531 Not very happy with the robustness Of the product. Easily broken. Will be contacting the company for answers and replacement parts. It does fly ok. Very touchy controls. 
10532 Small size recharger.. Working excellent.. Battery also good.. 
10533 Good product. Arrived promptly as promised. 
10534 I love my new camera. It s a beginner photographer setup. Memories in the making. 
10535 I bought this as a combo for the infinity portable speaker and it didnt fit the damn thing 
10536 Nice quality especially for the price. Would definitely buy other colors. 
10537 The fact this doesn t turn off is my only score against it. It s also a bit confusing to use, but not difficult to learn. Works great. Would prefer a wireless version. works with my D7100 
10538 Perfect 
10539 great! 
10540 I have used LensPens since my first DSLR a Pentax *ist DL back in 2006. They work great on my lenses and haven t caused any scratches or issues. A quick and painless way to clean my lenses. 
10541 Excellent product. 
10542 No problems here! This is the backup battery for my Nikon D7200. It charged up quickly as I expected and lasted as long as the battery that came with the camera. 
10543 Lost my original Nikon charger. This one works as advertised and comes with a vehicle charger attachment. 
10544 This mic was the reason I kept getting error messages on my 70D. Didn t have time or patients to trouble shoot it. Sent it back. 
10545 Great Price, works great 
10546 Holds everything except the kitchen sink. Works great! 
10547 Great! 
10548 It cant be support a big camera. 
10549 Love it 
10550 This is one of the best lenses Canon makes. If I m shooting outdoor portraits, this is what I reach for. 
10551 so far it has worked as expected. 
10552 Cheap and works perfect for semi-pro activities. 
10553 Thank you for the material of the order, everything went well with the delivery man 
10554 Nice camera!! I m very happy with my camera and the teleobjective of 300mm but the rest of the material is not worth it, the quality is bad. 
10555 AMAZING! In love with it.. soft, comfy, stylish. :) 
10556 works great!! 
10557 classy way to offer a days shoot to friends,clients, family members 
10558 Just what I need for my 1st Aid kit 
10559 I have been in love with this camera since I got it. I m still learning the advanced functions. 
10560 Item is broken. I guess I ll be using super glue since it s not worth the hassle of returning. 
10561 Great lights, would highly recommend 
10562 Easily connects and works so well! Very easy to carry around. 
10563 Cheap, broken, this sums up what this tripod is all about. Doesn t matter where you get it you will find the same. Shame on you Targus. 
10564 Had an odor but is a great deal and great way to keep camera safe. 
10565 On time delivery, packaged very well. Excellent product that functions as advertised. Easy to place or remove, easy to use. 
10566 Camera stopped working within 30 days. It was a worst experience i had, i went for a trip with my family and thought to capture all the moments with this new camera but it stopped working all a sudden and i couldn t capture any pics of this trip. 
10567 It works pretty well, but the reels seem like they re a little to narrow for 35mm. The film was getting jammed a lot, and rounding the lead edges of the film with scissors seemed to help, but I ve hard to re-start rolls several times. 
10568 So far so good. 
10569 .then again all batteries are good brand new.. 
10570 Good 
10571 JUNK 
10572 What I really like about this product is that there were two straps included with the mount that could be used. Hooray!! 
10573 sound wasn t great item looked and felt very cheap and batteries cost. 
10574 It did not accept the app, the disk would not load up.many trials and nothing. 
10575 Thanks 
10576 Quick and painless setup including wireless. Resolution is good. 2-way comm works. 
10577 bad camera sent 2 back to aweek will not try that brand again 
10578 I use it all the time, great lens. 
10579 Extremely thin and high quality. I would purchase again if I need another filter for my other lenses. 
10580 gave as birthday present. what a wonderful camera! 
10581 Perfect for all we use it for. Great for under water shark viewing. 
10582 Great price. Very easy to use. Also very sturdy. 
10583 Love everything about it 
10584 great tone, still tryung to find the right spot for it 
10585 Cameras arrived w/out any damage since it was packaged properly. Had problems setting 3 cameras wireless. DLink support was fantastic. Wait time was less than 5 mins. DLink support ( C6720565-AR004231, AR004207,AR004208) walked me thru the wireless setup. 
10586 Great price, excellent protection! 
10587 Solid construction and fits well in my arca ballhead. 
10588 Tripod itself is great, but the adapter isn t. I had to buy a replacement adaptor in a few weeks. 
10589 Hang on to it. It s small and you like having it on the camera. Check to be sure it s not loose. 
10590 I found this macro rail to be very well built, especially for the price point. movement is smooth and precise. I m quite happy with the purchase. 
10591 Good 
10592 Great little camera to mount on the bottom of a RC airplane! Tons of fun! Wonderfully clear pictures..This replaces the one I misplaced,it has a lot of potential to have fun with,especially on an electric plane, zero engine noise to attract attention. 
10593 the charger is okay but the batteries don t work but a few months. would not buy again 
10594 Great camera and SD card. Wasn t really buying it for anything else, but the tripod works pretty well too! Fantastic price point. 
10595 Gene Crawford 
10596 Good item 
10597 Wow from China. 
10598 Great product - works just like described -- 
10599 AMAZING AND THE SOUND DOES WORK!!! 
10600 like the colored borders 
10601 Old model camera. The case is too small for the camera with battery. Except for the camera, nothing is of the brand or description advertised. I paid $90 for expedite but I was not shipped for 2 days and by Snail mail. 
10602 Looks nice but it s not the most efficient. So if ur going for the looks, then go for it, but it s annoying when u want to take pictures 
10603 The camera seemed to work fine but it offered little adjustment possibilities, resulting in inconsistent and almost temperamental results. I supposed it might also have to do with the film available. 
10604 More than half of the joints broke, all at different times. Only used once. It s hard to try to turn or twist. Not worth it on my book. 
10605 Did not work!! 
10606 The sd card would not play on my Galaxy phone, the info on it said it would. 
10607 I love this follow focus ! Nice value for your money !!! It Is precise and works perfect after few mounts!!! Great product ! 
10608 Priced right works great.Was a bit concerned when I discovered that the rear hatch door on the expedition was all plastic rendering the magnet useless, but wait they included a Velcro sticky thing so all is well. Will update after our camping trip in the near future. 
10609 Worked as advertised for about a year or so....then the charge starts getting less and less. 
10610 good product 
10611 I have used this bag maybe five times and the zippers have failed. One zipper fell completely off and the other zipper popped out of the teeth; rendering the bag worthless. Look for another bag. 
10612 This camera delivered great pics on our vacation. The zoom capability is excellent for a moderately priced point-and-shoot model. Very happy with the purchase. 
10613 When I bought my GoPro, it only came with the waterproof housing. This housing actually lets the sound come through. 
10614 Works good 
10615 Good 
10616 Love my new camera and all of the goodies that came with it. It was shipped very quickly and everything was included as it was listed. Thanks for making my purchase easy and helping me capture many memories! 
10617 Perfect thank you 
10618 For the incredibly low price it is hard to complain but the product definitely feels like it costs- cheap. 
10619 This is just as good as the way more expensive clamps. It s versatile, strong construction, has a great grip. I trust it to hold my Zoom H6 if I want to boom it. So far hasn t budged an inch. 
10620 It s a cool-looking and resilient case 
10621 I just used one of the new my newly purchased batteries on a 7 day bear viewing trip. Although we didn t have non-stop photography, I was amazed that I didn t need to recharge the battery once during the week. I m VERY pleased with the product. 
10622 It s ok, you can t take a pic with it and it lets the phone tilt if you don t balance it perfectly. 
10623 A bit smaller than I would ve liked, but it s well made. Good for short photography trips! 
10624 Easily too use, give good colur. 
10625 one of the lights does not fit right. 
10626 Perfect for small fixed focal length lenses and teleconverters. I like that there are no plastic tabs or anything that rubs / chafes against other camera equipment. Very simple and very functional equipment protection. 
10627 Works great and you do have to iron the backdrops, no big deal. Want to learn how to close it, watch a youtube video they are out there and easy to find. 
10628 Not bad for the price! Feel like the lens could be clearer!! But all and all good deal!! 
10629 great item fast shipping thank you 
10630 Great for transferring your pictures to your phone and sharing on social media on the spot but just a heads up, if you shoot in raw the file sizes are large and can take a few minutes to transfer. 
10631 Met expectations. Great value for price. 
10632 Did not include the correct DVR. 
10633 it works, but not compatible with mine. 
10634 Nice frame, works beautifully, so simple to set up! 
10635 Too many issues with an off brand. Works great when it works but often finicky with the camera electronics. Sometimes just doesn t work 
10636 Great item. Great price for a very nice quality item. Thank you 
10637 Good value for money, good quality 
10638 So much fun to use for guests! 
10639 very good shipping, no problems A++ thanks Patrick 
10640 died after three months of use 
10641 Camera works great. The setup was very easy 
10642 Pretty good, looks durable! 
10643 The item arrived in reasonable time and was as described. There were Japanese import duties but I knew about them when I ordered. I wanted manuals etc for my camera to be in English rather than just Japanese. 
10644 Works great 
10645 Very good. 
10646 Exactly as advertised and the cheapest price around. It worked perfectly. 
10647 Works great!! 
10648 excellent 
10649 Best purchase of the year for me (400$). Awesome! 
10650 Better then the one that came with the camera 
10651 Amazing! Love it 
10652 Had purchased one a few months ago exact same one and the company would not take it back so we had to order this one ...It works great but we had to put the insides in it...it came with out the parts. 
10653 Very good product 
10654 Great 
10655 Good camera. Night vision is good 
10656 This tribrach has a iron items. I have been looked for tribrach with unmagnetic items and that it has items to brass or aluminium. Also screws are magnrtic item to iron. 
10657 Great monitor calibrator 
10658 Works as expected 
10659 Good quality. Clamp on stand difficult to open. Could use a sturdier stand but overall fine for my purpose. 
10660 The gentleman who received this as a gift is quite happy! 
10661 The product arrived before schedule without any damages. Very impressed. 
10662 Excellent tripod. Recording self-tapes has been so much easier with this. It has different levels and tons of different adjustments for any type of project you may do. 
10663 One of the lenses was messed up and not clear, and the clip had chips in it. Disappointed 
10664 I searched for the perfect strap. It is stylish, soft and durable. I love it. 
10665 Good replacement battery 
10666 Well made, no complaints here 
10667 Works great, sturdy with no problems. 
10668 Great value box. 
10669 thank you 
10670 Fit my camera perfect, and price was awesome. 
10671 No problems launching from grass now! 
10672 These work great for any screen. Gets it really clean. I normally use with my iPad & iPhone and have no complaints. Would repurchase. 
10673 works great on 1080 setting. what a cool camera. super easy to use. 
10674 Nice case. Fits in my pocket book. Has extra pockets for SD cards. 
10675 Wow! This is a great camera for my 10 year old daughter. She absolutely loves this camera and has the very best time capturing her own memories with it. 
10676 Nice little scanner for your old paper snapshots. The feed-through design and on-board storage make it easy to handle a large number of photos rapidly. It s a really good solution for those simply wanting to create a digital photo album. 
10677 Worked for about an hour, red light came on and that s it. Wouldn t reset, just a red &#34;I m dead&#34; light. 
10678 as expected nice case 
10679 A must have for extra batteries to keep at the ready. 
10680 The digital art was great. Nice and clear and good sorted in to easy to find and use groups. I have made several scrapbook pages for my self. 
10681 Do not buy this camera. It failed me after two weeks of use! The lens mechanism stopped working and no longer extends out. You are better off using your mobile phone camera! 
10682 god value 
10683 Best camera I ve ever had. I took pictures of the Pope in Rome and you would have thought I was standing next to him when I was way far away 
10684 I am very pleased with this lens...a good inbetween....got it before I needed it for wedding pictures....shipped as soon as she could.... 
10685 Cheap/inexpensive, but good. It s a small part so it doesn t have to be name brand. No one can notice that it isn t Canon. Fits and feels like stock. 
10686 Quality seems nice. Works as it should. Fits great. A great purchase! 
10687 THe zoom is not great, and I have had issues with pictures appearing pixculated. I am very aggravated with this camera. 
10688 Battery life doesn t seem to have alot of juice. The stock battery i received with my phantom 2 seems to last me longer! i dont think its what its advertised to be regarding longer battery life! 
10689 I recommend this product. I love it. Vary accessible. Not heavy. Light and easy to the hand. 
10690 Great battery and dual charger combination for the price. So far, the batteries have been decent on run times, and the dual charger makes charging much faster than the single unit that came with the camera. 
10691 Generally good product and easy to set up and configure. Main problem was that the unit I got was returned by another purchaser and the seller did not erase previous phone numbers from the memory, so alarms kept calling him! 
10692 wow! 
10693 pretty good price vs quality 
10694 WORKS GREAT. 
10695 Very good device for a beginner. Reasonably priced that will not hurt your budget. Lighting stand could be heavier or just use a sand bag. (Ankle weights could also work.) 
10696 It s Not sharp 
10697 I use this quite often, works well especially for the price.... 
10698 Camera is great but software that comes with it does not work. Took me several hours to get it to work 
10699 This is one of the best dash cams out there. This dash cam was easy to setup and get it running. Everything is working fine. I bought an extra one for my sister. 
10700 not at all what I thought it was. Returned 
10701 Received two different styles, one style was durable and easy to attach directions to for a wedding reception, the other one was like a cardboard box. Still waiting to see if pictures turned out. Fingers crossed! 
10702 It is working great for the long action shoots at the sporting events that I am coving 
10703 Cheap, but maybe deters the homeless. 
10704 This is the coolest tool a photographer could use. Great for long exposures and selfies 😁 
10705 Works perfectly. Good spare battery when you re doing lots of photos or video. 
10706 Device works fine, I just couldn t make the USB attachment work... 
10707 My grandaughter just loves this camera,she is six and can use this.thanks. 
10708 Works well. 
10709 Quick Delivery and came as stated!! 
10710 Good bunch of stuff for the gopro! Good quality 
10711 İt s worked well with Lumix FZ1000. 
10712 Nice bag Bought this for my new Canon DSL with extra lens. Has room for extra batteries, battery charger, manual. Includes shoulder strap and has good padding and divider to keep equipment from getting banged up. Good quality and great price. 
10713 Perfect fit for Sony Rx100 III. I have mine with screen protector + sony grip and it fits perfect. I also add 1 spare battery on the very bottom, the lid still closes but not 100%, more like 80%. 
10714 Works great. Very happy with it. I love the zoom function 
10715 hard to operate. 
10716 Great deal! I went to buy a second set and they were already out of stock. 
10717 Order arrived in time, works well with my Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS STM Lens, have not ran into issues. 
10718 Great buy! 
10719 nice camera but make sure to buy the micro SD card. no internal memory 
10720 Fast shipping works great for my cool pixels camera. 
10721 Reliable.... 
10722 fast shipping. works fine for my d7000 battery 
10723 amazing 
10724 Bought this for my small DSLR. It s much much smaller than I thought it would be. It s works fine for small cameras but if you have any type of DSLR, this absolutely will not work for you. 
10725 It fits and it s OEM. 
10726 I love this camera. It is easy to use the battery holds the charge for a long time. It fits in my pocket. I have purchased two cameras since but always go back to this one. 
10727 It s a battery. It works. 
10728 Just the right case for my newly purchased camera. Very handy and very compact... 
10729 Want to return but cannot and it does not work 
10730 Arrived broken. They insisted I watch their video on proper way to use. I ve been using these for 30 years. Broken is broken. Very, very low quality product. Not one you can count on. 
10731 Item arrived quickly and as described. So far so good is a great second battery! 
10732 Very well build, be aware that it does not hold the Gopro with the Wasabi extended battery. 
10733 Neither my wife or I found it comfortable and it made reaching the shutter release to cumbersome. We don t use it at all. 
10734 Not made well, very cheap looking. Got what I paid for. 
10735 Does the job. Comfortable yet slips from time to time. 
10736 the tow arms too short, the V-grove is too narrow, there is no way you can hang monitor and light and mike at the same time! 
10737 Brand new and fast shipping. 
10738 Received right one time like promised 
10739 Excellent choice. 
10740 It was a great purchase can t fault it superb really pleased 
10741 Really enjoying my first prime lens. Great value. A little disappointed that it arrived a day late. Thankfully, I wasn t leaving for my trip until the following day! 
10742 Great 
10743 Great 
10744 Really easy to use when you get water temp right great product 
10745 Gets the job done just fine. Anyone knows if i can use this adaptor with RZ67 lens? Or the RZ67 adaptor with RB67 lens? 
10746 great product keeps my go pro safe and secure with a great peace of mind .very pleased Thanks!! 
10747 good price and product. 
10748 It is awesome!!! 
10749 Nice collection of accessories but low quality of course! 
10750 Perfect, great quality at a rock bottom price! The customer service was Awesome too. 
10751 yes. Exact color of the photo. Nice quality as usual. 
10752 An excellent pouch to hold filters. Instead of 4 plastic filter holders you can condense them into one convenient holder. 
10753 Great 
10754 Deeper than what I needed, but this is a very good product. 
10755 Fits Sony RX-100 ii perfectly. 
10756 Works just like the orignal 
10757 Keeps my Nikon Coolpix floating and handy. It s great for the pool and getting those family shots. 
10758 This is a great little product for the price. Certainly worth the price. 
10759 smaller than I thought and it doesn t hold a lot. I have put the camera in a bigger bag and use this a protective case. 
10760 It s a great camera for the price hands down. Only down side is that it ll record only 10-12 min videos.... 
10761 Great cleaning tool for under $10 
10762 Poor! It doesn t value the money that I have paid. The head of tripod doesn t screw the Gopro. 
10763 Super Clear! 
10764 Fine product. Works as intended 
10765 These cameras are very buggy as they stop working all the time and have to unplug them the ptz doesn t as promised 
10766 It covers the flash connection. Enough said. 
10767 excellent. 
10768 Needed a lens cap with the leash so won t lose it and so far no lose! 
10769 Have had this bag for about a week, really like it. I have my Nikon D4 with my 80-400mm, 70-200mm, 27-70mm and my 14-24mm in this bag and it fits perfect. 
10770 For a GoPro with accessories this case is not near big enough. 
10771 This was a gift and My friend fell in love with the camera. 
10772 I threw it away :-( 
10773 Works seamlessly between my D610 and my iPhone 6+. Refurbished saved me money and shipping was fast and free! 
10774 Pretty good set for a good price. This set covers it all for beginners 
10775 It does what it say, and it awesome that its directional. The Gopro mount can actually pop out of the housing pretty easily. My buddy wiped out wake boarding and the gopro popped off. If you re going to use this for water sports MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A FLOAT! 
10776 Great battery for D750. Factory replacement. 
10777 love it small and compact ,just the right size for me and keeps my go pro safe. Thanks!! 
10778 Works as expected but needs a ball mount. Ordered ball mount today. 
10779 The price is certainly right! Just don t forget to turn them off when you re done. 
10780 Flimsy, but it gets the job done. 
10781 Awesome 
10782 works as needed 
10783 very good! 
10784 The charger was the wrong one for the batteries, so I didn t have a camera for my trip BOO 
10785 They re fine with me, no worries. 
10786 Received fast, great product!! Got this camera for my garage because I once received a notification that the garage door was open with no way to verify with absolute certainty. This camera works flawlessly and was very easy to setup and get running. It s wireless. Love it!! 
10787 Easy setup. 
10788 Works great! I am happy to have gotten this as I lost my charger! 
10789 Everything came just as expected. 
10790 Met my standards. Fast shipping 
10791 I have not used this product under water yet. I did take a couple of pictures with it and they were great. I purchased this camera for a trip to the Bahamas in January. I hope it takes great pictures and I hope it doesn t leak! 
10792 Love how this is built & would buy a 2nd one if I need it. 
10793 Nice leather strap. I wish it was 4&#34; longer, I m a big guy. works OK though. comes with everything you need to attach and protect the camera finish 
10794 The base is ok, but the little ball head is really flimsy/junky. I m using it to hold a small LED lite array, so I just superglued the ball in-place and am using the LED device s mount for movement. 
10795 lost the first charger a good replacement for sure. 
10796 Great battery ato a great price 
10797 Love at first sight. This is an amazing case and I knew I had to get this. 
10798 I got this for my Coolpix 500 camera and it works great! Also, delivery was very quick. I will order thru this site in the future. Thank You 
10799 very good but too expensive. $129..9 was a perfect price for it. 
10800 Great Product/Great Value. 
10801 very good quality, big upgrade in terms of design from the previous. 
10802 Excellent 
10803 Did not work for me, I am using a channel master +,dvr for tell me how to connect it. Help 
10804 Reasonable and so needed for this camera! 
10805 This is a great bargain for the money. Half of these things exceed the price alone and the quality is just as good. 
10806 Fast delivery, excellent brand 
10807 Works good smooth rotation, no distortion except at max 
10808 Easy and fun to use 
10809 Easy installation, works right away. I can now view remotely from my phone or desktop. 
10810 I think it s such a rip off that this item isn t included in the Vello light bouncer. It works well but, doesn t warrant the price. It should be included in the light bouncer. 
10811 Extremely good, my camera has been dropped, and it hasn t broken. 
10812 I thought this selfie stick was remotely control but they are not. 
10813 impressed! This was easily able to support my micro 4/3 panasonic gx 7 with the 9-18mm 4-5.6. Upright position only though! 
10814 Wonderful 
10815 This quick release clamp is used on my Jobu junior gimbal head. I just remove the gimbal arm and install the clamp to give me a side mounted head 
10816 works very well 
10817 excellent image quality 
10818 The threads of the screw that attach the plate to the camera all mess up. Thus, unable to use. Other than that, it s ok. 
10819 Great camera !! 
10820 Very bad item, used it one time and broke. 
10821 Can never have too much extra film on hand 
10822 Very nice product. If it weighed a little more, it would be an excellent product. But I m using it for a Note 4 phone, which is heavier than the GoPro. I Recommend it for it s intended purpose. 
10823 works great 
10824 Up to now, battery works correctly. 
10825 This full package was well thought and has all the items needed for a good photo service. The product was delivered on time with all the items as described on Amazon site 
10826 Great case and great price 
10827 Excellent and they came earlier than expected. Thank you. 
10828 Thank You! 
10829 Everything appears to be good quality products however some documentation would be nice. There was nothing at all and since there are a lot of individual parts I m really not sure what everything is for and how it fits together. 
10830 batteries worked fine, arrived promptly, and the charger, not available from the store where I bought the camera, is a nice bonus 
10831 It did not work for what it was supposed to work for, which was the sanza Clip 
10832 Good product but not the best quality, the head strap was loose which I cant fix my camera on. 
10833 Horrible does not work I would like my money back please ! 
10834 have it on my fishing rod. love it 
10835 Fantastic lens 
10836 Nothing but problems from this thing. From freezing to not coming on at all. Doesn t even record you whole drive. Only records when it feels &#34;vibrations&#34;... Well the sensor must be poopoo! Do yourself a favor and stay away 
10837 best camera !!! 
10838 Really nice package of converter rings. Decent quality for the money. Would buy again... 
10839 Works great, no problems 
10840 BETTER then expected excellent photos and long length movies taken with great clarity. ONLY option we would like to see id a snap on red lens filter, this would bring out the best of this product. 
10841 Solid lens for the price, hunts a little and motor noise can be heard during video sequences but and all around keeper 
10842 To easy to OPEN, slight knock and it flips up 
10843 It wasn t strong enough for my use. 
10844 The product didn t even reach me. 
10845 Works the same as the original charger, but I like this one more as it comes with a car DC plug to charge while on the road! 
10846 Bought for my brother and he loves it and uses it when he skateboards and bikes at skateparks. 
10847 By far my favorite and definitely most versatile gopro mount Can literally mount this to anything! 
10848 nice soft ring just what I wanted 
10849 I used this with a one channel dvr in the car, and it works great 
10850 This backpack is amazing! I love it. I switched from a Canon over the shoulder case to this, and I am absolutely thrilled with the decision. It was long overdue. 
10851 Products are awesome, great quality, fast Shipping, unfortunately I had 2 missing lens at the time that the box arrived but other than that. Great Products. 
10852 Performs as the original Nikon QR foot does. Quick to put and take off. I like the rubber coated tightening knobbed compared to Nikon s. Great value compared to Nikon OEM, 4X less cost! Only time will reveal whether it is as robust as the Nikon. 
10853 Great camera system easy to install 
10854 Love it. 
10855 A very cost effective alternative to the official GoPro version 
10856 very sturdy, easy to install. Little pricey on the import duties. 
10857 The battery lasted 6 weeks in a device designed to run for 5 years before replacing the battery. A bad product! 
10858 I can t believe all of the good quality gear you get for such a low price. Everything works great and makes the Gopro so much more versatile. Definitely a great buy. 
10859 For the price this is a good tripod. It may need to be oiled if you want to turn it easily for panning shots. 
10860 Bought this to add two more cameras to security system. Works good 
10861 great product works great 
10862 Very good 
10863 Great clip! 
10864 No battery cover useless as is 
10865 The battery works beautifully. No complaints. 
10866 I received a completely different camera than what is shown in the pictures 
10867 This item clearly shows a 2nd part in the bike handle bar mount position photo. The description and images are misleading. 
10868 Perfect lens. 
10869 The first day we used this product on set, 2 of three screws holding &#34;Sticks&#34; together came loose and we had to use gaffers tape to hold it together. I went to hardware store and replaced screws and it still falls apart. Do Not waste your time with this product! 
10870 Worked as expected! Only draw back: No instructions for cage assembly! 
10871 I like it and would buy it again. 
10872 Great base for my Benro Transfunctional tripod. Now I can convert my tripod s removable leg into a monopod. 
10873 an accessory for every type of activity 
10874 Good, inexpensive after-market replacement. 
10875 Great Product, Just as Described!!! 
10876 Item arrived as described. Quick ship. Highly recommend!! 
10877 Love love love! Set up is easy. No cables. Totally wireless 
10878 Great action camera for a cheaper price. Thumbs up.👍 
10879 I was hoping to be able to have some sort of focus option and be able to zoom. There aren t many times this camera will be very useful. 
10880 Works fine. 
10881 Outstanding underwater camera holder. I used it while diving and it was everything that the manufacturer claims it to be. Worked like a charm. 
10882 Typical excellent Canon quality. This has been a great addition to my collection. 
10883 I&#34;ll recommend to anyone buy this product 
10884 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
10885 We love it, but would be nice if it could move around the room by using an option. but it is great 
10886 Love it. thanks red giant. 
10887 Great case, flexible inside pocket is adjustable, heavily padded yet lightweight. 
10888 Very good and chsrges fast 
10889 It works 
10890 They arrived fast and work perfect!! 
10891 Works great. 
10892 Love them great clairity for a resanable price 
10893 Best one 
10894 This is a great monitor with a clear picture and very good quality. If you have a high end security system then you need a good clear monitor to go with it. Old monitors can change the quality of your picture coming from the security cameras through your DVR. 
10895 The package was a gift, so it s not fair that I rate it. I can say that everything that was included in the offer arrived on time and was in brand new condition. The person receiving the gift was very excited and continues to enjoy using it. 
10896 Very cheaply made, not intuitive at all. But the real reason for the one star is that after two months it stop working, now all the pictures look almost white, impossible to distinguish anything. 
10897 Awesome inexpensive light ring, the only con is that you can t use full range of your wide angle or wide angle zoom lens because the ring will crop the borders of the image. 
10898 i love this camera. it is replaces an older model from 10 years ago. easy to handle. takes great pictures. the accessories are an extra bonus which avoid having to purchase them separately. canon products are very durable. 
10899 Wasn t quite what I thought I ordered 
10900 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
10901 It s a good camera when it works, but sometimes we have had to call for tech support. However, they have been very helpful. 
10902 decent arch support for my feet. I wear them all the time. Like the style and looks, have held up well so far. 
10903 Thing works like it s designed but the lens cover (rounded piece) doesn t fit the lens hood so it s really stupid. I had another issue where the ring got stuck to my lens and had to get some tools to take it off. 
10904 It s cute and very convenient. 
10905 Thanks, it s perfect, very reasonable price too. 
10906 It is ok, although I had big troubles using AAA batteries it is really annoying because they don´t fit perfectly. 
10907 Had to return as it would pair with my Blackberry Z10 but seemed to interrupt other functions on my phone and too hard to figure out for me - didn t have time to waste to figure it out. Time to change to another phone probably... 
10908 I love everything about this camera, I upgraded from a T3i. Great kit lens very pleased. 
10909 Great Product 
10910 Absolutely great buy!!! Love having my charging dock and the extra batteries so I can just switch them out quickly! Batteries work just as good as the ones that came with the camera 
10911 I love this film sheets! They are the perfect size to keep on my wallet. I ordered the 20 film sheets and they arrived in 2 days!!!!! I was really surprised! Im definitely going to buy more!! 
10912 tried off brand before - it didn t work. Only the Fuji brand seems to work as replacement 
10913 Was not disappointed. 
10914 BOUGHT IT FOR GRANDDAUGHTERS BIRTHDAY, SHE ABSOLYELY LOVES IT! HER PICTURES ARE AWESOME. 
10915 Solid case for new Phantom. Backpack is deep enough to fit everything securely. Enough cutouts and pockets to fit all my gear. 
10916 Price on these are great. I ll update later if they don t last as long as expected. 
10917 Works like a charm. 
10918 Not made to accept the qd 1.5 loops......the sling is a closed unit.........you can not add them on 
10919 Product does not work. I sent it back. 
10920 OK 
10921 great little camera! 
10922 The camera looks *generally* as advertised. However, the &#34;30 LEDs&#34; is false advertisement. Inserting batteries causes a single red LED to light up, and even then it only blinks. In no way does it look like faux IR. I would not purchase this again. 
10923 easy to add working great 
10924 It s a great kit for your gopro heros 
10925 Everything fits and works as it should :) A bunch of extra unnecessary things are included in order to increase the appeal but It beats paying for the original GoPro pieces and they work just as well! 
10926 It does the job of a lens protector without sacrificing image quality at a great price. 
10927 these work great - will be buying additional items for other cameras and similar items with straps 
10928 Good Camera... Great Picture... Easy Operation From both PC and Android (Apple ????? not my way).. Note: camera ID is in Low Case... NOT Upper Case as shown in the instruction. 
10929 This kit was exacty what I needed and I am very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this company and this product. 
10930 It lasts for hours, which is great since the batteries that I had did not last much. 
10931 Excellent product, it is rescue my waterproof camera is alive again. 
10932 Fast shipping and quality product. 
10933 If you are an actor in this day and age you are likely taping your own auditions. This is the best deal on the internet. You don t have to be a lighting or grip guy to figure this stuff out. Get this product asap. 
10934 Good as expected 
10935 Bought it from PoEDepot and got an American UL listed version. Will buy again! 
10936 amazing 
10937 Great filter, using it on my 50mm and 24mm Canon lenses to take some excellent long exposure photography. 
10938 I haven t used my camcorder in years because the battery wouldn t hold a charge. At a discounted price I can now capture the first s of my toddler. 
10939 I have installed it in a tennis complex. Absolutely worth every penny. For the price you cannot get better. The quality of the images are top notch plus i got a 500gb Hard disk with it. 
10940 Very helpful 
10941 Yup it pops on the front of my lens and does whatever a tulip lens hood is supposed to do. I dunno all the pros have them so I figured I should too. Gives me some street cred and that it worth every penny. 
10942 Not much more to say, functioned exactly as described. Build quality seems solid and has no trouble rotating the weight of my Canon SL1 
10943 Easy to install and the quality of the video is decent. Although the apps do crash frequently. 
10944 My son told me this one was the best one to get. I take a lot of pictures for my online store and it works great. I been using it daily. 
10945 Arrived on time and as shown, used only to do a few splash shots. 
10946 Great for the price. Definitely worth having in my bag to trigger a small flash. I found that it caught the light pretty easily within a relatively close distance. 
10947 The first time I use camera, I try to install, I personally think it s very good 
10948 It looks fake. I did find these at Best Buy cheaper. 
10949 A++ 
10950 Just used it for ziplining 
10951 The kits gives you everything you need to keep your camera clean. 
10952 I have used everything that came in this pack. I wouldn t encourage the selfie stick as there are much better options (like the GoPole). However, this whole package is incredibly useful and anything in this is worth the cost. 
10953 Great Thank you 
10954 Good deal and quality ,love will order more 
10955 Fits well, does what it s supposed to do 
10956 Pic nice and clear and easy to use-straight out the box with two cords done. I just wish it didn t lean no way to adjust 
10957 Item delivered on time, was as described 
10958 It s handy having an extra battery around! It keeps its charge very well. 
10959 Great buy! 
10960 Good 
10961 Very comfortable to use and keep my hands free. Hand are not getting tired on caring gear and shoulder doesn t hurt. 
10962 compact and great 
10963 This does not fit the go pro 3 housing. The black frame alining is different from this LED housing. Simply put it doesn t fit 
10964 Quality stuff right here !! Well worth the asking price for everything you get !!! I loved mine !! 
10965 Albert Ferman was the tech who helped us set up the camera. He was very helpful and explained all my questions clearly and showed us all the functions.. Very patient and courteous on phone as well. Happy with the product. 
10966 Perfect combo for a small price. 
10967 Spend the extra money and get the brackets that are made out of metal, these are plastic and I had a brand new strobe hit the floor because of them. They just don t tighten down enough on the flash shoe to keep it from moving and sliding. 
10968 the batteries do not hold a charge 
10969 Charged once I received them went to used them a month later they did not hold a charge 
10970 Very good quality. Works just as expected and has a large amount of adjustment 
10971 Fit perfectly! Thanks!! 
10972 Great 
10973 Minimal distortion, this thing has become my favorite lens for walk around, and landscapes. Totally worth every penny. 
10974 Henry was a great tech. Got me up and running in no time. Works great. 
10975 I got this for my girlfriends camera and she loves it. She lost her lens cap, so she uses this to keep the dust off on a constant basis. Its been about two months and the cleaner hasn t broken down and the brush hasn t lost any bristles. 
10976 Bought this lens kit for my daughter and she loves it! 
10977 Wonderful product. 
10978 Good product for the money. Display software needs work. You cannott zoom or clip areas for motion detection. You cannot delere individual pictures. You must reformat the whole memory stick. Good quality video,say or night. 
10979 GoPro adaptor for aux mic. I have a ton of these. All good. 
10980 I use it for carrying tripods and lights for filming. 
10981 Seem to work fine. 
10982 Don t buy the dome port without this. In fact, KNEKT should not sell them separately - makes no sense. The cover fits perfectly and is 100% essential. 
10983 saved my bacon on a recent install 
10984 Great case..like it a lot holds everything well..if you use the blade guards it is a very tight fit to get the arms in with the attachment at the end of the arms..over all it s a good back pack case.. 
10985 No problems so far....good value. 
10986 great. 
10987 Looks awesome and feels great especially when I put the larger lenses on. 
10988 Great buy. Fits my sony video camera perfectly 
10989 I was reluctant at first because of the price, you get what you pay for. But it is better than expected. 
10990 Canopy sent me a download that was illegible. I requested one in print someone could read. As of this date they have refused to send a legible copy, so I am cancelling the plan. 
10991 It s a little heavy and I have a difficult time using to take clear pictures of my moving kids. but overall it is a great telephoto. the rest of the package is just a bonus. 
10992 Great mount for the Xiaomi! 
10993 fast shipping and i love this camera so far the battery life lasts pretty long and i love all the features it has :) 
10994 Very easy to set up, very good for the price 
10995 Great Lens for the price - no noise in the corners - for an inexpensive wide angle it s impressive... 
10996 Product works great! I broke the one that came with my camera, and this was a good match! Great price and it turned my frown upside down. 
10997 For the price and what this does! Get 1 of these and they transmit to each other Talks to other receivers also, Get it. Brands don t matter when it comes to flashes. 
10998 great product 
10999 Very good bundle 
11000 Fast delivery very happy 
11001 Camera is well built and takes excellent photos and videos. Not user friendly to transfer photos. Pain in the neck for this part. 
11002 There were no instructions included and we never could get it to focus correctly. Maybe it s just our incompetence, but it is sitting on a shelf. Thank you for your interest. 
11003 Good new for Sony a3000 with high speed sync 1/4000s on camera shoe with neewer NW-985C E-TTL. It just flash...no zoom or communication with camera..it can not shoot high speed sync on sony a7r. Why? Funy for Sony with build the same universal hot shoe. 
11004 Camera is compact and great for filming. 
11005 way better performance with low light resolution or zoom focus than similar NKon - good to have a grip too 
11006 Worked perfect for our white water rafting trip! 
11007 Bought it to fit 2 - 21.5&#34; iMacs. They fit great! I tried to fit a third and it barely didn t fit. Great case though! 
11008 For the price you get more than I expected. I thought it would be cheap quality but it works well, video quality is very good and have not had any problems at all 
11009 As advertised ! 
11010 Good capacity. 
11011 Works great. Using it on two different Sony A65 lenses. 
11012 Great price and lots of great GoPro gear! 
11013 perfect fit 
11014 very good 👍 
11015 Item was as described and the actual product was in new condition. But the actual package it was is had been opened. You could clearly see the original tapping had been teared on all sides. Luckily the product works fine. 
11016 Very sturdy case. 
11017 Good quality cable and the extra adapters a great plus 
11018 Love the extended tightening screw. Works great. 
11019 This was a good purchase. 
11020 Good performance; good price point 
11021 Great little camera. 
11022 Just as described-very nice. 
11023 Great product, just v wish it had mini USB instead of micro USB. Other than that it s a winner. 
11024 Exactly what I needed 
11025 Works wonderful 
11026 Canon has a 1 year warranty that they have honored for me numerous times. I buy Nikon now. Either way, you don t really need this. 
11027 nice cheap alternative to big dollar GOPRO mount does what it is supposed to do 
11028 The product is of good quality and works as described. 
11029 works well 
11030 Worked as expected 
11031 Very good overall, just the battery life is poor.should use AA battery 
11032 They are a piece of s*** they re no good I m sorry to say that 
11033 Super mirrorless camera. 
11034 Great kit, very nice quality. 
11035 Have not used the ballhead extensively so far, but everything seems fine so far. Appears sturdy and supports my camera very well. 
11036 Great camera for the money, no complaints so far 
11037 Very cool camera. I ve had a lot of fun playing around with it. It takes great video and the sound works well even with the case on. Here is a neat trout video: &#60;iframe width=&#34;560&#34; height=&#34;315&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2oxFU3u1uU&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen&#62;&#60;/iframe&#62; 
11038 Perfect entry level SLR 
11039 Took about three weeks to get it... They re pretty thin packs. 
11040 This product works as expected and is well built. 
11041 The one I purchased from an another store but it was a GoPro Suction Cup Mount non the less. The camera would shack and not allow for smooth filming. 
11042 Absolute Junk. Could not get this camera to be recognized by the dlink software. Followed all instructions, tried both WPS and wired methods, tried both a desktop and a laptop. 
11043 Can t even tell it s a refurb! Auto focus works on my d3000 & 5100! I have no complaint! I am happy with the price and the product! I plan to order this for my assistant to use. 
11044 Very good quality. Was impressed until i saw a big dot on my recorded videos. It is stuck inside the lense and not outside the lense. We ll see when i get my replacement item. 
11045 A real piece of junk, a waste of good money. Used it twice and the small metal connectors at the bottom that make contact with the battery broke, it s real garbage! 
11046 Can t find anything to complain about. Brush hairs are soft and does not fall out. Brush retracts into unit to make it compact and cover prevents hair from getting dirty. What else can one ask for? 
11047 It s worth what I paid for it. 
11048 Thank You 
11049 Nice! 
11050 Mine came broken I can t even use it because the metal part of the strap is broken 
11051 works like a battery should work 
11052 I give this to all my clients. 
11053 This is a great product!! I paid for mine $85.00 with free shipping, received it within 1 week of order. Picture quality is great, and really simple installation. I love the 2 in 1 screen. With this product in an accident or driving complaint, I am covered. Highly recommended!! 
11054 This was an excellent camera until it sat for a while. Now it will not charge from the battery. I called a shop and they said they can t get parts from Kodak and not to buy any more Kodaks. $500 camera down the drain! 
11055 Very good product 
11056 Great 
11057 Works great, fits around my NX3000 (without the detachable flash). Should be enough to protect my camera while traveling around Europe. 
11058 Batteries and charger both worked great. Batteries worked good in my Nikon Coolpix S3700. 
11059 Very Nice 
11060 I love this little guy. I use a ton of tripods and this little guy fits anywhere. Great price and awesome features with the remote. I totally recommend. I received this for review at no cost. Opinion is 100% mine. 
11061 What a great case! Very sturdy and holds everything you need to have a great day at the beach or anywhere else. 
11062 Nice 
11063 Great experience & great shipping 
11064 This float works wonderfully. 
11065 I like for those time when needed and for my go pro session convenient and yet secure. Thanks!! 
11066 This is so wonderful for long distance families, its great for grandparents. 
11067 Great batteries! Excellent value! Will buy again! 
11068 Works as needed! Good product 
11069 Perfect case for the GoPro! I use it for my GoPro Hero+ LCD, and it fits the camera plus all of the necessary accessories perfectly. It s sturdy and also small enough to fit inside my backpack. Overall, great case! 
11070 does just what its supposed to do 
11071 Great Product 
11072 Works like the original. 
11073 First one I ordered was D.O.A. but the company has a good return policy. I got a full refund. Decided to give it another try. New camera pen works great! 
11074 good product 
11075 Works well on my diatone 250 quad. Bigger board than the other FPV cameras I ve had so I didn t even need to zip tie it. It just fits perfectly! 
11076 It works perfect and i m on horseback with a lot of movement. 
11077 Small bag. Not enough to accessories. 
11078 Fits my canon! 
11079 I have never taken better portraits. It seems to make skin look smooth and perfect. Although, a baby s skin is pretty much perfect. Great little camera. 
11080 Excellent , dose everything it advertises 
11081 I bought it help with a special needs child. 
11082 Thank you 
11083 Excellent one 
11084 Bought as a gift for my father. It uses motion detectors to turn itself on, which is very creepy and disturbing at night. But the display is beautiful. 
11085 Love it ... using it for my elderly mother in a mother in law suite! 
11086 Just what was needed for the project; wide angle and fast lens. 
11087 Gift for dad. He loved it 
11088 Very portable and good viewing. The tripod is a bit flimsy but I guess Ok for the price, hence 4 stars 
11089 Broke at application. 
11090 I think bean bag filler works best with a mixture of these beads for light weight and heavier material like sunflower seeds. 
11091 Why buy just the lens when you receive so much more for the same price? 
11092 It was good but not what I want it but it s really good came a week early 
11093 great for travel; used on a safari and it was no burden to carry along 
11094 this didn t work for me or my Nikon d5300. Of course I didn t try it right away so, I am beyond the 30 day return period. Charger indicates a full charge but when I put it in the camera, it is not charged. 
11095 Great reponse time, arrived in New Zealand 
11096 It has a pretty long life and it flies easily! 
11097 Very difficult to get to work right. 
11098 Great for underwater Video. With the monopod the fish are not afraid of the camera. You can get great shots. Love the way the pod extends. Flip up the lever and extend the pod. 
11099 Awesome and great for filming!!!! 
11100 Exactly What I Wanted. It s GREAT ! 
11101 Thought it was rubber material. It s actually plastic. I m assuming it ll still float okay. 
11102 But keep misplacing damn things. 
11103 works great at first and then it started making this weird beep sound now it doesnt work 
11104 Great Camera case. 
11105 light and easy to pack. good 
11106 Nice wireless camera. Setup was easy and the smartphone app is pretty good 
11107 Magnificent! 
11108 Very satisfied with purchase, 
11109 VERY GOOD LAST LONGER. I RECOMENDED 
11110 Nice kit. 
11111 You need to hunt down required accesories and build this one yourself to get it to work - of you can find the right parts outside of London 
11112 I thought it would take 2 of them to float my Nikon AW130 but 1 does the job with capacity to spare! 
11113 Not Canon Brand, but it does the job nicely. 
11114 Loved it and arrived on time. Easy to use and upload photos. 
11115 Great product. Like, it s a good buy. I would buy it again. 
11116 AC adapter died a few weeks after the warranty expired but besides that; its a great camera. 
11117 Good camera for the money. The box is sturdy (industrial) and the design is simple. My only complaint is the shipping time... almost 3 weeks seems a little long. 
11118 This is decent for the price however, it burns through batteries like crazy! 
11119 Holds everything for my Hero 3+ perfectly. No longer need to go hunting around for anything. 
11120 They work great 
11121 Buy the right size bag, put my equipment is very good, prices are affordable. 
11122 Great charger, charges better than the Sony charger. 
11123 this had everything I needed for dslr cleaning - works great - would recommend 
11124 Works like a charm, and that is all that matters. You cant complain about the price either. 
11125 Does the job and can t beat the price. 
11126 Perfect love them 
11127 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
11128 We use this backdrop to take pictures of the dogs and cats at the animal shelter that I volunteer for. It is a volunteer favorite. We do put a white bead board on the ground for the floor instead of the wood. 
11129 I still dont get what it does, it does not fit in my GoPro Hero 4 Silver, but its a cool keychain and bottle opener

11131 [[ASIN:B00JAJ9U8K Vimtag (Fujikam) 361 HD, IP/Network ,Wireless, Video Monitoring, Surveillance, security camera,plug/play, Pan/Tilt with Two-Way Audio and Night Vision]] Honestly…….. one of the easiest items I have ever setup. Very clear step by step directions in package. Pretty much plug and play. Love it! 
11132 Great bag. Can cary everything that I want with room to spare. 
11133 works great innovative design 
11134 crash pack is essential 
11135 Cheap plastic, never worked as intended. Can hold two batteries but only pulls from one at a time. 
11136 LVR is fine for my hero 4, but cannot charge while your recording with case, I prefer the non lcd vesion 
11137 Vincent was awesome technical support! Highly recommend this product over the more costly options (home security systems, etc.)! 
11138 IT took OK pictures then died after 2 days. The camera would power up but crash when taking a photo. 
11139 I was so excited when I got this cables. After 2 week of used the connection that screws into the camera broke. I am very disappointed.. please do yourself a favor and don t spend your hard working money on this crappy cables. 
11140 I received the camera and the only way to charge it is thru the camera. Also 1 battery was bad out of the 3 
11141 I have used this product for over twenty years and are perfect for security lighting systems that can be controlled from anywhere in the house, with an X-10 control unit. 
11142 A great camera. Feels like a real camera in the hands. The only reason why I didn t give it five stars is because of the problem endemic to all digitals, the lag time on the shutter. 
11143 This is an excellent kit for the price. I bought it mainly for two spare batteries. Batteries always seem to &#34;go dead&#34; when you least expect it. Can t beat this deal. 
11144 This cameras are just poorly made. Either they reset, send me an email every minute or I cannot connect to them. Nothing but headaches. Thank god I only bought two. Don t waste your money on these. 
11145 Fast delivery as usual and it is just what I wanted for my New Nikon, Thank you very much & I will be sure to use you in the future. 
11146 It is a great product for cleaning glasses. 
11147 Great travel tripod could not believe how small it folds up to.Very strong for being so light. Highly recommended 
11148 this is a gift, looks like it will work perfectly - it would be nice to have an instruction booklet 
11149 They send me defect one...I will never buy this again 
11150 Was very easy to set up (especially for a new photographer) but the box was missing one of the backdrops and only had one umbrella and NO RETURNS by the time I got back in town to realize it was missing pieces from the package. 
11151 excellent product. 
11152 No comments 
11153 Good watch for the value! Would buy again! 
11154 Replacement batteries for my camera, work great, thanks. 
11155 The sound quality blows my mind 
11156 Works very well & the price is great as well 
11157 Good 
11158 Great. Hate the viewfinder. 
11159 First time using this flash on my Nikon D3200 the flash was stuck on the hot shoe. Small ball bearing on bottom of flash would not retract all the way so it would not release the flash. Had to bring it in to have it removed. Poor quality. 
11160 This product is exactly what I needed. I ve been shoot for over half a century and finally decided that I was going to have some fun creating my scenes. This product was shipped immediately and appears to be a great quality for the price. 
11161 Yes they work, but the adhesive is horrible and does not stick. Ended up having to use 3M double sided tape to attach one mount to my daughters helmet. 
11162 Product is well built and study. Light weight and very versatile, and the carry bag is perfect. 
11163 exactly as described.. 
11164 Works well, doubles as an iphone and a GoPro stick. 
11165 Love this one! 
11166 This item was perfect for my iPhone 
11167 Great batteries at a fraction of the cost of originals....Work great and hold a charge! 
11168 very good and fast service would order again 
11169 Works well, and glad to have a protective filter on my Panasonic DMC-LX7. But, really, Panasonic should have just made the lens barrel filter ready, rather than compelling one to buy another item... 
11170 A neat item but was defective screws were never installed properly. 
11171 Good & it is my need. Thanks! 
11172 I am about to buy a few more of these... Just what I needed for my Sigma 50-500 OS. The QR plate that came with my Airhed ballhead was just not cutting it. For under $10, this thing is solid! 
11173 This camera is okay for a basic camera and for the price. Day shots are good, night not so good. Poor quality build. It s good for travel. 
11174 Darkhorse accommodated by request for special shipping so I could get these albums by my wedding day. We used them as our guest book and they were great! Darkhorse communicated quickly by email and helped me get what I needed, on time, for no additional cost. 
11175 Works great. Exactly what I expected 
11176 It works well with practically any camera or tripod, and picks up sound quite nicely. 
11177 Arrived quickly and works exactly as intended. 
11178 Excellent product! I use this diffuser almost exclusively with my canon flash. It provides excellent balanced diffused light for a variety of flash applications. If you only buy one difusser, this is it! 
11179 Great camera. Very easy to use. Takes good underwater pictures and video. Very good product for the price. 
11180 Battery charged right up and fits fine. 
11181 Good！！！ 
11182 Arrived on time and equipment was exactly as offered. Great product, great service, great value!!Only needed charger but for less than the cost of a stand alone charger I got a charger 2 extra batteries and a car charger cord!!! 
11183 These pieces are swell, great experience from seller! 
11184 Love it 
11185 Beautiful. It is perfect for my needs. 
11186 used it couple of times and found ok 
11187 I recieved the slide converter 1 day early the amazom box was in perfect condition. But package box was slightly damaged but did not affect operation of device. Just started using but don t know about relibility right now works as described. 
11188 they work 
11189 On time and as promised! 
11190 Beautifully designed - perfect 
11191 Great video cam. It gives you two hours of time and the pictures are easy to upload. No sim card needed. I swear by Flipshare! 
11192 Fit my T3i lens kit perfectly. 
11193 Best camera backpack on the market. I have tried a lot of different bags and this one is the best. Size is just right for day hikes. 
11194 item arrived promptly and as represented. only used once so far and performed as needed. thanks 
11195 Amazing 
11196 It s really just neat... not necessary but cool. I use it with the D5500 
11197 item was directly as describe 
11198 Nice Fit, Well made! love it! 
11199 They work great with both my 60d and the 70d. 
11200 Great camera! Great quality and tons of accesories. Works great so far! 
11201 These worked for me. i have them on my slider, my shoulder rig, my tripod, and its really nice to just swap my camera between all these with no need to change the plate. 
11202 perfect, quick delivery! 
11203 This is great when I am traveling and have my kids with me and only want to take one camera body and one lens (and still need to tote their sunglasses and my wallet, etc. 
11204 I am satisfied 
11205 I think the hardware is great but the software is complete trash. This device is unsuitable for security due to the fact that the motion detection has not been enabled in the app yet. Push notifications for motion detection does not work. Returned and refunded. 
11206 Perfect case. Great price! 
11207 This camera is very well built and the customer service Walter provided to set it up on pc and tablet was super. Thanks for a great product and service! 
11208 Small, simple to use and setup; does what it says it will. What s not to like. GoPro offers decent software for editing. So far it s been bulletproof 
11209 Good product, timely delivery, works as intended, Good price. Durability? So far so good…. 
11210 Not only was this NOT a plug & play device it is plastic cheap Xhina made. Even their Level 2 support cld not fix - wasted THREE HOURS! Returned & bought Nest (drop) cam which is AWESOME wyality & indeed installed instantly!!! Get a Nest cam!!! 
11211 This backdrop stand is excellent and well constructed. I am very pleased with it and would recommend it. 
11212 Not made for the camera it was pictured with. 
11213 Great product. Great quality and stylish. The seller shipped on time as well. 
11214 Complete junk, waste of everything, just a scam 
11215 Great Value 
11216 This has been a great addition to my equipment. It is the just the right size for when I am shooting still life and macro photos. When shooting portraits it can easily be held by your model without interfering in close ups. 
11217 It Fit like the original hood. So far I am not disappointed. Would buy again. 
11218 GREAT 
11219 GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT. 
11220 It was broken! so bad!!!! 
11221 It was worth my Lil change 
11222 t I don t like the instruction book being online. Haven t figured out how to view photos online. 
11223 Love it! Keep an eye on my dog throughout the day! 
11224 As described and delivers promptly 
11225 Works as described. Target and Walmart sell an exact monopod for around 45 dollars USD. Have not got it wet yet but cheap enough to buy two, one for the water and land. As plus it comes with a GOPRO tripod mount. (score) 
11226 Is a nice product, nicely build. The only problem is the foot holder, It doesnt stay up. At the end I removed from the Monopod. 
11227 Lenses were a great deal for the price. Seem to be quality. Definitely would buy again 
11228 we should all have them at home never know when you need them 
11229 Excellent product. 
11230 My order arrived as promised. The D5300 manual is well written and the camera easy to assemble with very intuitive controls. With accessories, this is a ready to shoot package for beginners and experts. 
11231 Camcorder worked well although there was some pixiling after using Digital Video Head Cleaner everything worked out well, good buy, satisfied. 
11232 Product received, as scheduled, and is just as it is advertised. I am very pleased. 
11233 works really well when it s working, my son loves it. It does what it describes, fly really well for a $50 drones. But one of the propeller fails after a few days of heavy use. It becomes useless if one of the propeller fails. 
11234 These batteries do work, but don t fit into the slots as easily as the originals. The batteries don t seem to hold as long either. 
11235 DOA Returned. 
11236 I love this flash! It was inexpensive and does the job I need it to do. 
11237 Good 
11238 Arrived on time and fit right onto the standard lens for the nikon 1 s1. Works great to reduce lens flare. 
11239 This remote works with my Nikon D3100 perfectly. 
11240 Awkward to use. Takes three hands to align the hood properly. 
11241 Perfect exactly the expected 
11242 Was wondeful, gave the camera the grip it needed 
11243 Gift 
11244 Love old school Polaroids 
11245 Great stuff! Works as expected and protects your gopro from occasional loss 
11246 Now I am always strapped for when things get messy. 
11247 it lasts long enough!! :) 
11248 Honestly there are so many uses for this product! We use it in pools the ocean while spearing, surfing, body surfing and just catching family fun. Thanks again for the great product. 
11249 Good camera, but returned it as there is no real flash. It comes with a little toy one that looks like an after thought. Great pictures in good light, but there are better options for a little more money. 
11250 Sturdy little cap. The string isn t adjustable, so it s kind of useless but doesn t get in the way much. 
11251 Absolutely love my new Canon! It s exactly what I wanted and all the added items are great, especially the case. 
11252 They are working fine. Thanks. 
11253 Came fast. fit great in the camera and work perfectly. 
11254 I love this set of reflectors, very pleased! 
11255 Great case, holds everything I need. No complaints 
11256 Its OK the battery doesn t fit all the way in the charger 
11257 the case is not solid red. it is fully clear. the only thing red is the rubber liner that is inside. it will fit 2x iPhone 6 w/ cases on, a wallet, some keys, and pocket knife. 
11258 Packed full of capability. A real bargain. At first the latest software did not allow me to register on Lenovo tab, but they quickly remedied the problem. 
11259 Excellent camera for a point and shoot. The camera has many great features only found on more expensive cameras. The photo quality is excellent. 
11260 Dose not work at all. If cane tack back the one stare I will 
11261 Should have came with lens ( Canon ) 
11262 Nice price. 
11263 Battery life is terrible. Should have looked around for better camera. Price was ok, videos clear. 
11264 instructions not very good, could not get the audio to work properly. 
11265 Works well but kinda stiff, I like my backpack style better. Larger and bulkier than expected. I find I use the inside case more than the whole thing. 
11266 Flawless. 
11267 Great 
11268 Great Compact case. Perfect for those who do not need to carry around a bunch of different lenses. 
11269 easy to use 
11270 Works like it should 
11271 Not bad for the price, it doesn t work really well with my d810 but is pretty handy for smaller cameras, (I cant reach all the neccasary buttons on the larger dslrs) 
11272 Great item 
11273 Well they are Sony lens caps which is what I needed. 
11274 Total Junk Camera s do NOT buy... they didn t work, period.... fuzzy picture for a while then no picture 
11275 High quality well made compact unit. Easy to carry and use. 
11276 Well made pouches. I prefer these to the larger cases because they can be packed anywhere. 
11277 Works fine but loose in socket 
11278 It works as it should. 
11279 Perfect! Just what I needed for my next project! 
11280 Canon top quality & has the space I need. Only objection I have is the lack of a zippered top closure instead of the Velcro fastener option. It s noises & I don t feel as secure with my gear without a zipper closure. Maybe just me 
11281 Too small for necklaces, and not enough lighting even in a brightly lit room. Otherwise great product. 
11282 Doesn t take great out of water photos, but hints why it s an underwater camera! 
11283 Nice 
11284 love it 
11285 Does the job, like the price! 
11286 Hah Go Pro nervana 
11287 Excellent camera took great vacation photos 
11288 Bought it for a gift. My daughter was thrilled!! 
11289 Nice frame i make my wife happy with this frame with all our goo moments & memories 
11290 Fits perfectly into my Okley backpack 
11291 Perfect 
11292 Used to replace two flooded o. e. cams out of 8 in my system. Exceeded expectations for a unit with this low price. Much better resolution and color rendition than o.e.., and much better mounting brackets. Will use them in the future as the others give out 
11293 Quality and price are great. I wish the threads weren t so darn long though. I m just posting this so the MNF might consider shortening them? :D 
11294 This camera is awesome and you can t beat the price. The best thing that I like is that the screen on the camera is so very clear and easy to use...will have lots of fun with this for years to come 
11295 took a little while to get it to work. has been great since with no issues. 
11296 Really easy to install. And love that I can get real time on my phone. Just download app and set up account good to go. Love it 
11297 Very satisfied. 
11298 Its not good for my canon t3 after a couple of shots it tells me the communication between the lens in the body are not compatible I have to clean the connectors this lens is s***** 
11299 The product is very low quality. It is cheaply made and does not work properly at all. 
11300 This is an awesome scope. 
11301 Looks like it will do the trick. Fairly comfortable and constructed well. 
11302 A really good camera for point and shoot. Has an amazing zoom, shoots quickly, has some special filters and stuff 
11303 100 % recomendable 
11304 Great kit for anyone with a go pro ! 
11305 I love the pouch they came in, and they work really well! 
11306 happy about it 
11307 Good charger I use it as an extra works perfect 
11308 Works perfectly for our smaller waterproof camera and allows it to easily float in the pool rather than sink to the bottom. 
11309 good product. 
11310 Right angle plug much better than straight plug. 
11311 Awesome in every way-- I bought this for a trip to Yosemite in August--was the perfect lens for my GH4-- 
11312 Like many things somethings you can not buy cheap 
11313 What I am looking for is about 300/500 dollar range. 
11314 well made. good price. 
11315 Good 
11316 It was working now it keeps disconnecting. I dont know whats going on 
11317 Great camera, came with all cables and parts. very high quality. 
11318 This item does what it is designed for. It does feel flimsy and make you worried that your flash will fall but it holds up. It works. 
11319 Works as well as original, but a tiny bit thicker making it difficult to eject from camera. 
11320 Super fast shipping & fit my Nikon perfectly 
11321 Great protection. 
11322 Not ready for prime time. After countless hours with their support, we could not get it to work. Had no choice but to return it. 
11323 Suction works well! Tried it on my wind shield and my surf Board and held up pretty tight! 
11324 A solid kit for any sort of standard photography uses! I used it successfully in cleaning both my sensor and my lenses. It is a great deal and definitely something to look into. 
11325 This is a fantastic lens. I can t recommend it enough. 
11326 I had to return it. Bad flash & one of the batteries were also bad. It was after 30 days & Amazon would not accept my return!!! 
11327 Good courteous job, with full satisfaction. 
11328 The best starter Professional tripod you can find. I would recommend this tripod any one who wants to start off with a awesome tripod. if your worried if it s shakey it s totally not super sturddy and can put it anywhere 
11329 Its a nice product. Came in safe and secure package. Got that nice look. So far I like it. 
11330 Sibling used this on his backpacking trip to Japan. Camera came back! The clip is really sturdy, there is no fear of the camera falling off. Great product! 
11331 great. 
11332 Very nice 
11333 I have been Pelican fan for some time and have picked up 7 bags so far! The best case for camera lenses. 
11334 Good quality and price 
11335 One of the best DYI system available on the market. 
11336 Better than the GoPro battery 
11337 Great case! Great quality. Perfect for my needs. 
11338 good price 
11339 Really like this camera 
11340 Perfect! 
11341 Fun to use. Very versatile. Held Canon Rebel ESO T3i stable and level. Hooked to a tree limb. :) 
11342 perfect 
11343 Love it. Very good starter Go Pro. Will eventually upgrade but this one is great for starters 
11344 I probably would have paid another $10 for GoPro s frame mount with the quick release. However this works too except the CamKix frame mount got caught in the front faceplate and bent the corner of it! Good thing these are replaceable. 
11345 Great little filters for the cutest camera ever, 
11346 Great bag for video gadgets. Well made and good cushion. 
11347 Has worked great ever since I bought it 
11348 Works great!:) 
11349 Extremely usefull and recomended to protect the camera. Canon 70D fits perfectly. 
11350 very happy with purchase 
11351 Durable. Reliable. Well-made. Great value! 
11352 This is a very affordable remote. I would recommend taking out the battery when not in use. I have found the battery dead several times. After being stored for a short time. 
11353 Excellent product. 
11354 My 1st one [exactly the same] was stolen, so I liked it so much I got another one. I ll be more careful this time. 
11355 Bought this for my Husband while he was out to sea. He used it constantly in rough conditions and it held up amazing. He filmed awesome footage of aircraft and similar events and he said it was extremely easy to use. 
11356 This gadget proved to be very helpful and convenient! 
11357 confusing instruction and battery not charging. 
11358 Very easy to set up and use. I have gotten amazing footage thanks to it on my bike! 
11359 Good telephoto lens in well lit situations. 
11360 amazing 
11361 They are sturdy forceful clamps. I like them fine so far. 
11362 CAN NOT fit my D750 as the title described!!!!! Please change the item title and the description!!! 
11363 These have a tendency to unscrew as you use it. I m thinking about taking it off 
11364 It really protects the camera and is easy to use. It can be used with the kit zoom, the Panasonic 14mm, and the Panasonic 20mm. The front cover doesn t fit when the Olympus 25mm is used, but you can still half cover that fits on the camera. 
11365 Exactly what I expected for the money. I wish the bars could be a little shorter, though. Too long with three bars, too short with two. Oh well, the price was right. 
11366 These are great! And the case to carry them in is perfect! 
11367 The camera is fine. 
11368 The NVR is dead after 7 months. Front panel light are dark. Also ... The cameras require Microsoft Windows to configure. Cannot access without an unsecure and unsigned Active-x IE plugin. This system is useless to users with real computers. Linux users beware. 
11369 Works great! Must buy for any photographer, amateur or pro. 
11370 just the item i need. 
11371 This bulb is really big. But it does put out a very nice and bright light. I m using it to light a painting area. Would not recommend using this for regular lamps due to size. 
11372 This is a really good value. You get a ton of paper for a very small price. 
11373 Not working with Control4... 
11374 Didn t work well broke, but I got what I paid for 
11375 Awesome camera!!!! Lots of features that I will need to learn how of use..Uploading to internet is a breezy!!! 
11376 This item is exactly what I have been looking for. My SLR is very heavy and I have been looking for some way to distribute the weight. 
11377 Have everything I need for my sj4000 adventures ;) 
11378 PIXDIGITAL is not an approved NIKON dealer (called 3rd Party by NIKON). Subsequently NIKON will not honor their warranty on the camera. 
11379 It is well worth getting these chargers when you add the battery pack to your camera. 
11380 Works great, lightweight and nicely straps to wrist when your up a ladder! 
11381 Works. Fast shipping. Easy setup. Great picture. 
11382 This is a great wifi camera, very easy setup 
11383 We use it everyday to keep an eye on our dogs. 
11384 100% good 
11385 Did not work well with android note 3 
11386 I love the light from this. I can t use it because on the two location shoots I ve brought it out, half of the support ribs have broken. 
11387 I used i this on my panasonic ag-ac 90, It works excellent. No humming or background noise like other mics in the price range. 
11388 It fits snug on my flash and does a great job of changing the light of the flash. 
11389 I feel like this product is a little half-baked, they rushed it to market and it isn t great. The shogun is great, but I m considering finding a third-party sun-hood. 
11390 Good price on these batteries, and they arrived before I expected them to. 
11391 seems to be doing a great job as of yet! smudging is a bit temperamental when it happens.. but I wipe it with a lens cloth and it seems to do the trick 
11392 Great product for the price. Shipping was fast. The battery life only lasted about an hour, but for price I was still happy with the product. 
11393 It works great on portraits. I recommend this also to my friends. 
11394 I ordered this thinking that it was a wireless, returned it without a hassle when I got it. 
11395 Great camera 
11396 So bad it s not worth a review.. useless junk. 
11397 A convenient little bag to hold my t3i camera and its lens. It s just what I needed. However, if you wanted to carry extra lenses, this would not be a good bag for you. 
11398 Sony is very good 
11399 The easiest waist of money, doesn t work AT ALL. 
11400 good price and product. 
11401 Thanks 
11402 Works as described and reasonably priced. 
11403 Just what I needed, great price and fast shipping 
11404 Loved these! Eventually the clamp tips did snap or break off so not sure if that s normal wear and tear or if I did something that caused it. Just used it to clamp fabric onto my photography backdrop stand. 
11405 Great value for the price, my son love it because of unbelievable quality. 
11406 so far so good 
11407 not always focused, not enough zoom for me 
11408 This works if you bounce it off the ceiling 
11409 Fast delivery, good product 
11410 Same color as described. Lovely grass green Great thick quality as usual 
11411 works great 
11412 I m a 10 year old girl and got this camera from my grandparents. I like the camera because I can go underwater with it, and I can take selfies, and I like the color choices. 
11413 The camera software is not compatible with my smartphone ... no version available for other cell phones or tablets 
11414 Haven t used it yet but it is charging 
11415 Awesome product and for the price? Da boooomb! I love it. The shots are smooth and I look like a pro. Awesome. 
11416 NIce lens hood, looks well made, gets the job done. 
11417 It seem good for the price, i will use it and update the review. 
11418 Really clear sound for the cheap price. Sucks the cord is short so can t do long distance stuff, and the wind shield fell off super easily so it s lost forever. 
11419 Works well, stays on glass and holds up my point and shoot, no complaints here! 
11420 The lense bends the horizon on the peripherals, the software will not load on my iPad. The system seems to be incompatible with my 64bit windows app. There were no prohibitive warnings at the time of purchase. Kind of a rip off, Nothing works as expected. 
11421 Shutter button would have been nice... 
11422 Clever system that works for us. Not intended as a full time security system but more peace of mind when away. Could do with some sort of IFTTT integration or one of the smart home systems - maybe on the way if so then systems get even better. 
11423 A 
11424 AAAAA+++++ 
11425 I use it as babay monitor and it works very well, I can see the stutas everywhere. recommened. 
11426 Amazing camera! My daughter loves it! 
11427 The lenz arrived on time and works great 
11428 Love this case! Looks great and fits my Samsung WB35F smart camera great! Just a little snug at first but stretches just enough to fit perfectly! 
11429 Love this tripod. Definitely sturdy. 
11430 I was a little nervous about buying a refurbished camera, but I have not had any issues with it and it takes beautiful pics. 
11431 very nice and slim 
11432 New and delivered on time. Great deal. 
11433 Would not recommend 
11434 Great image quality, fast lens at low cost. Plastic mount is durable. No focus scale and lens hood. I would get the FA 50 1.4 if I was more professional. Great lens for cost conscious enthusiast without sacrificing image quality. 
11435 Delivery was on timeach and the charger has a great overall value. 
11436 Very nice product, doesn t have the quality feel that more expensive ones have, but performs great nonetheless. Only problems I had was the battery door not staying shut occasionally, and the foot being plastic, I broke it while removing it from the camera. 
11437 Camera works very well. It does generate quite a bit of heat, but the image is very nice. 
11438 Excellent camera, good quality and clear image. 
11439 Muy buenos 
11440 it came with a bag, camera strap and 32 gb memory card. Thanks 
11441 Great product, used it for 2 years in our office. No falsies, no problems. Calls up to 3 phone numbers when activated. Perfect for small businesses located in a big building without security. Door opening and motion activated, strongly recommend. Not for high security. 
11442 the batteries and charger worked as expected, the items were delivered as promised on time with no issues. A seamless transaction as it should be. 
11443 I have had no issues with this. Fits my Canon 70D with a longer lens on it. Great for everyday use. 
11444 Easy to operate. Slides sometimes hang up inside. Otherwise - light is bright, picture is good. Did not try negatives. 
11445 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
11446 This was for a Granddaughter, so I don t know about the performance. I did get it in just a couple of days, so I was very happy about that. 
11447 As advertised. Solid construction and fits perfectly on my 400 Rebel XTi. The ability to use either standard batteries or 2 battery packs make this quite versatile. I ve used it with the battery packs and it lasts a long time. I recommend this product. 
11448 I have been using this camera for a few weeks now, and I have been completely with its performance. Expecially when you get into it more advanced features like the multi frame noise reduction and HDR. my wife loves the creativity while in auto mode 
11449 Good for the price. Really creates the appearance of a TV 
11450 Awesome product great the building custom iPhone rigs 
11451 Excellent 
11452 Cant beat the price fast charge and always have a battery for my canon D30 camera 
11453 Exactly what I wanted for my T5i...snug fit with kit lens. Will offer the protection I was looking for. Snug around body and long enough to cover lens plus straps secure to each other. 
11454 sharp, rich colors on my 7R2 
11455 Fantastic for the price! Great accessory for macro lighting! 
11456 Love this camera. With the bundle you have everything you need. 
11457 Great product very good prise fast shipment I recommend. 
11458 Perfect. Flexible and lightweight. 
11459 I got it, what more do you want. 
11460 Lens is great. I am highly satisfied! 
11461 Great 200 ISO color negative film. Seem to shoot a little blue for me, I have been editing this during scanning. 
11462 I like it. 
11463 Product works as advertised. However, like other reviewers have said, it is very hard to remove the lens. I have resorted to using a flat blade screwdriver to get in there to unlock the pin so I can remove the lens from the adapter. 
11464 Works great, just what i needed. Great distance, worked well out of range while camping even. 
11465 Take the time to balance and it works great. The grip tries to slide though. 
11466 Not much to say. I m happy with this product. 
11467 Excellent binoculars. I can see far goes perfectly with this product that is not too expensive. I am satisfied 
11468 Product is light weight and feels durable. Metal GoPro attachment point is a big plus for confidence that your GoPro is staying put. GREAT customer service! 
11469 Easy to use. Well worth the price 
11470 stopped working after a week 
11471 Do not buy this camera as a deterrent, it is only meant to fill in spots that real cameras might miss. If this is the only camera, in about a week everyone will know it is fake. 
11472 Ok 
11473 Bright back light, Clear view in bright and sunny conditions outdoors. Long action time on high capacity battery (2 days of use between charges.). Only came with short MiniHDMI to HDMI patch cable and no pigtail for the analog av input. Would have also liked a 12vDC pigtail as well. 
11474 Just what I was looking for 
11475 Works as intended. 
11476 good camara but didn t realise that it didn t have share options 
11477 It is just the size (a medium, despite the description) for my needs, falling between a couple of smaller bags and a larger system bag. It certainly seems sturdy and well designed. I opted for the orange interior to make finding the small odds and ends easier. 
11478 Pain to install and uninstall. Does not fit in case with guards on... 
11479 Takes great pictures! 
11480 ok;-))) 
11481 Love it! 
11482 I love my Manfrotto! 
11483 It came exactly as the description said it would. It s adorable and unique. 
11484 Bought one of these for my 70D and it works great. But no surprise there - I have bought SterlingTek batteries for my other DSLRs (40D & G12) and they have always been excellent and cost-effective. Highly recommended! 
11485 This is not a UNIVERSAL AC ADAPTOR, it does not fit into my device 
11486 This little camera works awesome for a whole bunch of different applications from underwater to live shows and for the price you can t really find something this good I think. 
11487 Fit my filters fine. A nice additional to my Cannon SX520 outfit. Well worth the price. 
11488 The frame works great and has a great picture. The directions for use after set up could be better but, even I figured out how to navigate the web site. 
11489 Great mic, low hiss 
11490 Happy 
11491 Received on time and in perfect condition. Works very well with no issues. Recommended product 
11492 Worked as advertised. Expensive way to print out pics. 
11493 This is a very simple device and so far it has worked as advertised. The item is supposed to be built by Foto&Teck but it carries the name &#34;Lynca&#34;. It works and it is very inexpensive. 
11494 These work great! 
11495 I bought this initially for my binoculars to use at concerts but took it to Boston last weekend and paired it up with my camera and it was great. It s light, compact, and steadies your shots beautifully. 
11496 High quality and worked fantastic! 
11497 All seems in order. I got this to view the Blood Moon in September 2015. And to view our wonderful night sky on other occasions. Packs easily in the backpack (included). Nice value. 
11498 Extremely light and EXTREMELY loud. You pull the top loop off the Robocopp to turn it on, and it s very secure so you can be sure it won t go off automatically. It s sturdy, well-designed, and as I said, it s LOUD!! 
11499 Ok 
11500 Awesome build quality and functionality! gonna buy more for my class. 
11501 excellent 
11502 it is very well 
11503 Awesome camera! Plenty of features, easy to handle, and takes absolutely splendid pictures! 
11504 They do the job of an extension tube, but feel very cheap. My lenses have also become stuck every now and then, but still easy to remove. 
11505 Great siren. Has decent volume 
11506 Great Product 
11507 Battery was great. Last double of the one that came with it. 
11508 Great tripod, very light weight but sturdy. I can now get close-ups without movement by using the bluetooth remote control button. 
11509 Great product. and it s a Tiffen even better. 
11510 Good quality...good price...timely shipping. 
11511 Works! but probably would not withstand rough handling. JC 
11512 Fits my old camera perfectly thanks ^^ 
11513 What can I say, it works......got tired of fooling with this and just put velcro on the speed light..... 
11514 Good price 
11515 Great Product 
11516 works great. 
11517 The batteries are working well so far. I don t live them overnight for charging. They will get hot if you do. The charger is fine too. But you should charge one battery at a time. 
11518 So far so good. Arrived earlier than promised. Have used a few times with excellent results. This was purchased for a Canon 60D. 
11519 There is a reason why products like this from Manfrotto are more expensive.... They are grade A quality and you can tell. The movement of this head and the incredibly sleek build are perfect for video and/or photo. You get what you pay for! 
11520 The best lens I d owned so far. 
11521 Very good, but it doesn t quite have the range of configuration I was hoping for. I could probably use on with slightly longer arms. Mechanically, it is solid. 
11522 Great product, as expected!! 
11523 Worked very well. It attached to my Canon t2i and helped me take some great pictures. 
11524 Perfect. 
11525 Equal, in my opinion, to high-priced brand name filter sets. 
11526 Works perfectly on my Canon T3i and 7D Mark II 
11527 These cells actually had more juice then my OEM battery. Highly recommend this product. 
11528 Got the wrong size case but it works good for something else I am using it for 
11529 It is very good 
11530 Great product! Easy to position. Stays wear you put it. 
11531 I like it 
11532 very good ! 
11533 Very happy with them!! 
11534 works just fine 
11535 Product met all my expectations, price competitive and delivery quick. What else can one add? 
11536 A++++++ 
11537 so far great lens, very low light pic looks good shooting with nikon d7100 iso250 f2.8 new camera and lens my bluecloud. 
11538 The product was delivered in a timely manner. It was purchased for a new Canon 70D DSLR. It fits well, but it is a bit loose. It falls off in my camera bag, as I m removing the camera. While using the camera there is no problem. 
11539 Very clear, bright image with accurate color. Weight is not too great for easy carrying considering the magnification and objective lens diameter. Lens caps are awkward in use. 
11540 small enough to put in my back pack but not big enough to carry everything you want in it 
11541 need to include attachment instructions 
11542 Hi, it came in a bundle. Big, spacious, but the twinkle that makes when you walk is just too annoying. 
11543 it s comfortable for the dogs, put on snug it holds up very well to even my most active dog. Running jumping swimming! Keeps position and gives a great view!!!! 
11544 works great 
11545 There are much more effective staff on the market. But I found how and where to apply it. Good for the price. 
11546 This is a nice protective cover for the price. It fits my Canon SX40 nicely and fits in your pocket when not in use. 
11547 Works well! 
11548 product was as advertised. shipment was quick. 
11549 The gaps (in the way the cover closes) reflect on all of the photos. 
11550 fits the 18-55mm lens perfectly. 
11551 Great but needed assistance to setup 
11552 Indiana Jones asked me where I got this and how much it cost. He offered to exchange this for his leather pouch; but, I didn t accept the trade. 
11553 Product was as advertised and a great buy for the price, shipping was on time and the tripod works with a number of different cameras. A worthwhile purchase 
11554 Good deal for the price. Has every piece needed to enjoy the camera. 
11555 My purpose for this camera was to watch my dog. I love it. I can also talk to him which is awesome. To be able to scan the room Is a great feature. Highly recommend this product. 
11556 plenty of run time with this pack 
11557 Great light as a great price 
11558 cannot connect as wireless unit have done everything - useless 
11559 Easy to program. 
11560 Everything was as stated. All accessories were as described. Arrived on time. Product is excellent 
11561 light & durable, we will see how it lasts the test of time. 
11562 These are great! You can place them on windows or doors and they will chime or sound an alarm when one is opened. Definitely beats paying a high price for alarm monitoring. 
11563 I just needed somethin to see my driveway area. Easy to hook up and works great 
11564 I got this camera since a friend of mine has it and I saw it working. It works for me as a baby monitor. I had no issues installing and setting up it. Like it! 
11565 Charger does a fine job and fits the battery well. 
11566 A few times after using my GoPro with this case for a while in the water, the lens on the case begins to fog up a bit. From time to time I have to disassemble the case in order to wipe the inside which becomes a bit inconvenient. 
11567 Very happy with the batteries, charger and all at half the price. Great deal! I was so happy that it arrived early so I could take it with me on vacation! 
11568 Worked Better than expected !! 
11569 Is a great tool for beginners as well as pros, and takes amazing shots! Lightweight and high quality! 
11570 Nice 
11571 easy to operate. Husband has a very large wrist fits him perfect 
11572 This battery works very well with my external HD dsiplay monitor used for my camcorder. Battery discharge lasted for the time expected. Recharge time depends on the charger, but I had no issues iwth this item. 
11573 excellent product 
11574 Too many parts not as easy to install as expected 
11575 great camera and cheap 
11576 Purchased this item to replace a broken contact on sliding glass door. Item arrived quickly, was exactly as represented in the description, was easy to install. 
11577 This camera is my baby, I highly recommend it to anyone who loves photography. Plus you can t beat a touch screen display ! 
11578 i like it. great ! 
11579 PERFECT!!!! Works great! Sooo easy. We have the GoPro4 mounted on our roll cage of our RZR... I put this remote on my wrist and control it from my seat. 
11580 sometimes the control of the lens through this extension not work but still good addition to my gear. 
11581 My son really liked the camera and it looks to have a good seal. Should come with some small memory stick. 
11582 This was more of a pain to use than it was worth. The clips don t allow for for flexible positioning. We had to use our clamps instead. More for studio use than field use. 
11583 work good no problems yet 
11584 Just what I wanted. 
11585 It s a battery. It works. 
11586 These work very well for getting a better position on the camera. Along with a set of straights, there are only a few positions that are not possible. 
11587 Simple and durable. 
11588 Only used couple of times but works good 
11589 It is just perfect! 
11590 Great filter. Now I can shoot video in sunny condition with low aperture and fixed shutter speed. Good deal! 
11591 As Described 
11592 Definitely a little too expensive for what it gives you but it does perform well. 
11593 Great value, good quality kit, seems solid. 
11594 higher quality 
11595 Perfect size case for all my gear. Make sure to get the lid organizer too. 
11596 Have a wide range of lenses for my Lumix DMC-GM5...but this lens has quickly become my absolute favorite... 
11597 The camera was clean and has performed great shooting sports for two weeks. 
11598 Rounded ones fit well on the top of my 8hp Johnson motor. I also used one on the dashboard of my jeep. Also worked perfect. 
11599 Best bang for the buck in a 4K camera, I m very impressed with the resolution and capabilities, I d been discovered its potential day by day. 
11600 The charger works perfectly with my original battery and getting the extra pair of batteries means I can shoot for days before needing to recharge. 
11601 Works great and easy to program. 
11602 I bought this device from this seller based on the reviews. The device is not the one pictured, but is identical to the cheapest looking, lower rated models. Don t make the mistake I made. Don t pay extra for looks and reviews. 
11603 Nice and compact case! And WOW for customer service! They wanted to make sure I was happy with the product and followed up with me immediately on a question I had. 
11604 Husband LOVES it! 
11605 Works as they say. Easy to install easy to use. 
11606 Product works great. Got it the next day! 
11607 fits perfect, but it should, both case and camera are Sony 
11608 Wife likes it in her buisness. Mail n more. Thinking of buying another one for the new restaurant. 
11609 Very nice just what I wanted. It did not disappoint. Durable and beautiful for photos 
11610 Good camera! Good delivery 
11611 Other reviews state that the rolls don t have an expiration date but I used it for the Dallas Cowboys training camp, the pictures are great. Product arrived before specified date. 
11612 Camera is one of the best of this type on the market. Quick setup and excellent support if needed. Just call Walter and he can provide you with excellent help & support 
11613 Excellent hi resolution video surveillance camera, can be controlled remotely so it can pan and zoom remotely provides good color video when there is enough light and monochrome video using infrared in the dark. 
11614 Best buy for the money! 
11615 great 
11616 Fits perfectly on my Canon 18-135 STM lens. I can zoom wide and it s not in the picture. It also doesn t stop me from being able to put the lens cap on when I m done with the camera. It s everything I needed for this lens. 
11617 The batteries doesn t hold the charge as well as the actual fujifilm battery I have. I noticed if I don t use the batteries after charging them, they slowly lose charge. So they are not amazing, but work as expected. 
11618 It worked great until the attenna broke off. It is touchy, will try again and be more careful. Otherwise it worked as it is supposed to. 
11619 The colors are not as vivid as I would like, but far superior to my last photo frame. I have not a explored all its capabilities, but it appears it will do more than I will ever use. It is a good value and well worth its price. 
11620 Not great but works 
11621 For the money, this is a nice quality case. Bought it for a Phantom 3. The hell fits great. Had to do a few small cuts for the controller. But it was easy with an electric kitchen knife. Not as sturdy as a hard case, but good basic protection. 
11622 very good 
11623 good 
11624 Worked perfectly 
11625 So happy I can find instant film at a low price! 
11626 Danny was very helpful with the problems I was having setting up my camera. The camera is very clear 
11627 Everything Perfect! 
11628 Incredibly solid, microscopic precision machining and tolerances, and superb build quality! A real winner! 
11629 excellent 
11630 Great WiFi camera for the price...easy to set up 
11631 at my second month it broke 
11632 nice product 
11633 as good as a go pro kess expensive 
11634 Got to use it once, then strapped on the chesty mount to paddle board and the gopro popped out and sank to the bottom of the Willamette River during Redbull Flugtag in Portland. Should have just been using this. Oops 
11635 Light and cute camera! Comes with a lot of accessories. Video/photo is sharp and clear. Also the price is so much better than GoPro. 
11636 Very good quality and very light. 
11637 Excellent monopod. It comes with a phone holder and it is also good for camera. Most importantly, it locks, which allows to install a phone or a camera without any fears. It looks sturdy, I hope it will last. It comes with phone holder and a screw for Gopro. 
11638 Pretty small, but does work. 
11639 Excelllent Product and great price 
11640 Excellent! Exactly what I was expecting. 
11641 Henry Campbell was very helpful in solving my camera issues. Henry was very diligent in making sure my issues were resolved. Foscam has excellent products. I recently bought 2 more Foscam wireless cameras. 
11642 These work pretty well and last a reasonable length of time (without using the flash, though I ve read LION AA batteries last longer.) Having 2 batteries means you always have a spare ready to go if 1 batteries gives out. And it was a good deal. 
11643 I have a camera like this, love it. Got this one for a friend. 
11644 Great product 
11645 It blew..... amazon gave me a refund, also I would have given it 0 stars if I could 
11646 perfect fit for my eos t3i as good as new piece 
11647 Use this on my Canon T3 and T5i; works fantastic. Fast lens for a low price. 
11648 This item arrived in good condition. It will come in handy when I need to clean my camera and looks like a quality item. I received this item at a discount for my honest opinion. 
11649 Good items! 
11650 Super product! 
11651 Very heavy duty and will protect my camera gear without any worries. 
11652 good 
11653 Takes a bit of patience to dial in motion sensitivity so that it doesn t record anything that moves. Make sure to schedule reboot at least once per week. Dlink app is ok. Saving recordings to network drive performs better than to sandisk. 
11654 great batteries and prompt shipping. 
11655 Don t pay for the name brand. This an amazing product. All in the family have loved using it. Riding water crafts, swimming with dolphins and surfing it is uP to the task. 
11656 Product was as described, and delivered as scheduled.The quality is excellent and does the job perfectly. 
11657 We have a great picture. Very pleased. 
11658 Worst video security camera I have ever used. 
11659 Good Boom stand for the price..will do the job if you don t want to break the bank. Received this boom stand pretty fast. So far it has been very sturdy and I ve had no problems whatsoever. 
11660 perfect no problem what so over. 
11661 My Nordic waterproof camera floats work as expected. They are keeping my valuable cameras safe in, and around the water. 
11662 Great Update 
11663 I ve long wanted the SLR-Zoom GorillaPod and when it went on sale I couldn t pass up on it. I use it for my Samsung NX1 and 16-50mm S lens - it works as intended and don t have to worry about hitting the weight limit! 
11664 It s a great tripod for beginners who haven t used one before. I noticed that when I tried to adjust it some washers and bolts actually fell off of it. But besides that, it works great. 
11665 Works great on glass. Customer Service was excellent and I was contacted by the owner to ensure everything was satisfactory. Where else can you find customer service this good. Will definitely buy from a service that cares for their customers. 
11666 I might have to return it Didn t come with manuel on how to use Fits my camera but when I take a picture it comes up errow try cleaning lenses 
11667 I needed something compact for spare lenses. These are perfect. I love the cinch cord with hooks so I can clip them to other items or my bag. The padding offers extra cushion to protect the lens. Great value. 
11668 Awesome quad copter!! My sone LOVES it!!! 
11669 This greatly exceeded my expectations. It s easy to setup and is nicely made, considering its very modest price. Now I only need to pull out the big roll of seamless paper for large items. This is perfect for items up to about to about the size of a basketball. 
11670 Holds all my gear safely. Lots of room for stuff. 
11671 Great little camera. The only potential problem are the on and off switch, gets stuck from time to time. 
11672 Great value 
11673 Too complicated. 
11674 Great product and great price. I would purchase again. Best Buy didn t carry the batteries, but they sold the camera that needed them. Go figure. 
11675 ok 
11676 These batteries may not last as long as the Canon ones, but they have lasted me for three years and still kicking! 
11677 works ok but to small and to heavy 
11678 It was the item I ordered and perfect for transferring pics. 
11679 Love, Love, Love this! I will order another one just to have for events. Using this one for my photo booth at my party and the second one will be used just for a second prop to have a different background for pictures. Very professional looking. 
11680 Good for quick carry, doesn t take all your lenses and accessories. 
11681 Still holds up well. I needed something to protect my camera. I love this cover. 
11682 Good 
11683 Worked great 
11684 Don t waste your money! 
11685 I bought a Nikon camera and this cable wasn t included. Anyway I thought I needed it and this cable worked perfectly 
11686 Love the product, like how it attaches to my camera very easily and quickly while trying them out.. it would be nice if they make included a red and orange color one too, maybe in the future they will.. 
11687 These are great octoboxes for the price. I can t speak to their durability as I only use them indoor in a studio, but for my purposes they work great! 
11688 Got it for Zukio 12-40mm f/2.8 Pro 
11689 Perfect for the mobius does feel a bit make shift but works exactly as it should. 
11690 Securing your property have never been easier while at the same time being able to be done with such quality as it is now possible with EasyN IP camera,High quality video makes me happily to monitor my store.I will buy more. 
11691 Fits great, works great. Does exactly what it s supposed to do ... 
11692 great service and price 
11693 The best drone for professional and safe pilots who respect the art. 
11694 My grandson loves them. 
11695 Cute and works well to keep the camera afloat! 
11696 camera would not work with my iphone ,appel 5s. The app kept dropping info and I had to re enter. 
11697 Board snapped 1st day on set. Gaff tape kept it together mostly. Rain started to wash colors off the sticks 
11698 Great price and great product. Can be used to charge Wasabi and GoPro battery. Gives a lot of flexibility. 
11699 To those who say it will not fit the SX520 - they are right. It does not even come close. It does appear to be a classy case, somewhat retro which I like. Too bad it does not fit the SX520. 
11700 its ok but now with more gear the bag is to small need bigger one 
11701 its great and the color match the camera, 
11702 Works perfectly 
11703 I Love This Film 
11704 Good 
11705 worst product ever, no instuctions sent it back for full refund...still cost me $300.00 to find out it would not work 
11706 I also sent message to amazon to let them know 
11707 The filter holder is padded and, protects the unused filters. I consider this to be a very nice value for the money. 
11708 An inexpensive way to adjust the flash on the a6000. Works well. 
11709 It is a good semi professional camera. The only problem is sometimes gets hard to get focus. 
11710 grainy video 
11711 Very flimsy album and will not order it again 
11712 This is an amzing tripod. Especially for the price. It has everything you need. I just don t recommend taking it outside if its windy but besides that it s wonderful. You should really buy this 
11713 I love my Nikon Coolpix. It takes great photos in low light and has a powerful zoom. I only wish it were smaller and lighter, but you can t have it all. 
11714 I can say nothing bad about this camera, was so usefull for my photography class, and even after the class i ve still been using it! Great deal over all 10/10! 
11715 Would not take the information for the protection. How can you register your product if the website will not take the information. NOT GOOD! I feel like SmartGuard took my money - no coverage of product. 
11716 Great picture quality without that &#34;fish-eye&#34; look, night vision works well ( unless pay higher $ for infrared cams ) No problem with cables and power adaptor. 
11717 I really enjoyed it. It works as expected. However, it kind of sucks that it only takes 8 pictures, especially with it being so expensive. 
11718 Rather than digging up the wire when I moved the PTZ camera I purchased a replacement cable. Good quality, works as it should. 
11719 The shipping was really fast but the product came damaged so I wasn t able to take it on my vacation as planned. Not sure if it happened during shipping or what 
11720 Leather? No it is not. But, not too bad 
11721 Poor performance out of box. Need to be collimated. Celestron may charge you extra to do it. Once collimated, works fine. 
11722 Fit perfectly and does it s job well. I m a happy customer.(: 
11723 These cases are very nice, plenty of room for the gear and it rolls well. Two man carry handles work great. 
11724 Lots of really cool things in here. Some of the items I had no idea what they were for. When I googled them I got inspired with cool new things to try with my GoPro 
11725 Can t get it to work.went step by step.records nothing 
11726 This is a really nice &#34;bundle&#34; I gave it as a gift and thought it was a good camera with some good accessories. 
11727 My daughter received it OK. However, I apparently ordered the wrong one because it didn t charge her camera. Thanks 
11728 a perfect replacement for the original Eyepiece cup that comes on the camera. 
11729 Good product. 
11730 The device refuses to recognize the internal hard drive. Cameras work, but the system will not record. 
11731 Far smaller than appears in photo 
11732 So far so good. 
11733 Great addition to the Tilta rig. Allows you to move the handles down and forward to, with the addition of a shoulder pad, create a shoulder rig for the BMCC. Amazon price was way better than eBay or direct from Tilta. 
11734 awesome!!! use it all the time!!!!! great price 
11735 Be careful with using them in flashlights they will blow bulbs in streamlight TL-2 and TL- 3 my mistake 
11736 but great lights 
11737 Camera, case and extra battery are great. The other stuff is just clutter 
11738 Love all of the compartments and construction of this bag. My Cannon t3i fits perfect! 
11739 as described. 
11740 Works as well as expected. Better for trip to Greece to take Acropolis photos in crowds. Light-weight & packable for carry on luggage for airplane, no questions asked (I thought it might not pass because could be used as a weapon). 
11741 One side where the flash is inserted just broke. Made of cheap material. 
11742 Great camera for the price.... Excellent customer service from Digital1 
11743 Quite satisfied with it. Do wish it had a GPS. 
11744 The further zoom the more blurry. 
11745 Order it and got it pretty quick. The item is working just fine. Came about half charge on one and the other was full charged. Thanks 
11746 Great product 
11747 The spectacle of this tiny camera is big, when you consider its tiny size. I bought the camera for its large 20.1 sensor, but mainly because it boasted a premium Carl Zeiss Vario-Tessar lens. The results are unmistakenly grand. 
11748 Worked very well for charging my camera battery! 
11749 tks 
11750 Works well with my A7. 
11751 Love 
11752 Roy martin help was so appreciated thank you foscam!!! 
11753 Great Product. How do you get value any batter than this with Prime shipping?! 
11754 Works pretty well. Sometimes difficult to keep it out of the picture. 
11755 The description item says &#34;Waterproof&#34; and I have used just one time in my pool and later, the screws show corrosion. 
11756 Complete package of accessories for lower than individual prices. 
11757 Easy setup, superior design, and superb definition. 
11758 Camera sucked in lighting setting weren t helpful. Pictures came out light. Better to buy in store. 
11759 Cable arrived ahead of schedule and worked as expected. Good service, good value. 
11760 super dooper 
11761 great 
11762 This works great, first tried a bar fly which was no good. Arkon actually fits the bars of a bicycle handle 
11763 It floats and it s easily visible. Solid product especially for the price. Saved me the first time I used it, almost lost my camera as i was floating down the Potomac river. 
11764 perfecto 
11765 like it..! 
11766 Good quality tape. 
11767 I really love this product. It s all about whatever I was looking for. It s so convenient. I am fully satisfied. 
11768 Works great, and shipping was quick! 
11769 They gave me the purchase price for what I paid for since they couldn t fix my camera and were very nice helpful and quick 
11770 soooo happy with my purchase! the shipping was super fast and came a day early. :) I am so excited to use it! 
11771 Exactly what we expected. 
11772 Both the battery and charger have worked well so far, and that too, at a price that is hard to beat! 
11773 Works great! 
11774 I love my Canary. Not only does it help me keep an eye on the house, but I can also watch the kids playing in the other room! 
11775 They work great, good investment! 
11776 The pictures are clear and pretty low maintenance for the price. The night view could be better, and the mounting brackets are cheap, they never stay in place and requires frequent adjustments. Anyway, over all a good buy for the price. 
11777 It broke the first day i got it the foot crumbled now can t be used. Didn t even get to try it out very disappointing 
11778 Great hidden camera, no one even can notice it s recording. Directions are confusing, but after you buy it, the seller sends clear instructions. Wish it was 1080p too. 
11779 Used for transporting firearm on vacation 
11780 Ordering more. 
11781 No problems, 
11782 Crappy accessories. 
11783 Love this camera....very easy to set up and use. The picture/video is clear even in low light. I like having the ability to keep an eye on what s going on at home when I m not there. The motion sensor and text alert are also great. 
11784 Love this so much!!! Beyond my expectations and it s worthy for me to wait so loong time to have it :) 
11785 ok 
11786 Have been using this camera both on dry land and underwater. I think the auto-focus is not quite as good as the old Canon that I replaced but, otherwise, this is a nice camera for someone who just wants to &#34;point and shoot.&#34; 
11787 Amazing Value for the money. Recommend buying extra batteries, there is a set of 4 or 5 that can be charged at the same time. That is what I bought and it is perfect. about 45 minutes total fly time. 
11788 Good idea for waterproof cameras, but no way to adjust for wrist/hand size. Well made 
11789 The caps is a great help when transporting water. 
11790 Thank you :) 
11791 Superb product for a great price. Lightweight and compact. 
11792 Not as good a picture as the Fujikam it replaced, but all of the local services it provides (to e-mail, local recording, FTP upload) make it worth it. The web interface is also well laid out and easy to use. Presets are pretty cool to play around with. 
11793 Love this thing! I bought this for my wife for Mother s Day and had no problem setting it up. It s completely easy to use. Really cool digital photo frame. 
11794 The best I have used 
11795 No complaints!! 
11796 The blower was the only item that completely matched the description. Biggest letdown was receiving a cheap brush pen instead of a Lens Pen. 
11797 Very happy with the camera system, I can rest better knowing I can watch the activity around the house at night, 
11798 Great clarity. Traveled abroad and monitored thr cameras with no problems. Make sure you have a good internet connection and you re golden. Customer support was very responsive to my questions before receiving and after. Highly recommended. 
11799 OK 
11800 awesome! 
11801 It didn t come with all of the pieces to cover all the sides. 
11802 Excellent work perfectly! 
11803 Shipped quickly, works perfect for the Nikon camera I am using for. 
11804 Does what it says 
11805 Didn t work for what I intended to use it for. Tried to mount my camera on my windshield but my camera would just be facing at awkward angles. Very strong suction though. 
11806 I would have given it 5 stars but you cannot view your photos with this on, otherwise it works as advertied 
11807 Better than expected 
11808 It s a good camera for what I need it for. The tripod is stupid... seriously, there s no other description for it. 
11809 It looks nice, and I like the pattern. 
11810 These are light and move very smoothly and with great ease. It was a great purchase. I bought a second one here at Amazon after this first one arrived. Make sure you have the right width based on your tripod. 
11811 Works perfect for my cameral!!! 
11812 Sometimes when one gets stuck it ruins the whole case and you can no longer use the rest of the packaged polaroid 
11813 Great price, works well. Worked like a OE flash. Will by another for a slave unit. 
11814 Not as thick as I expected. 
11815 This was cheaply made and tightening each leg as i lengthened it was a night mare. Didn t stay tight. The legs became loose and one of them broke. This was all within a month of getting it with minimal use. 
11816 [[VIDEOID:153357149d2c408819cc54ff2a1c437a]] Camera take great videos. Came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

11817 Great picture & Super wide image. Onvif works. Using 2 of them with BlueIris. 
11818 Second time buying this product.. no issues, works great for our chicken coops! 
11819 FAST DELIVERY...PERFECT FABRIC...LIGHTWEIGHT YET DOES HOLD ITS SHAPE VERY WELL.... 5 STARS TO THE COMPANY....COWBOY STUDIO 
11820 Just as expected 
11821 I have a Lopro that s a little bigger and takes up to much space. This smaller version fits the bill when I m packing lighter. Good value 
11822 Better than buying more filters. 
11823 same as before 
11824 all fine 
11825 Great case for the money. 
11826 The camera is very easy to use and is small enough to fit in your pocket or purse. Takes good pictures. 
11827 When this camera works, it s fantastic. I purchased it to take photos of the animals in our local animal shelter. The Sports mode and burst functions work very well for this application. The problem is that the camera is unreliable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn t. 
11828 Have not had to use alarm, but like knowing that it is here if I do need it. I tested alarm, and it worked. 
11829 Good deal and very good lights. 
11830 the battery s and the charger work great. 
11831 Very easy to setup. The cameras have decent low light resolution but in color and with light sometimes are blurry. The motion detection is very sensitive, picking up even slight movements. Overall and for them money, this is a very good product. 
11832 It s awesome lots of pockets, and useful cutouts. It doesn t hold a P3 controller perfect, but I made do. 
11833 Good camera for the price! 
11834 Used this for snorkeling and scuba in south florida. Evens out the color just perfectly!! 
11835 I like 5x7 format for my photos.... the problem is there are no small photo albums. This one does nicely...... 
11836 they work good.Just what I needed. Was about to chunk the camera but they fixed it. 
11837 great conversion piece with fellow shooter. Works well and just not on camera and lens. 
11838 Excelente 
11839 Perfect!!!! Great batteries on arrived early!! 
11840 This is perfect for what I do. Needed for release on landscape pics that required long shutter speeds. 
11841 Perfect 
11842 The Removu P1 is a lifesaver when it comes to framing shots while boating. Until now, it was a guessing game to make sure I had the shot I wanted, but now I can make sure I get the shot I need without risking my phone to the water. 
11843 Absolutely the best purchase 
11844 Very good mount but the screws that come with it strip easily - do not use the screws that come with the product -only good for sheetrock if that 
11845 Nice little camera amazing performance for the price. 
11846 Love my ringlight 
11847 Nice gr8 price 
11848 Works as expected. We lost our Nikon version and this cheaper version works just like the Nikon version. 
11849 Love it 
11850 Pretty. 
11851 Works! 
11852 lasted about 2 hours of non stop photo taking before needing charged 
11853 I should have measured my camera s screen first ! 
11854 Good quality film, and it lasted me a long time. 
11855 I love it! 
11856 Best camera of my equipment, good quality and reliable. 
11857 Great product and great support! 
11858 Good product 
11859 was unable to attach the arm to the stand as it doesn t fit at all, not even the mid section... 
11860 Used primarily for night photography and eliminated camera jitter due to camera motion when triggering the shutter. 
11861 Just as described 
11862 Good Product 
11863 I though it would have been to small and not have any sections but to my surprise it was perfect. love the color and it feels & look like a regular messenger handbag 
11864 It s everything Canon and everyone else who has one says it is and more. 
11865 Great Value! 
11866 Good easy to use zoom lens 
11867 AS ADVERTISED 
11868 Henry was fantastic with his support, so far camera is ok. 
11869 This seems to be just what I needed. 
11870 I loaded 10 pictures onto a flash drive to plug into the USB. It will only display 4 of them. I have no idea why that would be. It s a basic frame so I can t seem to find much information on it. Very, very annoying. 
11871 Returned it after finding many of the screws on the clamps were stripped out. If you get a good one probably not bad for the price. 
11872 We use this camera float mudder often as we are Floridians and &#34;live&#34; in the water. Its somewhat of a bulky fit for my petite female wrist and little unattractive but it does the job well. 
11873 Super durable! 
11874 Poor quality product. Battery never charges, buttons work randomly and after 2 months of use the volume buttons stop functioning. 
11875 It s been a good feature for airsoft 
11876 Excellent value - Provide hours of recording time in the Canon M41 camera. 
11877 Love it, work great. 
11878 Loved all the gadgets and the suction cup actually works on the hood of the car - it didn t budge at all. Good quality and lots of variety for a great price. 
11879 Perfect for my camera. Plugs into the wall and so keep one battery in camera and if I go out, I tuck the spare in with the camera. 
11880 No customer support ? Who is responsible here Agasio ? Foscam ? The support number dials Foscam and they say call Agasio ? Ridiculous 
11881 Do not buy Agasio 
11882 Works as expected. 
11883 I bought this for a wedding I was a second shooter at worked perfectly and I love it , the stars made it very easy to put on my flash when I needed it. It folds up very flat so doesn t take up much room in your bag. 
11884 I m not really sure if this works or doesn t work, or make a difference. But one thing I learned is to be careful how far I insert the cord tip into the conditioner. It can, and has, pulled out the cord tip, rendering the cord useless. 
11885 Charges battery but e charge on the camera runs out only after one hour of use! 
11886 Order arrived safely and quickly. 
11887 This camera is amazing! I have 3 other people interested in purchasing the same thing! 
11888 once adjusted to both eyes it works great, Good buy for the money 
11889 perfect 
11890 very good..... 
11891 Easy to use. Gives good light. A tiny bit too heavy for my flash--causing it to move the swivel. 
11892 Good price seems to be the same as the one with the Nikon logo but less cost. 
11893 awesome. no complaints 
11894 Works well, had for a while and still working well. Nights a little blurry but still good. I will try to put a photo or two on here of the night vision. In the next couple days.:-) 
11895 Polarizer arrived on time and was as advertised. Condition was very good and it works well with my 14-150mm telephoto lens. 
11896 like it a lot 
11897 They were not even close to what was advertised 
11898 Henry is good. 
11899 battery drains quickly but it works if used immediately. 
11900 This is one nifty little accessory. Many uses and very sturdy. I already had a ball head to use with it, if you don t, you might want to consider purchasing with the ball head. 
11901 The fit is acceptable, but a little loose. It comes off just a little too easily. 
11902 Exactly as described, works excellent! Bought as a gift specifically for the moon filter and they are greatly impressed with the quality and viewing capabilities that this kit offers as a suppliment to their Celestron telescope. 
11903 This lightweight camera has some great features and I think with be fabulous when travelling! 
11904 Great camera 
11905 it was great 
11906 Worked fine for 6 months, then started making corrupt files and ceasing recording at random intervals. Had to tell the cops that the hit and run I filmed was a corrupted file. No one was happy. 
11907 Love the Camera. Bit confused on some of the accessories that came with it.. some seem to be missing parts.... 
11908 Love...exactly what I needed 
11909 Bought this for my son-in-law, who had a camera bag, but it was big and bulky. He loves this as it is compact and he can take it with him hiking much easier. 
11910 I wish it had a wider panoramic view, other than that it is awesome! 
11911 Replacement for lost charger works 
11912 Always can use extra mounts 
11913 It is not good ,l will not recommend it to anyone, 
11914 No problem! 
11915 This case works well, but after swimming, the lens fogged up, ON THE INSIDE 
11916 Thanks you! Great job. Shipment did arrive late:( 
11917 This is the safest option for me to carry my cards. There is been a couple of instances where the cards are falling out of their places, but not enough for me to dock a star off of this review 
11918 Very Well Satisfied. Thanks. 
11919 I bought this to save a little money, and it broke the second day I had it. 
11920 Flies very well inside the house but is no good for outside 
11921 i use this to hang images at comic cons and it works great! sturdy and easy to set up. held up all 30 images. awesome purchase! 
11922 The pictures turned out great!! 
11923 Good quality but do not fit as well. 
11924 Very good, auto-focus works as long as there is enough light. I prefer to use it with a zoom lens since with a prime the distance object - lens is too critical. 
11925 Good addition to the Roam 3 bundle, exactly what it is....nothing more....nothing less... 
11926 Like the others, very nice, I have seen some ?? hoodlums walk be and sort of glanced around to find the other cameras, some fake many many real ones J R 
11927 Solid image quality. Interface not as good as GoPro, but otherwise can t find a flaw. Gopro accessories work well with it. Get a lot of interference when recording with auxiliary power source. 
11928 Excellent 
11929 great lens for close up work at school. 
11930 Worked for me......Takes a bit a skill to get a fine adjustment......course adjustment is quick and once locked with the thumb set screw very stable. So far only used with a 28 MM lens which is fairly light. 
11931 Protect your investment. 
11932 Works extremely well as a baby monitor with a phone app! 
11933 I liked the product 
11934 One of the connector that holds the strap to the bag broke within 6 months, the other one keep coming off from the bag. The bag is too deep to reach Not efficiently designed for its size Good thing that I got it free when I bought camera 
11935 Its answer to all my needs. 
11936 Nice work fine. 
11937 Perfect for my application, and I love the small footprint it has! 
11938 as described,easy to use 
11939 Doesn t work at night .... Not sure if I have something plugged in wrong. 
11940 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
11941 theses lenses are not meant for ipod touch 5th generation. it keeps falling off of my camera. 
11942 I was a bit apprehensive after reading a few of the reviews, but after a week s use in the field in hand-held flash mode for my macro photography, I have absolutely no complaints. 
11943 FAKE BUT THEY LOOK REAL! 
11944 This is a perfect bag for just about everything I do. Great for travel, casual movement between offices, trip with the family. From clothes to electronics and everything else. Great construction and already has taken quite the beating. The bag is holding up great. 
11945 OK ... it s supposedly a NIKON-made shutter release but the price (almost $40) is ridiculous ! It s well-made but NOT worth that much money. 
11946 Batteries last all day , recharge pretty quick. No Problems. Can never have to many batteries. 
11947 Excelente!!! 
11948 Fair enough 
11949 Product arrived on time and as advertised. Otherwise, what an I say? They re cleaning cloths. A good value for the money, and they do a good job, both for my glasses as well as (gently) cleaning camera lens filters. 
11950 Great for my two light stands with light socket attached. 
11951 everything was as stated in the product description and the quality is as expected and the price is good too 
11952 worked well, no issues or flaws found in product 
11953 Cool 
11954 Works great! Just like the ones that came with my other lenses. 
11955 Happy with my purchase 
11956 Its controls are way easier than others I bought my kids. 
11957 Very please with it 
11958 Perfect bundle! 
11959 Too small......got a bigger one 
11960 Great tool to have in your bag, doing a lot of GoPro filming like I do. It s nice to have a tool to be able to tighten it so tight it will not move. Using this when you have high impact stress helps to improve your video quality. 
11961 I couldn t be happier! I use this for monitoring the children when it s nap time. Super crisp images night or day. 
11962 Perfect for me... small,compact and easy to use. 
11963 Out of the eight pictures taken, only 4 developed. I have never seen instant camera film this bad. 
11964 Great zink paper 
11965 Very nice cameras! 
11966 Sharp images and vivid colours. 
11967 Does the job without extra wiring. 
11968 Knew it was vintage, actually looked used. Came with European wiring and plug. Had to replace plug, which took up the cost of the lamp. 
11969 The only bad thing, was 3 of them broke before the end of the roll of film. We ll see how the photos turned out in a few days. 
11970 I wouldn t recommended this for photography.. I use it for electronic pass thought for my canon s lens so I can control the aperture. The auto focus is to slow for any type of photography use 
11971 Good for the most part. Wish the case was better quality though, especially the inside padding 
11972 Exactly what I needed 
11973 seem to work well. I have had others that did not 
11974 for the money, not a bad buy. 
11975 This lens is crisp and clear! I am in no way a professional photographer, but love to photograph as a hobby. This was the perfect addition to my basic lens. 
11976 Works great. Adds stability to vertical shots. Adds weight with two batteries. 
11977 Well built. But it is tall if you have on a tripod and the slider. 
11978 Could see in lens. 
11979 Really good product stands up to what it says 
11980 Work very well on plastic lenses. Never have enough of these. As good as anything I have tried in the past. 
11981 Love the case and functionality of this item 
11982 Good strap easy to use, connects with other Op/Tech products, makes it easy to swap straps when needed. 
11983 I just got this so we have sometime to try it out, but I plan on coming back with and updated 30day review! For the price this is amazing! It came with so many extras and I m really excited to take it with us to the pool tomorrow 
11984 Works as advertised! Not much more to say than that! 
11985 LASTS LONGER THAN ORIGINAL BATT WOULD BUY AGAIN!! 
11986 Amazing quality. Just wish I had opted for the slightly higher model that had wifi, so I could connect to my smartphone. 
11987 Great zoom 
11988 nothing is more trusting than foggy camera lenses. These have helped, haven t had any issues since using them. 
11989 Can t use auto focus but these little lens adapters are pretty neat 
11990 After testing all the accesories in different scenarios I can say that this bundle is very good, specially for the price. Only negative point is the weekness of selfie stick 
11991 Stands seem a bit top heavy! 
11992 Working Great 
11993 amazing camera wrist strap. bought it for my nikon d3300 and it worked perfectly 
11994 Love it! 
11995 Great product. Delivery was fast and the covers fit my Gopro perfectly. 
11996 I found it in parrot story US by22.99$ 
11997 Must use on flat surface 
11998 Absolute must have when buying the ski phantom 2 drone 
11999 Awesome case! 
12000 The Promaster adds an extra layer of protection to your lens. As a bonus, it does not distort your pictures. 
12001 very good 
12002 Simple device that works well for various photo ops. 
12003 It worked great and we loved the wrist strap 
12004 Works great 
12005 worked well 
12006 hi l hace neewer nw565ex is there any setting to remove the beep every time i take a photo 
12007 Received in timely manner and was as advertised 
12008 I like it 
12009 It shipped quickly, the product works perfectly for land or water. I am very satisfied with this model. 
12010 Excellent kit, batteries last longer than gopro batteries. 
12011 Remarkable camera. Amazing feature set and great IQ. Feels good in the hand. 
12012 Does just what i thought it could do. Perfect! 
12013 Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS 
12014 As advertised. 
12015 great light and can t beat the price. Works greats off camera with my two other Canon Speedlites. 
12016 .they all get along like one big happy family!! 
12017 Just what i needed. 
12018 Work fine and was what we were looking for 
12019 Glad to have another battery 
12020 Very good product 
12021 Great camera! Great video quality! This being said: The default IP differs from the documentation; the bundled software also kinda sucks... I recommend the Blue Iris software instead. 
12022 I love this selfie stick! Wonderful quality! I had before stick from be bath and beyond and the quality sucked! This stick is amazing: easy to manipulate, holds phone well and has a nice color! Love it! I always have it with me ;) 
12023 The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is really useless 
12024 Bought several of these cases. They work great and are a bargain. 
12025 Awesome value. Simple setup. Well done. 
12026 nice and compact but sturdy 
12027 was looking for an underwater stick to use for scuba/snorkeling.. this worked awesome 
12028 I love my filters! They improve my photos so much! 
12029 So far so good. I almost went with a SLR but prefer a pocket-sized because of so many activities with my kids. 
12030 Excellent, watches over the contents of my garage 
12031 I m so unhappy , the mobile holder was broken as you can see in the photo 
12032 Just as described. 8 year old loves it. There is a learning curve to flying but he has mastered it. There were a few crashes in the beginning but the copter held up fine. 
12033 Haven t put a 5 star yet because I m not 100% finished hooking up everything at the dvr, but so far everything is great!! Quality material and everything works. Can t beat the price either 
12034 great value except battery charger charges the batteries slow 
12035 I was worried about sacrificing quality to get such a...portable lens. I didn t have to worry. 
12036 Great Item. 
12037 Hands down the fastest I ve ever received any product. Great quality! Recommend to use this seller. 
12038 Excellent 
12039 Product packaging solid, fully applicable to outdoor sports, good quality, practical，I have used the suction cup and it did a fantastic job,and will use other accessories for a free time 
12040 Not bad 
12041 The on/off switch does not work with my Canon HF G-20 camera. Does the endless cycle (on/off) as has been reported on other cameras in review section. Zoom does work 
12042 Good quality bag. I use it for my Fuji X100S, which fits just barely. I wish Billingham made a bigger version, as well. I would love to use this as a camera sleeve for my Leica M. 
12043 Great exposure and very easy for me to use! 
12044 easy to use, just love it - this was a replacement as I lost the first one 
12045 Stick and move... This is better than a bare flash gun will ever be. Nice soft focused light. Cats wait for no man. 
12046 Terrible it didn t work at all, it didn t show any recording only lines across. Don t by it just try a different one. 
12047 So far, so good.. 
12048 I ve used this type of Nikon flash for years now. Very reliable, durable, great quality, always great performance. I like its light and compact size. 
12049 Wasn t quite as heavy duty as I thought it would be but it worked for the low price. 
12050 Am old school and like 35mm. This does a great job for what I need. 
12051 Great performance 
12052 I love the ability for family to send photos via email. 
12053 Unable to use the suction cup, I think it requires a housing for the gopro camera that snaps onto the suction cup and the same goes for the chest strap. 
12054 Great product and deal. I bought this for my son, who likes to make movies and he absolutely loves it. The stand is just a tabletop model, I thought it would be bigger, but it folds down, so my son leaves it on all the time. 
12055 So far, so good! Holds a big charge. 
12056 I am not really sure if it did cleaning job. I have not noticed any difference either in playing a tape or recording. 
12057 Battery type and no recharge when connected to computer. All other features are good. 
12058 A compact camera bag with comforted anti-theft features, nicely done! 
12059 Works great! 
12060 Worked ok but very disappointed that it did not come with the device. 
12061 Exactly what I was looking for 
12062 Nice deal and fast delivery 
12063 Great item. Quick shipping! 
12064 Works. I have not tried a battery drain but what I see so far looks great. 
12065 Does not seem to last as long as the Canon battery that came with my camera. But for the price I am satisfied. 
12066 Works great. Plenty of peices so you can get the camera at any angle you d like. 
12067 It works and charges 2 at once, but it feels cheap and the electronic display of the charge is wrong. 
12068 Lack of instructions with the piece means you need to do a little research, but works as expected. 
12069 Love it. I may look like a dork, but its easier to take selfies. Had to work a bit to download software, but stick works great. 
12070 Great product at a great value!!! 
12071 Perfect replacement if you lose your original lens caps and covers. 
12072 this does not work for a Canon 5d mark iii, they say it does but it doesnt. Will return. 
12073 Very useful. 
12074 Very nice in quality ! Happy with my purchase, also came a day early! 
12075 great bag for city shooting. Walked around downtown many times with this bag. 
12076 good 
12077 I m in love with this lens!!! I love not having to change lenses all the time!! Defiantly worth every penny!! And all the extras!!! Wow I was amazed!! 
12078 [[VIDEOID:69cd76e77c27154e03a263510f0419fe]] Camera take great videos. Came with lots of accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price.

12079 It fits! 
12080 Nice small camera bag, a little too fat once you put and extra battery in it, but it will work 
12081 i m glad i purchased the hand trap, however, i haven t used it yet but the cost was great. i ve seen lots of professional photographers using their hand strap so i m sure when i use mind I will be glad i purchased it. 
12082 Excellent !! 
12083 Did not work right out. The box I was hard to pair the controller to the unit and it did not hover it was all or nothing on speed And after about 60 min. Of run time all the unit wanted to do was flip. 
12084 I like it alot for the price. when panning or tilting it does not move very smooth but that is to be expected with a tripod in this price range. 
12085 Good looking product. Not to sturdy tho, it will fall apart soon..but for the time being, it will suffice. 
12086 It s a must 
12087 Only buy your batteries OEM. Period. 
12088 Fast delivery and great product 
12089 best 
12090 Great product. Wish the seller could give some different recommendations on how it could be used. I searched YouTube for all kinds of ways you can use the straps. I was able to put it on my ski boot while snow skiing. It was awesome shots! 
12091 Very good 
12092 The package really saved a lot of money for us. This has all the functioning accessories for a semi-professional photographer. 
12093 very nice portable instruction booklet that be placed into camera bag 
12094 Nice camera cover 
12095 it s great 
12096 how do I return it Can t get it to work most of the time on my Samsung Galaxy S 4 I phone. 
12097 too lightweight...not good at all 
12098 Worked as expected 
12099 for the price, they are exactly why we need. they aren t SUPER durable, but thats not what we are looking for. people knock over our flash stands ALL the time, so its nice to have something thats faithful and replaceable if broken. 
12100 Simple but it s nicely made and it works 
12101 Excellent 
12102 so far so good bought less expensive model a year ago and screen looked schattered with colors and was disappointed after my first one lasted so long without problems 
12103 My daughter loves her camera, and this film worked out well for us. 
12104 Love this product! 
12105 Very good price More importantly, the product works as advertised. I replaced the deteriorating mounts with the new mounts which immediately connected to the system through the wiring. Thus far, the product is operation properly. 
12106 Just what I needed 
12107 as advirtised 
12108 good product 
12109 Worked just as good if not better than the original I am on my fourth photo shoot and have 38% still active I definitely recommend these batteries 
12110 I swap out the batteries all the time, they charge quick and I always have a good battery to go to 
12111 Excellent GoPro pole. Light and medium sized. 
12112 NICE ITEM 
12113 It s good for its price 
12114 Works good. Camera quality is not the best but does a job. Easy to install. 
12115 This item worked nicely 
12116 I try this for my iPhone 6 Plus. The thing is top heavy and keep ripping over not matter how I adjust this thing. 
12117 cheap yet very good quality head mount for GoPro camera 
12118 Easy to set up and sync. Tried it with both mine and my husband s phones (Samsung S5 & S6) and worked great. Can t wait to take it on vacation. Extends easily and the product has a tight hold on my phone. Love the color as well :) 
12119 Great product. Highly recommend. 
12120 Good simple case that fits my Panasonic DMC-FZ70 perfectly. I keep battery and charger in front pocket and SD cards in flap pocket. I like it. 
12121 Very nice came one time 
12122 very good 
12123 Great bang for your buck 
12124 So far works and my VHS camera hasn t fallen off. 
12125 Great product and price! Fit on my Nikon lens without any problem. You won t be disappointed in buying this one. 
12126 The lenses are awesome, but the way they attach to the phone is really annoying and can crack your screen if you re not careful. Good lenses though. 
12127 The selfie stick looks very cute. The button is sensitive. The selfie stick is convenient to take picture. Like it very much. 
12128 Use these in my RV for a bit of security. Stay put and do the job. Great seller! 
12129 Used this on the three week trip to Alaska, knowing the my regular strap would kill my neck. Love this!!! 
12130 Love this lens. It was priced right and is excellent quality. I would recommend it to anyone that loves prime lenses. 
12131 Great product. Light and easy to carry. Heavy duty endurance! 
12132 The &#34;handle bar&#34; piece fits my roll cage in my car 
12133 Cheap product, memory card inserted all the way into the camera instead of clicking into place. You can t record on a card that is floating around inside the camera. 
12134 Good mounts and good price 
12135 You get a really cool perspective on your snokeling with this mask, relive the moments of feeding fish all around you! 
12136 I love this! I put it in a tote bag when I don t need my whole camera bag and gear and just look like anyone else on the street. 
12137 FAST, AS PROMISED 
12138 Good one I am using it for pat 2 years. 
12139 One side of my Big lights don t work. Other than that the product is a great buy. 
12140 Since the camera didn t come with it, I had to get this product, which complements it perfectly and the neoprene is comfortable. 
12141 This polarizing filter works extremely well for the price. I can detect no noticeable distortion in images in which it has been used. 
12142 Nice set of filters in a nice holder. The Polarizing filter works well with the UV used to protect the lens. 
12143 Fantastic ,works great and excellent service 
12144 Unbelievably efficient. 
12145 I d give it 5 stars if it were metal, otherwise it is very real. Photo sensor shuts it off during daylight to save batteries. The IR LEDs for night vision are just like the real thing. Very real looking if you are 10+ft away. 
12146 Got this for my mom. It is so easy to set up. We already loaded hundreds of photos and it has great quality. I thought this might be too big but it s perfect. Best gift ever. And the best part is that it will constantly be updated for her! 
12147 The zoom feature is nice, however the picture quality is not much better than my 800 TV lines of resolution from my Zosi camera at one third the price. Rain tends to stick to the lens and distort the image. 
12148 Worked as expected 
12149 These are replacement batteries for my new Leica Q. Rather than paying over $100 for Leica s battery, this Wasabi package includes two batteries, life same as Leica, and includes a great dual-volt charger. 
12150 very good tripod for photo and video. i recomand 
12151 Thx 
12152 Works perfect. Fast shipping. 
12153 So far, a good solid camera that takes good pictures. My daughter took it to Europe, and the pictures turned out pretty good. 
12154 This works alright. With snappier rounds, it can get a little loose. I haven t had a problem with my .22 or 9mm. We put it on my friends .40 and it tended to fly around a little. 
12155 Easy to set up and works great. 
12156 A+ 
12157 GREAT battery 
12158 Great lens 
12159 Great price fast shipping it works great 
12160 Purchased for the PowerShot SX700. Battery life appears equivalent or better than Canon battery that came with camera. Takes recharging well. Good to have reliable spare batteries for several hours of continuous camera use, with and without flash. 
12161 No need for an expensive one, this is all you need. Unless you like wasting extra money for no reason. 
12162 great product well worth the money... 
12163 Can t really ask for more so far so good awesome product 
12164 Excelent add-on to the GoPro, and nice bang for your buck. 
12165 Great little camera, easy to use. 
12166 Its camera was really awesome 
12167 i can even connect it with mywifi router also using its WPS button.all over i would like to 
12168 This is my first hefty photography purchase, I m a beginner and I would absolutely recommend this. It s been great so far. 
12169 Used it on vacation and got excellent photos. 
12170 I have to revise my initial review. This product mostly worked as advertised for about a month, maybe less then suddenly stopped working. I emailed the seller for guidance with no luck. Be Wary 
12171 Do not buy! Flies away on its own! Totally lost all my money and gopro4 
12172 Arrived earlier than I expected. I didn t like the packaging, but I like the bag very much--that matters. Fits my Canon SLR with a battery grip and an 18-135mm lens. There s still a room for one more lens but I don t wanna overload it. 
12173 I was pleasantly surprised at how well this portable vocal booth helped to isolate noise and give me clean vocals! I m very satisfied with it! 
12174 It works just as well as any lens cloth I ve used. Even though the top doesn t have a closure to keep the cloth in place I haven t had any problems with it falling out because it s a tight enough fit. 
12175 I love it! 
12176 for me, the price is equivalent with its quality. it is ok to shoot not quickly moving subjects. for better shoot, you need .... a tripod. a very very good tripod 
12177 Awesome!! 
12178 Works exactly as advertised. Has pockets and a drink bottle holder.. Makes it easy to hike around with the inspire 
12179 Just what I needed to replace my lost charger 
12180 well built tripod and I love it 
12181 very good product! 
12182 Solid buy for a much cheaper price than the canon version. I haven t used the canon version, so I can t necessarily compare the difference of the two. 
12183 The lights are great and illuminate my studio set for video and photo as expected. I would ve rated it a 5 star if it came with a carry bag. 
12184 I love this Will be using it on a trip in a few days But I have gotten some great selfie with this with my pets. 
12185 Received this product at a discount in exchange for an unbiased review This tripod is awesome!! We ve been using it with our kindle to watch movies! The legs are very flexible and we are able to make a stand that stands on our couch!! We love it!! 
12186 All perfect! 
12187 Does what it needs to do. 
12188 SO AMAZING. So cute and cheap& the texture of the front and back is bubbly. It is so amazing and holds the polaroids great!! 
12189 Its awesome cut my recharge time in half which allows me time for shooting pictures thank you 
12190 The item looks very good. Also, the seller is very responsive and supportive. 
12191 exactly what I needed. 
12192 well worth price for on the go Videos.. I use if for my Golf outings... nice !! 
12193 Superb glass quality achromatic lens, made in Japan. A rare find as new. Works great on my Sigma DP2 Merrill. 
12194 Got this as a gift, it came quick and was exactly what they wanted. 
12195 works great and super portable! 
12196 Great little tripod base. Legs are long which give solid support to the attached top heavy cell phone. 
12197 Perfect fit. Fast shipping. Thank you! 
12198 Yeah, I used this to store my anker charger and 2 extra batteries. I don t want to damage my battery so yeah. This thing keeps it getting crushed inside my backpack. 
12199 Purchased this for my GoPro Hero+LCD and it works great. It fits everything all my accessories and extra mounts I have with plenty of room. 
12200 Very delicate, instructions not very helpful. Broke second time using it. 
12201 Battery was an exact fit! Camera working great 
12202 Works like the original. 
12203 I used this to mount a Baby Monitor near my baby s crib. It is just okay. It doesn t grip that well and caused it to slide down all the time. I also bought another one with a better grip (cushion instead of plastic) and it s WAY better. 
12204 Exactly what I needed! 
12205 Fantastic Umbrella 
12206 Great product and shipped fast. 
12207 One star. 
12208 Feels cheap 
12209 THIS SD STORAGE CASE IS GREAT! 
12210 the perfect starter cleaning kit for a camera 
12211 A OK!! 
12212 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTC3eUorRMU Here is how I used it I think it worked great for us 
12213 [[ASIN:B00LAVA2OW EEEKit 8-in-1 Accessories Kit for Gopro HERO 4 Session LCD Black/Silver HD 3+/3/2/1 Camera]] It all came as advertised, and I am impressed with the assortment of accesories. I have not fitted the camera to these accessories yet, but it looks like it should all work. I m happy. 
12214 Great product and works as expected. 
12215 Absolutely amazing camera. More than I need. 
12216 you get what you paid for. items are not super premium but ok as they re not expensive, the straps for head and chest are totally worth it. 
12217 They do the job but if I would had known exactly what I was looking for I would have went with a better brand 
12218 This product is fine. It didn t get five stars due to the fact the band that holds the filters in place doesn t work to well. 
12219 I have two cameras now. Great picture, and lets me keep an eye on my dog while I m gone to work. 
12220 Very good generic cable for my cam 
12221 Thick, Soft! Will last forever. Beautiful flower design as you see it, orange/red, yellow, green with gold vase! :) 
12222 I upgraded a few months ago from the Canon t3i and I LOVE this camera! My quality of images has improved immensely, and it wasn t hard to learn how to use it. I would definitely recommend this camera! 
12223 its ok 
12224 smaller than I thought but work well - good price and quick delivery 
12225 Perfect! 
12226 my order arrived dirty 
12227 this backpack holds my dji phantom 2 vison plus v3 and all the equipment needed to fly except my ipad tri pod i have to carry it seperately and i still have one free hand.I don t know if it is the best backpack but it works perfectly for me. 
12228 They work 
12229 Firmware wrong! Don t buy 
12230 Awesome! Charges quickly and very easy to use. It is a must for Gopro users. 
12231 really good film. although taking pictures outside normally makes the picture over exposed. the film lasts for a long time and is just great over all. 
12232 Great quality images but super awkward to hold. I think that s ultimately why this body was discontinued. 
12233 This is such a good buy! It protects my camera from scratches and I get so much compliment on the case. 
12234 This has helped me so much! 
12235 Digital Goja was great, everything came as advertised. All the items were working properly. My only concern is that the Sigma Lens itself takes soft pictures, in general. I think it still is a good walk-around lens but I wish it could take sharper images. 
12236 I have both this camera and a Go Pro brand. I found this one to be much easier to use, lighter weight without feeling cheap and much less expensive! 
12237 Love this camera. Easy to use, takes great pictures. And takes AA batteries. 
12238 good price/value 
12239 Love my flip camera. I use in my classroom. 
12240 works as expected 
12241 Good quality mic with a very accessible price 
12242 Best Goods. I love it.!!! 
12243 Perfection 
12244 This is nice speedlite works like a charm. 
12245 Camera works fine 
12246 Good inexpensive lightweight portable tripod. Not to flimsy, good fit for small lightweight cameras. Nice to come with a carry case also. 
12247 I really like this viewfinder that enables you to take reflective readings, and it is easy to install and remove with the Sekonic light meter. Using the light meter with this has really helped my pictures. So far have just used it for landscape pictures. 
12248 Fullfill my expectations... 
12249 these are good cameras for the money 
12250 Works Great 
12251 I like the filter set but the filter holder could be a little stronger :):) otherwise the filters work well 
12252 It fits. Not loosening up 
12253 One battery can t last for 20 shots, though the other is fine. 
12254 It met my expectations. For the price, it s worth it. The resolution is somewhat limited. 
12255 I absolutely love these for the price! I bought one a year ago and just bought the 2nd. 
12256 Took it on mission trip to Guatemala. Gave more than 400 kids the first picture that they had ever had of themselves. Took picture of 88year old lady. When I gave it to her, she said it was first time she had a picture. 
12257 My stabilizer broke 1 DAY INTO SHOOTING! this is absolutely ridiculous & I would love to hear an explanation! 
12258 Some photographs are priceless...you ll ensure capturing the shot with a back up battery!!! This one will be used with my TG4 Olympus. 
12259 It works great with my Sony Nex 6. 
12260 Very good bridge camera. Options and online help have been very good. This kit from Amazon was all it promised, although I upgraded to faster/bigger memory right away. Very good photos, but best in class video. 
12261 Excellent product. 
12262 I got exactly what I needed for the price 
12263 They work well, and at a great price. 
12264 The batteries are great, the charger works, and it was a fraction of the price of the OEM version. 
12265 Had to replace..it did failed after several charges! 
12266 its not working...... 
12267 As described. Thanks 
12268 doesn t hold much 
12269 Showed up fast, works great. It replaced a DJI Vision 2+. 
12270 Perfect lens! 
12271 Great so far!, 
12272 Bad product that doesnt work at all 
12273 Great camera for the price. 
12274 Looks nothing like the picture on the box.Just clear through cheap plastic. Cant get the film roller to turn.Acts like it is locked into position. Then what could you expect for 10.00? Hopefully I can return it. 
12275 No complaints. 
12276 Great item, holds good charge, fits camera perfect. 
12277 Excellent product and seller. 
12278 Nice small simple camera. Does everything that I need a camera to do. 
12279 I needed a polarizer and lens hood for my zoom lens. This worked just fine. I like the cleaning brush. 
12280 Great for what it is 
12281 Great value, looking forward to purchasing other sizes for other lenses. 
12282 Great product, great price, no issues with it being refurbished. 
12283 battery works great. used with large Tamron 150-600mm lens and never wore out battery for a full day of wildlife shooting. 
12284 Plastic but feels good quality. Good for the money. Good as an entry level flash. 
12285 I might like it more if the product would have instructions on how to use it.. having great difficulty collimating my celestron reflecting telescope. 
12286 Love the color and touch screen and ease of use.... But it SUCKS UP YOUR BATTERY FAST. 
12287 Not quite what I expected 
12288 Excellent product with a comfortable grip and takes very good photos. 
12289 ok 
12290 Bought this for my son so he can use some legacy Canon FD lenses on his Canon digital camera. It works fine, and is well made. No problems focusing throughout the entire range. This is a good product. Recommended. 
12291 Great Picture ! 
12292 Delivered as advertised 
12293 Compact and useful. Wish I had had one of these years ago. 
12294 very useful but no adjustment of light 
12295 Total junk. Needle was stuck from time took it out and would never move. 
12296 Returned bought a different dropcam 
12297 Quality product, and one of the few I have seen that allow you to insert 4x6 pictures both horizontally and vertically, thereby allowing you to view vertical pictures without having to twist and turn the book around constantly. 
12298 Thanks 
12299 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
12300 High quality. Thick cable. Rugged. 
12301 Small but perfect for this camera. 
12302 This battery was perfect. I have a battery that came with my Canon EOS Rebel T5, but sometimes forgot to recharge. So I decided that backup battery would be best. No complaints at all. It charges well and fit perfectly inside of my camera. 
12303 Just came off of vacation, worked great. 
12304 Dont buy this unless you have a warehouse size studio. Too many pieces to assemble. I wish I had saved my money because I never use it. In fact, I ve never used it. 
12305 Very good!! 
12306 Thank you 
12307 Great product, great customer service! 
12308 as back up batteries PERFECT Work with camera charge time a little short 
12309 Perfect for the backpack 
12310 Very short range! Went back to my 5yr old bunker hill(works most of the time). 
12311 I have given this a 5 star rating because of the vast selection of attachments, the price and the speed at which it was delivered. Each item is sturdy and well built. Most impressed. 
12312 Excellent a must have for a Sony camera 
12313 Kenneth done the best cx service very helpful.so happy.nice camera 
12314 Great choice! great service from company! 
12315 My son loves it and uses it in our pool a lot. 
12316 works well 
12317 I hate it. Not comfortable. Still slips down when you lift the camera up to take a picture. Tried it for a long time, now looking for something better. 
12318 great working, looks fine. 
12319 These cameras have very poor color rendition. 
12320 Good lens for shooting moon. 
12321 I loved it! Thank u ! 
12322 Photos came out fantastic!! I have an older Polaroid that I found at an estate sale and I was very hesitant about with to get for it. This site helped me a lot! Although it came out a little more yellow it had more to do with the Polaroid. 
12323 I love this. It s wonderfully sturdy with a great grip, and yet compact enough to carry in the tripod straps of your camera bag. Easy release attachment at the top is an extra plus. Well worth the price. 
12324 Works as advertised 
12325 Perfect fit case. 
12326 Very nice camera 
12327 Everything works and does the job. Light weight and easy to carry, like to a waterfall. Not made for rough handeling and I would not recommend use by children as the legs could be bent. 
12328 Didn t use right away. By the time we started using it, found out that there was a glitch in the remote and had to spend an additional $50 for download cable and update, just so we could use the remote control 
12329 A little bit tight for my WB350F but still a decent case. 
12330 great product. Works as described 
12331 Picked this up for my light painting brushes, seams well made, and is just the right size for all my flashlights and attachments. 
12332 Nice eyepieces.I have purchased several of these--the 31mm,19mm,10mm and 7mm all work as advertised 
12333 The 3 second delay between detected motion and picture taken along with poor focus gave no useful pictures. 
12334 It doesn t come with the memory card as of Aug 2015. 
12335 This did not work. It did not pick up dust from the sensor of my digital camera. 
12336 Perfect size and nicely padded. 
12337 My granddaughter loves this, 
12338 Know that this product comes from China and may take time to arrive. Product works nice in that it covers both the eye piece as well as the LCD screen. Only downside is that it easily rocks back and forth (left and right) fairly easily. 
12339 Exactly what it said it was. Fits my Canon 18-135mm EF-S perfectly. 
12340 Looks real! Especially for the price! 
12341 This battery pack was the perfect replacement. The price was was fair as well. Highly recommend. 
12342 It took weeks to get here from China. Phantom 3 fits in there great. You have to remove the tablet holder from the remote and no place for tablet inside. Not super rugged, but is much better than a floppy, soft-sided bag. Couldn t beat the price! 
12343 not work with my printer!!!(Polaroid Zip Instant Mobile Printer) 
12344 Nice little camera case. 
12345 worked well while scuba diving no wories about camera floating off 
12346 great for a beginner like me. 
12347 DOES NOT WORK WITH THE NIKON D3200. 
12348 I love this product so much.... I have searched all over for something that was suitable for my camera and I finally found it. The price is perfect, the quality is very good and the slider is perfect and ready to go whenever you need it. I highly recommend it! 
12349 Easy setup, better video quality than the garbage cameras I used to install in Wal-Marts and the remote monitoring, motion detection, sound, wireless capabilities are all a plus. A consumer friendly product with commercial grade (or better) uses. 
12350 Works great with Nikon 18-140mm NIKKOR (67mm). See attached photo made with +4 close up. 
12351 came quickly, works well. 
12352 It makes people look younger!!!! Great one!!!! 
12353 Perfect for small camera. 
12354 The microscope works well but the package was received without the CD and the free CD memory. RL 
12355 Took it to 80 feet, no problem. 
12356 It is literally useless 
12357 it gets the picture in negative color them drops to static and its only 30 feet away. Waste of money 
12358 very cheso and a waste. 
12359 Like it very much 
12360 Great set for new photographer. 
12361 Great little optic - very handy for hunts on the move! 
12362 Works perfectly for my gopro hero3, battery pack, and lcd screen. No issues charging. 
12363 Handy and useful! 
12364 The strap is comfortable but not without problems. Most importantly, the metal buckle reaches around to the fragile camera LCD screen so it can potentially damage it. 
12365 Never held a charge. Useless. 
12366 Doesn t work from the pc. I can only use it with my iPad. Very buggy and not worth the purchase. 
12367 Product as expected. 
12368 love this product. 
12369 Works great for trouble shooting. 
12370 Love the variety in the patterns/designs. Perfect for my 13 yr old and her cousin 
12371 I would love to be able to rate this product, however it came with no instructions... I would probably give it more stars if I could use it. 
12372 Excellent Quality 
12373 Junk! 
12374 I matched this with a Opteka MP100 monopod for a trip to Africa, as a full tripod would be too bulky to carry and use on Safari. 
12375 Perfect! 
12376 Wonderful quality. Not lightweight but carries well with its shoulder strap. I didn’t think I could afford binoculars this nice. 
12377 These were a great cost effective replacement for our stock cannon batteries. worked great. 
12378 I was hoping it would be a bit smaller, but its super loud and great otherwise. Definitely makes me feel safer. 
12379 This charger does the trick. I plug in 5 batteries and an hour or so later they are all charged and ready to go. That gives me a good 45 minutes of flying time to include changing them out. Much better than the one-battery charger that comes with the quadcopter. 
12380 lot of camera for the dollar 
12381 It stated it fit my camera but it didn t. Otherwise the quality was good 
12382 As good or better than the original batteries! 
12383 This is beautiful, looks amazing, Exceeded expectation for appearance. Don t know yet about how it holds up. 
12384 Light but strong lens cap keeper without any exposed metal scratchy parts. 
12385 it works great 
12386 So happy 
12387 GREAT EQUIPMENT at a GREAT PRICE!!! 
12388 Great product....the quality of the video really good too. My son really enjoys it. It is great family fun for all of us. 
12389 What a deal! These work just fine and the price is right. 
12390 Simply awesome 
12391 I m hoping these batteries will last longer than the last ones I purchased. 
12392 Did not work. 
12393 Great! Live the product...records great...just had to get extra device for cell phone viewing! But very happy overall thanks 
12394 This is an amazing camera. Super easy to set up. Great app. I can check on my home anytime. I can move the camera by swiping the screen. I am ordering additional cameras for other areas of my home. Great camera, great price! 
12395 After ordering and receiving the camera lens I found that it didn t fit, I contacted the reseller they sent an adapter ring, it works fine now. I am very happy with this reseller they went out there way make thing right. 
12396 Ordered 2 and both did not work. 
12397 Batteries don t fully charge or hold a charge for very long. Total waste of money. Don t buy. 
12398 Good!! 
12399 Very Good 
12400 I got this lens for wild life photography. It is heavy, but well worth the trouble. I ve gotten great shots across a lake, without any loss of image quality. This lens is Sigma s better quality, better sealing, better glass. I think it s great!! 
12401 Love it. Fast delivery 
12402 Not sharp at all. I use this for skateboarding 
12403 Worked perfect. Unfortunately the item I got it for was a piece of crap. But I ll hang onto this, never know if I ll need it. Sucks, cause now I don t actually need it. Grrr! oh well.... 
12404 I use this everyday and it produces some excellent pics plus other photographers are always interested in my camera. 
12405 Sharp. I use this lens all of the time. 
12406 Does not work with my camera as advertised..Total rip off. So disappointed. Might stop shopping on Amazon. Sellers require no creditabilty. 
12407 I would not describe as pro-grade but probably comparable to other tripods for the price. 
12408 Worked Flawlessly. 
12409 Great warning system that is inexpensive yet gets the job done. 
12410 Works as described although as many people have said and I can attest to it that the IR extender receiver doesn t work. 
12411 Spectacular lens. Extremely sharp on the Pentax 645Z, great contrast, and small footprint. Great grip. Little to no flare, even shooting directly into the sun. Only minor quibble is that there is some purple fringing against bright light. Fantastic value. 
12412 Recommended by fro knows photo, yeah its OK, pretty simple, limited use since there is no zoom. 
12413 This did not meet my expectation at all. I returned it to the vendor. 
12414 Solid product and a good cost benefit. Great for everyday shooting. Good materials and well made. 
12415 Makes you feel like a pro! Love all sides and works great for making pics better lighting 
12416 This was far better quality than I expected for $10. 
12417 works just like the originals 
12418 Didn t charge anymore after the first power up 
12419 Nikon does not recommend. Suggested using them could possibly void warranty. Returned for refund. 
12420 Loved it I take it wherever I go! 
12421 This camera is a must for every hello kitty fan. It s adorable and very much worth the price. Easily the cutest camera I have ever owned & a crowd pleaser as well. 
12422 Great product, high quality, arrived quickly in the mail. 
12423 Works but battery doesn t fit 100% straight away. Gotta jiggle it to snap on. 
12424 They fit well, good replacement! 
12425 good 
12426 These are legit. 
12427 Well designed, very functional. Light weight. 
12428 Bad battery. if leave charging all night will only fill half battery but if you leave charging for a couple hours will be 90% but don t last to long before die so I can t charge overnight and I can t trust when is full. 
12429 Caps better designed than original manufacturer s cap. 
12430 Used our floats at the beach and they worked very well. Love the bright colors for easy detection in the water. Only concern is the thin cord which could break easily. Only time will tell for that. Excellent customer service! 
12431 Fantastic little radio triggers!! Love em. 
12432 This battery did not work. Will never buy again. 
12433 Has been a great pack for my SLR! It has kept it safe on hikes and during travel! 
12434 Everything arrived in a timely fashion. All was as advertised. Best of all the hoods and filter work well together and readily go on my 52 mm lenses. I am very satisfied. 
12435 Perfect 
12436 Perfect fit. Sturdy. 
12437 A++++++++ 
12438 works like a charm! 
12439 Its just good 
12440 A gift--got rave reviews. 
12441 This worked great for about three months then the legs started loosening up. 
12442 This is great looks almost faded though. Not real bright. 
12443 Didn t work out for me 
12444 Excellent 
12445 Named after horseradish LMAO!! Works okay and price is good. Just for backup. I use the Nikon battery as long as it has juice. 
12446 Love it. Who would have thought that something so inexpensive could make my $250 Canon speedlite better. Fits perfectly and seems to provide 
12447 Optically excellent. I m coming from the crappy 28-100mm f/3.5-5.6 kit lens from 2002. If your sample has the squeak it s really annoying. Oh, well. That s what I get for going the cheapest used I could find. 
12448 It s handy and compact, but sometimes the camera makes it too top-heavy if you re using it as a tripod...the little legs are not enough of a base. Works well for hand extension though! 
12449 Pretty good. Better than low end go pros but not as good as the very expensive ones. But for the price you can t complain. 1080p 30fps and a screen. 
12450 very good for this price, i use rarely, so, cant say a lot about it 
12451 Gr8 product for the price i pay 
12452 Fits my Panasonic Lumix camera at a great price for 2 batteries and charger. Charger also recharges Panasonic battery that came with the camera. Panasonic doesn t provide charger for the battery. Camera has to be plugged in & that is a nuisance. This way I always have extra batteries. 
12453 liner not glued very well! selfie stick spins around!! HEAD GEAR GREAT!! 
12454 Doesn t work. or i was sent a remote with a dead battery 
12455 Loving this Dlink Wireless 
12456 Works perfectly 
12457 Very good quality, indistinguishable from a name brand item. 
12458 Love the improvements. 
12459 For the price it is great. It takes some getting use to for opening but it makes sense when you see it 
12460 Love this camera. The price is really good compared to the same exact model at Best Buy. 
12461 Convenient for my DSLR. Haven t tried remote but that was one of the major reasons I bought this package. Great combo. 
12462 Gets the job done.clear picture works great. 
12463 Good price ... exactly as expected. 
12464 Excellent 
12465 Very good quality for the price 
12466 This is the new hobby to keep me relatively 
12467 Good, versatile bag. Nice solution for dividing compartments and to take out the entire cushion assembly. Very good weatherproofing. I am missing smaller organizing pockets, say, in the flap. Carrying options: shoulder strap, hand carrying strap, attach to suitcase. 
12468 items are ok to use. 
12469 Glad to see I m not the only one who couldn t fold the thing back up!! Will be making a trip to YouTube for a video! Great size though! Large enough for someone to get in and move around comfortably. 
12470 Easy to use and the included case is a plus 
12471 Love it 
12472 So in love with the cell phone mount for my go pro. Now I can take it to theme parks and it s easier to record/shoot pictures and videos! I do recommend this product to other people!! 
12473 the stand is pretty good quality for its price.............the fabric is thick and heavy...........i would buy again 
12474 Battery fit into charger but could not get battery out of charger. Had to use a small screw driver. 
12475 only used it for a day and it broke. Invest the extra bucks for quality. Lesson Learned 
12476 I like it 
12477 Excelente producto. 
12478 I bought this lens as a gift for my boyfriend and he loves it. It came to my house right on time and there are no problems with it. Overall it was a perfectly successful order. 
12479 Great 
12480 Great lens cleaners at an unbeatable price. 
12481 Didn t work at all! 
12482 it really helps when video recording with a camera that has no light 
12483 So far so good. 
12484 The product was perfect in condition and package was apt. I d recommend this to anyone looking for an intermediate level photography. 
12485 Great product! 
12486 Works perfectly and such a great deal. Definitely recommend for shots where a slow shutter speed is needed and you want to eliminate any camera shake. 
12487 Like the idea it seems to work but there is no way to play SD card on your computer you have to use the dvr I thought you would be able to emailed several time hard to get point across its sitting in a box 
12488 works great the only downer is my lens cap does not fit it as it is bigger opening but it functions like a pro. 
12489 Took it and phone to shop and they couldn t get anything out of even after hours of trying to charge it. 
12490 Great color. I should have gone with a smaller width. I ended up cutting mine, which was a pain, so keep that in mind. Paper is very sturdy and suits my needs well. I love not having to deal with fabric wrinkles. 
12491 Awesome idea. Didn t fully test it but I also bought Joto waterproof pouch and brought my iPhone on the river. 
12492 the best thing ever ;) 
12493 Looks good and fits well. A good idea for protecting the lens but have no way of evaluating the optical benefits. 
12494 Illuminati 
12495 a great handycam 
12496 Excellent product. Strong, light and easily carried on airplanes. Brilliant idea. Works well with my SonyAE7R light-weight full-frame. I ve had several Manfrotto products, and I like them all. 
12497 The seams are very visible, and my white backdrop was torn. 
12498 Absolute piece of crap. After the update it won t work anymore. Hugely disappointed! DO NOT BUY! There is no way to contact the manufacturer for a replacement or anything. It s a rip off. Amazon needs to step in and stop these douchebags from selling here. 
12499 Recommended. :) 
12500 works fine 
12501 Great, worth the price 
12502 I like it, good for the price 
12503 A great package! Everything is new, all counted for. The price is awesome for how much accessories you get with the camera. I think this bundle is the lowest priced on Amazon... or any market. On time shipping! 
12504 Great if you want a 40 mm. 
12505 Have been using this for our trip to california,oregon,washington and canada. Couldn t be happier and at such a great price!! 
12506 Love this camera does everything i want, takes great pictures and its pink! 
12507 It works well but have to be right on your idem to bee looked @ 
12508 Worked fine. 
12509 works great 
12510 Best carry on case you can buy... worth every penny. I use this for traveling in the Middle East and R&R carrying my Mac Air, Samsung Tablet 2014 Edition, iPad Air 2, ext. HDD, and charging cables. 
12511 Best drone for the price. Great company and deal with the extra batteries. 
12512 Doesn t allow you to add battery grip, unable to close. 
12513 Camera works great! Only downside is that the box didn t include a manual or memory card. 
12514 Very good item 
12515 Awesome product! 
12516 You can t beat it. It took the place of two lens that I have. 
12517 Great light. Just wish it was AA or AAA instead 
12518 The item showed up 4 days earlier than promised. The item is of high quality and I d recommend it to a friend 
12519 Book I received with it was not in English 
12520 Light weight, very adjustable, great fees tires. 
12521 The work great! 
12522 ok 
12523 small need extra to be studio 
12524 The arm are not very flexible, hard to bend.... 
12525 Not nearly as roomy as I thought it would be. 
12526 Handle with care! First time I mounted it, I got it stuck on my lens. Second time it got stuck in the body of my D7100. I would highly recommend getting a filter wrench at the same time you purchase the ring. 
12527 solid case/great for price 
12528 I can t say enough about this product, it does exactly what I wanted and it sharp corner to corner. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a Ultra-Wide. 
12529 The materials are good and sturdy, the parts fit together nicely, but putting in the rods requires a bit of strength. My recommendation is to put it together and leave it assembled. This one is the perfect size for my purposes. 
12530 Excellent purchase. Very fast shipping. The flash kit comes as described and fitted perfectly on my Nikon D7000. It worked wonderful. I really loved the difusser. 
12531 Falls off camera too easily, already lost this viewfinder 
12532 came with missing screw 
12533 its a decent quality camera for the price. just wish that it would also record so wont have to watch it every so often. the cloud notifications dont fully work, other then this it allows me to see whats going on in my place while im not home. 
12534 Love it its so cute and able to carry any where :) 
12535 Love this lens,. Light, small, and photo quality is awesome,. Using it together with my D7000, takes good sharp photos,. really like it a lot. 
12536 Bought to calibrate laptop screen. Works exactly as it should and it was easy to use. 
12537 ok for the money, but not what i wanted so i returned it for a higher quality and more expensice tripod 
12538 Perfect for keeping all of my photos safe and organized. Love this will purchase again. It actually arrived sooner than I thought it would couldn t be happier with this purchase. 
12539 Great camera using it to film skateboarding with a neewer 37mm fisheye and opteka x grip 
12540 Perfect for what I needed. Great quality. 
12541 taped thru the middle all the way across. folded like an accordion so folds won t come out..can t use as a background. 
12542 Definitely good to have extra batteries when you re out and about. If you re filmong for the day, you don t always have a place to recharge. Fast shipping. Good price. 
12543 Works like original. 
12544 The case is really nice. It s sturdy, well made and comfortable when wearing it. My only complaint is there is no place to put prop guards. I have to carry my prop guards outside of the case. 
12545 Nice, love. 
12546 These are good, they do what they re intended, which is to power an IP security camera, and are not expensive. 
12547 The screw in version installs differently than the bayonet mount (aside from the obvious difference). This video was extremely helpful in getting the latch closed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CsoNmlFZMU Be sure to run your finger over the latch from the attached side rather than trying to just push it in. 
12548 The product was OK. Would not fit my Camera. I think it s the Camera. 
12549 I was looking forward to receiving these but I was disappointed. They were already broken before I could put them on. One of the arms was in a few pieces 
12550 I will probably use the parts to make something different. 
12551 Ok. 
12552 Great case 
12553 Nice and small and works well 
12554 When I used this, it completely drained a newly charged camera battery in 3 hours. Thankfully I own a backup battery. Otherwise it s awesome! 
12555 It wasnt exactly what I had in mind, but was easily adaptable so great! 
12556 I would definitely recommend this product. Good value for money and looks great. 
12557 Amazing gopro piece ! 
12558 This film turned out great! Just keep your exposure to the darkest you can. 
12559 the image quality of the camera was terrible so I returned it... not sure if my camera was defective or generally the 240p sucks! Setting up its wireless connection was so easy and using it whenever there is an outlet was practical. 
12560 Works like a charm... nice clean professional look 
12561 works well 
12562 The size it s very practical, too small. 
12563 Love Canon products... they seem to surpass most other brands with features and performance... 
12564 Amazing very sturdy mount stays in 5 out of 5 
12565 A bit snug for my camera, but it is very nice and it was a great price! 
12566 I love this lens, picture quality is very good. I was unsure about going with a brand other than nikon but glad I did now 
12567 Doesn t work outside USA 
12568 Very fast service. Great to work with. Camera is very nice. 
12569 i ve owned other B+W protective filters and bought this one based on those previous experiences. i m very happy with the quality of images that i m able to capture on a sony a7r. it s like the filter isn t even there. great product. 
12570 good and fast 
12571 The sticker did not fit and fell off right away. Terrible item. Waste of money. 
12572 Got this for my Canon T31 and it works perfectly, also works well on my film camera. Great product and great price! 
12573 They work. A couple have been in use for a few months now without issue. This was a good buy. 
12574 They work great and the picture quality is good. My only complaint which has nothing to do with the camera at all is that they are not cheap to develop. 
12575 Very good ! I love it !!!! 
12576 Works great. Very happy with the purchase. 
12577 Using on my Fujifilm S1 camera. Great price and a product I will recommend. 
12578 I bought these for my Nikon Coolpix L830 and they seemed to do the trick! I am happy with the product, thanks again Amazon! 
12579 Came with chinese firmware and seller only directed me to Dahau. Dahau support is non existent. This camera is actually the lowest end Dahau..I would suggest the 2xxx or 4xxx models over this for a fe more $ 
12580 Great Product 
12581 Everything okey 
12582 Fiddly to set up but it does work. 
12583 Worked out really nice. 
12584 What can I say....it broke 3 minutes into my ride. It was lose so I gave it another turn and it fell apart. Plastic junk. 
12585 what a great kit for a great price 
12586 Flash will not work anymore. Only 1 day after purchase. This thing is bad!!! 
12587 It was nice 
12588 This is a good deal - two batteries, a house charger, and an adapter for the car, all at a good price. 
12589 Worked as expected. Thank you. 
12590 you will not regret spending the high price on this one 
12591 Awesome product and great customer support by POMBO! Quality camera and accessories at a amazing product = satisfied customer 
12592 Perfect for the price every thing works but I have one complain, the screw that holds the position of the suction cup is no holding it, but the other things are perfect!! 
12593 It doesn t zoom well 
12594 Good quality. Great price. 
12595 all the pieces work great with my GoPro HERO! 
12596 Nice 
12597 So far, its been outstanding. Lens is sharp for such as wide range zoom and the noise on he camera is remarkably low at iso 6400. 
12598 met and/or exceeded all expectations 
12599 Difficult to set up but once it is set up correctly, it works like a charm. If your kit weighs more than about 3-4 lbs, this is not the stabilizer for you. 
12600 Love this. Is not auto-focus on Ds3100, but I prefer to use manual. 
12601 Lens caps fit perfect on my Pentax Digital SLR. Package arrived on time! 
12602 Very useable and interchangeables. 
12603 I have this camera. It worked for a few months and I got a few worthwhile images from it. It likes bright sun and works well in the water. The good thing about this camera is the price. 
12604 Excellent camera strap! Very fashionable and useful strap. 
12605 Price was good and its a great battery for the Phantom 1.. 
12606 SONY engineering always seem to make weird design decisions. This time, they removed the IR receiver which has been available in all previous models. So I can flip the LCD screen 180 degree but there is no easy way to trigger the shutter. Brilliant!! 
12607 Too much noise. Any suggestions on how to reduce the noise? (AIR) 
12608 looks good 
12609 It s just a tripod inside a box. The tripod itself is fine, but don t market it as &#34;with a bag&#34; if you re not going to include it. 
12610 Worth the money, filters add more creativity, but are hard to focus with them on. 
12611 I love this camera. Takes good pics and is very user friendly, not a ton of confusing buttons. It s kind of bulky and it s hard to find a case that fits it, but I would say that s the only con. 
12612 Fits the tripod well. Looks k=like it will do the job needed 
12613 Fantastic Little Tripod That Will Grip Almost Anything!!! 
12614 Great filter, spendy but high quality professional. 
12615 not what I expected. 
12616 This battery from Sterlingtek works just as good as the Nikon battery that came with my d7100. Great purchase! 
12617 Great gift item. 
12618 Does what it needs to. 
12619 I ONLY GOT ONE SET, NOT TWO! SO this was a JOKE of a product! 
12620 This item ripped in several places on the first use. The quality was horrible. 
12621 Works perfect on any 50mm lens, bought it for my Canon. Works great! 
12622 Good 
12623 Bad product and bad documentation, it has issues to function. It is surprisingly that a leader brand like Nikon develops a product like this. Another story is the software which is realy poor. I don t recommend it 
12624 This bag was much better than I anticipated! I was originally going to buy myself a different bag! But this one will definitely do the trick! 
12625 works just fine 
12626 Excellent case,rugged and it s Waterproof,just right for a GoPro Camera. 
12627 Excellent quality at a great price. Fit my light perfectly. 
12628 great battery. 
12629 I very much like the camera, but there was no lens cover or instruction Manuel 
12630 Great simple way to carry your lens cap. Stays on tight. 
12631 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
12632 good 
12633 Great mini tripod, what you would expect from Manfrotto, stylish, light, usable and the mobile phone attachment is very easy to use. 
12634 It has a lot of use and think it is really reliable. 
12635 I d highly recommend for ease of use and a balanced posture. If you shoot a lot, this is very handy. 
12636 Just fine 
12637 ok 
12638 Not up to the expectation. Would recommend Nikon COOLPIX S5300 instead of this model. 
12639 Exactly what I wanted. Easy to install. Very flexible to meet differing needs. Used for protection in my separate garage. 
12640 It works 
12641 Definitely not a GoPro 4 Silver, but that is not what is aiming to be. Simpler controls and a more responsive LCD screen make this camera great for beginners and people on a budget. I would highly recommend this over the HERO. 
12642 I really enjoyed the product and the pouch is incredibly handy for stowing safely, however the Polarized lens does not screw in tight. It stays put, but will come off if pressure is applied in the outward direction. 
12643 as expected 
12644 It is so nice to have back up batteries for whatever purpose, so the price and quality of this product was great! 
12645 Easy to use. Sleek. I like the options for uploading pictures. My husband enjoyed his birthday gift. :) 
12646 Great batteries 
12647 Exactly as expected delivery was a bit slow. 
12648 Use is monitor my baby as baby monitor, it works very well. 
12649 Does not make a smooth uninterrupted scan no matter how fast, slow or careful you are with it. You get what you are willing to pay for it, I guess. 
12650 Expensive, but worth the money. Comfortable, well designed, good quality. 
12651 Great câmera. I had some trouble ajusting the flash light when taking pics on a sunny day. But the camera is super fun to use and practical too 
12652 Connected to raspberry pi. Works like a charm. Worked right out of the box. Definitely worth the price. 
12653 Comfortable. 
12654 I am having a blast with this little camera. The photos are small but they are tons of fun. I like the double-exposure feature for creative special effects. (Note-there is trial and error involved in that! But it s fun and works). Great colors in the prints 
12655 Great! 
12656 Love it! 
12657 This camera is mediocre at best. I recommend going to Walmart and buying a canon elph for less. I own a 7d and iPhone 5s. I prefer iPhone 5s over s110 pics. 
12658 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos.

12659 ok 
12660 Convenient, space saving way to hang multiple backgrounds 
12661 Love it! Great quality at an affordable price. Safely packaged and quick delivery. 
12662 Great camera easy to set up except for the wifi portion which I have yet to figure out. But love being able to spy on my pets at home. Night vision works. I like all the functions of the camera. 
12663 The usb charging port already broke. 
12664 Excellant binoculars ...(and I bought used ones!) 
12665 The color was a little off between materials, but the thing is very usefully and I am happy I bought it. 
12666 Awesome, does so much more than I expected! 
12667 Lens came fast and in perfect condition. Its a quality lens and takes great photos. 
12668 I couldn t get this harness to fit at all. I m female 5 5&#34;. When I adjusted it to the correct length I was unable to raise my binoculars to my eyes.Definately not a product that will work for everyone. Returned without any problems. 
12669 Cool. 
12670 love it 
12671 Good quality. Sturdy.. only problem is blue tooth not compatible with my phone :( other than that, good product. 
12672 The is a great deal and a GREAT drone. Tons of support videos on YouTube. The only manufacturer with a 60 warranty with support in USA. 
12673 Best deal I could find 
12674 No issues with this replacement battery for my Canon elph. Haven t stressed it to much, though; just casual usage. 
12675 Excellent tripod. I ve had it for about 10 years. 
12676 Broke right out of the box. 
12677 Nice 
12678 Saves my lens from scratches 
12679 help some 
12680 Does the does as expected. 
12681 Works well! 
12682 Great batteries. 
12683 New to FPV, if have found the technology to be challenging. But my learning curve has been appreciably accelerated by these folks. They sell great products, backed-up with great documentation and, most importantly, superior after-the-sale support. 
12684 I love this canvas, wish it was bigger. 
12685 Garbage, does not work!! 
12686 Best Price for a solid bundle! Hands down worth it! Thank you for this! 
12687 Nice camera strap it fits well 
12688 Worked fine when I first got it, and now a few months later, I go to record and nothing. No sound. 
12689 This photo studio is large and everything is high quality. May need to add more lights if it s pretty dark but works well for gloomy day product shoots and it gives it the extra light needed. 
12690 Great product 
12691 All the harnesses work great but the hand bar is unstable and always fell over, I had to tape it right side up. Everything else works great! 
12692 Wished it had an auto focus. But other than that, love it. 
12693 Perfect! 
12694 Great product and quick delivery. 
12695 Great item , makes for very nice and interesting camera angles. 
12696 Henry was helpful and patient in assisting me in setting up the camera and on my phone. These cameras are very durable and have good quality for the price. 
12697 Great, very very strong light! I ve said it before and I ll say it again... SATISFIED customer! Love it!! 
12698 So far so good. Only time will tell if this is a product worth more stars. 
12699 For the price and quality it worked just fine. I do recommend any one to get a heavy duty tripod. 
12700 Used these on a recent rafting trip, everything worked great! Selfie stick is as everyone has pointed out... Not great, the weight of the camera in a housing causes it to flip around on you. 
12701 Great set for the price. Didn t come with any explanation as to what lense is used for what purpose. Overall pleased. 
12702 Case Logic DCB-304 
12703 Works as expected, fits my Trek Alpha series just fine. 
12704 Perfect 
12705 Love it! 
12706 Awesome product sent in record time. 
12707 very nice product! nice and clear and does not affect my usage of my go pro. protects my screens well. thanks! 
12708 works as described 
12709 Good product as advertised. Pictures turned out very good and used at Cancun resort. 
12710 Good very good job 
12711 Received it a few days later than expected but no worries! 
12712 Bought this lens for Milky Way astrophotography and was not disappointed. Great lens for the price, so long as you don t mind manual focus. The nikon version comes with the right interface for the camera to control aperture, so all of the auto exposure stuff will work. 
12713 The transparent crystal case fits and goes perfect with my daughter s instax mini 25 hello kitty camera. She loves it and thank you. 
12714 Cut my finger on a shard of steel that was leftover from the machining process on one of the balljoints. But the arm works well, locks into place, and is stable. 
12715 Was perfect for our daughter s wedding photo booth! 
12716 I wanted extra batteries for an upcoming research trip to Mongolia. Sadly, this held an incredibly low charge and was next to useless. Very disappointed. 
12717 lots of mounts 
12718 The only time that is a good thing 
12719 I got this because I m a bit p-noid sometimes...this only made it worse!! I get it and test it out, the signal was going off every where, my tv, my ceiling fan, my cable box and spots in my ceiling I which is probably an electric junction box. 
12720 As advertised, fits the camera like a glove 
12721 Perfect solution to lighting up our pond at night and shutting the lights off from inside our home. 
12722 Works as described! Alerts me on my iPhone of any movement or noise in my home. App allows me to see what s going on from wherever I am. Works day and night. 
12723 BEST SELLER... HOPE TO DEAL WITH YOU AGAIN, 5 STARS FOR SURE 
12724 easy set up - high def only thing is that not enough controlled access when used as a nanny web cam compared to another webcam that i ditched [Belkin], this one never lost connection to the network 
12725 Seem fine and strong, but only time and many uses will really prove these as good product. They are fatter than most of my other Nimh AAs, so they don t fit well in some applications. 
12726 Camera is OK for the price. A little slow on focusing and pictures are not spectacular, but it is a decent enough point-and-shoot for brightly lit scenes. 
12727 Mounts the the bag and does not move at all. Awesome build quality 
12728 My new favorite lens 
12729 great quality mount. holds firm and is easy to setup 
12730 Good looking fake camera. Happy with the purchase, 
12731 Good for this price 
12732 Very nice Case for my camera. Looks sturdy and cool. Would recommend it 
12733 very good 
12734 Fast and Reliable. Will order again soon! 
12735 protects tiny camera 
12736 keeps it floating... 
12737 Works exactly as it should. There s not much to say about it, it s a handle that floats. When dropped into the water it floats as it should. I ve never had problems with the mount either. The strap is comfortable and can tighten on your wrist. 
12738 Henry Campbell helped with the issues with my foscam setup, he finished within 5 minutes, all of their technical support persons have good knowledge 
12739 Very easy to use. AFFORDABLE, STURDY. I have used it many times for off camera flash projects. WOULD BUY AGAIN! 
12740 Prompt delivery. Substantially cheaper than another charger I had priced at a local camera shop. Works perfectly. 
12741 Goood 
12742 excellent product! love it 
12743 Worked great until it died six months later. 
12744 Nice backpack. We ordered multiple of these and like them better than DJI version. But would like the price to match DJI price if we are to order anymore. 
12745 This fit well on my D5300, not a perfect fit but good enough, I think that I should ve taken more care putting it on. 
12746 Just works! No complaints about quality or delivery time. Will be purchasing another. 
12747 Bought as a present for someone who is very pleased as he now can clean all his lenses etc properly. 
12748 Just started using.. Seems a step above the average Chinese replacement battery. The items were well presented with well done packaging. 
12749 Sweet camera for the money and hard-to-find No Infrared option in a bullet. You can use these thru a window or other places you d like discreet surveillance minus the giveaway of infrared bulbs. The included power adapter is a nice touch. I will buy more of these! 
12750 Constantly switches to channel 1 instead of staying on channel you set it on. Also, lots of interferences and loud ringing despite systems being place far apart (different floors). 
12751 Works exactly as advertised as well as very handy. It also is possible to purchase and extension cable to longer remote controlling. 
12752 Exactly what we needed! 
12753 Product is good the battery I ordered was not, the one I had here did fit fine. I had an off brand that did not fit, fits in camera though! 
12754 Camera is great. Could not get the SmartGuard Protection Plan registered. SmartGuard would not take the information. NOT GOOD!!!!!!!!!! 
12755 I wasn t certain that this mount would work with my 3Pod H5 ballhead, but it does. Solidly made, and a great value! 
12756 The die quickly. But you get what you pay. Cheap price=cheap quality. 
12757 Great! 
12758 One of the best lenses made! 
12759 I like this case it works perfect and half the price 
12760 &#34;If you only carry one of these this is the one, extends out longer and remote is keyfob size , i can use with ALL my cameras 
12761 Purchased a 95mm and was impressed so I purchased another UV Filter at 67mm and once again am very pleased with the purchase. Fits perfectly and threads are smooth. Just purchased two more and expect the same excellent quality. 
12762 Matches my nikon d5200 body perfectly. Doesnt add too much weight to the already heavy camera. 
12763 One of my best investments ever. To start on the world of Digital SLR photography, this is it and much more.. 
12764 I may have bought the wrong case as this doesn t fit the stuff very well can t quite get a handle on where stuff is supposed to go. Next time will purchase larger case where I have options on cut outs. May work for you though. 
12765 great 
12766 Still works good after many years. 
12767 love it, but thinking of getting something lighter for my hike... 
12768 Replacement (upgrade) for my Fuji X-E1. 
12769 This item is really unattractive and not functional. Also they charged me $7 to return it??? Terrible. DO NOT BUY! 
12770 heck ya 
12771 Nice and useful set. Quality matches price. Shipping was fast and packaging was fine. Minor scratches on watch stand, but the watch band covers this when it s used. 
12772 Arrived promptly and works as expected 
12773 Decent binoculars for the price. Great size. 
12774 Worth every penny. Loved the videos. More functions that I haven t used yet. Small fits in palm of hand. Great purchase 
12775 I upgraded from the A35 to the A7S and all my Full frame Lens work perfectly on the A-mount to E-mount adapter. 
12776 Much too small to comfortably hold my Canon 70D with a 50mm lens. It fits but you have to stretch like mad. 
12777 Great camera. Easy to use. Takes great pictures. 
12778 love it will be order again sometime soon. 
12779 I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens. 
12780 I have already recommend to my friends 
12781 &#34;Very good product. I like.Thank the seller to send a birthday gift Integrity of the seller.&#34; 
12782 good price and product 
12783 This is one of the best. Very durable. Zooming option is nice and clear. I owe one for about 7 years now and have no regrets buying it. Nice piece of equipment. 
12784 This is the only kind of lens cleaning paper I usually order. Always does the job and is not flimsy to use. This product arrived in the time they said it would arrive. I m happy with my purchase. 
12785 Good product, very durable, shipping was EXTREMELY fast... I ordered this case on a Saturday and paid for 2 day shipping and it showed up the day after i ordered it, on a Sunday... I didn t even know I could get deliveries on Sundays haha. Overall very satisfied. 
12786 Replaced a 10 yr old alert that is no longer made. This one is much better - it has volume selection and choice of sound. It works from 1/8 mile from the house. Lpve it. 
12787 We use it as a back door alarm at our senior thrift store. It works great. 
12788 Great, met all of my expectations 
12789 Perfect bag for everyday use, lots of storage potential and places to put different things! 
12790 Really great! The video is so smooth and the glasses are so stylish that I can wear them out and nobody knows what they are. 
12791 It worked great 
12792 This is my additional order. I bought 3 before from different seller. I use it on my off flash n strobes 
12793 Item is what it says it is and arrived as such. Just didn t do much to take out jello. On increasing height I would still get the wobble. Only reason for three stars as it just wasn t what I needed. Item was flawless in description and delivery. 
12794 Tough and easy to use. A great tripod 
12795 Pare soleil efficace 
12796 Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, nice wide field of view. 
12797 This was easy to install, works like it was advertised and best of all I can easily view what the cameras are seeing from thousands of miles away. One more plus, it is superior to the wifi cameras in cost and it is hard wired. 
12798 Excellent hi-quality product and seller 
12799 Bought for my 12 year old grandson. He loves using it when he is riding his bike. 
12800 Great quality for a super low price. I use this on my sony action cam for motorcycle riding. It is directional so the wind noise does not affect the mic in my helmet. 
12801 This hood is not worth ordering. It does not securely mount onto my Canon lens, and has fallen off more than a few times. It is only a matter of time before I loose it for good (which at this point I am okay with). 
12802 good 
12803 No comments 
12804 ok 
12805 Lost my power for my camera this one works great 
12806 Nicely built bag that actually protects your camera but I hated how bulky this was. I brought this with me while I was vacationing and it was a pain having to lug this thing around. 
12807 Works great! Have been doing some landscape tripod shots and this remotes is a good product at a good price. 
12808 The lens hood came in an official Sony Box. It fit my lens as advertised. 
12809 I bought these as a gift for my wife and she loves it and its an actually steal... 
12810 Begginer photographer here so I don t know a ton but the product was as described and I m very happy with it. 
12811 Case is a little bulky for putting into a camera case so i can t actually carry it with me but it all works well 
12812 Excellent product Terry Morgan was very helpful! 
12813 When I attached it to my camera it wouldn t focus at all 
12814 i think maybe they lit for one night, then dead, nothing. get them at Home Depot instead. I should of. 
12815 Nice luv it 
12816 Fogged up due to humidity the first time I used it but that was my fault for not setting it out sooner in the outside air. 
12817 Works great! I use to get dizzy when watching my video but now I don t have that issue using the gimbal. A must have. 
12818 The package came as described, the light is very bright and works well for macro photography! 
12819 As soon as I put my flash, the clamp would fall and lost it grip. Not worth the price 
12820 Super hard to get pictures under water as you can t see anything on the screen but it s okay. I got a couple good pics and it s decent price/quality ration. :) 
12821 Pictures are O.K.,but deleting is a pain. 
12822 as described. Thanks! 
12823 Good props 
12824 Awesome product… 
12825 Great Product at a Great Price with fast shipping 
12826 Works well with a Nikon D3200, but autofocus with the Tamron 150-600 lens is hit and miss dependent on the light. At longer zoom settings you will need a tripod, or a lot of light and high shutter speeds, as expected since any movement blurs. 
12827 The product is described as HD / 720p camera. The quality when viewing through the Web app or mobile app while the camera was connected via ethernet, is clearly not HD. We have 2 other cameras on the same network and also 720p which have a much higher quality. 
12828 It works, but it s...big. It bulges over the side a bit more than it seems like it should, creating a lip on the end of my lens. This metal lip makes getting to the lens cap more difficult than it needs to be. 
12829 Purchased this for snorkling in Key West for our Canon Elph. It works great. I m sure it s not nearly as good as an actual underwater camera but for the price this case it s a keeper! 
12830 I mostly use it with a Canon T3i with a nifty-fifty and the 85mm 1.8 and the rest of the space (about half the bag) with things for work...so far I m happy with it. 
12831 has issues ... tilt axis keeps drifting even with a perfectly balanced camera. I ve used the GH4 and Blackmagic cinema and same issue with both cameras. Calling DJI is a joke and gets you NOTHING done. 
12832 I love this tripod, so versatile and well made 
12833 They look a little cheap, but they work perfectly. Strong clamp, good size for what I need. 
12834 does an excellent job of keeping my gopro afloat and it latches on and closes very secure and snugly. great product and was shipped extremely fast! 
12835 Worked perfectly ,good quality, arrived quickly AND inexpensive 
12836 Bulky, heavy, picture quality not impressive. 
12837 Exactly as advertised and works perfectly with Nikon Coopix510 camera. Great price for all that is included. 
12838 Product came as promised and came earlier than expected! Good price too! 
12839 Love this thing!! Super easy to use and takes great videos. 
12840 Very pleased with the camera and especially the price... 
12841 You can literally set up your go-pro anywhere and on anything. This was a great bundle package and super inexpensive. 
12842 Amazing video clarity for the price. 
12843 My daughter loves it came on time it s so cute!! 
12844 Great lens. Works perfectly. Shipped fast. 
12845 great set 
12846 It was as listed. 
12847 Very acurate very easy to use Test xlr 1/4 midi 3/8 rca 
12848 Great product! 
12849 Purchased to mount on a roll bar on an open-cockpit racecar. I have used it for one full day (about 3 hours of track driving including some off-track excursions) and it performed flawlessly, no shaking and never loosened up. It was received quickly and exactly as described. 
12850 Well built mount. It most important part of a mount is the it is solid with no vibration or slippage. This is a great mount. Likely I will order more. The ball joint allows infinite positioning possibilities. The best mount I have. 
12851 This new lens is most versatile lens by Nikon, in my opinion. I have many Nikon lenses over 40 years, and this one is the most convenient for my D700 and D750 in everyday and travel shootings. 
12852 Works like a champ. 
12853 Was exactly as described and came quickly! Very pleased! 
12854 Sucks... i need a serial code that they were supposed to give me to use the software so i can t use it until I get it. 
12855 Great for the price, avoid digital zoom of course. 
12856 Great camera mount. I bought it as a gift for my mountain biking cousin and she loves it. It is very sturdy and solid. 
12857 good value 
12858 Very nice camera. Software not user friendly. Spent hours trying to set camera up. Called tech support, they had problem had to download a fix. Reset camera, then could not log in ... return camera within a week. 
12859 Camera was in excellent condition. 
12860 Worked as advertised 
12861 Excellent product! Great alternative too name brand batteries. Worked great in my Nikon D5000. 
12862 It is a pelican. Need I say more... 
12863 This is s superb tripod! I couldn t be happier! 
12864 Batteries fit in a hero 4 silver without issue and last just as well as the factory. Charger works well. 
12865 must have for people who misplace their cap all the time 
12866 I will recommend this to anybody 
12867 Doesn t hold a charge. Runs down quickly. I get 70 pictures on 50% of the charge. normally I can get 350 pictures on 60% usage 
12868 Currently on vacation and haven t taken the go pro off of this stick. It s durable and perfect for us. Goes underwater, in the sand and even the basic stuff. Great product 
12869 It fitted my camera well. 
12870 all good thanks .. 
12871 Can t speak to the quality of the power output but in the field they last roughly as long as my Canon batteries. 
12872 works goood 
12873 I ve used these for a few months and I really enjoy them. 
12874 Love this HD camera 
12875 fast delivery and low price. 
12876 It can record on SD card and on laptop, recording is easy and automated. 32GB micro SD card holds more than 60 hours of recording and it keeps on recovering.Great camera and great image. 
12877 Strong., easy to use. 
12878 Fabulous. I cannot believe I was able to take such awesome video of the moon. This technology is amazing. I photoshopped my cat on the moon. Thanks so much for a great product! 
12879 Great idea, worked great for about a month then started having all kinds of problems. Would like to see someone build a more durable and reliable unit and charge more for it. 
12880 I wish it was 1080p but I m still happy with it. 
12881 Perfect fit, easy installation. Always a good idea to help preserve the condition of your screen. 
12882 good enough 
12883 More than what we need for taking pictures and for identification of small insects. I shall highly recommend it. 
12884 Too small to comfortably hold Coolpix S33. 
12885 No windows 8 drivers, not compatible 
12886 Arrived swiftly. Battery works great! 
12887 Works great! Can a photographer ever have too many backup batteries and chargers? 
12888 very good purchase. my camera would not work with the old battery that came with the camera. I tried charging it several times but nothing worked. so glad that amazon had these in stock. 
12889 It works! Easy to setup. 
12890 Work like it should. 
12891 Daylight, nightlight, whatever you shoot in, this thing will pick it up. Even in the case, you can still make out low voices talking, and the clarity is astonishingly better than I expected. For the price, you can t beat it. I plan on ordering a few more very soon. 
12892 Cheap, comes with everything you would ever need! Not as strong as GoPro (after 4 weeks a mount broke) The selfie stick (mono pod) tend to rotate a bit, but not to the point where it s unusable. 
12893 Just might be the best lens on the market, at least for headshots anyway. Super sharp, super crisp and the autofocus is amazing. Many complain about its weight, but that makes about as much sense as saying a Ferrari s engine is too loud. Happy shooting, Vroom Vroom. 
12894 good product 
12895 A+++ 
12896 This recharged batteries quickly and I was happy that I received it just as fast before the kids went to camp. 
12897 This is a great little case for the money. Works for me! Nicely made. I would recommend this anyone that doesn t have a case for their camera. Love it! 
12898 Perfect!!! 
12899 Cheap and works good 
12900 Best training quad for the money ! Stable and responsive. Buy extra batteries ! 
12901 Got these to use with my Eco shopping totes. Just the right size and padding is great. 
12902 Works as described and a must have for vacations. 
12903 Does not fit the Canon EFS 18-55 IS. The lens has 3 tabs, the hood only has 2. Returning to Amazon. I don t know how the people that answered questions got it to fit unless they have a different version of the 18-55 from Canon. 
12904 Great bag. Well made. Plenty of room and great compartments.. 
12905 Very good for a reasonable price. 
12906 It was easy to install with Synology Surveillance Station. Excellent image quality. 
12907 too dificult to operate 
12908 Probably will fit Most compact cameras. A MUST BUY! 
12909 These are ok but not great. 
12910 Great lense 
12911 I m glad and I like it! 
12912 Gave this camera to my 12 year old granddaughter and she has loved it! Is putting together picture albums and going thru film like crazy. This is what she picked out for her birthday and she has enjoyed it ever since. Great little product here. 
12913 I have purchased smaller cleaning cloths for my glasses. They were hard to use because they were small. I now only use them when I carry them in my pant pockets. These extra large cloths are AWESOME. No problem cleaning your eye glasses with them. I highly recommend. 
12914 Product does the job, as described. Doesn t scratch screen or glasses. Cleans smudges and fingerprints quickly. Good deal. 
12915 amazing device, smart idea. 
12916 works great with T3i 
12917 the BEST !!!! i want 10 of these !!! takes a contour from dead rto full in 45 less minutes. ALSO takes a GoPro from dead to full in about 40 less minutes. 
12918 Terrific camera with better IQ than A7ii. Easy to shoot hand held which is notable for a high megapixel camera.only negative I can think of is that it is a bit heavier than the A7ii. 
12919 Wow, amazing camera and I m a total rookie when it comes to photography. Easy to use and take clear professional type Photos. Excellent battery life also makes this machine amazing.. Love it, don t hesitate. 
12920 Ive had this for a while now with no problems never thought id find a charger for my fe-20 and i believe it shipped pretty soon 
12921 Great camera. Great price. 
12922 This kit takes out all quest work of gopro accesories, this covers the bases from the case to the tripod.the extra batteries are also very helpful,couldn t ask for more 
12923 Nope didnt like it 
12924 It does exactly what I wanted it to do 
12925 Rock solid. Even at 125 mph! 
12926 Good price for the amount of options! 
12927 My order was for 5 cameras- 3 of them arrived broken beyond repair. Of the 5, zero of them have a functioning light. They are passable as cameras but your odds are low that they ll arrive in usable condition. 
12928 Does the job! Used it for our honeymoon in New Zealand and Fiji. The camera was floating in several scenarios including swimming pools, rivers, and oceans! 
12929 Horrible super cheap made! They should not be selling this item it all I give it zero stars!! Please don t buy this item you will be very disappointed! I promise! 
12930 Easy to use and set up. Great item 
12931 EXCELLENT 
12932 I have to say I saw quite a few mixed reviews. So far the lens is working out fantastic for all the landscape pictures I take and stars!! 
12933 it works and there you go. 
12934 The battery charger is exactly what I needed and it was shipped and delivered on time. 
12935 The item works fine but the housing was dinged up. It looked used. 
12936 Very good quality of pictures and videos, love it!!! Great accessories too, couldn t get better deal for my money. 
12937 Works for light camera bodies/lenses. A bit difficult to hold still when attatch a medium telephoto prime lens with a DSLR. 
12938 Terrific!!!!.... and the delivery was fast 
12939 Exactly what I expected! Arrived on time. 
12940 A+++++ 
12941 Good product. Would buy again. 
12942 I love it 
12943 these are great though we only received three instead of the four indicated. 
12944 Great way to be introduced to the effects among different filters. Gave this to someone who just got a new DSLR and thought they should have some lens protection. Case and filters have good construction feel 
12945 fit perfectly. Included a bonus - ability to tie the lens cap to the neck strap (won t lose it again). 
12946 Received item in good condition. Works with no problem at all. 
12947 Holds my camera with lens and 70-300 mm lens also. Room in pockets for gadgets. Bag resists water. 
12948 Excellent product, video is amazing, fast and quiet, micro SD is an extra for me, software support multiple cameras and multiple windows in same screen. EXCELLENT, this one replace a broken 0.3 PM Foscam and use it with my NAS system. 
12949 Henry from Foscam was great to work. He was able to get my camera so I can view it remotely in a matter of seconds. Great support and great product. 
12950 Can wait to use it for our cruise! 
12951 Screws right into my X-Pro 1 without any hassle and stays there pretty tightly. Looks good with the black and it s pretty lightweight. Plus it s the only soft button I ve had so far that hasn t fallen off! 
12952 Awesome! 
12953 Danny was ERY fast and helpful in the resolution of a probelm 
12954 It did not work. The screen was completely white. 
12955 pleased with purchase. Just as expected. 
12956 its made ok. it absolutely does NOT work with my garmin virb elite even though they put it in the description! guess i got caught with the &#34;keyword&#34; type ad they use to get you on their page even though their product has nothing to do with your shopping needs. 
12957 Great quality, won t pick up trees if windy. Easy to set up, 5 minutes, batteries after three weeks, still full. Recommend if your looking for a nice security camera. 
12958 Very useful one. Shipping was fast. 
12959 This tripod is perfect for the price! Easy to use, great size and worth it. Product came in perfect, all parts work! 
12960 Great lens at the best price anywhere. 
12961 Nice kit wish there was a small thin piece of metal to protect the set screw from bezel damage but I Mac Gyvered a shim to do the job works great. 
12962 Holy crap this is AWESOME!!! Im telling ALL my photog friends. 
12963 Fantastic lens. Very sharp. 
12964 Fantastic!!!! 
12965 The bottom does not work. Just de remote control 
12966 Great product! 
12967 Daughter is happy she bought a camera could not find the battery I DID GOT TODAY. SHE IS ON CLOUD 9 THANKS 
12968 Great products delivered quickly. 
12969 ExFoto body and rear lens cap fit just right on the Sony A3000 (&#34;Sony&#34; and &#34;E Mount&#34; are stamped on both). Handy when using adapters. Product arrived in about two days...great service. I recommend this, no problems. 
12970 Works great with my utility PG&E! 
12971 All my gear fits well. Nice fit and finish. Good product 
12972 Price beat out the competition and product was as advertised. 
12973 My go-to glass when I tie smaller than size 14 flies. Nice warm light. 
12974 Great product... Used it and works magnificently. Reduced the amount of gear I sometimes travel with. Loving it. 
12975 Great to have. Never know when will be needed. 
12976 It feels pretty cheap. One came damaged but they sent a replacement. You have to be extremely delicate when adjusting camera if not you can mess up the threading in the screws. 
12977 I bought this unit when I purchased a new video camera. They work flawlessly. 
12978 It has better resolution than the previous generation, but did not include any software for viewing multiple cameras, as in the past. 
12979 Macro lens is crap. I used wide angle lens only once and don t like to use anymore 
12980 Took a while to ship but it s exactly as described. 
12981 Does what it says 
12982 Amazingly thought and easy to apply. Great product! 
12983 Material is very sturdy, with very tight connections. 
12984 Love it, motion detector work amazing!!! wifi, free cloud! easy to use. Glad I got this! I use this in my room when I leave, I just plug it in when I leave and unplug when I get home. 
12985 Love it. Bought this as a gift for a friend and you can clearly see the difference in the pictures. Would recommend this and the price is right. 
12986 We bought this when we had a baby. Takes amazing portrait photos at a reasonable cost. 
12987 Came in the mail fast. I only use my polaroid for special occasions and if you do the same, then I wouldn t suggest buying such a large packet because these expire and photos don t come out as great. This is a great deal though. 
12988 These work great. Not one problem 
12989 It is a very nice bracket. This is the only item that I have ordered from Foscam that I haven t had to send back for replacement. 
12990 Suitable quality for the price. Met description and accurately performs on my daughter`s iPhone 5S. Would recommend purchase to others. 
12991 My bouancy mount just crumbled in my hands after less than a month of light use. What gives? This is after the screw for one of the mounts disappearing in the ocean. I m dumbfounded. 
12992 Outstanding value for the price. You get 2 Vivitar batteries for the price of 1 and the charger and cleaning kit. Vivitar has made quality photography equipment for decades. 
12993 Wonderful toy, if it just worked how it supposed to. It doesn t matter how much i correct or &#34;calibrate&#34; it with the correction buttons in the remote, it just keep going front or aside, i almost lost it to the ocean 2 times!!! 
12994 This mount was slim enough to allow proper focusing on all my cctv lenses. It does what it advertises well. 
12995 Not sure have not got it to work yet. I will repost later. 
12996 As advertised and good price 
12997 Love the versatility with the 5 different colors and hues. Easily folds down (once you ve practiced a few times lol). 
12998 very good camera, but very temperamental. One should double check shots before relying on the evf focus or otherwise. 
12999 I use these Filmguard bags to keep my cellphone in when I travel. While the chances of damage are remote, these bags are used to protect some of my electronic devices. 
13000 Fits my old Cannon Eos RebelG yeah thats a 35mm. 
13001 So far, so good. 
13002 Perfect...!!! 
13003 Repeat customer. Shipped fast, great product. Chargers my Canon rebel camera just as well as the original battey! Thx! 
13004 As described. Quick ship. 
13005 Perfect! 
13006 It s a wonderful product. the night and day vision is very clear. Had no problems installing although had to ask for help with putting it in the right spot. We be ordering more of this item 
13007 Works great. Best one I ve used in this type of head 
13008 Does not record video from my quad copter cam. 
13009 awesome yo. 
13010 arrived fast easy to install 
13011 Easy to use, great price. 
13012 Perfect fit for my Sony camera. 
13013 Great camera, everything works great and the international delivery service was quite fast. Tnx for a good deal. 
13014 This camera takes great pics in and out of water. We took it on vacation to Punta Cana and were very pleased with the quality of the pictures. 
13015 Very happy with the kit. 
13016 I like the dual settings and it fits perfectly on your strap. 
13017 AAAA++++ 
13018 Great price to give as a gift to a young graduate. 
13019 I love this camera. Great pictures and options. Can use AA batteries instead of having to keep it charged. The wireless share option is absolutely awesome - it instantly will send them to my phone or tablet for sharing and uploading. No cords to worry about. 
13020 They thought of everything, most complete kit I have ever seen, amazing product. Very useful. 
13021 Seemed to work well for calibration, but started bugging me to recalibrate about two weeks later and I can t get it to stop. 
13022 not working great. hard to set up. returned and bought other camera 
13023 good 
13024 Not made strong 
13025 Works well as a replacement for a storage card reader. 
13026 Sorta big but it works 
13027 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
13028 Tons of space, extremely comfortable, great value. Looks and feels like it should cost a lot more than it did. It has so much space, I don t even have enough stuff to put in there :) 
13029 Well built, smooth action, no faults so far. This head is more useful to me than a ball head. Handle is on the left side, right hand is free to hit shutter or change settings 
13030 Rhis was amazing! Way better than i expected. Durable vinyl. Greaaaaat color. Loved it and will use it for many years to come 
13031 So many different levels it can be placed on. Great tool 
13032 Great addition to my amateur photography case. 
13033 Cumbersome, not useful. 
13034 Don t try to tighten these suckers even slightly with your fingers! I did. And there was no way I could untighten them by hand! The lens binds! I actually had to take a pair of waterpump pliers to the filter to get it off. Just saying! 
13035 Whats to say? It works. 
13036 nice product, quick delivered, good description 
13037 They fit the screen of my a5100 perfectly. 
13038 Excellent product! Used it on MacBooks, Acer s, Lenovos. Makes all the difference in the world when running. On the MacBook, the fans don t turn on as soon as they would before, and it definitely runs cooler. 
13039 It is okay little too heavy but not try to look at the moon yet 
13040 Wait until next trip to Asia. 
13041 Good, sturdy little tripod for the right application. Just keep in mind the size, and if it fits your needs, you ll like it. 
13042 Works perfectly with the strap. 
13043 Finally a cup that stays on in my bag. 
13044 Fast service! Love the product! 
13045 I wish the directions were a little clearer on how you know when it is fully charged and when its on verses off. 
13046 Seems to work pretty well, a bit faster than in camera charging. It does get a bit warm, but that hasn t been a problem so far. The batteries seem to hold a charge about the same as the Sony branded options, time will tell if they last as long. 
13047 Got as birthday gift for wife, and she loves it. Pictures are beautiful and it brings back the nostalgia of the insta pic camera. 
13048 according to expectations, very good article 
13049 A must have for action sports! 
13050 It has a pretty decent quality, great camera to take on a short trip, hiking or biking. No complaints. My only complaint is that it does not come with a memory card. The price is right and the quality is better than I expected. 
13051 The Lefun video camera was very difficult to activate to my IPhone but upon getting it done, it is a fantastic device. It met all expectations and was a great addition to the overall security of my residence. I am very pleased. 
13052 love it!! 
13053 Just what I needed and a price that I was very happy with 
13054 Very pleased with the camera and it s features from night vision to mobile device notification. I recommend this camera to anyone that is looking for a good security camera. 
13055 Great deal! 
13056 This bag is so cute!! High quality, perfectly fits the Fuji. Sturdy also! 
13057 Charged up fine and works well. 
13058 Fits on my T5i 
13059 It is good product. I spend a lot of time to find it. 
13060 Screws keeps coming loose and the Gopro adapter correctly. Otherwise it is ok for a starter clamp. 
13061 Amazing camera delivered quickly. 
13062 Awesome and cheap! Good thing i found this 
13063 Exactly what I was looking for for my GoPro!! Highly satisfied!!!! 
13064 This case is great! Fit everything I needed in it. 
13065 Works great. Just wish it had an off switch. 
13066 very nice 
13067 Product delivery and performance as advertised. Would recommend to friend. 
13068 Received in great condition. Packaged appropriately. Charged just fine. But have not been able to use as both camera shipments arrived damaged and were returned. 
13069 Can you use this for fishing in a boat? 
13070 very satisfied fast delivery would recommend ,charges fast 
13071 Love this cam and use it as a dash cam every day. 
13072 Was good till it rained. Camera maybe outdoor but not the poe connection. 
13073 The quality of picture is poor at best 
13074 Cool 
13075 AWFUL! Save your money. The software wouldn t download, making it completely useless. 
13076 A+++++ 
13077 great floats to save my electronics. I had 1 from before and had to order this set of 2 because they are so great. 
13078 Great quality for good price! Came really fast even though i chose free shipping! 
13079 Received product and tried installing it myself. Had a problem with the play back 
13080 Called D-Link customer service and received excellent assistance from Employee id# AR004619 
13081 Didn t like the way the vivitar lens hood fit so I got a genuine cannon lens hood 
13082 Great lens for my Canon t3i, price was right. I like it! 
13083 Haven t lost a camera yet. 
13084 Best camera in the world!!!!!!!!!!!)))))) 
13085 This is a great product. See the video about it on the B&H site. 
13086 Good product and fast delivery. Just as expected. 
13087 Nice Camera and not complicated to operate. 
13088 Not bad at all. The Sony battery I m using can be a pain to pull out, but besides that, the light wouks great and can be VERY bright. 
13089 Great purchase, very usable for the batteries of our Panasonic Camera. 
13090 Looks very realistic, good quality and arrived on time. 
13091 Well, there is a ton of stuff in this kit. I hope my wife figures out what all of it is for. Super fast service, all packaged real well. Exactly as advertised. 
13092 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos. Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps daytime: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpDS_aVjA5Q https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZ4A19GoEFk Sample Video @ 1080p/60fps at night https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UQICoPTPlw 
13093 the lenses are great, though I rarely use the 15mm the filters are amazing!! you can even use the blue filter on the moon and the resulting image will not be too affected color-wise, where are if you use the moon filter you get a green moon. 
13094 I am very happy with it s calibration results, but the software is OK. Calibration takes a while, and the software could be a bit more powerful. I bought this hoping that I could accurately change color temperature throughout the day, but it s not an easy process. 
13095 The light is dim, but good enough to provide a little light to highlight our front columns. 
13096 Great Product just what I was looking for. Easy to set up. I also like the fact I can receive photos on my cell. 
13097 Arrived on time. Exactly as expected. 
13098 I am having a lot of fun getting to know my new camera. It takes incredible pictures. I only wish I could go on vacation to all the scenic places to take pictures. 
13099 It s fun. Make sure lighting is good when you take pic. If they are pics will be nice. Took it to a wedding. Fun. I give it 4.5 stars 
13100 Great I Love It 
13101 POOR DEPTH OF FIELD. PICTURES WERE NOT SHARP. OVERALL HAD BETTER PICS WITH LOWER PRICED CAMERS, ESPECIALLY NIKONS AND THE KINDLE FIRE HD. 
13102 Such a great price!! You would be crazy not to buy!!! Just got it in the mail today and everything is perfect!! I can t put my camera down! I have a Nikon d7100 and the auto focus with the lens works wonderfully! Thank youuuuuu! :) 
13103 Convenient and fits perfectly. Quality plastic cases for photo batteries. 
13104 very niice 
13105 This is a really nice camera strap. I replaced my Nikon strap with this one and have not had any neck ache from the strap cutting into the back of my neck. Good material, nice looking and easy to detach from camera. 
13106 Came with everything stated and in great shape. A really good value given the price. 
13107 very useful item! everything was ok, recommended! 
13108 Rough machining; not smooth when adjusting. 
13109 My camera stopped working the minute I plugged this in!!!! 
13110 They look real! Installed all 4 in 30 minutes. My handyman saw them and said, &#34;Good for you, you have a security system.&#34; I did tell him the truth😊 
13111 Spend the money on this and you will be glad you did. Works awesome, stinks really well without damaging. 
13112 Good 
13113 not good at all 
13114 Original and perfect! 
13115 Easy, fast, safe and confortable! 
13116 The item works as advertised. The only downside I have found so far is it does not fit as well as the original lens cap did. It does, however, fit well enough to keep dirt, water, etc off of the lens. 
13117 I wondered if I would like this since it is an off-brand, but so far the batteries last just as long as my Fuji batteries, so I have no complaints. Good price on a good product! 
13118 Batteries work fine in my Canon Powershot Elph 520HS. Received in a timely manner. Thank you! AAA+++ 
13119 ALL WENT WELL 
13120 Delivered quickly, quality product. Easy to use. Thanks! 
13121 I ve been able to calibrate all of my lenses with ease. 
13122 Awesome, Beautiful piece 
13123 Great buy, very happy. Easy set up 
13124 Worked to perfection. 
13125 The only reason I m not giving this a 5 star rating is the cheaply-constructed plastic ring adapter that comes with it. 
13126 Works great 
13127 Works great. 
13128 Ok 
13129 Awesome 
13130 I needed to file down the base that slips into the camera s hot shoe so it fit better (the paint made it just a bit too big to easily fit), otherwise it works great! I highly recommend this adaptor for devices like Sony s HDR-AZ1. 
13131 This works if it is trying to hold up just the camera. If you have any other accessories on it though, it doesn t seem to work so well. The bright orange does help find it in the water though. 
13132 Looks very realistic and if you can keep it in the sun the charging works well. 
13133 the pics of my husband in tis think was worth every cent 
13134 it is a very good polarizer at a good price. Recommended 
13135 Just like the ones that came with my Go Pro. 
13136 Fast shipping and quality product. 
13137 Great camera! 
13138 I didn t know how much I wanted this tripod until I used it ..fantastic! DSLR no problem. 
13139 Good. 
13140 Fast shipping, product work s as advertised. Great value I highly recommend! 
13141 very good picture 
13142 Worked fine 
13143 AS usual, a great filter. 
13144 Works, but be sure to rinse thoroughly after saltwater use as it uses cheap screws which will rust in no time. 
13145 Nice case 
13146 Product works fine (my second set). Inexpensive &#34;fix&#34; 
13147 If you are going to get serious about using your GoPro, the higher end filter solutions will be better for you, but these do work as described, though short lived if handled often. 
13148 The fit is so far off the batter fails to make contact when this device is screwed onto the A6000 
13149 Great for getting those difficult angles. 
13150 keeps charge almost the same as original and price is awesome. will see how long will keep capacity. will buy it again. 
13151 None of the pictures develop , I went to Michael s and bought more film to see if it was my camera ,but all the film from Micheal s worked. None of these developed. 
13152 Super fast charger and two batteries for less than the price of the batteries. Amazing. 
13153 Using these batteries with my FujiFilm X100T camera as extra backups - they work like a charm, seem to be well made, charge reasonably fast, no issues with size. 
13154 Nice product. Will order one more right now. Great for dslr attachement and slider set up. 5stars Please check out our youtube channel PassionForDrive 
13155 Other than lockjaw because the weight of the camera I can t complain. Steve has great customer service and will take care of you if there is an issue. I highly recommend for those that want first person view while surfing! 
13156 Takes great pictures, easy to use. Great for telephoto shots. Have taken it 4 wheeling and no problem with camera being bounced around. 
13157 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
13158 Both units arrived DOA. No functions worked, not even flash test. Tried several Nikon flashes - all the same. Best thinks I can say is that I got a prompt no hassle refund. 
13159 Well made, excellent size. 
13160 very pleased 
13161 Used a light meter, this doesn t put out nearly as much as it claims too. False advertisement. 
13162 Works fine. 
13163 For the price, you can t beat this ball head with a stick! I own two of them. 
13164 great! 
13165 Have 0 complaints for the price. Mostly plastic with main bars, etc being aluminum. but again, it does what it s designed to do and is a very solid product. 
13166 This does not fit a Nikon P500 even though it s listed. 
13167 Item delivered on time, was as described, 
13168 Very Good!!!!♡♡♡♡ 
13169 Works perfectly! 
13170 They fit and do the job, although they seem to have less capacity than the Fuji batteries. On the plus side, the included charger is much more compact than the one that came with the camera. 
13171 I use this tripod in my studio and on location. Holds the 7-200L with ease. Love the grips for control. Buy it 
13172 For the price this is an excellent home camera. The ease of which it sets up is what I particularly like about the product. I would recommend this to a friend. 
13173 I love it. it works wonderfully with my Canon 5D MK3. Heavy duty construction. 4 stars because I think it s overpriced. Should be a $29.99 item. 
13174 Arrived quickly. Surprisingly good for moon and star gazing! 
13175 does not contain the circlip, not be able to repair ,the image does not correspond to the product 
13176 This is a very low cost solution for document camera needs. We use this in a school setting. It is very easy to store and to share among several teachers because the set up is so easy. 
13177 Great camera but very slow in reporting, sometimes none at all 
13178 perfect 
13179 Still have not used, but looks good 
13180 Great camera. The fact that you can control it with your phone is amazing. It s just the quality of the image that is a bit disaponting. But other than that it s a great camera 
13181 It floats! I took this on vacation and it worked great to store my cash in, clip it to my bathing suit or whatever! Very good quality! 
13182 Works great easy set except I can t get internet connection to the Internet no usb connect screen reads. 
13183 It was a plastic globe with purposely large drilled holes all around the base of it but packaged in a profoto box. Didn t seem legit. 
13184 Good kit, these accessories are just like the go pro ones, the only difference is they are lacking the name, and thankfully the elevated price tag. Good Stuff! 
13185 I have tried everything under the sun to clean my lcd/led tvs. This stuff is amazing!!! I will be purchasing another bottle as a back up!! 
13186 The lens protector is a must with this frame when not in use. The frame bends easily to get the camera in and out. 
13187 Works perfectly with the lens specified. Good deal. 
13188 These along with the ones that are 90 degrees lets you make any angle you can imagine. They do fit tight and hold well. 
13189 Great product. Effortless to do business with 
13190 Everything I hoped for!! Excellent pictures!! 
13191 Good product. 
13192 Photo quality a little less than anticipated. However, great value. Easy to configure. Has worked flawlessly. 
13193 Works wonderfully. 
13194 This product was easy to use and the pictures looked nice. You can put hundreds of pictures on this device with an 8gb card. There are many options for display and will play music as well. I plan on buying another for myself! 
13195 Works perfectly and for much less than the Panasonic version.. 
13196 This product is strong, but the shoulder pad constantly slides out of position. 
13197 No performance issues.....this link process my photos directly to my computer without any issues. 
13198 Very nice album for the price. I wanted this to put all my daughter s senior proofs in and this album more than met my expectations 
13199 Great screen protector! Must have for D750. Fits perfectly. 
13200 Charges fast. Charger was my main interest as I had buggerred up the charger input on the camera and the batteries were a bonus. 
13201 Amazing! Love it! 
13202 Good 
13203 Worth the price 
13204 Great case. 
13205 Very good 
13206 Not good at all! Never had Wi-Fi , you suck! 
13207 Original equipment that fits like it should! 
13208 Bought this for my daughter who was going on a cruise. She loves this camera and found it easy to use. 
13209 Excellent 
13210 Kept my camera dry during a rained out wedding. It was a total lifesaver. Worth the very low price I paid to keep my very high priced camera safe. 
13211 Awesome item for the graphic artist or others wanting to showcase materials in a clean and professional manner - many extra pages that other portfolios don t have at a great price! 
13212 It came with a ton of stuff. Something you deffenitly have to mess around with and get used to. Ober all very good product and it shipped fast. 
13213 every thing ok 
13214 Great bag, just the right size. Excellent value. 
13215 The very refined product fits my monopod perfectly. 
13216 This product freaking sucks! We have now had it for two and a half months, and it just QUIT WORKING! And Amazon won t let me return it, I am pissed! 
13217 Powers my 7&#34; Lilliput monitor from my RED Brick. Works great. 
13218 This serves the intended purpose- blocking excess light so that I can better see the viewfinder display. It does, however, block some of the rear screen. Debating about trimming it a bit. 
13219 really good camcorder 
13220 A little bit small 
13221 Much sturdier than the cable that initially came with the camera! 
13222 takes good pictures 
13223 Poor connection that requires the camera to be turned on before the lens is seated. This is too expensive for the build quality. 
13224 good to have a spare 
13225 Wanted wireless one. So returned this one. Got to order a wireless one. 
13226 Ths is a very well-made camera. The metal housing is lightweight yet very sturdy. The finish on the base metal is very nice and high quality.The color and contrast on this camera is very good. I would buy another one if the need arises. 
13227 Very dorobale 
13228 fast shipping, awesome price! 
13229 works great in my camera 
13230 Excellent camcorder, I have really enjoy to film with. Very stable image and clear sound. If you are looking for a good camera at perfect price, this is the one for you! 
13231 i love my new camera strap its so pretty and really nice fabric defiantly 5 stars 
13232 Nice, but loosens up in the water and came off during scuba dive. 
13233 Battery would hold enough charge to power the camera for 3 minutes. From first charge, this new battery would not hold a charge. Warning! Avoid! Pour quality. 
13234 Second-rate optics in a nice compact and light binocular. Lost it and bought a Pentax 9 X 28 for $180. Really nice. 
13235 Paper is good quality and color. Thickness was enough to hold up to taping and walking on. The pictures we took against this look fantastic! I highly recommend buying. 
13236 I put these on every lens I own, it protects your lens and with not really much of a reduction in picture quality. Worth the investment better to replace a filter then lens. 
13237 They fit just fine! 
13238 Junk! waste of time and money! Don t buy it! 
13239 Great quality. Perfect amount of storage. Take it on all my hikes. Rugged, did I mention QUALITY. 
13240 This is a really collection of things for my camera. It more than met my needs. 
13241 Adapter was shipped very quickly. I like it better than another PC hot shoe adapter that I used to use. TTL pass through works great and is not obstructed by the hot shoe. 
13242 Perfect 
13243 worked just fine 
13244 good quality 
13245 bad 
13246 I purchased the older model a few years back and it worked great! The new model works but is fuzzy and hangs on shutdown! I would not recommend. Instead of getting better it is far worse! If you can get dvu104 it works very well! 
13247 perfect spare batteries for the go pro, includes charger 
13248 Other than it breaking 2 days after getting it, it s great. I wish I could leave negative stars. Biggest piece of crap. Poorly made. 
13249 Minor hiccup at first when updating firmware for the first time, but once that s complete you won t regret. 
13250 I found the matching tripod for this piece at a Goodwill for $10 but it didn t have the quick release. This piece fits perfectly and it is very easy to remove and out back on the tripod. I m very happy with it. 
13251 Not really practical for shirt pocket, but picture is decent and battery life is as advertised. 
13252 It works great, takes awesome picutres and is very easy to get to record when mounted. However, the user interface with the phone app is really not intuitive and sometimes 
13253 Finding harnesses and acessories are harder than other more popular cameras. 
13254 It s perfect I am very pleased with it. 
13255 I got the incorrect brand for my camera, loot at the details first before you purchase it. 
13256 Battery discharges extremely fast and overheats the camera causing it to shut down way to easily. 
13257 A little pricey but does what it is supposed to. 
13258 Just what I wanted and a good price. 
13259 Exact fit. Long life. Travel charger great to have on a long vacation. Never had to worry about a dead battery at the beach or at the wedding. Charging in the car is a great feature. 
13260 I bought two. Neither worked with motion video. Single pictures worked fine. Continuous video worked fine. 
13261 for being a off brand/knock off it holds really well against the true gopro battery. love that it s a wall charger and can double as a car charger too. 
13262 I ve used these for a couple of years- they take and hold charges well, and I ve changed them about every 2 years. 
13263 If you have a GoPro, just get this. Great price with a greet charger and you ll need the batteries. 
13264 Thourghly enjoing this lense 
13265 So far so good. Everything was there and more than I will probably ever need 
13266 Performed as expected. Still have not used all the accessories. Update. The headstrap works great better than the GoPro model for me.Have not used all the accessories, only those related to diving at present. 
13267 Seals well but buttons very hard to push, unlike original. would not buy again 
13268 It s okay should have done more homework before purchase. Do not like paddle flipping to one side. I find it difficult following anything I want to capture with paddle to one side. Just okay. Thank you 
13269 I have no experience with a proper wide angle lens but this one was a fantastic low budget solution to my dilemma 
13270 it did work for alittle bit,,you get what u pay for..lol 
13271 Love it. Bought two. May get a third. Can check on my elderly dog during the day. 
13272 Great for the lake and other dirty/dusty/wet locations. We have dropped it in the water several times with no negative results. Great for candid shots. 
13273 Sent this as a gift and the recipient loves it!! If has everything needed for a person who is traveling and hates to carry bulky accessories. 
13274 I wouldn t recommend buying this, the tripod is plastic, and one of the legs broke! Not very sturdy and it came to me all scratched up and rusty! 
13275 As advertised 
13276 Got the Sidekick Black Duo. Powerful light that attaches to the gopro via a long screw that holds at the pivot point. Great accessory. It s a bit too bright for close up but it does light up subject nicely overall. Great product. 
13277 Very useful 
13278 A great camera for the price. Wifi Picture downloads is very convenient, All user friendly controls and video quality is excellent. 
13279 its a X mass gift so have not used but looks like its a nice item ...... 
13280 Such a great camera for only $45. It does the job as expected. Super clear video quality and great night vision. Highly recommend it. 
13281 For the money.....excellent. I have high dollar lenses, and this glass performs as expected and exceeds expectations. Really fun to use. 
13282 Great item 
13283 Works ok. 
13284 My mom loves this bag, great size! 
13285 EXCELENT PRODUCT CLEAR VIEW 
13286 way too cool 
13287 Two thumb up 
13288 For a beginner you will be on overload with all the accessories. My daughter has a similar camera, she is helping teach me. Everything but, large tripod fits in case, but, full! I use another bag to carry my camera, most times. 
13289 Good 
13290 I am very happy with this lens. Did not have any kind of problem. Nice Bokeh in my pictures. I have been using with TC 1.4 
13291 So far so good. Great pictures. Thanks for a great product. 
13292 It works, but charger is a pain. It is an adjustable , universal charger. You will have to look up the positive and negative contact with the battery manufacturer (there are many contacts on these batteries!) just to see how to setup the charger. 
13293 Great bag, just needs a little more room. 
13294 Didn t fit. Didn t work. Didn t charge. 
13295 Oh how it makes me feel young again. The Polaroid, which instantly develops and prints out your photo within 15 minutes. I love using it but why it gotta be so expensive to get the film :( Can t mess up with this camera! :) Great quality, LOVE IT! 
13296 Great value. It works as advertised. Only thing that has me worried is how tight the included mount squeezes my iPhone 6 Plus. I may buy a different phone mount, but even doing so this is still a great value. 
13297 Excellent quality and easy to use! 
13298 Very comfy and secure strap. Well worth the purchase. 
13299 Great product and arrived on time 
13300 Fits my camer like a glove. 
13301 I took this home & attached to my camera & works great. What a find. My 200mm didn t go as far as I wanted, for our trips. VR works great as well. 
13302 The batteries are great, but the grip doesn t seat correctly. I loose power to the camera and have to reconnect the grip to get it to work. 
13303 Great camera easy to use. Beautiful 
13304 Construction/materials seems kind of cheap. I d pay more for something a little sturdier. 
13305 The item itself is really nice, it fit my crossshot strap well but the 2 is too small for my galaxy S5, It is good quality enought that I will order the Joey 3 since this wasn t useful for what I needed 
13306 does what is says 
13307 Basic film. Always good 
13308 Love this camera, makes cute business card size pictures. 
13309 Great Kit 
13310 Luv it. 
13311 Then Vivitar Auto Focus teleconverter lens would not operate on auto focus. I had to manually focus to obtain an image. I m very displeased with this purchase and when I return home later this week I will be requesting another one that works. 
13312 Lots of pictures of my hand due to lens placement. Underwater worked and underwater color was good. 
13313 Great little monitor, works really well with my A7S and the smallhd support team has been amazing! The 1080p panel has super high resolution which makes it simple to pull focus. 
13314 The product do not work well. First the stop sign I thought would have been a little bigger. And it want light up when the car touch the pole. It will light up way seconds later. I really not satisfied with the product. 
13315 THIS CAMERA IS GREAT. AND THANKS FOR THE REVIEWER S DISCOUNT. 
13316 this lens will change the way you see photography. It s pricey, but the quality come with a price. If you have the money please buy it. 
13317 Great battery at an affordable price 
13318 It was as advertised and arrived in good time. 
13319 Worthwhile if you find a bargain. Batteries hold up well. Motion sensors delay causes people to be out of the frame before recording. About a 1-2 sec delay. Numerous false alarms and yet has hard time recognizing people in vicinity. 
13320 Great Product, Fast shipping 
13321 This product works however you gotta watch the pin to make sure it doesn t come out. By pin I m talking about when you will see that I m pointing towards in the product picture. 
13322 Great camera! Worth it. 
13323 This product is awesome. I love it 
13324 It didn t fit my light setup but with a little modifying it worked out. Fun product. 
13325 Had to read the reviews to find out how it attached, but it works great. I don t ever remember owning a lens that required the removal of a piece of trim to attach a hood. 
13326 Great product.Would buy again. Expensive but worth it. Well built. 
13327 Arrival time as said 
13328 Going to have so much fun for my birthday &#60;3 
13329 Every positive review is spot on! Love this thing! 
13330 still working 
13331 I m completely happy with the product. 
13332 Awesome 
13333 Great camera fast delivery very happy 
13334 I asked for the Kodak MD863 charging cord and adaptewr but was send one that did fit the charging plug on the camera. I hope we can resolved. 
13335 Horrible. I didnt even get a chance to get it wet. Thr screen stopped working and the battery died within 15 minutes. Now i have no pics of my event 
13336 Henry was very helpful getting my camera set up, foscam underestimates wait times on the phone but that is IT for you. An hour later I cannot connect to my camera, it says incorrect username/password 
13337 Battery Door does not fit properly. Adding tape to hold in place. Must snap door on and add tape each time battery is removed. 
13338 works great 
13339 Well pachaged and arrived very quickly. They charged up well and seem to be working just fine 
13340 I bought this for my Tamron AF18-270mm f/3.5-6.3 lens. Primary purpose is to use it as a protection to the front element of the lens. Very pleased with the quick shipment. 
13341 Neither great nor bad. Mounting hardware is cheap and flimsy. Camera works okay. 
13342 Great quality! 
13343 This bag has worked beautifully for our needs! 
13344 Delivered as indicated and works well on my camera. Great value. 
13345 Perfect! 
13346 great tool for knowing who s comming in your house. 
13347 Fits my Canon 85mm well. Attaches and detatches easily. Fast and efficient service and great item for a great deal. Thank you. 
13348 It was weak and break easy 
13349 Was NOT the color I ordered. I wanted raspberry, received a very dull, red camera instead. Very disappointed 
13350 Not bad. You probably don t want this if you take it places as it ll get banged up quick. But fine for a stable studio environment, and fine for the price. 
13351 Great item, good price!! I really liked the product! 
13352 Good system, easy to set up, works good, does good in the dark 
13353 Took a long time to get them but they are exactly what I wanted! 
13354 Amazing bundle! Great kit for the money. 
13355 It s amazing...as far as a 1000 m range when used as a momentary switch, the relay can chatter at 3 m if you stand between the devices. 
13356 Despite so many half assed reviews that sorta bash this camera, I found that it is leaps and bounds better than the original 7d that my neighbor has. The extra features are worth the extra money to spend on the mark 2 
13357 Grainy video. Can t see the difference between this and my old standard definition camera. I regret buying it. 
13358 Amazing system and easy to install! The camera views from the phone are real clear! You get plenty of cameras to place throughout the house. 
13359 Not much to talk about, it is ridiculously easy to install and sounds pretty good. 
13360 A battery is a battery, what more can be said. The ordering process was simple and it arrived on time. And I did order a second one. 
13361 Records really dope but Idk if it s my phone or the camera. But when i download the video too my phone I have no sound. 
13362 Case is soft not a hard case..price is right 
13363 Works great. Charges two batteries relatively quickly. Glad I bought it. 
13364 great accessory to have for the GoPro. really cool to see the point of view of your dog. adjustable for dog sizes 
13365 Used to replace Honda Accord original alarm horn. Works great. 
13366 Didn t fit. 
13367 Moose always delivers. Love this circular polarizer. It is my second size and every time I get a lens, I will return to get one in the new size needed. 
13368 bought this for my wife as a birthday gift as she was getting ready for a mission trip to Monterrey. Not only is it a good camera but as a tablet she used it to keep me informed of her trip via e-mail. 
13369 great product 
13370 Love it. Works great with my Olympus E420. Easy set up and works with AAA batteries, which were provided for both units. 
13371 I got this for my daughter s birthday and she loves it. I bought the accessories but she wants to get more. I ll leave it up to her to get the extras. 
13372 Maybe it s great product, but it s not that easy to use. 
13373 Super cute bag that matches surprisingly well with the Fuji Instamax raspberry colored camera! The material is really soft and the case opens 3 different ways so you can snap a picture on the go. Overall great case! 
13374 Very good! 
13375 Exactly what I expected 
13376 The charger and batteries work fine. I received them quickly and put them to use immediately. I had occasion to use the batteries and charger extensively on a recent vacation and they performed well. 
13377 Lots of options, could have lived with 1/2 of them for what I do. But nice that they are there if I do need them. 
13378 Works. Paired with my YN560-II flash (with built in reciever). 
13379 Perfect and battery works great in my samsung camera 
13380 Its advertised as new, the product is not and wont hold charge 
13381 Works just fine. 
13382 This one is a bit shorter than the original that came with the lens, but that is not a problem. It screws on much more snuggly than the original, so I m hoping this one won t fall off and be lost! 
13383 So glad I saw this before laying out $160 more for the Really Right Stuff version! 
13384 Great product. If you are not tech savory you will need to get support. Online support is great. 
13385 good 
13386 Good price for a quality pod. I use vortex for all my scopes binos and spotter 
13387 Finally a battery charger that actually works for my model of Sony handycam. Ty Ty Ty. 
13388 Not bad for a small camera. 
13389 works on the Nikon lens that it was manufactured to fit. Mine was busted so I purchased the replacement. 
13390 Doesn t fit any canons 
13391 excellent 
13392 The photos speak for themselves. An outstanding camera. 
13393 The camera cleaning kit that was purchased arrived promptly and is exactly what I want. 
13394 not as good of quality as I would like, but for the price it s alright. 
13395 Good price and long lasting. 
13396 PERFECT!! 
13397 The documentation is in unintelligible English. Product support is non-existent. Returned. 
13398 Worked for the first day and then sensor wouldn t recognize motion. Not a good product. 
13399 Compact, great pictures, simple to use, good value for money. 
13400 Quick and as described 
13401 I like the fact that the charges has a plug right on it rather than having to lug the electrical cord around as is the case in the original charger. 
13402 BUYER BEWARE... Both zipper pulls from main compartment broke off in less than 3 months... the shoulder strap also broke in half. This case have only been used lightly since I bought it... I guess you get what you pay for. 
13403 it´s my second MegaGear, i have one for my G16, and love it. 
13404 Inexpensive way to get macro effects. Works best on 3rd objects (e.g. bugs, flowers, etc.) Not good for magnifying flat surfaces due to edge effects. 
13405 Bought this for my daughter s GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition. It worked great and made using the GoPro a breeze. We used it in and out of the water. 
13406 item simply did not work 
13407 useful good condition 
13408 It s takes really good pics. I was surprised. No problem with the camera. I use it underwater all the time. Great buy 
13409 Not always reliable but can usually get it operable after a bit of fussing. Serves its purpose for the price. 
13410 It works as expected. Since it is very inexpensive, and it comes in a pack of five, I don t mind putting new ones one as old ones break or fall off. So far so good, I have not had any failed on me yet. 
13411 It would be a better product if the batteries came in plastic carrying cases, such as Lumix batteries. This allows storage in camera bag without the contacts getting dirty. 
13412 I think it worked fine for the price, what do all the complainers want. 
13413 Excellent product! 
13414 Great bag, lots of compartments, just what I needed for a work bag. 
13415 Omg this is just what I expected an more ! Great conatruction , great materials ! Smooth and simple ! Amazing !!!! If you don t buy this as your first tripod you are just dumb ! 
13416 After I figured out how to work it, I can t complain about the camera, although the booklet that came with it was missing things so had to download it online. 
13417 Viviparous - the old standard at a great price. 
13418 The hight of the mount slide was too shallow for my GoPro Hero 3 clip and I could not insert the clip. Nice try but useless. 
13419 Love this lens! I use it for landscape and night sky photography. Yes, it is a little bulky and heavy but I feel that is a fair price to pay for the results that it can achieve. 
13420 Monitor had to be sent back to uniden for repair 1week after installation!!! Very disappointed and inconvenienced! Still haven t heard back from manufacturer! 
13421 Excelente 
13422 This lens works great, it is very light zoom is smooth. I recommend this lens 
13423 This product functions as designed and is definitely small and light but I d recommend getting the Jellyfish tripod instead. You ll be happier if you do. 
13424 Beautiful and has enough space for many things 
13425 The charge doesn t last very long, almost the same as the original Sony battery that I ve had for a few years - which is why I purchased new batteries. 
13426 Great 
13427 One of the leds doesn t work. Even thought the battery is fully charged (I ve charged them and switched them) One of the leds nevers turns on green. Besides that minor inconvenience the product works as described. 
13428 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
13429 Works very well and charges batteries quickly. Easy to use. 
13430 It s OK. 
13431 Now I just don t have to worry about not having a battery when I need it the most. 
13432 Cheap quality. If you are looking to save money go ahead. This mount will fall over and it will not stay in place when you wrap the legs around things. The camera is too heavy for the top ball it will slowly move and fall back. 
13433 works well 
13434 I liked the product 
13435 Price is right and comes with a 12v adapter as well. 
13436 Spectaculiar 
13437 Works great but would have liked some way to attach wrist/hand strap. It s still an excellent value. 
13438 Great picture quality at a very affordable price. Easily connected to my current ADT system. 
13439 This is such a great product! The camera is very easy to use and it has great pictures from it. When I was a child I always wanted a Polaroid camera and now I do. This is so much better than any other Polaroid camera. 
13440 Good product 
13441 Easy to use. Works great! It s much more convenient than using my smartphone app to take pics. Well worth the money. 
13442 I expected this pencil to be able to mark the back of photos. It does not. Was I incorrect in my expectation? 
13443 great backup battery. 
13444 No instructions or HDMI cable. 
13445 I had this camera for about a month now and it s awesome. I barely had problems with it, and it took great videos, photos, and more! 
13446 Works very good as expecyed 
13447 So far so good. 
13448 I love the color it s really lovely 
13449 These are great to keep up with camera in the water. I love the colors too! 
13450 It works just the way it supposed to be. 
13451 Perfect fit! 
13452 Perfect, was give the part info from Panasonic so I could find it on Amazon. It is just what I wanted and needed 
13453 Setting it up was easy because of the instructional videos you provided. I use this for filming videos. Seems like great quality and has a sturdy and solid build. 
13454 Package delivered on time, products such as described, all excellent, recommended 100%. 
13455 Great price and the filters work great! 
13456 Great case. Really fast shipping. Really easy to modify if you have made upgrades go your Phantom or controller. Very satisfied 
13457 good strap 
13458 Works where other cables don t. Long enough to avoid most issues. 
13459 works great in the night with no light and the sound is awesome. 
13460 It work wonderful, I really enjoy it. 
13461 I with I had one when I lost my gopro at the lake 
13462 great replacement strap 
13463 Super cheap plastic. Horrible video quality. Wasn t worth the $26 amazon prime day special. Returned it. 
13464 Had trouble with this product. It ended up not being compatible with my camera(Sony HDR-SR11) as advertised. However, the company I bought it from provided excellent customer service. I was able to return it. 
13465 Perfect fit. Access to the lock button when reversed. You wont be able to manual focus with it reversed though. 
13466 Works well in 2008 Honda CRV. 
13467 Very strong and durable. 
13468 It is excellent , it better and more power than regular Canon bsttery. Fast delivery. Thanks. 
13469 Very good accessory. Very solid, very good quality. Ideal for shooting at low altitude. The videos are fluids naturally no jumps or abrupt movements. The gripper has a non-slip protection, useful. I totally recommend. 
13470 Using this for cave photography/video very pleased with the results. 
13471 Used for sides of van 
13472 Very satisfied with purchase. 
13473 For the price, it is perfect for someone like me (a beginner) to mess around with some fun additions to my camera. 
13474 Snug fit on the lens and great protection to the lens. 
13475 Nice and sturdy piece of equipment. We mainly use it for our company s office pictures as well as pictures of our many field locations. Adjustable legs makes it pretty much suitable for any surface if you re willing to adjust the legs just right. 
13476 The camera never worked and a child was very dissappointed. Do not buy this camera. 
13477 It s a little too compact for the Lumix FX100 basic camera, and replacement battery. I need a larger case but the case is built great. 
13478 As expected 
13479 Good picture, too bad the lens scratch easily. Make sure you shake your camera underwater to get all the bubbles out before recording. Or another tip is to remove and reattach the filter while under water 
13480 This is good staf, now I can take photos for long time and many hours, it work with my Nikon D-5100 camera very well. 
13481 Great value, work as expected. Thanks! 
13482 excellent product. 
13483 A must have 
13484 Great product, would buy again. 
13485 It is great and really easy to use and the pictures a re good quality and clear. 
13486 Worked out great. 
13487 Excellent quality for a very low price! 
13488 Love this modern technical device for keeping an eye on the baby! This is a different generation of parents and they like to keep on top of the sleep schedule. This is an easy way to do it. Syncs with your cell phone. 
13489 Works very well & is easy to use 
13490 Very bad product. It show no value for money 
13491 The camera is wonderful,I really got what I wanted at a very great price 
13492 You just can t beat this deal! My batteries work perfectly, no problem shooting a full day of my son s baseball tournaments. I highly recommend product and seller. 
13493 Great deal! Love the dual charging ability. Thanks! 
13494 Took this on a trip to Africa. The worked great so far! 
13495 soft on the neck, and easy to put on the camera. 
13496 love it 
13497 Incredible prime lens. 
13498 It has a ton of features. I m just beginning to learn and try them out. It s fun! 
13499 bought this as a gift for my husband. It is a sweet case. It holds a lot of the accessories that we have for the go pro. very strong and durable 
13500 The one thing I slider is supposed to do is move left to right smoothly. Not only are there a lot of kinks in the move, it also wobbles forward and backwards along the track. 
13501 It worked as advertised. 
13502 Bought two. Each charged in less than 2 hours with Canon charger, but both were depleted of charge in 2 days. One with no use and the other used to take only 2 photographs. My rating would be a minus 5 stars. 
13503 Great replacement batteries for a good price. Have alwYs used Sarah I. 
13504 Excelente producto 
13505 What we needed - works great for camcorder and DSLR. 
13506 Not was explained.. Wasted money! 
13507 Walter did a great job assisting me and this is the 5th foscam camera I purchased and plan on purchasing more 
13508 I love this. It works great and arrived quickly 
13509 arrived fast and worked as I had planned. 
13510 I got the one before the session came out and the selfie stick sucks and the car mount broke once i touched it 
13511 Works well 
13512 Good 
13513 Got the camera used as a gift with Chatger. This one works just fine and charges fast! 
13514 Great camera, easy to use, and the movie capability captures good quality sound 
13515 Great, it works perfectly!!! 
13516 Extremely upset! Wish i could give it zero stars. I did not receive what was pictured. It was suppose to be film with rainbow borders instead they all have white borders. Will be returning. 
13517 I really do Like how straight forwardly useful this product is. I wish I had ordered it earlier. It s versatile and I can t find any fault. 
13518 Excellent Product 
13519 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
13520 Got two for remote locations and meeting my needs, excellent. 
13521 Good quality, very relaible 
13522 excelent , no problem 
13523 love the versatility 
13524 Awsome good 
13525 excellent fit and finish, works good. 
13526 Good product, Works as described haven t used it yet in the field cause ive been fighting my GoPro to update correctly but is sturdy built well and holds the GoPro very well. would recommend for somebody looking to either film live feed or charge for longer time lapse/video 
13527 No reason not to give 5 stars, the product charges batteries and the batteries run my gopro..cant be mad at that! 
13528 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
13529 I ordered this just to see the quality and to hold two JTL light stands. I am extremely surprised at the quality and the protection it gives to my light stands. I will be ordering more of them as I order more light stands. 
13530 Very high quality archival storage pages. I m moving family slides out of carousels and into these to save space. 
13531 Looks like the TV is on from outside. Somebody must be home, right? 
13532 Worked Directly without doing anything.... Just inserted it into the USB port of my Surface Pro 3 and Windows Hello was ready to scan my fingerprints... 
13533 i loved the camera, its great thank you 
13534 Fantastic camera!! 
13535 Calvin did a wonderful job and was very fast! 
13536 Needed this for my Kodak camera, however I paid about $20-24 dollars about 2 years ago on here, which I thought was kind of pricey. It does get the job done though. 
13537 Like having as a practical spare 
13538 Carlos, did an excellent job helping me with my camera 
13539 The card makes it worthwhile but probably won t use most of the items. 
13540 Perfect 
13541 The package arrived much earlier than promised. Excellent! The buckle s quality has room for improvement. The hook got pulled sideways by 2 MM after a week s use. 
13542 Easy to use and works well 
13543 Perfect operation simple install! You know someone s out front before they do! Range football field not bad! 
13544 I just love the camera the pictures that come are excellent 
13545 I thought it will be other type of camera with more features but still good for my photography classes. 
13546 Good for the price .The first times the stick rotated sometime but after some time it got harder and holds well big phones. Still using a lot after several months. 
13547 Very sharp, relatively light, and the AF is quick enough for fast subjects. 
13548 Cheaper than buying one of the clock nanny cams.. Works great, easy to program when connected to your PC.. 
13549 Good Material only first time to open is a little bit hard. 
13550 Works great! 
13551 I love it :) 
13552 Cannot beat it for the price. Great little lens and FUN to shoot with it. VERY pleased with this purchase and even though it is a manual focus it is easy to work with. The manual focus actually helps you to become a better photographer. 
13553 Does not fit well 
13554 So far, everything works great. My son ordered a GoPro for our vacation. His has issues and their tech support has been very lacking. I ordered a GeekPro and started to test it on Thursday. The picture quality is excellent and no issues were noted. Thanks for your prompt shipment! 
13555 I was looking for something to fit my Sony RX100 iii and this is perfect. It s kind of tight for it but it s work and it can also fit into my pockets. I needed something sturdy in case of an impact and this seem strong enough for it. 
13556 NICE! 
13557 Exactly as stated 
13558 great seller - delivered as promised! 
13559 The video quality is great. Love the microphone option. We are using this as a baby monitor. 
13560 Very nice product. Easy to install. Image and audio is not affected by the drop case. Rain, day, night, night vision is not affect by lens cover. Recommend this product. Perfect fit for my nest cam. 
13561 This item is as advertised. Seller shipped quickly. Would buy again. Two thumbs up. 
13562 Awesome results for a fraction of the price! Very cool close ups! Great for close ups of jewelry and insects. Worth every penny! 
13563 Good quality good price 
13564 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
13565 Does the job. Not as nice as the Nikon one. But at 1/3 the price and a couple free goodies in the box. 
13566 Very Good 
13567 The graduated filter works but isn t really dark enough in my opinion to make a huge difference. The build quality is very cheap and dust sticks to the glass like crazy. Not even close to being a high end grad filter, but will work kinda-sorta-ok. 
13568 Great product! Thank you for shipping it sooo fast!!!! 
13569 This is the first microscope I have ever owned. For the price it s a nice product. Very professional. Love hooking it up to the computer for a larger screen. No issues so far. 
13570 Great product 
13571 Works perfect! Arrived sooner than expected. Haven t had any problems with it. 
13572 Perfect 
13573 Great camera for the price!! Highly recommend 
13574 i keep getting asked if the round part is a bottler opener.... 
13575 Great product. Now I have a place to put my filters without leaving them on my lenses. The microfiber cleaning cloth; good addition. Thanks. 
13576 Right product..timely shipping....great price...charged right up...ready to use as a back-up!!! 
13577 Works just as well as the Canon brand battery and charger that I left somewhere in America s national parks last month. A great, cost-effective replacement. 
13578 Wow..!! Fantastic camera as I want. Its fell up my expectation. 
13579 The PERFECT case for traveling with the Inspire 1. Period. 
13580 This thing is big but then I bought it for the Tamron 150-600 which fits just right in it when locked at 150mm with the hood reversed and including the lens collar. Note: lens only, no camera attached. 
13581 These came with attached nice retaining strings, along with extra paste on strings. Great buy also with another Magic Fibre cloth too. 
13582 I LOVE IT....O PLAY IT ALL DAY FOR TWO YEARS NOW 
13583 The tripod itself is great for the price. It does the job that I need it to do. The carrying case on the other hand is terrible. I have had it just under two months and the strap has already come apart. 
13584 it is not charging anymore!!!!! 
13585 Works and fits my A6000 kit 55-210 lens perfectly! 
13586 Don t over fill easier to tie off 
13587 Worked out great, have plenty of room for accessories. 
13588 Arrived quickly and in great condition.It works ok but doesn t seem to last quite as the original. Just a little weaker I think. 
13589 first one got dunked in the ocean - loved the lens so much, I ordered a new one 
13590 these have been perfect for my new instant camera that i use on a regular basis. so fun & vintage. we display our photos on our fridge and in an instant film sized album. 
13591 Nicely padded, my dad loves it just wish it was a little bit longer 
13592 Snuggly holds my cards safely, I really like it. 
13593 It wasn t what I needed. 
13594 The clamp is great but the quick release tabs on the base of the neck both broke over the course of the first few uses. Now only the clamp is of any use. I wouldn t recommend this at current quality and durability levels. 
13595 worked as expected 
13596 works great. Also nice useful kit included. 
13597 Works great on my camera. I can now easily change from a neck strap to wrist strap in seconds and it is very sturdy. 
13598 Very attractive and sturdy posing stool. Assembly was very simple but because of the skimpy packaging, the seat-cushion was left with a large indentation mark that has not gone away after about 4 weeks. The height adjusting mechanism works well. 
13599 Good quality and love that it is not attached with a sticker, rather a secure cord. 
13600 Half didn t work 
13601 Bought this less than 6 months ago and barely made use of it but one of the batteries is a dud already. Disappointed! 
13602 Not as good as some other mini tripods, but it gets the job done. 
13603 Perfect. 
13604 Package was exactly as promised and received in excellent condition. 
13605 Awesome camera! Very fun and easy to use. Film is expensive, but what isn t these days? 
13606 Excellent product 
13607 didn t fit my gh1 
13608 Much better than the GoPro stock batteries, and these were fresh and let me motovlog for a lot longer without cutting me off early. 
13609 It s a great lens. there is a lot of distortion, but it s possibile to compensate using Camera Raw. Buy yhis just if you know how to work in iperfocal. 
13610 Camera is sold by Vivitar as &#34;underwater&#34; witha picture of a diver on the front of the box, yet on further review of the fine print, is only &#34;water resistant to 10 feet&#34;. This is a gross misrepresentation. Buy a go pro or another cheaper camera that is truley waterproof. 
13611 Detail of material 
13612 nice purchase 
13613 This has been a lot of fun to play with. Works fine. 
13614 Works really well... for the price 
13615 Terrible, terrible , terrible!!!!! 
13616 I completely adore these, they are a great catch for something more vintage fashioned when it comes to scrapbooking or even just for a wedding guestbook.Everyone had tons of fun with it, and we ve added it to our best times activity. just to incorporate some of everyone in it! 
13617 great item A++++ 
13618 works great 
13619 Wrong Key code on the software disk. Software will not load. 
13620 I love this tripod it is very tall as it says 5 7 it has a very nice height and it is light weight It works well with my Samsung Dv150f 
13621 Function OK. Quality OK. Delivery takes time from China. 
13622 For the price the quality surprised me. I m pleasantly surprised and happy. 
13623 I have Wasabi batteries for my Canon cameras and GoPro Hero 2 and 3. Better than OEM, more power so they last longer. Love the batteries, the chargers are OK - they use the same base and just attach the appropriate battery specific connector. This keeps sliding off. Annoying. 
13624 The Sony is great 
13625 and the service was also! Thanks Beach, I ll come again. 
13626 was a good value for a full frame sensor but returned for the D750 which is well worth the the price difference for the added features and low light performance. Wi-fi, flip screen, and higher usable iso made it a not brainer. 
13627 They are great! Price is great! 
13628 Great little storage album with contemporary feel for 5X7 photos that includes a business card holder. After purchasing the first one, I ve ordered two more. Build is excellent and pages very clear and durable. 
13629 Units work, but video quality leaves a little to be desired. 
13630 works great for my Panasonic camera and accessories, just right size not too big but still fits everything 
13631 exactly what i expected. each lens is a little magnifying glass and pivots. you can individually tighten each one. 
13632 good 
13633 Use it almost anywhere. 
13634 Kenneth helped me with a wireless connect problem. I am setting up a C1. This is my 4th Foscam and every one is doing the job. There can be a long hold time for tech support but they fix it as promised. Highly reccomend Foscam. 
13635 By far the best camera in its class for the price! Make sure you shop around for the best deal and you will love this camera! It is very user friendly and takes amazing pictures for experienced Photographer and newbies! 
13636 Great price, got it quickly. 
13637 Great product and great service from company. 
13638 now my tool box matches the rest of my gear cases 
13639 Gr8 cam 
13640 Was just what I was looking for to Go Pro paddleboarding 
13641 Great 
13642 I recommend 100% 
13643 Using one on each of my Jeeps. One of which is used on a fender lip mount. 
13644 Descent midrange price flash. Nothing special. Use for times when a flash is required additional lighting. Not good for doing creative lighting. 
13645 Prompt service, good price. 
13646 Buen producto. 
13647 Great colors! 
13648 Couldn t get this to work with my Nikon D600. 
13649 Good Quality and Products, just what I needed for my small jewelry photography. 
13650 Does not fit my sb400 
13651 Well made but a tight fit for a camera with a zoom lens attached 
13652 cheap 
13653 Lasted longer than standard battery 
13654 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
13655 Looks like a good quality product, but unfortunately it doesn t fit my gopro as advertised. I have a gopro hero 3. This skeleton housing is slightly too big for the houaing my gooro came with. Too bad. 
13656 Good quality camera for the price, but alternative software is highly recommended. 
13657 Did not like this item the lights are not bright enough to light the background properly for a good photo. I ve tried everything with this box and my photos do not come out nearly as well as my last box ( different brand). 
13658 Great Camera!! 
13659 solid, solid, solid!!! 
13660 My daughter was pleased 
13661 Worked very well shipped quickly and packaged well. All in all is what it says and does what it is supposed to do 
13662 Good kit. A couple of additional ways to attach the camera that didn t rely on an enclosure for the camera to be purchased would make it a great kit. 
13663 stylish and well made. Blue tooth works wonderfully and is easy to use. Camera is high quality; however, it seems to aim low. Like it is made for people with low setting ears. I only capture about the bottom 2/3 of whatever I am looking at when using the camera. 
13664 We swam with wild dolphins.Zip lined across a rain forest.Rode horses threw the jungle and jet boarded in puerto vallarta.But by far the funniest thing was clipping a go pro to our American bull dog puppy.Good bargain for a durable product.Ive told many friends about this deal. 
13665 Excellent product .... just missing the feature to turn off the IR in menu, but everything else is there. very quiet, fast, software support multiple cameras, works very well. Audio and Mic are perfect! .... so far GOOD 
13666 I have flew it just about 5 times. I carefully read some of the comments here and yes you should make sure you rad and review any information prior to flying this copter. I could see how it could flay away if you don t read the instructions. 
13667 Nice case. Just WAY TOO BIG for our needs. Return was no problem. It seemed much bigger than the dimensions (they were correct, just seemed bigger). Had to go a different route. 
13668 Very happy with the quality of product. Does what it promises to do. With my glasses, , laptop, tablet, smartphone, and my palm pilot around, I keep these within reach. Thanks 
13669 Works as expected. 
13670 Dual zipper close -- one zipper broke off within the first week. Velcro &#34;separator panels&#34; are less effective than expect. However, OTHER than that, sturdily constructed -- size\design supports ease of use. 
13671 happy 
13672 Great grip / cool design / move on! ;-) 
13673 They work great put off good light. Carrying bag is cheap and zipper is too but I didn t buy it for the case. Switch was broken on one of the chords but no biggie to just fix myself with a new switch. 
13674 Skeleton frame and clear lens cover fits my Hero4 Silver perfectly. All ports, lights, and mic line up with holes in the case. It also comes with a threaded tripod mount. 
13675 Great cams! Looks perfect 
13676 Excellent 
13677 Still charging after 8 months of daily use. 
13678 I use this for snorkeling in the red sea on deployment and for riding my bike at home. couldn t be happier! 
13679 Nice camera with a lot of features. 
13680 Camera takes good quality video. The waterproof case makes the sound not so great. The mounts are decent but DO NOT over tighten them. 
13681 asdescribed/ fast ship/ fair price/ recommend seller. 
13682 Bought this until I can afford a Nuba led ring light. I m actually really impressed with the performance. I have it paired with a neewer 750 ttl flash and Nikon d3300 
13683 The system did exactly what I needed. Soon after using the charger to charge my existing batteries and the new battery, the old charger that I was unable to locate in 3 weeks of tearing the house apart was found in plain sight. 
13684 It served it purpose... 
13685 Best bang for the buck. I ve used a few of these and they work great. haven t gotten a filter stuck on one yet, unlike some other brands I ve tried. 
13686 This camera has helped me collect so many precious memories... 
13687 Takes great clear pictures and is light weight. Easy to place in a small purse... 
13688 This is nice and works well for my once a month photo sessions. I can t say how it would hold up if you used it everyday and traveled with it. It replaces one almost the same, although this one does have a nicer carry bag. 
13689 Very light weight, sturdy easily holding a video head, a DSLR , lens and a slider. gets low, goes high. Feet are soft rubber for inside, reveling metal spikes for outside. Great no nonsense tripod. 
13690 terrible quality, the camera is way to small, it is plastic witch makes it eel like youre using a toy, it sucks 
13691 Great kit at a great value. I only gave it 4 stars because the selfie stick is useless. It can t handle the weight of the gopro and won t hold it upright. It just spins around and faces down. Other than that piece, the rest seems to be great. 
13692 The camera works wonderful and it was the best deal I found! 
13693 good really sharp pictures? good camera 
13694 Smooth , firm , and steady , the ball bearings do the trick ! Awesome great price 
13695 Still learning how to use. Older eyes and small screens.... 
13696 returned it ---not good 
13697 it helped me wonderful!!! i would recommend it truly , THANKS 
13698 Great portable tripod..that can handle full sized DSLR and lens. 
13699 A+ 
13700 Great lens. All items were as listed. Would purchase again. 
13701 Worked fine. I recommend! 
13702 Good product for the price. Takes nice pictures. 
13703 Crazy sharp! 
13704 as advertised 
13705 perfect deal. came exactly as expected 
13706 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
13707 for the price, it s worth it. most of the cradles are very tight fitting but they all make it eventually. the case is bulky and there is really no good way to get it all in the case. But, again, for the price you can t beat it. 
13708 Worked perfectly. Car charger is an added bonus!! 
13709 adequate for the task at hand. 
13710 Very pleased with this product! High quality and the cases included are excellent. 
13711 This product is so nice my daughter displays it on her desk with her pictures 
13712 Return wasn t one we wanted 
13713 great product 
13714 This is an excellent lens for any photographer/digital artist. I bought the lens for my Nikon D3200. You must use this lens in manual mode settings on camera. After reviewing fisheye attachment lens and true fisheye lens, definitely spend the extra money for a true fisheye lens. 
13715 Like it better than other tripods-more flexibility 
13716 Bought this for my daughter to take to her trip to Iceland, she was able to fit her camera and lenses in there nicely and loved that she could slide the bag over the handle of her suitcase. Pricey but worth the investment. 
13717 great buy since the batteries on the go pro run out quickly 
13718 Very nice! 
13719 Amazing!!! 
13720 Excelent product 
13721 This charger pack is an incredible value. I love this new charger. Would recommend 100%. 
13722 There batteries really aren t any good. Most times they only charge to 75-80% and they drain way to fast, even when they sit in the camera and it s turned off. 
13723 love it! it even comes with the hardware to tighten the screws 
13724 Quality glass that is still kicking on my camera a year later. I have nothing bad to say about this product. Will buy again. A+ 
13725 Works perfect with the flash, no TTL (i already know it before buying). 
13726 Great for 1 dslr camera but not if your needing to carry more then one dslr. 
13727 Fast and quit focusing, Sharp Photo s 
13728 Camera was like new. Works perfectly and was purchased as a replacement for my broken camera. This like new one reminded me why I bought the original in the first place. Takes fabulous pictures and is light enough to take anywhere. 
13729 Works great. Tested the batteries and they charge and work fine. 
13730 A little thinner than I expected it to be. If working remotely, be sure nothing reflective like a tv, photograph is behind it as it will reflect the light and give you hot spots. 
13731 Exactly what I needed 
13732 just what I needed 
13733 Fantastic 
13734 Well-made product. Nicely priced. Arrived quickly and nicely packaged. Exactly what my daughter wanted. I am sure there will be many many selfies in her cuter. Hopefully, no duck-face. One can hope. 
13735 Super 
13736 Good Product 
13737 Perfect. Exactly what I needed, and arrived in time for my trip to meet my new grandosn, and now I can take pictures because my camera is charged. :) 
13738 Always,we re human and will have accidents. 
13739 I like the mount. Should have ribbed the barrel so it won t drop down on the stem over rough roads. 
13740 Fantastic Quality Color 
13741 It s a lot smaller than I thought it would be. Will definitely not fit a 70-200mm lens. Lengthwise or width wise. 
13742 Great tripod 
13743 Loved it! 
13744 very good and steady tripod 
13745 The tilt motion has some tension but the pan is really smooth 
13746 No problem at all. Shipment time very fast. easy to use, very good quality of pictures. the package was definitely good 
13747 This is so easy to use. Works very well. 
13748 works very well!!!!!!!!!!!! 
13749 Works great 
13750 Works great, no problems everything as described 
13751 It fits perfectly my Sony HX90V 
13752 Perfect replacement lens for one that was dropped in the water at the beach. Works great. 
13753 Good: Solid Cheese construction Solid when Screwed down. Bad: No real bad things to say yet. Gets a bit in the way of using the view finder, flipped around or not because of the little butt end that sticks out. 
13754 Best friend of Sony Alpha 6000 mirrorless camera for panoramic photo and video with a relative short lens (like 35mm - 85 mm). Otherwise you may need to mount this grip to the lens itself. 
13755 Glad I got this when I bought my camera. Perfect protector of the lens at a very good price! 
13756 Fine 
13757 Does not work at all. Does not hold a charge for the camera. Basically I bought a $50 wall clock 
13758 decent quality 
13759 It works! I am using this with a Tamron 90mm macro on my OM-D and it works perfectly. The tolerances are nice and tight and the images are great! I have a fotodiox adapter for Canon FD and for Nikon and they all work great! 
13760 Exactly what I was looking for 
13761 Bags are really loose, neoprene is really thin, won t protect your lenses! 
13762 Would be super with a USB plug instead of a car port. Live in the now! 
13763 good 
13764 FLIMSEY, CANNOT OPEN THE BACK. DON T BUY IT. 
13765 This is so thin. I thought it would be thicker and not look like a piece of cheap cloth. 
13766 Works really good easy to set up as well.cameras are not the best and 2 of the 4 got wet when it rained other 2 still work good. Company did replace them free of charge. Other than that for price u realy can t go wrong. 
13767 This has a one way viewer only, but a good one. Like it. 
13768 First time tactual,y ordering these but aftually love it &#60;3 came at the same time it said 
13769 Exactly what was needed and wanted. Thank you for the opportunity to once again have my camera. LF 
13770 Works as advertised. I purchased these as back up batteries for my camera and they work just fine. 
13771 It was a good flash, but it just stopped working about two months later and the company is completely unresponsive. 
13772 Great Camera Day or night! Great Value as well........ 
13773 More than enough for me. 
13774 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0039BPG1A/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_13 
13775 Works 
13776 CASE# C6726445 BADGE ID # AR004228 DLINK tech support made everything a breeze. From A to B, the whole setup was simple and easy. Jenny assisted very clearly and in a friendly tone. The camera is of high quality. Definitely buying more DLINK products in the near future. 
13777 My daughter loves this camera & took gorgeous pictures through Ireland, Italy & England!! 
13778 works well, is solid, but much heavier than I expected. 
13779 Very pleased / works great / had a defective camera called GW and a RM Number was given to return camera / will update progress 
13780 Ample space; well built; good looking; fits the bill perfectly for my needs 
13781 kenneth did a wonderful job answering my questions. 
13782 served my needs 
13783 Highly recommended!! Great product. It can be folded to less than 10 inch long, has a sturdy build and work as expected. 
13784 IT IS HUMONGOUS! Very protective, but also very thick. I like the fact that I can wrap my lens up as a burrito or baby, hahaha. 
13785 Works as well as the battery and charger that came with my camera. Very pleased. 
13786 It is what it s advertized to be and works wel 
13787 great product 
13788 Great price, there was a 5 inch tear in the bag but I will place duck tape inside to &#34;repair&#34; the rip. Great price. Just what I need for vendor events., 
13789 Nice soft rubber, fits snug 
13790 I was really excited to get my Nikon bundle package today. But then when I took the bag off the carrying case for the camera it was dirty! Not sure if it was used? And if it was what other items in my bundle package were used then re-wrapped? 
13791 Works great. We take the battery off after Sun. AM service and it s ready to roll again by PM. 
13792 love this lens, very sharp 
13793 100% advisable 
13794 Works great cleaning my glasses and other electronic devices. Would buy again. 
13795 Works Great Now We Get to Use Our Camera again!!! 
13796 It s a Holga Lense. You don t expect low-light performance, or high quality feel ( it s all plastic) or pixel perfect reproduction. It s a nice cheap lense for experimenting with stuff. 
13797 Great picture quality 
13798 Fast delivery from Amazon. Works Great 
13799 It operates very well. I am still getting used to at the same time as with Windows 10. It replaces a lost Easy Share that had a rechargeable battery and a docking station. 
13800 Not the one pictured. It is the official made in Thailand Nikon OEM 
13801 It s works well 
13802 If u have a good camera , this product is a must. It protects your investment. 
13803 Solid. A bit heavy but on a bad thing for my rig. The holes are not universal for a AB Gold Mount which is why I got two of these but I made it work and it held. Cheaper compared to other 15mm cheese plates so I can t complain. 
13804 Higher quality lens than the 1 i had before. Great buy 
13805 Really takes so much stress off my neck, thanks so much. 
13806 It would not open on Mac 
13807 Works perfectly with my Canon M3 mirror less camera 
13808 Perfect fit for my Fujifilm S9200 and for my Digital Video Camera. It hold both and a charger at the same time. 
13809 item as described and on time. 
13810 Works good but you must have it about 3 feet off the ground and the chime is very loud a volume control would be nice 
13811 The product works flawlessly being plugged into socket. I didn t try that in autocharger. 
13812 Perfect. 
13813 This is a decent budget scanner. it won t blow your socks off but as long as you don t mind a little bit off work in Photoshop it s not bad. 
13814 does the job, but should be made out of metal for strength 
13815 does what it s supposed to. good stuff. 
13816 Perfect Bundle, good price 
13817 Excellent! 
13818 This is the perfect lens for everyday shots. It s fast and compact. 
13819 Great scope for the low price ,I bought this for astrophotography. It is well built and works great. I also have the 500-1000mm same brand and from same company 
13820 The moon shots are very good. I have had no problems with my new scopes. 
13821 works really well for the price 
13822 This camera is easy to use. Just follow the instruction, I get the video appear in my Android app. The night vision of this camera is poor. 
13823 Great item 
13824 Great camera. You can t beat the Leica lens. 
13825 Excellent! 
13826 What can I say but these lights are perfect! 
13827 It is very good 
13828 Remote viewing is very slow compared to older models. It sucks but the set up is much easier. 
13829 WISH IT WORKED LONGER DISTANCE 
13830 A++++++ 
13831 Does not bring any SD card 6 feet of cable what is that good for you would need an outlet on every camera very very poor quality video super super cheap quality!!!!!!! 
13832 As described! 
13833 It s very well made and is the perfect fit for our canon camera! We never worry about throwing it in a bag and damaging the camera. Feels protected. 
13834 Great quality! Works well. 
13835 This is a great camera 
13836 The image quality is excellent! 
13837 Great quality 
13838 This was a part of a Christmas gift for my daughter and she likes it tho the photos are rather small. 
13839 Garbage product. Broke before I could install it. Again, IT BROKE BEFORE IT WAS USED. That s a little problematic. Don t waste your money. Buy the Canon version. Mine Canon cable is still going strong 6+ years after its purchase. 
13840 Excellent!! 
13841 Great product. I used it when hiking and it held up. 
13842 Works perfect 
13843 good 
13844 It takes forever to charge an NP970! 
13845 Hero2 mounted gimbal-less under my phantom 2, and I have ZERO jello. Awesome. 
13846 it does what it says. 
13847 ♡ 
13848 They seem to work just fine. I have quite a few; probably more than I need. 
13849 Henry, Called for help getting set-up to access my camera on my mobile device. Henry was able to use team viewer and went over what he was doing with in 3-5 minutes I was able to connect to my camera! 
13850 Works really well. Keep forgetting to turn the mic on and off but the battery seems to be holding up well. 
13851 These are excellent - we keep a pile of them around the house as they re the only effective glasses cleaner around. 
13852 Excellent 
13853 Beautiful pics. Had some glitches at first but Ricoh helped out. Easy to use and the picture quality is awesome. 
13854 I am pleased with product. I haven t used it yet but I am just glad that it fits my camera 
13855 Works and fast shipping! 
13856 I use this lens probably the most - it gets me just the right amount of zoom, and the pictures come out super sharp and clear. Its not clunky or heavy to carry either. 
13857 thanks 
13858 Bold and nice quality signs! These signs are hard to miss and should serve as a deterrent to would be trespassers. 
13859 It does a very bad job of zoom. The zoom feature was why I purchased the camera and if you use the zoom the pics are blurry. I am very disappointed. 
13860 Excellent value 
13861 Good price, good product. Used them to mount lights for video making. 
13862 Volume down button didn t work. I got s replacement and the same thing was wrong with the replacement. I ended up returning both and got a different camera. 
13863 I ordered. I charged. It just did not work. So, I returned... 
13864 Love it, the quality of the recordings are a lot better than I expected. 
13865 great bag. arrived as promised. lots of versatility. 
13866 Im happy with the quality and texture of this strap. Im using it on a fujifilm x100t and its secure and at an ideal length. There are slight abbrasion marks on the strap from the camera rubbing against the strap, but Ive conditioned this strap and it restored the texture. 
13867 Purchased to wire up security cameras. I checked all with continuity tester and all were functional. 
13868 Fits perfectly with my glasses on. Not easy to install on a D90 but with a little extra force, made it to fit. I mostly shoot outdoors so having less light coming from the side of your eye helps a lot. 
13869 Good buy 
13870 Shipping very fast and easy install. Picture quality is good. 
13871 It fits perfectly ..It goes on the computer and camera. 
13872 Great batteries! The batteries last longer than the original GoPro battery. Charger has built in plug making it easier to travel with since there are fewer parts to keep track of. Great products. 
13873 ok 
13874 The best Camera ever!! 
13875 It fit the camera but did not work. 
13876 Works great and is definitely as advertised! 
13877 Perfecr 
13878 Very unreliable. When it works, it s great. But I cannot tell you how many times live view simply does not work and I cannot tell you how many times when I try to respond to an alert it simple says &#34;cannot connect right now&#34;. And forget it working wirelessly. 
13879 This battery offers more power time (2600 mAh against 1800 mAh Canon battery) for your camera. 
13880 This is an awesome monopod. Used with point and shoot and a 6d 
13881 nice 
13882 Great Buy solid picture quality for landscapes 
13883 Works and fast shipping! 
13884 Still learning to use them but I like it a lot. 
13885 I bought this for my daughter who will be a freshman in college this year. It is very easy to use and VERY loud. Hope she never has to actually use it. 
13886 Excellent Filter as expected. 
13887 Significantly more compact than the charger included with the A7Rii, and with added LEDs to tell you how far along the charge process is. I consider a pair of these to be an essential part of a Sony kit. 
13888 Love 
13889 Does not work for the whole range. after a certain point it starts showing an &#34;X&#34; in the picture because areas along the diagonals are darkened more than rest of the image. 
13890 Nice 
13891 👎 
13892 Returned this one as it is not what I expected. 
13893 ok;-))) 
13894 The product was received in fine condition and was what I expected. The problem is that the movies and pictures on the TV are not in color. This was a surprise. 
13895 This case works great. It fits the camera perfectly and keeps it protected 
13896 Flys great, camera works great, excellent product. Once you start getting the hang of things, you should look up NAZA mode....NAZA may even better for beginners 
13897 Works well 
13898 back door does not fit Hero 3. it is too large. 
13899 Fantastic camera - still figuring out all the functions and menus, but it takes great pictures, compact in size, good battery life and much more than a point and shoot ! Shipped and delivered the same day. 
13900 Just an awesome Toy... A little Tricky but you can get used to it... 
13901 very glad I made this purchase. 
13902 Picture quality is not great but it keeps my daughter happy. 
13903 Arrive fast and exactly as described. Cheap solution for my problem. Thank you! 
13904 It s a pelican case, not much more needs to be said. Great for storing my nitrogen regulator ! Longest time I ve kept a regulator without a busted face ! 
13905 It is a good scope for the money with lots of attachments you can get for it. However like most of these lower priced ones, the tripods are pretty much useless as far as being sturdy enough. 
13906 Good Deal! 
13907 Quick order comes with a filter pouch. Nice package 
13908 Works like a charm! 
13909 I should have waited to purchase one that was a little sturdier and taller. But for the price it is alright. 
13910 nice 
13911 Was excited to find a clip-on with good reviews as opposed to my magnetic one. Make sure you are super close to the object when using the macro lens. But very happy with this product, and was compatible with my new iPhone 7 as well as my old iPhone 6 
13912 excellence, 
13913 **Product Received in exchange for honest review** Great quality tripod mount! Works great and made of very durable plastic.. This is just as good quality as any of the other tripod mounts that I own.. I highly recommend this 
13914 Nice low cost alternative to a GoPro 
13915 Camera did not meet my expectations. The quality of the photos in auto and friendly auto mode is not acceptable. 
13916 Perfect!!! 
13917 This lens kit arrived quickly, well packaged, and in good working order. I used it during my recent vacation, and was very pleased with the performance of all the lenses. 
13918 Excellent Portable tripod. I always toss one into both cars. A little light for my full size Nikon but A1 for my Canon G15 
13919 Works great........ 
13920 Item collectionable, but like new. It works fine, Im happy whit this purchase. Amazon.com is amazing. Thank´s a lot. 
13921 I am very happy not only with the camera, but the cost. As far as I am concerned, this is a new camera to me. I am going to France in the new future and I look forward to using it and getting great pictures. 
13922 Prints pictures very well, but can be hard to manage. Otherwise a very lovely, easy-to-manage camera! Gives off good vintage vibes and instantly gives you a nice bit of pretensious hipster flare. 
13923 Works great! I lost my charger somewhere when I moved and needed a replacement. Great price and it works well. No doubts my original one will show up now but at least this was a cheap replacement. 
13924 a perfect fit for the canon camera. convenient slots for sd card and extra battery. easy to carry in the hand or wrist. a really nice and compact case. 
13925 Excellent. 
13926 Excellent product.. includes everything and the fancy case is wonderful 
13927 Works great. Long battery life! 
13928 I had to return for a poorly fitted/errant propeller on the drone. A new one should be sent 
13929 does not fit well into the socket. Ruined the Connection of the original automatic lens. 
13930 Amazing camera, all came in a big box well protected, I cant wait for my next family vacation to start shooting photos, all the products that came with the bundle are great, not all are the best quality, but for the price the bundle are an excellent deal !! 
13931 Light weight and gets the job done without breaking your back. I use it for my Canon 600 at weddings. Of course you need a hot shoe attachment for flashes, don t forget that. 
13932 Does not fit well. Keeps slipping of the Canon lens it was built for. Don t waste your money on this piece of poorly made plastic. You should expect more from the lensmaker 
13933 Fast shipping and works as promised. My camera was unusable without this so I m happy to have it! 
13934 Very great purchase,thanks 
13935 OSD anything on a camera this cheap shouldn t be passed up... I ve seen alot of 800, 1000, even 1200 tvl cameras for under $20... they all look like crap in 1080p @ 48&#34;... this doesn t look bad even thou you ld expect it to 
13936 Excellent product good quality 
13937 Easyh to instal. Camera magnets to it, just like a stock mount. Gives an obtuse rather than acute angle for options for pointing the camera. 
13938 Works well with my camera 
13939 Fits to camera. allows remote control of shutter and complete control during a &#34;bulb&#34; control for minute plus shots. Reasonably priced - would buy it again. 
13940 fast delivery and just what I needed 
13941 Perfect holds my military spotting scope 
13942 Good fit 
13943 I love that camera and extra gadgets;) 
13944 This was a graduation gift from college for my daughter. She was so happy to get it and uses all of it for her work and as a hobby. Glad to have found it at AMAZON! 
13945 This is the case I use when I m taking extra things with me. 
13946 Awesome tripod. My wife bought it for me for my birthday. And it works great. I can set it almost anywhere I want and it stays. 
13947 Hope I don t have to use this but I do think its a great deal. 
13948 arrived as exactly described! I keep the senior pictures of my friends in this album, and the plastic sheets give the wallets more than enough room 
13949 Arrived quickly with a kind note from the sender. A great product really, I ve been using it well for my Sony camera lens and my computer screen. 
13950 Nice camera so far, great pictures. Talking it on trip to Utah s National; Parks. Shipped fast, well packaged. 
13951 Amazing product i use it on all my shoots for modeling 
13952 Much cheaper than the Nikon flashes, with almost the same bells and whistles. Performs great 
13953 Great product. Easy to use and ultra good video quality. This customer service is the best part of everything. They helped me through the installation process. 
13954 Great hard to find product! Very happy! 
13955 Can t use my camera without this... 
13956 Great lens 
13957 Thank you. All was well! 
13958 super camera 
13959 This meter is amazing! Growing indoors this is must have tool! I recommend this to anyone who is a beginner or expert. 
13960 great seller - delivered as promised! 
13961 For the price, this is okay, but the tripod is pretty flimsy. I m no photography expert...and I won t be with equipment like this. 
13962 nice 
13963 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
13964 Batteries work great. 
13965 While the tubes don t lock up on my lenses like others have noted, they are not rigid. Any change in pressure on the lens causes them to flex considerably. 
13966 Overall my daughter loves it for changing at dance competitions; however, it is difficult to fold down until you have practiced several times. 
13967 I had a 12mm and it didn t give me a full view, this 16mm is about right. 
13968 Product appears to be good quality and functions as advertised. Happy with the transaction. 
13969 very good protection. good grip 
13970 I got one MagicFiber as a free trial with an order from Amazon suppler...Ordered this set ..what more can I say, they work GREAT. Ordered them for my cameras and my wife took one for her glasses... 
13971 It s AWESOME! 
13972 love this camera, its as advanced as a hobbyist needs thats not into SLRs. excellent photos and fairly easy to learn. the viewfinders fine for me ive seen some complaints. still breaking it in. if you need something larger than a cell phone camera but not super advanced its great. 
13973 The best scanner for the price! 
13974 Danny was extremely helpful and was very patient. He is a true asset to your organization. kudos to him! Product is extremely effective and delivers on the promise. 
13975 Perfect fit for my Norman LH-1 lampheads. Could have used these long ago! Nice product - protects well. 
13976 It works 
13977 Ar004214 Thank for your support I initially have trouble with my wifi but the tech service Breagan help me to set up the camara and is working very good I do have two cameras. 
13978 good 
13979 Very excellent item for the price nice resolution and double screen its nice to. 
13980 really not that impressed. 
13981 Fits on my lens perfectly - just what I wanted. 
13982 Fits just right. I m using it on my FE 35mm f/2.8. 
13983 Must have for GoPro!! 
13984 A lot more dependable than off brand knock offs 
13985 Excellent product. 
13986 Too much vignetting from using it on the lens, useless. Works ok on the hotshoe, but kinda misses the point to use it like that. 
13987 Easy to install and works reliably! 
13988 Excellent, stylish and good photos 
13989 Great price! Delivered quickly. Works well. 
13990 Looks nice. Easy to put on camera. You need to adjust it to your needs. 
13991 Great binoculars...just what we were looking for .... THANKS. 
13992 I wish the optical zoom is much better. For even close objects after full zoom I have to move closer physically to to the target to get the best pic. Unsure if theres a better way of taking pics. 
13993 On time and as described. No issues 
13994 These have lasted longer than original GoPro batteries as well as another popular 3rd party battery. Highly recommended. 
13995 Great helper, to watch out your house while you are away :) 
13996 Flash does not work as advertised. It will not work wirelessly. I contacted the seller for help, but never heard back from them. 
13997 it does not fit my camera like it was advertised!!! 
13998 This camera was exactly what I was looking for. Would give it 5 stars if the app didn t freeze up so often. Was easy to install and set up. 
13999 very good cam for the price. the instruction video was ok but could have been better. overall the camera works great and the pan tilt works much better then I thought it would. 
14000 This little bOOger is made very well, great fluidity, and craftsmanship...I highly recommend this high quality tripod. 
14001 tks 
14002 great replacement battery with fast shipping. 
14003 Works well 
14004 Great case really love how compact and protective it is. Perfect amount of space for a few accessories. I have been using it for 3 months now with a canon sl1 and don t regret getting this case at all. 
14005 The product has arrived and every thing worked as I expected. We have been using the batteries and charger regularly. 
14006 Great product. Simple and works! 
14007 This is the second fake tv I have ordered and this one worked perfectly. This is the first one I ordered from Three Bears. They were good to deal with. I would have no problem ordering another. 
14008 Fast Shipping, made very sturdy, all cameras came on clear. 
14009 perfet 
14010 These supply an excellent current level for making colloidal silver, and the addition of a couple of alligator clips converts them into great little portable generators suitable for either home or travel. I m very pleased with them, and have recommended them to others. 
14011 Excellent goodies for the price. 
14012 Th bag is so cute and fluffy, I loved it! 
14013 great transaction. Product as described 
14014 wish more quality clear camara 
14015 Great deal! 
14016 GOOD QUALITY 
14017 I want my money back, not worth the price. 
14018 The belt loop breaks fast. 
14019 This is the kit that goes with the camera, I bought for my granddaughter. She s had more fun, than I thought she ever would. She loves being able to add her own special creation to pictures. GOOD QUALITY!!! The case is super cute!!! 
14020 Perfect!!!! Love this Drone arrived on time as described 
14021 Batteries work great and the charger is a good addition. 
14022 This kit has the accessories I wanted at a reasonable price.. 
14023 Nice set of camera lens adapter rings. 
14024 I had problems with CD because it arrived broken. I do not know where get a new one. 
14025 Plugged in just as instruction said. About a minute after taking of lost all power and copter board caught on fire. Been flying for a year with no problems until I attached the camera 
14026 No issues !!!! 
14027 great 
14028 Nicely made product; works as advertised. Shipped/arrived on time. Thanks... jb 
14029 This product is excellent. Well made and exactly what I was expected. Delivery was excellent and no damage during transit. 
14030 Not great, not bad. You get what you pay for. 
14031 Freakin BEST camera bag EVERRRRR!!!! Love it sooo much!! Thank you, thank you! It s solid, fantastic and I have ZERO complaints :):) 
14032 Everything went fine 
14033 Easy to use, worked fine 
14034 Nice 
14035 Great bag!🎒 Got it for my boyfriend as a bday gift!👬❤️🎁🎉So much storage! Love the lime green accent color😍 perfect for hikes 🗻📷👌 and makes traveling on planes better✈️ 
14036 Arrived safely. Worked great for my trip to the zoo! 
14037 Very good 
14038 My husband the thrill seeker loves this chest mount! His GoPro was held securely while ziplining, mountain bike riding, and God knows what else he does :). Great buy, shouldn t be disappointed. 
14039 Perfect...just what I needed. 
14040 Work well! 
14041 The price is too much for too little 
14042 TERRIBLE, I bought this when i was at the beach. Then took it into the water and it was suppose to be so called &#34;waterproof&#34;. It wasn t and rusted then I was going to use it again and the pole popped right off and bent. 
14043 It s an amazing mount! I use it specifically for recording races and other events on my bike. It is extremely sturdy and well made! Totally would purchase again or recommend if anybody needs a mount for their GoPro! 
14044 Bough in November, 2014. After July, 2015, they charge about 2 hours of use (one bar). Enveloping plastic detaches from edge, which makes difficult to get battery out of camera. 
14045 This item was not working well.... Turned on the camera and I got pictured.. But the picture was blur like smudge ..... Not in good condition... 
14046 Good qualities and a great seller. 
14047 It must BUY item :) 
14048 No problems 
14049 Hi...Your timer you send to me is wonderful,i love it,thanks./. 
14050 Screen was completely backwards (clock, etc.) Sent it back. 
14051 this product was good quality and meant every one of my requirements 
14052 The unit arrived in good condition and everything was included as stated. Very good buy for all that you get. 
14053 excelent. 
14054 This was purchased quite some time ago and it is still holding up strong. I remember not paying a huge price on this and it has certainly served its purpose for my light needs. Lightweight, includes a storage bag. Collapses down pretty compact. 
14055 Extremely light and very well made for it s pricepoint. Have no worries mounting my 6D to it. Very compact and easy to travel with as well. 
14056 good material i like it. keeps my speed lights tight on those tripods 
14057 Works great. The turnover time from order to receipt was very short! 
14058 Great performance ! 
14059 Nice selection the product price was fantastic and the quality is very nice can wait to start posting videos 
14060 ok quality, did the job 
14061 These work great on glasses, iPhone, iPad, etc, and they are larger than similar products I have tried in the past. I would definitely recommend. 
14062 Works well- worth the money 
14063 No problems with the order at all. 
14064 Battery works great, and retains power very well. 
14065 The Charger is different than the picture and have just one dock for battery, the car charger is different too and is just for this charger and is not possible charge a ipad and iPhone at the same time because doesn t exist usb port.... 
14066 Excellent device. Has worked for me for many months. 
14067 Junk, send it back to China 
14068 I wear glasses and use a nice camera so these come in handy and are thicker than most I ve used. Very pleased. 
14069 Worked great! Fit perfectly in my Sony Cybershot W620. Happy with product and quick delivery. 
14070 We are trying to catch a car thief who stole my wife s car. He keeps coming back on our property to try again. We hope to catch him with one of these camera. 
14071 Not bad for price. 
14072 Like everyone else, the base of the arm broke on me after only a couple of uses. NOT WORTH WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT! 
14073 If you are a professional....stay away from this....I know...if professional should not be buying this in the first place...correct. If you were to purchase..install and never move or remove...could be alright...third time I removed...the whole entire right side tore from top to bottom...overpriced for what it is. bummer. 
14074 I bought the 2 camera system first, it worked so good, i purchased two additional cameras to add to the system. Simple to setup, record and maintain. I use it to monitor the home while away and it works. 
14075 Protects my camera from scratch and light bump. Portable n light. 
14076 Love it 
14077 Perfect replacement (and extra back-up) batteries for my Sony Cyber-shot DSC-WX50 16.2 MP Digital Camera. 
14078 This is a hd camera and it perfect for inside. I had no problem with the install 
14079 Excellent camera; cheap goodies. 
14080 Works perfectly at a fraction of the cost. 
14081 These are really good stands! I use them with the NEEWER 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Camera Video Lights and it s a perfect combo. 
14082 So thrilled with this strap and the quality. Perfect for my Fujifilm instant camera! 
14083 It was easy to install take a little wild to reach me be it s work well 
14084 Optically, they re awesome. I can now bring nature and wildlife from afar to what seemingly appears to be within arms length. Great value and quality. 
14085 Perfect 
14086 Awesome and great price point! 
14087 Love this bag. It has been handy, and a great move up from my standard case. 
14088 The tripod is not stable. When I attached the selfie stick to the tripod, it tilted over and dropped. I would not recommend this product if you are looking for a tripod to hold the selfie stick for pictures and recording. 
14089 very good just wish it had an on when dark and off when light setting. the 4 or 8 hour option at dusk doesn t cover the entire night 
14090 Great batteries and charger!! fit perfect on my camera!! 
14091 Delivered on time. Good value 
14092 Nice quad-copter for the price. Software is easy to use. Resolution on the camera is pretty good. Easy to assemble the parts that are included. Very durable so far. I have even had it stuck in a tree one and retrieved it. It s fun to use! 
14093 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
14094 They work great 
14095 Besides the nostalgic look, this half case really improves the hand grip of the Df. It makes using longer zoom lenses and/or holding the Df for a prolong period of time much more comfortable. 
14096 Great! 
14097 Using it with a Sony action can, smooth rotation, good price, standard tripod mounts top & bottom 
14098 Well put together kits. Was given as a gift. She loves it 
14099 Great product, love it! 
14100 For the price you can do so much, yeah the screen and veiw finder is low res, but the image is not. 
14101 Worked for me. 
14102 I like the product. Its exactly what I´ve expected. And the personal letter sent by the manager of the company makes you feel really good and makes you feel you are buying a good and quality product. 
14103 Very clear picture 
14104 nice 
14105 great. 
14106 It took some trial and error, but it all works now as expected. 
14107 Quick Delivery and came as stated!! 
14108 Easy to setup, great audio, well worth its price, and extremely stable. I highly recommmend it!!! 
14109 I bought this devise to help me clean the inside of my sewing machine. It blows all the tiny threads and lint and is very helpful. The rubber feels strong when squeezed, so I feel confident that this product will last a long time. 
14110 Shipped promptly; was nicely packaged; fit the camera well. Seems to be high quality glass. 
14111 it is the fourth one I have purchased hoping it would work. its a hit and miss (with most MISS) also if I am lucky it records but can t play it on any of my computers 
14112 This camera worked great for two years. I used it in the Caribbean once and then the next day, the screen went black. It lasted almost exactly until the two year warranty wore off. :-( 
14113 Charged this battery upon arrival. Camera ran less than one minute and died. Not pleased at all. 
14114 ...Works perfectly. No complaints. 
14115 not part what I needed 
14116 Smaller then appears,good quality. 
14117 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
14118 Awesome! I had no problems installing it and it seems to hold a charge much longer than the old one. 
14119 Super easy to connect and works just like it s supposed to. Very fast delivery too! 
14120 Does what it says 
14121 This lens is absolutely wonderful. I thoroughly enjoy using it. 
14122 Looks very nice, Good Quality. 
14123 Purchased this months ago for spring break beach trip... used it through summer for pool adventures. Durable and great pics (lighting does matter) for the price of the camera. My boys take it away and I love watching the underwater videos that they come up with. 
14124 High quality images and video! I ll be making YouTube videos and such using it! Extremely easy to use with the phone app as well. I love taking it to the gym. 
14125 Works great 
14126 Keeps my GoPro visible and floating on top of the water! I love it! 
14127 Fantastic.. Easy to use. Well constructed. 
14128 I have not had a chance to use these yet, but I did test them out and they work fine. 
14129 Have bought Wasabi kits for several of my cameras. They all work flawlessly. 
14130 This is NOT a 500 watt light. It is 75 watts, equivalent to a 300 watt incandescent bulb. 
14131 The extension clasps are very hard to work especially if your hands are wet. 
14132 Just what I expected. Works well and both my kids and I can wear this snapped. It s a little bulky on the wrist strap but you definitely can t lose it. 
14133 Product arrived quickly and was as described. 
14134 Night time photographs do not show beyond 15 
14135 Pleased 
14136 A true five star product if it came with instructions. I would have gladly paid double the price for the inclusion of an instruction booklet with code examples and wiring charts. 
14137 Light weight tripod and it is still sturdy. Used in some windy conditions and had no trouble. 
14138 It does what it has to do. Ok. 
14139 These binoculars were too big for my use 
14140 Excellent tripod to get the job done 
14141 Scheduled for delivery on Sunday! Didn t think it would actually show up, but it sure did! Good quality, perfect for day trip, not meant to hold everything you own. I like the precut cutouts. 
14142 It is really expensive but I really loved how it worked with my polaroid 3500! 
14143 I love that I found this on here because no one sells this battery for my camera! It works great and i love the price I got everything for. 
14144 Very portable and easy to set up. We use it as a projector screen as well. 
14145 This camera far exceeded my expectations. The video is amazing and the photos my husband took of the moon were so clear I thought he had downloaded them off the internet to play a joke on me. The zoom was so amazing we could see the craters in the moon! 
14146 I absolutely love this camera. Takes amazing pictures and video underwater. I still use this camera to this day dont forsee getting a new one any time soon. 
14147 Works like a dream 
14148 They do the job well. Just watch out for the little slips on the ends, they tend to break off, if used a lot. 2 pairs of mine, have lost the ends so far, and they are non-usable after that. 
14149 Installed it and it worked, not sure what else I can ask for. 
14150 Focus range is so small that it s impossible to use even on a tripod. Seems to be clear enough that it might be a good lens but the focus is just too shallow. 
14151 Does what it s supposed to. A bit pricey to be made of paper. 
14152 Product works great. Price much lower than brand found in store. 
14153 I still haven t figured out how to set it up. No support. 
14154 The camera is fine but the on-board memory is pathetic, all but requiring the purchase of supplemental memory cards. Consider the memory card as a hidden cost when buying this camera. 
14155 Made my own Google Cardboard. These lenses did a great job and worked great. 
14156 My daughter is fascinated 
14157 Worked perfect with my Arlo security cameras. 
14158 Works well. It even comes with a car charger. Plus the two battery pack I bought with it means I won t be caught without battery power for my camera. 
14159 Hard cover to provide good protection. Ample space for essentials. 
14160 Great package deal! I love the camera 
14161 Amazing camera!!! 
14162 Basically an Eggtimer with cool graphics. No adjustable settings and the 1hr. limit and rotating speed made the timelapse seem rushed. the top also fell off. Not a great buy for $35 
14163 It was cracked. I took it into the water and it started to flood. Luckily I noticed it before it killed my go pro 
14164 first time for a digital camera. I have always had Canons. My lens from my Rebel 2000 also work on this one. Very happy easy to understand and download pictures onto computer. 
14165 Worked very well! 
14166 Arrived safely. Worked great for my trip to the zoo! 
14167 Bought this after a bit of a hunt through competing listings. This hit the sweet spot of wanting clear protective lenses with cap holders and not much more for my new Canon camera with an extra telephoto lens. Good price and very rapid delivery. Would use again. 
14168 Great color & pattern - interchangeable is the best! 
14169 It can only record for a maximum of 25 minutes. I bought it to record lectures but it s just sitting home now. The battery is not strong at all. 
14170 Recieved in timely manner. Very satisfied! Now able to enjoy watching my home movies! Thank you so much! 
14171 Love this - works well, even with Linux! 
14172 I love having these magic fiber towels on my office desk. I use it to clean my monitor, tablet screens, phone screens, and my keyboard which has a glossy finish. Highly Recommended! 
14173 Images have a strong magenta cast difficult to control even indoors. 
14174 does the job 
14175 Better than expected! 
14176 Smaller than I thought but well constructed and very useful for the photographer that needs an extra hand. It looks great on my Canon 40D. 
14177 Great product for a great price. Cant go wrong 
14178 Having fun with it! 
14179 Works perfect. Got it for my Grandmother. Super easy for all her kids and grand kids to send pictures. Easy to manage the account online from afar. 
14180 Excellent cameras. 
14181 works good when you aren t in the wind, already had one of my speed light stands break because of these but oh well that was my fault. 
14182 exactly as described. 
14183 Great quality glass on this pair of binoculars. 
14184 It s been good to transfer our slides to digital. Easy to use. 
14185 It s really awesome camcorder. 1080p is a steal for this price. I used it in Kauai for snorkeling and helicopter ride. It s priceless. I recommend this camera. 
14186 Offers great protection for my lens, easy to clean 
14187 Great wide angle lens that takes fabulous color! A must-have addition to your DSLR kit. 
14188 depth of field with small f-stops resolved! 
14189 Great price it does it s job. 
14190 Freezing to much on the app and i do have the faster business Internet at home. I restart the cameras 3 times already because it didn t work. 
14191 As advertised 
14192 Great product! 
14193 Does what it s supposed to do. Great cheap alternative from Amazon. 
14194 good 
14195 Works fine for the price. 
14196 so so~ 
14197 It s hard to beat Kodak s TMAX 100. 
14198 Never worked with iPhone. Now in junk drawer. 
14199 Ricardo John great service and great camera! awesome business 
14200 Did not really fit my Samsung NX mini which is the smallest nx camera samsung has for its mirrorless camera. The case did not leak at all. The case is meant for smaller point n shoot and not mirror less cameras which are slightly bigger. 
14201 Love it. 
14202 love the wide angle of the lens and image quality. I wished to purchase 14-24 mm based on reviews but happy with this lens now. 
14203 they work out and are very usefull 
14204 I can view the record directly from the APP, so good 
14205 I love it. it s a bit big but I am sure I will soon fill it with all kinds of gears. 
14206 Was not for your shoulder like it says and it is very short even for around your neck 
14207 Glad I chose this camera. One of the best ones out there for outside. 
14208 Poor quality even at this price. The float mount broke right away. The selfie stick is ok, but can be purchased alone and not in this kit. For use with my action cam in the water, I opted for the neomark wrist mount and was very pleased with it. 
14209 The camera was relatively easy to setup, and the picture quality is alright. The build in audio isn t the greatest, but it has ports to plug in your own speakers/ mic for the camera if you want better ones. I have not had any issues with the camera yet. 
14210 Good price. Ok batteries not as longest lasting as GoPro brand. At least you get two of them though and a nice dual charger. Nice to have backups. 
14211 Sucks. 
14212 Fast charging on the go. Nice for getting another flight in when you all you have is your car. No issues and I ve used it several times. 
14213 I just received the tripod and it is awesome! I love the bluetooth capabilities! 
14214 Great product 
14215 loose range quickly 
14216 I absolutely LOVE this!! Definitely gives me a more professional look!!! 
14217 very nice very nice to product especially to selfie loving people.it is an all in one and very handy to carry for holiday packers. can be recommendable. 
14218 Perfect fit for my larger tripod. 
14219 product as advertised, very good 
14220 It s made fairly well, but I expected a much higher level of quality if it was originally 79 dollars as stated. 
14221 Compact. Great quality. 
14222 gracias 
14223 Broke the first day..... 
14224 Works nicely! I also like that It comes with extra batteries, for use on vacation. 
14225 Batteries arrived in a timely manner and were just what I expected. 
14226 Great idea for taking better photos. Easy to use and adjustable so it fits my Samsung phone too. 
14227 Great shipping time, used this at church today to video the children s service with my daughter operating it with no problems! 
14228 Fits phantom 3 perfectly 
14229 great products. Thanks 
14230 Works great. On a full charge its only rated at about 8-10 minutes, but I have gotten 12 minutes out of a battery. 
14231 Didn t set it up wirelessly but so easy! 
14232 Love love love my Nikon camera. I have taken over 500 pics already and think I may have found may new calling. Very happy with this product. 
14233 Didn t like this. The case was too small for the GAlaxy2 camera and would sometimes turn the power on as you slid it into the case. May be ok for a smaller device. 
14234 Good for group shots you want to be in 
14235 This is awesome. If it came with a case or something I d give it 5 stars. 
14236 As described. Love the camera. Great pictures for an entry level photographer. Takes time to get used to the camera as a newbie and a lot of trial errors but I ll get used to it soon enough 
14237 This is a surprisingly good camera! Not quite five-star outstanding, but I am very, very happy with it. My family owns two now :- ) 
14238 Optic tubes were not aligned. Two discrete images with an angular separation both horizontally and vertically. This should have been discovered before shipping by simple inspection. Did not re-order. 
14239 Arrived PDQ and was as advertised, very happy with items so far. 
14240 Perfect for my eight year old, Instent gratification, we got through a pack of photos in an evening. Quality of the pictures is good. 
14241 All Great!!!! 
14242 This package includes far more than what you could find at other Big Box stores. It is a true bargain. 
14243 Crazy number of tiny parts to assemble and instructions were worthless. 
14244 I was extremely disappointed with this product. This product isn t durable enough for children. This was purchased for my son. He dropped it and it broke.... He was heart broken. It was money basically thrown in the garbage 
14245 Now I have a very disappointed child. 
14246 low quality photos 
14247 This works well and does everything I need. The camera setup was straight forward, configuring the firewall an DNS required more knowledge. 
14248 Worked fine 
14249 Good quality, delivery on time! 
14250 the film we got was outdated in 2008 pleas give me my money back 
14251 Yup. It s a photo album that holds 504 photos and yes, it s worth it. 
14252 Works great but very difficult to setup. Took two people 3 1/2 hrs. to finish setup, could not connect to my Apple MacBook Pro. 
14253 A must purchase battery and charger. 
14254 Works great and is a must have when using in the ocean so that you don t loose it. 4 stars because the price was a little high. You pay the extra money for the brand instead of for the material. I recommend buying from different distributor. 
14255 Total FAIL. Camera mount completely came apart and we lost our camera in the waves. Do NOT buy if you care about your camera 
14256 5 star 
14257 I love the texture, they are almost suede feeling. Those are the kind I love most because they remove debris and grease from my glasses and other lenses so much better, highly recommend! 
14258 Does the job. Does unravel itself but it still functions the same. 
14259 Good for just taking around what you need 
14260 Did the trick. Fixed tethering issues without adding power. 
14261 excellent product 
14262 With a newborn we wanted to capture the moments that were just to long to use the IPhone. This is easy to use and very compact. I really like how you do not need to remove the battery to charge it. Thanks 
14263 I really love my new camera! I wanted to get something that takes really nice pictures yet affordable so I was a little nervous on ordering this product since I have never had a Sony camera but I am absolutely happy with my purchase! It s takes great pictures! 
14264 Good product 
14265 Its perfect and very comfortable 
14266 -0 star junk THE END 
14267 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
14268 Just received this lens cover 2 of them and they fit perfect and fit good feel sturdy and not loose like my other ones. If I continue to loose them will def be ordering more :) 
14269 Can not adjust the sense with this bag. Pictures look a bit blury. not that happy, but it was cheap. 
14270 Just what I needed. Very good for laptop and glasses! 
14271 Excellent! Thank you!! 
14272 This is NOT plug/play. It is plug/install an executable from china/play. It requires flash which is on it s last leg as software. This does not work with Blue Iris software. You cannot play the video without installing their software. 
14273 No comments 
14274 Buy it or lose your gopro. 
14275 Price was right. Only used a few so far and they seem OK, but I m not yet sure. 
14276 Love it. 
14277 Solid tripod. With the right adapter it holds my iPhone 6 perfectly. 
14278 Camera great, servive fair but has gotten better 
14279 Ordered it and it came in a reasonable time. The strap is great and feels comfy on my neck. The look and feel of it is also amazing as well. I ll definitely be buying more straps from here in the future. Thanks again! 
14280 as expected...hated the short and non-microusb cable for charging 
14281 Bought as a gift for my Nephew. He liked it. 
14282 Ok for a gift! 
14283 Great price! Came fast ! 
14284 It seems to work as advertised 
14285 Excellent alternative to tracking down a factory battery for the early generation gopros. I have a Hero2 with a WiFi &#34;bacpack&#34; and the battery lasts just as long as my brand new hero4 black. 
14286 got here in nothing flat.. excellent!! 
14287 very good system 
14288 Thank you! 
14289 Inexpensive replacement battery, seems to work as good as the original. 
14290 Ended up keeping since the return shipping would make it a wash. NOTE: There are NOT 50 LEDs as claimed in the description- just one blinking red light. Meh 
14291 Fits everything you can use!!! 
14292 It s just personal preference...nothing really against the product. 
14293 Very satisfied with this purchase. The payment and shipping went very smoothly and quickly. 
14294 This bag is great for the Nikon D7100, my dad loved it for his birthday! It also came just in time for our Colorado trip 
14295 Great little cleaning kit, although the plastic bag it came in fell apart as I took it out of the box. 
14296 These are great IP cameras for around the house. They can FTP snap shots or video to any FTP server. 
14297 It s ok....the screw is crap it won t screw in anymore it s a good thing the go pro came with extras...if you want to use it for the outside of a car I recommend the actual gopro suction cup... 
14298 This is exactly the same as the original and charges the battery great! 
14299 Fit good on my nikon d7100, if not placed correctly it comes out in the picture, but then u rotated it an it was no longer in the way of the pictures 
14300 Love the metal mount on this product. Really dosen t add weight to the mask. 
14301 This product replacement! My security system battery died unexpectedly and this worked just as well. I expect it to last many years to come. 
14302 Works perfectly to connect my Olympus camera to my PC so that I can save photos to my computer. 
14303 Was for the Camera 
14304 Love the quality and look of the case! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is because although manufacturer claims it will fit a Canon Powershot SX60 camera, IT DOES NOT! If that is what you have, I would not recommend you ordering this product. 
14305 Bought this as a gift for my mother in law before she left for the family reunion. I figured it would be good for the group shots. I think she enjoyed it. 
14306 Amazing camera! And this bundle is quite the bargain. I should know. I shopped around for two months and this is by far the best deal. Shipped quickly and packaged very well. Highly recommend this product and this seller. 
14307 Price is right. Easy setup initially. Trouble getting sound from two separate computers. Tech help said it was computers fault. Both computers? Works fine on I phone. Now I can t even get a picture on those computers. Hate to invest hours in tech support. 
14308 Well worth the price! I like the removeable head. 
14309 Not very durable didn t work very long 
14310 Works well.Note it is the same adapter as the Kenko Teleplus 2X 7 element for Nikon AF, the 2 are the same inside, identical aside from brand name and minor cosmetic differences. Save a few $. 
14311 Very good protection that is sized for specific Sony lenses. This one is sized for the SELP1650 
14312 It does the job 
14313 I can t wait to use this thing on all my adventures. Came with charger, case, battery, and attachment for the case. 
14314 Very cheaply made, and cannot even figure out how to use it (no, it isn t simple at all -- actually has two pieces. Huh? Just another lesson in purchasing on the cheap. 
14315 The cameras work very well on the FPV plane and has a very clear picture, The seller was very prompt in getting the cameras out and to me 
14316 I did not receive the product shown in the pictures. Very dissatisfied right now 
14317 Great 
14318 Good quality. Good light. Very easy to assemble. I wish there was a simpler method to rotate the softbox from portrait to landscape. Overall, a great product at a great price. 
14319 Perfect! 
14320 Show a great pic..just had a line on one side, this was suppose to be a new item, but I think it was a use item, maybe or maybe not..but great pic on oneside. 
14321 Loved it 
14322 Worked like a charm! Thank you 
14323 Well built easy to open & close ,i play inside with my nikon 7100 with 18-200 no probleme very sturdy, next i try in the field,that would be the test,I have a larger & heavier $600.00 tripod this dolica would be easier to hike with. 
14324 DON T WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING THIS! NO INSTRUCTIONS AND ALL THE PARTS WEREN T INCLUDED. 
14325 The filter is quality made at a reasonable price. I use filters primarily to protect the expensive lenses that they are attached to from dust and debris. 
14326 Just not loud enough! 
14327 I am having such a great time using my new camera. Came with a dvd with tips on it for us amateurs to get a leg up. Awesome value 
14328 It would ve been 5 I ve stars if it wasn t 5 days late but it s a good product 
14329 Ok 
14330 I am happy with the product as well as shipment on time. 
14331 I use this product on my house because my neighbor is damaging my property and what better way to catch him with out having to go to extremes. I hope he keeps doing it. Great buy. .. 
14332 Fast shipping, great price! 
14333 broke after about 6 months. I used it about 3 times within those 6 months :( 
14334 Had to fuss with it for quite awile to get it paired with my SmartThings hub. No complaints once getting through the pairing process. 
14335 great 
14336 Pictures didn t turn out the way they were supposed to, and it only came with 8 pieces of film. Not worth almost $28 in my opinion. 
14337 I bought this to go with my Polaroid camera. But whats so cool is that it works with any cellphone or tablet. YOu can print memorable photos instantly. This is great especially for vacation which I will be going on next week. So excited. 
14338 cool. 
14339 Excellent seller recommend 100% 
14340 Fabulous. Works like a charm! 
14341 fit perfectly! 
14342 Easy to take a photo of me! 
14343 The quallity its very poor, i prefer at least 1080p of resolution. Another important thing is the angle camara, with gopro i had 170 degrees and with brinno only 14p0 
14344 love it 
14345 This provides serious protection for your camera. The fit is nice, and there are openings in strategic places for connections. The only downside is that manipulating the cover can be a bit tedious. The snaps work well, holding everything together, and yet are reasonably easy to open and close. 
14346 Really like the camera. The only problem is keeping my hand away from area when flash pops up. Easy to charge and take pics. 
14347 beats replacing a perfectly good camera 
14348 Ordered several. Wide angle lenses are great and worth the $7.95 each alone. However, the fish-eye lenses are blurry, not because of foreign matter or scratches (lenses are clear and smooth), but just the way they were made (they were all the same) 
14349 I live in a very hot area, the glue loosens from the back and the adapter (and the attached lenses/filters) falls off of the camera... what a waste of money, useless 
14350 AMAZING THIS TRIPOD IS VERY NICE, GOOD STILL, LIGHT WEIGHT NICE DESING IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SAMM TIPOD THIS IS THE BEST CHOISE 
14351 I ve been using this camera for years and it s still going strong. 
14352 Great camera - takes good pictures with enough pixels to get good quality. 
14353 nice kit at the right price 
14354 Great deal. good quality lens for our Canon DSLR and great items given with. 
14355 Works great. Fits my iPhone 6 perfectly. 
14356 Excellent dslr viewfinder. Comfortable on the eye, easily removable. The rail kit is also handy for adding other accessories or weight to your rig. 
14357 Already have some. These last longer than the battery that came with the camera, I get ~250 stills with these. I always carry a spare. The deal where you get two batteries plus a charger is a good one, already have that so I just got the battery this time. 
14358 perfect 
14359 Nice little dash cam. Works very well. 
14360 Daughter loved it ,great for party favors fast ship quality item 
14361 I read the reviews on this tripod and am happy to say it works great, easy to wrap around just about anything or stand on anything and with my Canon Rebel T31 it works great. 
14362 This attractive bag holds my Sony A7 w/ kit lens with room to spare. With the extender open, it will hold my Sony A7 with a Minolta MD 70-210 F4. Works great for carrying around a camera a single lens. Arrived in great condition and on time. 
14363 Great! 
14364 Works great. Can image for 4 min with my camera unguided. 
14365 Fit perfectly 
14366 Just the best seller! Cable was perfect as is this seller! 
14367 Daughter loves it. 
14368 Great little tripod for the price. However the first one I received was defective -- the camera wouldn t attach properly and it was missing a tightener screw. 
14369 pictures are so tiny you can t see it clearly,so I ll return it 
14370 THANKS I BROUGHT TO HAVE AN EXTRA ONE,AND IT WORKS JUST GINE,AND COST WAS GREAT 
14371 Great buy. Worth the investment. Extras are awesome!!!! 
14372 Just as described 
14373 Expect two different packages one with just the pipes and the second with the base plates. 
14374 After moderate use, the belt attachment is tearing from the case. Otherwise, it s a very good case. 
14375 I really loved these lights. Had two of them. Eventually the battery cells wore down and the light only lasts a few minutes at most. 
14376 Battery did not hold a charge, was unchargable so I returned it for a refund 
14377 excellent 
14378 Pretty sure I could come up with a smarter design. It s so oddly designed. I ll be losing the brass fittings sooner or later guaranteed. 
14379 Love the camera. The speaker and mic don t work as well as I d like, but i can overlook that. The subscription price seems a little high. 
14380 good camera 
14381 I love this little case I got for my camera. Debating on purchasing one for my daughter. Nice material and print is just gorgeous. 
14382 Great pack! Now just the camera cost $499, the Wasabi Batteries cost $23.99 and Lexar 32GB card is $24.99. 
14383 good quality 
14384 So far-all is well. Takes me awhile to figure out all the buttons, seems to be perfect. Took it kayaking with me and didn t have to worry about getting it wet... 
14385 Awesome value for money, it breathed new life into our Canon SL1 (which has a rather pathetic battery)... all the extra add-ons were a nice touch and, but really you are getting two good batteries and a backup charger. 
14386 Fantastic camera package for the price. All items listed were in box. Brand new unused. No issues. All parts fitted perfectly. Camera is amazing. Shipping was amazing. Definitely great service. Thank you Celltime ! 
14387 After one month of use it restart with no obvious reason at random time 
14388 Super Clear! 
14389 only one battery of the 2 worked for me 
14390 It is a big disappointment,it worked just during installation with good audio and Vedic but late the audio turned to one way traffic. The outdoor will hear you but you can t hear from indoor. It is a wast of money.Video picture is great and clear.This product needs improvements. 
14391 Takes good photos and has everything a casual camera user like me would need. The menu navigation is awkward and slow and I ve had difficulty getting it synced up over WiFi to my phones and desktop. 
14392 Great camera! Easy to use. Fast efficient shipping. No complaints! 
14393 Super easy to use. It feels sturdy even when it is fully extended and it holds my Samsung Note 2!! I took it with me on an out of state trip and it fit nicely in my carry on. Great price too. 
14394 Greate lense 
14395 Use this all the time. Great range and better than the standard remote that came with my camera. Be sure to keep extra batteries because it is easy to leave it on and the batteries not work. For $30 you will not find a better accessory for your camera!! 
14396 So happy, they work great and give me a long life for my camera. 
14397 The charger didn t work. Plus it didn t come with a lens. 
14398 Wasabi batteries never let me down. Good quality at a reasonable price. They are my &#34;go to&#34; batteries 
14399 Provably the best that I have used and properly priced too. 
14400 I have never been disappointed by Tiffen quality. Would and have recommend Tiffen filters... 
14401 Nice case. Neatly stores all of the GoPro accessories in a padded area with snug compartments for each accessory which prevents them from just rolling around in the case. Nice upper storage area on top of the case inside as well for additional items. 
14402 Love it 
14403 Henry did a great job with helping me solve my issue with camera , and got me up and running 
14404 Great camera, no complaints other then there being no memory card included. 
14405 I liked this bag so well, I bought one for my best friend. Well-designed and tough. 
14406 Performs as advertised. 
14407 Everything was great, timely delivery. 
14408 Husband absolutely loves this camera! 
14409 Cheap. 
14410 Works perfectly for my Canon Rebel T5i 
14411 is ok but not really impressing that much. i was hoping for more changes in the picture..... 
14412 too much flexible, dificult to remove the bubbles 
14413 Great quality and much more cost effecitve solution than the OEM. 
14414 works with my Nikon D200. 
14415 Works great. I can finally use my Polaroid camera again 
14416 Fantastic filter. High transmission. No decker able color cast. Very thin. Does not bind on lens. I d love to replace all my filters with these. 
14417 Excellent! 
14418 Great 
14419 Very good kit. 
14420 nice 
14421 Much better options available. Not very solid 
14422 Cute little photo album. It s not the best quality, but I bought it for my 9 year old and she doesn t notice things like that. If she wanted another one I would buy it again for her. 
14423 it is really fun and easy to control however the battery life is bad it well give you 2 to 5 min max and it take about 2 hours to charge 
14424 My old cable and power supply was giving me trouble so when got this seems to be working as stated in the ad with no trouble so far 
14425 Item is made out of plastic, it arrived broken. Should be made of something sturdier or shipped better. Nice idea though. 
14426 Amazing 
14427 This item was fantastic, fit perfectly, and just as described. The seller was great. Absolutely no complaints! 
14428 I could not use it with my camera, but the product was as advertised. Returned with no problem. 
14429 Nice sharp lens to compliment my D5200. Pictures look sharper than my older 18-105. Love the size because with the D5200 it makes for a very compact grab and go camera. 
14430 Camera did not wow me built quality ok video quality not great very user friendly one of the easiest I have set up over all good for basic around the house surveillance not great on detail pixels 
14431 Too small and rip apart too easily 
14432 Work fine Gets the job done 
14433 love my strap! tho the thread came out a little, I just cut it off a bit. 
14434 i continue to buy more. these work great. 
14435 This is a good, durable case for the RX cameras. It also has an extra pocket for a memory card. I have an RX-100ii camera which is an excellent little camera to bring on a vacation. 
14436 Great camera quality and value! I opened it up and played with it for a while to try out all of the different settings. It is easy to use and takes great pictures! I would definitely recommend this camera! 
14437 I use this on a Fujifilm X-E2 for the large handful of vintage M42 lenses that I own. It has a substantial feel to it and it just works as advertised. 
14438 Great product. 
14439 A+ 
14440 DSTE is the best non OEM grip out there period! I ve tried 3 others and this grip is by far better. The build is spot on with the OEM and all buttons/knobs work just like the OEM. The seller shipped fast from China and it arrived 8 days early. 
14441 Impossible to set up. Do not waste your time. 
14442 Works great just the right fit! 
14443 Very useful. 
14444 Had to return it the first time because the battery was not charging (after waiting more than a month for the camera to be delivered). The second camera I received is ok, but my phone takes better pictures. 
14445 Great lens! 
14446 Ok 
14447 good to have! 
14448 perfect to keep an eye on my bbq pit tempature guage from inside the house. 
14449 I purchased this for my son s rehearsal dinner. I tested and it took great pics. I liked it so much I purchased twice as much film as needed. I also purchased the little lens for selfies/close-ups. I may buy another camera! 
14450 Great 
14451 Excelent , 
14452 Works excellent for the money. Great starter copter 
14453 Good action cam. But no sound on videos unless you play it back on a VLC player. They should really update the codec for this device. Very annoying to have to find all sorts of work around (ie downloading codec etc) do deal with the no sound issue. 
14454 The lens hood interferes with the camera lens by obtrusively vignetting the view and thus the photos. I can t think of any situation in which I would find this product of any value. 
14455 FotoTech is great! Great products and service. 
14456 Arrived quickly, all the parts advertised were there and I got what I asked for. What more could I want? 
14457 Works great, covers all the entry points that I needed 
14458 Works perfectly 
14459 incredible bag! I can fit 4 film cameras in here, one tlr, one 6x4.5 medium format, one 35mm rangefinder and my 35mm slr! 
14460 Wow, this is a fantastic value. Works like it should at 1/5 the price. So far I m very impressed. 
14461 I do not recommend this brand. I bought it because they used it at work and while the quality looks okay it goes on and off all the time 
14462 Ok 
14463 nice --dated now of course but a very nice camera, 
14464 Photos are not clear otherwise it is fun 
14465 This product is awesome. It works perfectly fine. And the design gives it a better look than the regular slick one. Definitely recommend!!! 
14466 Soft at f3.5, more sharp around f8. Still the best APSC fish eye out there. 
14467 Works good 
14468 on time...worked 
14469 Love the way the legs expand and clamp into place. Clamps on the legs work much better than the ones you twist. My old one with the twist mechanism on the legs was forever slipping back down. 
14470 I have had limited use so far but I really like it. It holds my d750 very well. For the price you can t beat it. 
14471 Mine didn t work. I feel like these were overstocks with batteries long dead. No amount of charging time made any difference. On the plus side, Amazon refunded my money promptly 
14472 Takes good pictures, makes a good second camera 
14473 I got the first version.. Great but magnets fall out and it s annoying.. Can t seem to find a way to fix it 
14474 Very small and it broke within weeks. 
14475 works great 
14476 Great heavy duty mount 
14477 Great! 
14478 Seems too small. 
14479 Very good. 
14480 I don t understand Japanese/ no english directions to be read, nor pictorial instructions. I have returned the camera to Essex for credit card credit. 
14481 Met every expectation... Couldn t be happier with results 
14482 Fits, as one would expect 
14483 Wonderful! Charged quickly and last longer than the batteries that came with the camera, well done! 
14484 This cam works pretty well. The video quality is average but the price is right for a decent outdoor cam. Unfortunately I had 2 of these fail. They just stopped working completely. Pyle customer service was great and got me a new camera within a week. 
14485 I congratulate them for their excellent speed 
14486 I like it. 
14487 Costs more but is the perfect fit for your 50mm f1.8 STM -- and it reverses perfectly to fit into the camera bag -- cheap ones don t do that reliably. It also protects the lens front element with no optical impact. 
14488 Fast delivery. Batteries work as advertised 
14489 I purchased this video camera as a gift for my daughter. She loved it. 
14490 Amazing camera (love it!!), fast delivery and great customer service! 
14491 Battery is exact replacement needed, Excellent price and service. Recommend it for anyone who needs a batter for the SONY. 
14492 it did not look like what picture shows , in the picture it has the thing for attach to tripot but one I received dose not has one 
14493 you need to change the picture or send same thing as picture shows 
14494 No surprises. Everything as expected. 
14495 No problems. Works as expected. 
14496 It didn t fit my Samsung NX2000 like it said it should it was way too small. Also They didn t refund my whole amount of money they just refunded me $6 out of the $17 I paid. The case was very nice just wish it fit my camera. Bummed!!! 
14497 Came just as it looks. Vert sturdy. Love it! 
14498 Most completely satisfied including the price. Just right in every respect! 
14499 Nice colors -- thick substantial float 
14500 Great gimbal head for the price ! 
14501 Works well. I like the build quality. Easily screws onto my lens without binding. 
14502 I gave up as it was too hard to hook up with comcast 
14503 battery contacts are intermittent -- I think I can fix it, but at first I thought it was DOA 
14504 Works as expected. 
14505 Much nicer than the G1W. Setup is easy and does its job well. 
14506 Perfect for what I NEEDED it for. I absolutely love it. Works great.....Fast Shipping. 
14507 Good buy！Arrived on time. Works with no issues. Set up pretty quickly and haven t had any problems so far. Excellent baby monitor！ 
14508 Expensive but decent lens. Good for beginner. 
14509 The Camera works fine. However, Fuji download software is out of date and I cannot download pictures to my windows 10 software on my computer. I have contacted Fuji about this matter 
14510 I got these on Prime Day at a great price. I ve used them a few times and they work great! I ve taken some awesome photos with them. They fit perfectly in my amateur home studio. 
14511 Bought these for backup for my wife s Canon camera. They worked great. Held charge as long as the original. 
14512 This so small ... yet so cute!!! Works great!!! 
14513 great 
14514 Flies well, but so light that wind will take it as it goes above the trees. Easy to control unless windy 
14515 Good stuff 
14516 The octopus stand broke upon unpacking. I recommend sanding down the parts so they have better grip/friction. 
14517 Excellent product. Arrived quickly through Prime program. Well packaged. Worth the extra price over the generics, which I have tried & found to be worth what I paid for them, i.e. not much. 
14518 Batteries have lasted in this unit over a moth now in pouring rain for a month here in FL as still going good. Would recommend 
14519 It s not bad for the price, however, this was purchased before I fully conceded to the fact that in order to get a good solid tripod you ve got to spend some money. 
14520 cvi quality is awesome can zoom in with the right cameras. 
14521 awesome grip! 
14522 Was great..... And then it fell apart. I could tell it wasn t that sturdy and I m a little frustrated that it didn t last more than three gigs. 
14523 Lens cover gets scratched very easily. Great price though. 
14524 Works great! No issues communicating with my D600. 
14525 The kit itself is amazing comes with everything an amateur GoPro photographer would want. Anyway, very satisfied with this kit!For me 5 stars definitely. 
14526 Work good, easy to set up. The quality of the video could be better and the user interface isn t the easiest to use but all in all it s ok. 
14527 Purchased for a trip we took to St.Croix. It was perfect for the flight and sightseeing around the island. Loved it! 
14528 The s mirrors are useless. They constantly move even though I strapped them very tight to the handlebar and also tightened the small bolt that holds the unit together. 
14529 perfect fit, had it on for awhile and i forget it is even on there. 
14530 Well built cameras work well 
14531 I received the new item pretty quickly and in fine working order. 
14532 Great product. Only con I have with this is the tightening of the ball joint can be tight as it will go and still move in some positions. (Depends on how steep an angle you are at). Otherwise, great for smaller cameras 
14533 ie: Mobius cam. 
14534 Love this filter and it has helped a lot with my travel photography. Fits perfectly. You do have to be careful because it can get stuck, but you just have to make sure you are twisting the filter and not the lens. Highly recommend. 
14535 works great 
14536 I have not taken any serious photos with this lense yet. It seems to be very good at the very least. I did my research on this and this lens is recommended over the 10-24 Nikon lense. http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/10-24mm.htm 
14537 Great 
14538 Super cute and pretty easy to use! 
14539 Came on time and we used it for an important magazine shoot, awesome 
14540 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
14541 Cheap and weird. Holds to the camera and lens well enough, but latch is sloppy. One screw interferes with the lens and had to be removed, and another screw broke off completely. Good machining quality and price, but be prepared to rework it a little to fit your lens. 
14542 Item as described, fits on the new speedlite I just purchased. 
14543 They work and are a big upgrade from the previous extension tubes that I had which did not allow for auto focus to work. 
14544 It works. I have bene using it for about a week now. The color makes it easier to find if you lose it in the water. 
14545 does what it does, cheap plastic but it s cheap cost too, works well. 
14546 Everything works perfectly love this product! 
14547 Love these cloths. I use them for my reader glasses, PC screen, and expensive camera lenses. They do a great job! 
14548 Kind of cheaply built but will do the trick and priced right 
14549 I love these flashes!! 
14550 Great! Very pleased! 
14551 Great sturdy bag, 
14552 Looks great and is very well made 
14553 Works as advertised and the compact tripod is a travel favorite for me. 
14554 Perfect!!! 
14555 i was really excited to use this, but it came broken. I changed the batteries three times and nothing. 
14556 This had all the items i need. I love to take pictures, and selfies with fam are difficult. NOT ANYMORE 
14557 Works great 
14558 Great accessory 
14559 Just opened my package, and am very satisfied with my new camera bag! Fits the camera perfectly, along with plenty of room for my charger, SD cards, and my new USB cable. Very pleased with this purchase! 
14560 Fast shipping and quality product. 
14561 Excellent!!! 
14562 Fantastic product. Brilliant lens. Very pleased with the results. 
14563 Very good for the price 
14564 Fast delivery. Product is as described. 
14565 No quite as easy to set up as &#34;plug and play&#34; depending on your modem, but once it is set up, this is a good product. The picture quality isn t bad, and the night views are pretty good. Easily accessed through the Foscam App on my smart phone. 
14566 It does work. It does not make your lens a macro lens but allows it to focus at a closer distance. 
14567 Great security system with a many features and backed by outstanding technical support. 
14568 Love this camera! I m able to check on my little one anytime. There is a bit of a delay but not terrible. 
14569 My first flash kit for my first DSLR camera. Easy to operate and produces excellent flash photos. 
14570 Worth the price 
14571 Case is nice and helps protect my daughters camera. 
14572 Stronger and bigger than other ones that I ve bought. Hopefully, this one will not crack soon. 
14573 Great quality better then I expected and very functional while still protecting my camera. 
14574 I bought these for my husbands birthday and he is a bit concerned that they will not be good for long range viewing.....anyone have input on this please? 
14575 Just as described--and just what I needed--with perfect shipping! Thanks so much! 
14576 Excelent product 
14577 It does exactly what it says it will, it fits the vast majority of filter sizes, and it s not irritatingly bulky. Arrived promptly, and seems quite study, especially considering the price point. So far, so good. 
14578 It does the job. It s lightweight and feels flimsy, and doesn t have the best tactile feedback for the button... but for the price, what do you expect? Works fine with my Pentax K-50. 
14579 Necessary if using GoPro in water! 
14580 Very happy with this camera and all of the extras that came with it. Great value for the price. 
14581 Not the greatest 
14582 It works for what I needed. Fits in the bag I bought. 
14583 Great camera! Got this for a trip to Key Largo. Beautiful video. We dove to about 40 feet with no issues. Pictures are &#34;okay&#34; under water, but video is great. Wish it was a 2 inch screen, but the 1.5 inch does the job. Easy to use and operate. 
14584 The release lever has troubles and the aperture ring isn t so smooth, but it s workable. 
14585 Precisely what I wanted. 
14586 1. Super simple to set up 2. Love the wide angle lens, captures my entire apt 3. Very small, can fit anywhere 
14587 Exactly as advertised. It works fine. Received it sooner than expected. No concerns. 
14588 Item is as good as offered ... Thanks 
14589 I love this camera! Love the wifi feature! Very handy when wanting to instantly post your excelllent photos! Arrive in great time! 
14590 Works exactly as described,very easy to setup.i will buy it again. 
14591 Perfect, even sturdier than the original! 
14592 Everything you could want, plus more. Very happy with purchase! 
14593 Cord is too short... 
14594 Beautifully crafted accessory that greatly enhances the hold-ability of the camera. Makes one handed shooting so easy! Cannot imagine the camera without it. 
14595 Everything I could need for my new camera. 
14596 Works perfectly for my needs. If you have a professional camera that weighs a few pounds I would recommend you brace this stand a little. 
14597 Good camera. Lots of features. A little flimsy. 
14598 WORKS GREAT!! 
14599 Got this to use my Nikon mount Lensbaby on my Fujifilm X-T1. I was honestly surprised at how well made it is. For the price, I was expecting something that felt pretty cheap, but this is a solid piece of gear. Love it. 
14600 GoPro better watch out! I have used both now and this $50 Geekpro is more user friendly and with the screen, who needs WiFi. I have shown this to others and all will buy Geekpro from here on. 
14601 Very cool 
14602 Their firmware updating and process is crap. Software outdated. 
14603 Great piece for camera, thank you 
14604 I have a Nikon 5300 and this doesn t come close to fitting. Pretty disappointing. 
14605 Easy for my children to use while snorkeling and pictures came out very nice. 
14606 This fits great and saved me lots of money. Since I ll probably lose it again, I m glad I know where to find a sturdy replacement! 
14607 Great product, great price, fast shipper. 
14608 A must have 
14609 This is a great slide and negative scanner. I needed to scan 240 negatives that I wanted to digitize and put on a CD. This unit was easy to use and I was able to complete the job in about an hour. 
14610 It works like it is suppose to... Great! 
14611 Good stuff fast shipping 
14612 ok 
14613 One attachment worked. Nine wouldn t attach to the GoPro because the slots didn t line up. I must have gotten a bad batch. 
14614 got this for my 3 year old great nephew and he is in love with it, now he doesn t need to use my camera, he really enjoys taking pictures, made a perfect birthday present 
14615 My concern was the battery and after 2 months, it s still almost full even with the sensor on outside the gate. Setup was easy and fast. Connections are good. 
14616 Working great 
14617 Not bad! 
14618 As Advertised. 
14619 love it , awesome 
14620 for my cropped body camera 35mm lens acts as 50mm lens .I am using on D5300. i needed 50mm so purchased 35mm. 
14621 got this on prime day for my dad. takes great pictures in all level of light. very easy to use. for about same price as a point and shoot camera, this one tops with more features and controls 
14622 Works great. I wish it would lock out of the way better (when not using the filter), but otherwise works just as expected. 
14623 I do like the size of this camera very much but it just doesn t perform nearly as well as my other Nikon but then my other Nikon is in a whole another category price wise. Over all it s an okay camera. 
14624 It s my first camera and it is so cool. 
14625 I received the camera and didn t open right away cause it was a gift. When it was opened it didn t work. Still haven t heard back from them. 
14626 This is the best strap I have owned. It is secure, and very fast/easy to use. Keeps the camera handy and mounts to the proper mounting lug on the camera. 
14627 DO NOT BUY THIS GARBAGE. 
14628 Fast shipping, great product! 
14629 there is nothing else like it, perfect 
14630 as described 
14631 Too awesome. Must HAVE! !! 
14632 Takes good pictures. Perfect for trips where one does not want to take a full size camera. Ideal for vacations and complimentary to photos taken on smart phones 
14633 don t really stay on the visor, depends how thick your visor is... not working on mine. 
14634 Makes macro shots with these cameras even better 
14635 Good ribbon cable! 
14636 Very nice. 
14637 This case worked perfect for my GoPro 3+ 
14638 The products that I did receive work great, but the body mount and extension pole were not included. 
14639 Awesome little camera. I like the features and definitely the price. Need to practice a little with the app and order back up batteries for my longer motorcycle rides. 
14640 Thanks! 
14641 Great lens in great shape 
14642 This is a great camera. The product arrived quickly and in perfect condition. Unfortunately it broke after the first set of film. Trying to figure out how to fix it or if I should just buy another one. 
14643 Work Great Hold better than original cannon lens cover 
14644 This was a fantastic deal for an exceptional camera. I m absolutely thrilled to have this. I highly recommend taking advantage of this deal before they run out!!!! 
14645 Didn t get a chance to use it but after all the alarms I checked, this is the only one that resets itself and it gets tripped off. A plus for people who go on vacation. 
14646 Great, provides protecting for a camera, the only down side is it can t hold extra lens, which is more my fault for not reading the description. I ended up give it to my father, who works outdoors a lot, and he absolutely loves it. 
14647 Just what I needed 
14648 This camera works really good in the dark. It has amazingly good night vision. I like the size of it and I like how easy it operates. I received this item for a honest review. 
14649 Its a nice case but is too small for the Sony RX100M4 even though it is advertised as being for that camera. The camera does not slip easily into the case. Two stars because of the poor fit. 
14650 Works great for the camera without battery grip holder and bigger lens but would not buy it if you like to leave those on your camera. 
14651 The screws on the light stands broke after the first use and the light bulbs were not as bright as I expected them to be. You get what you pay for I guess. I would ve returned it, but one of them fell over and the light bulb broke. 
14652 Good camera system. Simple to install 
14653 Item was as described and received quickly 
14654 The order arrived in good time. Very pleased. 
14655 This is a great product. I felt so safe with it on the camera I even let the young kids use it while we were on the boat! 
14656 Perfect size, but a little bulky. Small enough, but big enough to fit batteries, charger and a slot for one SD chip. Wish it had smaller handle option and can remove larger strap option. 
14657 work great. good to have. 
14658 1 year later and these cameras have become part of our everyday life, being able to see what is going on outside is really nice especially when getting packages delivered! 
14659 You gotta be kidding me! This lens is EXCELLENT. Could not be happier. 
14660 It s nice and long. The only thing is there is a separate button that you hold to take a photo. I wish it was on the stick itself. Love the extra holder for go pro and other cameras 
14661 Package was received opened and reclosed and without the product. 
14662 When I finally received the whole kit, it was Great!!! 
14663 Exactly as described. Good deal! Works great. Thanks 
14664 they seem to hold better than the original battries 
14665 Thinking about returning. Don`t like the way it looks when you look into them. 
14666 I bought 2 of this. This is perfect for my video projects. I used to carry around with me a heavy one attached to another heavy battery pack. Not anymore! 
14667 Very happy with this case. I strapped it to my backpack pads on a week long trip and it protected my new camera and made it accessible for quick shors. Didn t really get on my way, either. Good product. 
14668 The umbrella has a very weak metal. it only lasted a few sessions. Somehow the metal twisted in a way I could never untwist again. Broken now. 
14669 for budget consumers, this tripod from Ravelli will be the best choice because of its durability and reliability while on the job 
14670 very good 
14671 Took it on our vacation and lasted as long as the original Canon battery that came with the camera. Good product. 
14672 Perfect condition works great. Not exactly like pictured. Newer model 
14673 I had to return it 2x for the same problem over the span of 3 days, unreliable. 
14674 poor quality it SUCKS!!! 
14675 Good as expected 
14676 Went right together with no cutting. 2 thumbs up 
14677 Product isn t the best quality but it works. 
14678 Es muy buen producto 
14679 Lovable to use either at home or in a car! Simple but very sufficient to charge. I like cloth, too! 
14680 perfect fit 
14681 works well 
14682 Quite obsolete now, better get a GoPro 
14683 As Expected 
14684 Fits LCD screen perfectly as described 
14685 My Grandchildren our having a great time flying the drone. 
14686 mine will not charge any of my 3 batteries. they fit fine in the charging port but they will not charge and no light comes on. what do i do. 
14687 Absolutely love this lens!! The photos I have taken came out fantastic! Have a taken quite a few pictures of grandchildren and I must say, this lens makes me look like I really know what I m doing! 
14688 seems fine 
14689 It s been a great camera. Very easy to use. We really like the zoom. 
14690 Very easy to set up and start using right away. Great features and a real value for the price. 
14691 Excellent! 
14692 Fantastic binocs. Light weight. Easy to use. Focuses up close and far away. Love it! 
14693 Arrived on time also came with two minor cracks, based on the reviews i was worried of quality... But shows perfectly 
14694 Perfectly functional cleaning cloths, though they seem to be of different types of cloth... 
14695 Great item to control tripod lights.. 
14696 I was using the macro ring flash, the macro lens and my canon camera for my profesional dentistry practice. Works great, fine quality pictures. Very usefull in my dental office. 
14697 I don t think they last that long. 
14698 Just one word...Excellent!!! 
14699 This tripod is awesome and we have used it on all kinds of terrain from rocks to dirt to inclines and it stays straight and level. Easy to adjust for filming at weird angles. Feels really strong. Heavy to carry. 
14700 Iove, love, love it, it is difficult taking photos of glass or shiney pewter. This camera makes it a breeze...replaced my Canon Sureshot! 
14701 Deserving of 5 stars 
14702 item arrived quickly and product quality exceeded my expectations 
14703 It works quite well. I am having an issue getting securely attached to my tripod so it doesn t move on the tripod head. 
14704 not as good as I expect. 
14705 Works great for my Sony RX100 III camera. Comfortable and easy to use. 
14706 finally a replacement charger that has the same features as my last!!! and that too it actually charges faster than my original i think! 
14707 All the stuff you need but the man f doesn t provide ... great package at a low price! 
14708 what an excellent tripod!!!! 
14709 This was a great product for the money and being similar to a go pro but for a fraction of the price. Highly recommend this for starters! 
14710 adequate 
14711 This power battery grip works great with my Nikon D5500, no problems at all, I can high recommend this grip if you looking for one. 
14712 Does not load photos 
14713 Satisfied 
14714 This was just okay for a quick fix. But I think I should have bought something different. 
14715 the best!! 
14716 Works as advertised. Great product and haven t had any issues. 
14717 Work well and are a good value 
14718 This works great for my small digital camera. I ve been able to take my camera with me on outings such as the Dirty Dash and haven t had to worry about damaging the camera. 
14719 Too much for something that is an adventure to install ! If you simply MUST have this brand screen protector, then buy TWO. One for the first failure and the second for, hopefully, the successful install ! 
14720 Easy to install and nicely built 
14721 defective out of the box. the part that attaches to the camera was not assembled properly and didn t align on the camera. had to return so don t know if anything else about it 
14722 flimsy design. 
14723 I was able to get the moisture spots off the sensor, but the dust and lint was a problem. I used the product as directed, but still saw dust on the sensor even after repeating the cleaning several times. 
14724 OMG this is loud! I have it wired into a SmartThings outlet. I made the mistake of testing it inside, and my son was so angry he threw his fork at me. And it seems well built as well - I think it will stand up to the elements. 
14725 My second Canon Powershot. Love this camera, so easy to run and all the accessories make it great. Good for novice for experienced photographers. 
14726 Batteries don t last. 2 years later, they won t hold their charge at all. SONY batteries purchased before that have continued to hold 100%. 
14727 Absolutely adore my camera! 
14728 Works great for my d3200 
14729 We have used this gopro more than I ever thought we would, we take it everywhere and the pictures are always awesome. I had never used one and I m not tech savvy at all and I had little issue figuring it out, it s worth the money!!!! 
14730 The battery does just what is designed for and has performed as expected. 
14731 Sorry to say mine didn t work properly. Only one side work. And there is a loud popping static sound on the other side. Maybe somebody else will have better luck but mine was a malfunction I guess. 
14732 Works great, but I could have just bought the 10X as this is the only one I ve ever used 
14733 Simply indispensable. No more lost or dropped caps 
14734 Excelent product 
14735 Awesome kit. I ve used everything already - even taken the chest & head mounts jet skiing/ wakeboarding :) Definitely suggest purchasing. 
14736 Extends and collapses much easier than the internally wired version. 
14737 I love the strap, but it was shipped with an off brand attachment, not the Black Rapid FastenR-3 
14738 Love these!! Very hard to set up, called tech support and they did it all for me. Was &#34;online &#34; in about an hour. Great buy. 
14739 👌🏽 
14740 Great Price 
14741 This is a nice lens pouch. For those people griping that the pouch did not fit their lens, try measuring your lens and pick the size that fits it. 
14742 Amazing product !!! 
14743 Great lens, great service. 
14744 Good deal. 
14745 Excellent!!!! 
14746 Exactly as advertised!!! Quick shipment+++ 
14747 Awesome 
14748 I use my case for the GoPro 3.0 (in waterproof case) and four batteries and I couldn t be happier. This case is small but holds and protects the essentials. There is room for random small items in the lid pocket too. 
14749 Very handy and stylish cold shoe adapter! Use this to mount my Sennheiser MKE600 mic to Zacuto Half Cage. Works flawlessly and once the plastic ratcheting knob replaced by metal knob seems to be the same build quality as Zacuto! 
14750 Nice products. 
14751 I m very disappointed with the GoPro4 Back. I purchased it and after 1 week, It started freezing and now I cannot use anymore!!! I lost information of my last two adventure running!!!! I really hate it!!!! It freezes every I press the Buttons Mode and Shuttle!!! 
14752 Great lens! 
14753 I use my camera every day for work and I ve tried a few different brands. None last as long as the original Canon battery, but these come closest. 
14754 I have found that when taking pictures with it, it works best on 1 to 2 subjects and only close up. So if that is what you need it for then I would suggest it. It is tricky when you have glasses. It leaves the circle light on them. 
14755 ok 
14756 Quick link to Vera3. Works well. Highly recommend this. 
14757 Using the filter now & it is exactly what I needed. They included a lens cloth & lovely note from the one who runs of the company. I like Tiffen products & will continue to buy them. 
14758 the camera is awesome, the jawbone im having trouble with. 
14759 Great price 
14760 Great kit for starters or intermediates. Great kit for the price. 
14761 Great deal. Very pleased with my purchase. 
14762 Very happy with the unit....excellent quality, fits all my needs and the price is right! 
14763 Great price and quality 
14764 Worked out very well for our purposes! 
14765 I use these diffusers on my yongnuo 568 flashes and they fit perfectly. I use them outdoors to diffuse the hard flash when I cannot bounce it. Great price as well. 
14766 It s great! It has absolutely met our needs of being a small tripod for flexible mounting. 
14767 Love this case. Customize the fit with the cubed foam and dividers. 
14768 Very good 
14769 Well worth the money. 
14770 Fantastic price! Love the customizable inside (with velcro partitions). It held a lot more than I expected. 
14771 it broke after I used it two times ): 
14772 I really need one of these, but I am not smart enough for this particular one. It is not simply plug and play, so to speak. I was in above my head. So, unfortunately, I had to return it. Best of luck to you if you decide to try it. 
14773 Bought this kit for my brother so that he would have an extra battery. He was very excited about the mini tripod and ability to charge the battery in his truck. This kit is a Super value and quality product. 
14774 The threads were too long for my application (Garmin Virb mounts). Also, the diameter of the threaded portion is too large for Garmin Virb mounts. 
14775 It worked and easy to replace the original. 
14776 The white trash and ghetto thugs living around me think they are real and that s good enough for me. Combine these with Mr Beams motion sensor lights and you ll be making those unsightly neighbors very uncomfortable and compliant in no time 
14777 Fine 
14778 It s cute and it helps with taking selifes on the fujififilm instax mini. the color also maches my camera. 
14779 The battery fit great! I m very happy with my purchase! And it hardly took any time to get here, great shipping! Thank you 
14780 I love this carrying case and I can put all my stuffs here in one 
14781 We were very happy with everything, especially the price. Delivery was as promised. Very pleased, would buy again. 
14782 Worked great for my canon 6D 
14783 I could not connect to the camera. LAN cable to the camera and the PoE power supply then to the router. The light on camera came on but kept getting Log In Failure using the supplied Configure Setup software. Returned the camera. 
14784 Camera sucks but flies great. No ability to attach different camera. 
14785 very good piece of little majic in Photo & VideoTechnology 
14786 Just ok ,four star 
14787 All was good - on time and batteries as expected. Price was good - Always need spare batteries when you travel. 
14788 Excellent product, very comfortable and very reliable seller 
14789 Return it 
14790 great 
14791 Really sturdy and good for basic camera beeds 
14792 It uses your phone s hotspot, and big pictures take a long time. Couldn t keep the connection long enough for it to work. 
14793 The batteries lasted a longer time than the ones that came with the camera. They came with a great travel charger. An incredible value for the cost! I received the package in a very timely manner as well. 
14794 Glad I purchased this. It really tightened up the focus on all my lenses. Simple to use. Just check your cameras first to see if they have a focus fine adjustment feature. Otherwise this will not help you. 
14795 This product works beautifully and made everyone at the birthday party happy. 
14796 Very flimsy and poorly constructed. After using it just one time, pieces of it were already chipping off. 
14797 A little thin but gorgeous and can t beat the price. Need thicker background underneath to avoid translucency. I just used an older backdrop and it worked perfectly. 
14798 I saw on Pinterest many people used this products at their weddings and then couples would write a memory below there picture. It s quick and simple to use and brings you back to the good old days. 
14799 Love these! 
14800 it was ok but battery didnt last long and cant have it more then 40 feet away 
14801 Great cloths 
14802 Great fit, no bubbles, so far very good. 
14803 Great love it 
14804 This is to replace a camera that was stolen from me. This is better than the one that was stolen. I could not be happier with this one. Thank you for a wonderful camera. 
14805 Worked perfectly in my FinePix F600EXR 
14806 small but nice when you need some extra light. 
14807 perfect for photo s thank you 
14808 Excellent product 
14809 Excellent! Thank you!! 
14810 took great picture love them 
14811 The strap was too big to hook up to my wife s camera, but I was able to adapt it. Works Great. 
14812 Keeps more charge than my actual Canon battery. 
14813 Happy with my purchase. 
14814 Work great! Other members in our group were envious and wanted one! 
14815 Excellent, it does the job! I have take it with me to 3 overseas trips already with no issues 
14816 We really like them. Fun for getting closer details on the moon. 
14817 its great 
14818 It helps to take selfis!!!yayyy!! 
14819 didn t work 
14820 One charging port does not work. 
14821 Good 
14822 I ve bought these before they work quite well look good 
14823 They don t last as long as the OEM batteries, but with 2 of these in a battery grip, you ll make it through an entire day of shooting with power to spare. Considering the price, I d buy more of these before spending the $ for the OEM battery. 
14824 Arrived on time and the quality is pretty good! Highly recommend this product! 
14825 Excellent !!! 
14826 good product, good price 
14827 Great Product!! 
14828 Works okay for the money! 
14829 Looks great on! Can t wait to use it. 
14830 Always need an extra camera battery - this charged quickly and is doing its job! 
14831 I just got this today and it is already packaged to be returned. Apart from being junk, the battery was corroded and the film was dated 2002. What???? Save some money and buy a disposable camera, they will work much better. If I could give it zero stars I would. 
14832 The lens cap fits fine on my Nikon Coolpix P90 NIKOR 24X 4.4-110.4mm lens. It gets my 4 star solely because it fits OK, hasn t broken, and was cheap. 
14833 Two for just a couple $$$ more than the single. Gotta love Amazon. 
14834 They were the worse thing I ever bought 
14835 Cheap 
14836 Iv e been using this on the hot shoe of my d3300 and this flash does great in TTL mode. When autofocus is enabled (and the flash is on the hot shoe) there is a ring laser that shoots forward, can help with low-light autofocus. 
14837 I love this camera you have to be pashint that s all 
14838 Value and quality!! Great camera for begginers and Pro 👍📷 
14839 Pretty much a good value. Fairly complete package, although I am sure that eventually I will be upgrading some of the accessories. 
14840 nice product , but it should come with power supply or choice of when buying from this company 
14841 Comparatively speaking, this is a great deal on the instax mini film. Best price I have found! Shipped in 2 days with prime. Thus will be my go to film purchase when I need refills for my Fujifilm Hello Kitty Instax Mini! 
14842 this is my first prime lens and i really love it, it takes great images and i just love it! if mine broke i would buy it again 
14843 ND is divided right in the middle with no adjustment. Causes framing shots nearly in half. 
14844 Great second battery! 
14845 This is a great system for the price we love it it works perfectly. 
14846 A decent lens for beginners-awesome with lots of light 
14847 too soft 
14848 Product as advertised, shipped promptly and at a reasonable price. 
14849 nice 
14850 works for what i eeded for a sall price 
14851 Superior quality Easy install A great deal for the money 
14852 VERY CHEAP MATERIAL ... BATTERIES RUN LOW FAST. NOT WORTH IT. .. LOOKS FAKE ANYWAYS 
14853 Thank you for your service, I love the product 
14854 Always a good idea to insure your items when you have a thriving business 
14855 Good! 
14856 as advertised, arrived before expected... nice surprise, THANKS, J 
14857 The stand start to get loose in the head after some use. It is not a durable or heavy duty stand. 
14858 Couldn t find this cable anywhere. Came quick and works perfectly. Can t beat the price. Great Product. 
14859 No Prop lines in the video, love it! 
14860 Won t stay on! Keeps falling off! Crappy product! 
14861 Awesome camera...... Does everything a gopro does for $350 LESS. 
14862 sale as advertised. 
14863 Well executed harness. This is my second one.The straps will eventually stretch out but that won t happen for years. 
14864 Its hard fort me to give 5 but it works and is what I needed thanks for the good service 
14865 It was broken when I received it .so I didn t get a chance to use it 
14866 Very cheaply made. 
14867 Very realistic. Just what I wanted for now. 
14868 Very poor quality. 
14869 Great products!!!! Very durable. 
14870 Has all the bells and whistles you need. The only drawback is that the shutter is loud. 
14871 I was expecting something of low quality for the price. I rarely leave reviews but I m so happy with this things that I need to tell others 
14872 Exactly as expected, protects hotshoe, centers with level. 
14873 Easy to take pictures or video. Great quality. Good battery life. Highly recommend it. 
14874 It works great!! 
14875 Perfect, nice and cheap. Arrived faster than expected. 
14876 This is not a regular mirror things farther than about 15 feet are tiny. I just want to know when someone is behind me so this works for me. Also, remove plastic cover from mirror 
14877 Arrived promptly. Exactly as described. 
14878 Met all expectations 
14879 Excellent! I loved and it worked very well. 
14880 Great tool kit 
14881 works perfect with my hero 4 silver. such a great buy as the batteries do run low quickly and having a few backups in my bag makes life perfect 
14882 Great product. Images are high quality. Can t complain. 
14883 Works good. 
14884 Excellent camera. Great price! 
14885 Battery doesn t stay charged 
14886 WORKS WELL, Satified with the quality for the price. 
14887 Physically a little longer than the 35 f2.8 and therefore easier to hold. Becoming one of my favorite lenses. 
14888 Nice case. Room for extra battery, card 
14889 Useless commodity. Neither battery was chargeable. It s not worth processing for a refund. 
14890 Absolutely great. Actually better than I imagined. I am very pleased with the quality of this camera. Pictures and video turn out great. I also had quick follow up with the seller just making sure everything was as expected. 
14891 The soil is used contaminated a whole bunch of stuff, send me them! I got really upset. 
14892 security system is excellent ,, and I can monitor my des iPhone or tablet, I recommend :) 
14893 Great starter camera 
14894 These Batteries worked Perfect for my Canon Vixia S20. The charger also in good. The cost vs. Canon s price is like 1/3 the price. 
14895 Would have been better if it didn t come broken! 
14896 good inexpensive attachment for my Canon telephoto lens to provide protection. 
14897 The size of the shield is smaller than the size of the LCD screen 
14898 Excellent product! Bought two separate frames twice. Very happy with the purchases.. 
14899 Not for heavy cameras. Based on another review I thought it would be sturdy but it is not and you can tell as soon as you feel the box. The monopod part also did not extend as much as I thought it would. Probably okay for casual light use. 
14900 Super pretty summery film. Fast delivery great price 
14901 Great product! 
14902 Works well. And for that price no one can complain. 
14903 It has a bit of a rubbery smell but it works quite well! 
14904 easy to set up and use 
14905 Very good value for the price. 
14906 Just what was requested. Thank you. 
14907 Charges good, keeps full charge for long time 
14908 ok 
14909 No issues, works great as per advertised. 
14910 couldn t have better. it is great 
14911 No grippy Handel just hard plastic feels cheap but gets job done. 
14912 Item arrived as promised. 
14913 Comfy and stylish 
14914 Love it 
14915 Gift, reasonable, child is happy. 
14916 One of those you get what you pay for. It carries a good amount, durability is the issue. Mine s already ripping at the top handle after 2 mild uses. 
14917 Ver y good 
14918 needs second pocket. inside pocket of the one opening is too shallow. Discs fall out. Had to buy another to hold my camera. Fortunately the camera was better than the case! Don t buy it unless you are need to have only one thing in it. 
14919 Yep, !!! 
14920 It s perfect working. 
14921 Great Item. Well made. Good stitching. Easy to fill. Nothing to complain again. Used this item to weight down our film lighting stands and they worked a treat. 
14922 Charged my old battery for my point and shoot! 
14923 Very professional sturdy build. 
14924 The camera was not what I thought it would be so the this protection plan was a waste of my money since I do not even use this camera. 
14925 Takes videos much better than photos. iPhone beats photo quality for sure 
14926 As advertised 
14927 Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
14928 Very good quality 
14929 I ve only had a couple flights so far, but I m impressed. Very easy to fly and video and camera shot are awesome. It will only get better the more I fly it 
14930 Nice light weight. 
14931 Works great, great color, easy to use. Highly recommend this product. Be sure to buy the floating straps, too. 
14932 I just got the camara today. I love it. It is easy to use. I definitely recommend this camera. 
14933 Used this product during our honeymoon. Worked very well and I received the same amount of time on this battery as I did the stock battery. It s very nice to have the 2 extra batteries plus the convenience of mobile charging. 
14934 Had to return the main product these accessories, and this seller did not take these back. 
14935 Just perfect! 
14936 I am so happy with these lights so far. Amazing battery life and a good light output. I definitely wouldn t mind having a few more filters/gels, but for the price I am so happy with the lights. 
14937 Wonderful!! Great price!! 
14938 No better than the 700TVL cameras that I had before and they were pretty bad especially for night vision 
14939 Keeps my go pro safe, and it isn t boring. 
14940 Fit my Nikon D200 perfectly. Took a good charge. Does what it says it will do. 
14941 very effective, works for me. 
14942 good and light 
14943 I like these opera glasses. They fulfilled their promised, but I do wish I could have gotten a higher magnification. 
14944 Videos come in hkv format. Have to watch full video can t skip thru. 
14945 Didn t come with directions, pretty easy to figure out though. Got the job done. 
14946 Perfect for taking anywhere where there is an electrical outlet to recharge battery, and spare battery. Never have to worry about no charge in battery, so always have picture taking ability. 
14947 I afraid that I bought it so much big to my lens..I mean I didn t read in the product details about the filter size&#62; I use a Nikon and those filter don t fit an any lens that I have....Bad purchase. 
14948 Works as advertised. 
14949 It worked better then expected 
14950 This light is massive produces minimal heat for a CFL. and great to add light to my aloe plants :) 
14951 Instructions are horrible 
14952 Super cute! Can t wait to do our 6 month pictures with our little man! 
14953 This lighting set is working PERFECT for my video blogs. Great product at a great price! 
14954 Ok, but a bit stiff and hard to close. 
14955 Doesn t work and got no refund. Stay away 
14956 Very good product 
14957 love it soooo much. 
14958 Works perfect love the additional accessories like the tripod and cleaning material and car charger 
14959 Not impressed with lens adapter for the add on lenses. No need for the add on flash 
14960 Camera fogged in side camera lens during first use. 
14961 amazing quality...love it perfectly fits my nikon d3200 
14962 Great product for the price. It also came with a portable bag to carry it around. Its very convenient and lightweight. Great for any kind of angles. 
14963 Very nice pole... Only thing I recommend is drying it out when doe using on water sports! But besides that great product would recommend 
14964 Item was shipped fast but the zoom lens is loose and when holding camera down the lens will slide out and it shouldn t move. Not the seller s fault but a factory problem. Takes good pictures but mechanical flawed. 
14965 I bought this with the expectation that I am able to pan my camera for panoramic pictures. The problem is when the ball is locked into place, it also locks the panning mechanism below! You can t rotate the damn thing. Stupid design. 
14966 good product and so good seller help me and contact me so fast thank yoooooou 
14967 We wanted the loud ringer, and the paging feature was a helpful addition. The 3 watt amp is pretty strong, too. All of the Viking components are easy to configure and wire 
14968 Right out of the box, the owner s manual is missing. I m thinking this is a return. I will charge the battery, go online to look for a manual, but if the camera doesn t work, I want a full refund. I m very upset. 
14969 You get what you pay for here. Works, but not 100%. 
14970 Perfect! 
14971 Great! 
14972 Not great quality. When shifted, the filter darkness does not cover the entire lens so during long exposures, the lighting is exposed differently across the picture. I suggest buying something more expensive for better quality. 
14973 good product 
14974 exelent 
14975 As advertised. Serves the purpose well. 
14976 I m really impressed with the camera itself the range of motion is great, and the picture quality is amazing for such and inexpensive camera. Where the product fails is the app it crashes constantly it seems to have a really hard time staying connected to the unit. 
14977 good deal! 
14978 For an amateur, this works great. Easy to set up and fast. 
14979 They work wonderfly when you re using them but trying to fold them up and put them back into the protective sleave is a pain. Otherwise it s a nice product to have. 
14980 No, it does not meet my expectations. I need to return. 
14981 I have not had the time to try all of the capabilities of the Nikon D3200 digital camera, but so far have found it easy to use and adaptable, resulting in excellent pictures. 
14982 Those li-42B are great. 
14983 This is a tripod. It s a pretty decent inexpensive tripod, and if that s what you need, I say order it. But if you need a light stand ... this won t do. 
14984 The case is nice but it is a bit hard to get the micro cards to stay in the foam. However, it got me to Africa and back and kept the cards clean and dry. 
14985 Very light and portable,folds up to a nice carrying size.Also sturdy enough to use outside.highly recommended 
14986 Meets all expectations 
14987 Good 
14988 Bought this last minute for a cruise. Takes pretty good pictures, zoom feature is excellent, but the time needed between pics is inconvenient. However, as a basic camera it does the job. 
14989 attractive case and fits great in my center console 
14990 The cameras are good and with the POE (power over ethernet) it makes running the wire much more simple. The downfall is the controller and HDD, it constantly needs reformat and will not overwrite the current recordings. 
14991 Great image quality. Tricky to get set up but customer service has been very helpful with getting things set correctly. 
14992 Showed up only one side charges. 
14993 Good for Linear systems. This remote will NOT work with Genie Garage door openers. 
14994 Excellent product. Stable, smooth and easy to use! 
14995 On time and as described. Very pleased with seller and item. 
14996 An actual Panasonic battery wow 
14997 Not the best 
14998 This Item was the same item that I had for my camera, no difference from the charger that come with the camera. The delivery was fast with no problems at all. I would recommend this company. 
14999 One of the two soft buttons (the black) has some &#34;other&#34; additional mark on the surface....which I don t like....the quality is much better in the photograph... 
15000 Did not have a universal fit like it describes. My Cool pics and Easyshare didn t fit. I returned for my money. 
15001 CHARGES FROM MY 20 WATT SOAR PANEL KEEPS BATTERY S FULL WHEN I M OUT ALL DAY SHOOTING PICS 
15002 Good price. They just go way to quickly especially when using the wifi. I have 6 batteries in constant rotation to have any fun making vids. Dual charger is a must have as well... 
15003 Love this camera you can zoom in and say stuff through mic 
15004 Smudge on the lens that I couldn t get off. Took a few pictures...all blurred. 
15005 This adapter works well. A bit on the expensive side, but I can now use my existing 58 mm filters. Easy peasy to install. 
15006 These work great in the Polaroid printer camera, just know they do not have sticky backs so you ll need tape. 
15007 It was just what I needed, and shipping time was great, got it before our trip. Price included a battery, so I can charge one and have it ready and waiting, no need to wait the the other one to charge. 
15008 Beautiful pictures, easy to set up, am going to give one to my daughter for Christmas this year! 
15009 Henry was very quick in fixing my problem accessing my camera through my android. Thank you very much for taking the time to correct this. 
15010 Adorable , came earlier than package had said &#60;3 
15011 Works as advertised. Pretty light weight. Pretty rugged. I used it backpacking and thought it was worth the weight. Just something fun to have to look at peaks and stars. Don t expect to discover any new planets with it. 
15012 Great service and product 
15013 Great price, good product. 
15014 The Smallrig is perfect cold shoe mount for field applications of mics 
15015 good combo 
15016 A perfect alternative to the expensive Fuji battery and charger. The charger works fine and I have noticed no difference in battery life in the camera. Very pleased with this purchase. 
15017 The swith was handy and decent at switching devices to a default. Now my TV with one HDMI port can have three HDMI devices attached. 
15018 This mount works perfectly for its intended purpose. It saved me buying another camera. It made it possible to view 2 sides of my house. I was able to utilize the full pan & tilt feature of outdoor camera. 
15019 Batteries are good, charger works fine and I received immediate phone support regarding a question. 
15020 My laptop charger took crap. This replacement worked perfect. Quick shipping and good price. 
15021 I finally got to play around with this. It is an amazing microscope for simple everyday hobbyists. I thought I would encounter a problem when I upgraded to Windows 10 but the drivers work fine. The drivers are downloadable from the Plugable technologies website. 
15022 For the price, you d think you would get more fly time. Oh technology limitations. It s a battery. It works. 
15023 Nice additIon to my go pro system....now no more charging in the camera! 
15024 Works great. Good image quality! 
15025 was happy to be able to get one for a very old flash unit. 
15026 The battery arrived in good condition and promptly. Once fully charged it worked as expected. No issues. 
15027 Fabulous lens. Works very well in all focal lengths and apertures so far after 600 shots. This will be my favorite matched combo with the Rebel 1 - T5. Until I check out the T6-x. 
15028 Flimsy and overly complicated design (the amount of pieces that extend. There is really no suitable purpose for these. I wish i could return them. 
15029 Works wonderfully and fits all my GoPro accessories. 
15030 works great - keeps the camera from sinking 
15031 ♫ ♪ ♫ A Pleasure ♫ ♪ ♫ tucksmusicstore.com 
15032 I like this one better than the Neewer Camera Tripod Mounting PLate with Quick Release that was all black. This one fits tighter. 
15033 As soon as I got my ROXANT PRO video camera stabilizer, I tried it with a smaller camera (Sony RX100 = 240 g) and it worked great. Your product is unbelievably sturdy and well designed for a really great price. Please keep me posted on future technical breakthroughs. 
15034 The 2 way audio works...the setup was not very easy. IPCam Viewer App does not have this model IP Camera for the smart phone. 
15035 Not only is this a great product, their customer service is top notch. I have already recommended this to other people. If you have any issues getting this connected reach out to them and they will certainly help out. Don t look any further. Buy it! 
15036 Very pleased with item. It arrived quickly and is perfect for the camera.. 
15037 fine 
15038 clunky interface 
15039 Great case. No real downfalls. Be up and flying in minutes. iPad slots could be a tad wider because I keep them in cases to protect screen and they are snug 
15040 Received and it was broken 
15041 It works but the red tip is hard to put on and I wish it was smaller. I know there is a smaller one but the smaller one did not get good reviews. 
15042 Great product and perfect transaction. 
15043 We love the camera strap! 
15044 I m satisfied. Great seller.. Thank you 
15045 Does not fit my factory Gopro case or the aftermarket case i purchased. totally useless junk. 
15046 Good price, fast shipping, durable product. 
15047 Must have for GoPro Hero owners. GoPro should have included it with the Hero. 
15048 Works like a charm 
15049 The item is as described by the seller -- be sure to attach the adaptor before the lens covers - I had to play with it a little to get it to work, but these are definitely for the Canon PowerShot SX50. All in alln a good deal. 
15050 Great camera the only thing I didnt like was going from water to surface and the amount of time it took to get the lens clear so the picture wasn t blurry 
15051 It s not good :( I m not happy i open it it s toooooo small not great quality recording and pictures are worse i don t know how to get a refund but I wish I could :( 
15052 Best camera I have ever used! 
15053 Does the job but it shakes a lot and can get uncomfortable against your ear. Hence the 3 star 
15054 they were better than I actually expected them to be 
15055 Really nice, sharp lens. Great price for a good piece! 
15056 as expected 
15057 It does what is expected. 
15058 Gift 
15059 Nice little polarizer, makes a big difference when shooting water or sky. 
15060 Awesome camera 
15061 Kind of plastic-y. Not impressed. 
15062 I really liked using the Bobber on my go pro while snorkeling. One funny thing I did notice is that when out of the water bees and other insects were certainly attracted to the yellow color of the bobber. 
15063 works wonderfully i would recommend this version of the GoPro over the fancy versions with the LCD viewer and WiFi just as rugged without the added cost 
15064 We were looking for a good bridge camera to go with our long lens DSLRs. This camera is great...perfect for landscapes. Images are crisp and beautiful, it s easy to use, and compact. A great buy!!! A must for vacation. 
15065 its light, easy to setup, easy to store, and holds a background up. 
15066 Really comfortable and useful strap. 
15067 I wouldn t recommend. It definitely doesn t work for what I want. EXTREMELY limited focus. You truly get what you pay for. The only upside, packaging was great and it did arrive quickly. 
15068 Great tool, does exactly what it is supposed to do, amazing build quality. I tied mine onto the pull of my GoPro case, so I always know where it is. Adventure on.... 
15069 Happy with product. Just as described. 
15070 Bobber is doing good job. You don t have to put water inside like some people advice - is perfect balanced. 
15071 Nice job, Amazon! Plenty of compartments and padding for all of my accessories. 
15072 Thx 
15073 Product as expect! Fast shipping! 
15074 best binoculars I have ever owned 
15075 This is all you need for your Go Pro Spare battery and charging kit. 
15076 Wow its amazing and my daughter is happy happy 
15077 Great quality and compact product. 
15078 I thought I was getting a good deal for B+W 72mm UV filter but when it arrived, it was a used one. It had finger prints and a dry sugary substance (ad if someone spilled soda on it) very disappointed. Going to stick with purchasing my filters from B&H Photo 
15079 Everything was awesome!! Delivery was amazing!! Wouldn t have bought it any other way and I totally recommend others to get their GoPro this way as well!! Thank you! 
15080 Excellent, thank you... 
15081 Great microscope, I use it to photo coins for sale and it takes great closeups. 
15082 Great value. They are better than original. 
15083 Arrived early and works great on my Sony A77ii, what more could I want. Very happy. 
15084 A+ 
15085 Nice hood, well constructed and good fit. 
15086 Superb lens. I ve been using this on my Nikon for over a year in all types of situations (indoor, outdoor, fast action, macro, etc.) 
15087 Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret? 
15088 👌🏻 
15089 Great telescope, easy to assemble and set up, great views of the moon. Haven t tried planets yet. My first real scope. Tremendous service from Orion for suggested accessories. 
15090 Love it! It s everything I expected! 
15091 Excellent 
15092 No matter the settings, I cannot seem to get a clear picture when inside. I bought this so I didn t need my large camera on me all the time. Disappointed. 
15093 Got it as a replacement. it works nicely. 
15094 Good connectivity and price. 
15095 works good 
15096 This case is better then I expected!! Very cool!! I added the DJI logo, looks even better!! 
15097 Too small to fit compact camera Cannon Power Shot SX710HS (it is a really small case) 
15098 This battery fit my camera perfectly and charged beautifully in the battery charger that I also bought, 
15099 The plastic sheet protectors seemed loose before use. Decided to return. 
15100 Absolutely love this camera. It has a lot of cool features!!! 
15101 Good recorder for the price 
15102 2nd Nikon binocular I bought. These were less money than first and we are just as satisfied. 
15103 ok 
15104 Quick shipping, quick connexion to bluetooth & compatible with Iphone 5! 
15105 Just what we need for our trip. 
15106 Outstanding camera! Easy setup! Love it! Will buy a couple more! 
15107 i used it with my phone and it s works ok 
15108 When turn on camera need to pull battery out and back in for camera to work 
15109 It does the Job just right good price vale 
15110 Nothing works like to original. Great battery pack. No short charge issues like those found on some clones. 
15111 Works perfect i could not complain at all 
15112 It does the macro job! focusing is quite challenging though. 
15113 It s perfect! 
15114 It stopped the jellow on my phantom 2. So I m satisfied 
15115 My husband and I were looking to buy a GoPro when we came across this bundle and we are happy we did. Being able to get a lot of accessories for a few dollars more was great. We cannot wait to create memories with this amazing bundle. 
15116 Great product. 
15117 Works great! 
15118 Great product, fits perfectly in my lens 
15119 Nice design and excellent construction. Works great with my Zoom H5 portable recorder too. 
15120 So far all of the accessories work as expected EXCEPT for the selfie stick. It s horrible quality and will not hold your GoPro without rotating around. Trash the selfie stick and buy a better one if you really need one (I didn t). 
15121 Pretty good buy. Gets the job done for the most part. 
15122 I like it! 
15123 Love my camera backpack took it to Costa Rica and was perfect for traveling!! 
15124 This tripod is not up to my expectations too short and unstable but for the money I guess it s all right 
15125 Great photos and video, arrived in two days. Would highly recommend this product and would highly recommend amazon. 
15126 It s okay, some pictures came out great. Others looked like webcam quality. Sucks up batteries though. Bring lots of batteries. 
15127 its ok 
15128 It was free and I still wouldn t use it. I hope no one actually pays for this. 
15129 Great packaging and product was what I expected. Great value. 
15130 Great for my project 
15131 too expensive... 
15132 I wanted to return this because the sound quality is so poor that there is constant background noise even in complete silent rooms. Other then that it s great but with sound so terrible I felt as if the device was broken. 
15133 Came on time, battery however does not sit in it correctly but seems to be charging. 
15134 Excellent upgrade!!! 
15135 Excellent.. very well made with all the storage and pockets needed.. 
15136 Tina Gonzalez was excellent in helping me set up my cameras - she was awesome!!!!!! 
15137 Excellent method to attach a Loupe to the 5DSR. Very well made and do like the lift up and swing away capability to move the Loupe without removing it from the camera. 
15138 I had to get a second strap in order to be able to have a strap around my neck while using the camera. So far that means there are 2 straps on the camera and I haven t figured out a better way. Otherwise, I am happy with it. 
15139 Works as promised. 
15140 The lens performed superbly, with very sharp pictures. In good light, the f/4 aperture provided excellent performance for short exposures with action sharply stopped. A wonderful purchase! 
15141 i like the camera...still in the process of learning about the camera but I do like that both video and photos can be taken I also like the large megapixels as well as it being able to hold a larger SD card. 
15142 It s bad quality and can t see for my cellphone or internet... 
15143 Its a little on the cheap side but it has some nice compartments which seem a little flimsy though. Not bad for the price. 
15144 perfect. 
15145 Good 
15146 Great lightweight tripod! 
15147 Okay quality, batteries last about 50-75% as long as OEM. 
15148 The batteries were not the 1450 mAh brand pictured, but 1200 mAh Bower batteries. Both are good batteries, and both last longer than the Canon OEM 1000 mAh battery that came with the PowerShot S95. 
15149 thank you 
15150 I got electric shocks each time I touch 
15151 Works great. No problems at all. Jim 
15152 great back pack for my camera and camera stuff 
15153 Awesome !!! 
15154 It arrived earlier than predicted and works great. I have no complaints about it. 
15155 This camera is breath of fresh air. Amazing zoom, easy to use because its just like my Samsung Galaxy 4. Wifi so you can instantly email or post on facebook, shutterfly etc. 
15156 Great 
15157 Henry at tech support was great in setting up the camera. Awesome customer service. 
15158 Like that it s manual focus with built in hood. Seems sharp for the price. I just don t like the limited aperture stops. 
15159 My first Big lens! very Very Happy!! 
15160 Worked perfect with my camera. 
15161 The cords for the lights are very short. The lights are top heavy and one fell over and broke the bulb on the 2nd use :-(. 
15162 Scanner was fine. I thought in reading the description it was an upgraded version. I already had one like the one I ordered. 
15163 It fits my hybrid bike bar, and it holds OK. However, it doesnt t fir my road bike bar. 
15164 Makes a big difference in my images. Easy to use. 
15165 For the money this reflects really does the job! I use it all the time in my photography classes! Gold and Silver is a great combination! 
15166 excelente 
15167 Arrived on time. Have used a couple of times and quality of material and function are very good. 
15168 Beautiful idea, design and quality manufacturing. Works as expected and makes holding the camera with one hand a pleasure. 
15169 This is an awesome product. It holds on windows and non porous surfaces. 
15170 Love it! 
15171 Love this! Very comfortable. 
15172 I was looking for a very tall mono-pod. I found it to be a little shaky when extended to full length. Still, works good and I will continue to use it. 
15173 Lost my genuine Nikon TTL cord at an event, and sorely missed it. Doubtful, I gave this a whirl, and it s perfect! Arrived next day! 
15174 great 
15175 Terrible product. Worked only 3 times and never again. Do not waste your money in this crap 
15176 Purchased two speedlights with a YN560-TX. The results are superb. It took me a while to get them set up correctly to start taking pictures off camera, since i m new to flash photography. This a must buy. Will update later after i ve done more testing 
15177 Another product that is WAY overpriced, but exactly what us video guys need. It s aluminum foil people. 
15178 Worked as expected 
15179 Excellent set of binoculars. They are better than expected! 
15180 Perfect match for the SIRUI P-326 6 section monopod. Easy to set up and adjust the friction resistance to suit ones needs. 
15181 Great quality for the price. No qualms about recommending this product. 
15182 I did very good pictures, i love it. 
15183 Really enjoy this easy to use camera! 
15184 Very fast shipping. New Product as described. Works very well. 
15185 Fits the copter, controller and charger great. No room for blades, tablet or other equipment. 
15186 Great buy 
15187 We have used our camera a handful of times and have even satisfied with the quality. I have yet to buy lithium batteries but I will be doing so. The regular AAA batteries are completely dead after only a half hour. 
15188 Definitely met my expectations! 
15189 Excellent product. 
15190 This camera is awesome - lots of features, is nice and compact making it easy to carry. 
15191 I got the accessories yesterday, when I open it, there is no connection with the selfie stick, I cannot use it for connecting with waterproof case. 
15192 great cams! WARNING.. If you use &#34;blue iris&#34; for your security system do not update the firmware on these. the last firmware (as of 8/20/2015) will not break the streaming to the software. However the cameras still work with other software. Also Infrared Leds could use better range...... 
15193 Doesn t even deserved 1 star.... Terrible, horrible, stupid app that will never connect to WIFI even when completing all steps multiple times your camera will appear offline on the app while the connection light is green. Without the app working this camera is useless... Never again.... 
15194 Love everything about this camcorder. The quality, the zoom, the auto focus, the stability feature.. its just amazing. only slight problem is that the battery pack sticks out. 
15195 Nicely made, looks good, supple and easy to use. 
15196 Works well, lightweight, compact, storage case. The top bar bends a little, but that s to be expected from an adjustable bar. 
15197 nice product 
15198 Great tiny camera. Great value for money 
15199 the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade. 
15200 the best 
15201 It works great and no one see s it lol 
15202 Came in excellent quality. 
15203 wonderful product 
15204 Great lighter weight 35mm camera. Excellent photo quality with the function to email a photo to anyone with a computer or phone. Photo correction program although limited has a good editing program. Great lense selection of which I have five. 
15205 These batteries work just as the GoPro one does! Charges well and leaves the battery fully charged 
15206 The description states that this contains a lithium metal battery. It actually contains a sealed lead acid battery. 
15207 good grip 
15208 As I expected 
15209 small, functional, works great, price is right. I did not do any research before buying it, but really happy with this mic. 
15210 Great product... 
15211 I had to call it in to get help and set it up with my mobile hot spot. The rep that helped me, Terry Morgan, was extremely helpful and walked me through the entire process. I m very happy with the product. 
15212 Perfect for glasses 
15213 Loved this lens and the bundle was great! Shipping was crazy fast too. I would definitely order from them again. 
15214 A good product. 
15215 Great light, works as advertised. However the battery backing pops out easily if you re not careful. Not the worst problem to have all things considered though. Great for getting a little extra fill light on indie film sets where time and resources are limited. 
15216 Worked very well and there are no problems with using them with the J5. Amazing price for three batteries. 
15217 Get teased for using a selfie stick! But seriously, this thing is solidly constructed and is great to get overhead shots in a crowd, and also really low shots (think skateboard videos that track along a few inches from the ground). 
15218 Works great 
15219 Just got, Have used it a little already taken a lot more pictures than my old one would have and still has 2 dots left. Thanks and the price was good also. 
15220 This is a very comfortable, great looking camera strap. It fits my camera perfectly. Very well made. 
15221 great for my needs when needed works well and very pleased. Thanks!! 
15222 I love the bluetooth shutter remote. Everything else is in great shape and works just fine. 
15223 Low quality 
15224 I love this sling, bought it prior to a trip to Disney World and this made it much easier to use my camera. 
15225 It works! Cap is good to protect camera lens while transporting and storing. Lens hood didn’t eliminate propeller shadow but definitely reduced it. Lightweight so does not effect gimbal balance. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase. 
15226 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
15227 three thumbs up. 
15228 Works as intended! 
15229 excellent product. 
15230 Very good. The angle for the camera needs to be better though. Have to wear them funky to get the camera straight in front of you. Make sure to get vlc media player or the correct codecs or whatnot for the avi file. 
15231 Perfect replacement for the mount that went bad. 
15232 Perfect 
15233 VERY LARGE The camera is incredibly conspicuous, although pretty to look at – if it doesn t need to be subtle are hidden in anyway it should work well – my bad for ordering without considering that issue. Two large to hide amongst bric-a-brac at Cetera as I had hoped 
15234 camera does not seem to be working as it should according to the instructions,kindly have someone from amazon give me a call and walk me through setting up camera and getting it to work properly. 
15235 Came fast works as advertised. 
15236 Lttle stabilizer than can make a large difference. 
15237 We love the camera and the accessories as well :-) 
15238 Really nice reflector/diffuser! Very easy to use and does a great job. The design is great and very easy to hold and use with one hand. 
15239 Works perfectly and shipped faster than expected 
15240 perfect piece of equipment. 
15241 Super high quality. Pitched my wobbly old clamp lights straight into the recycling bin. 
15242 very nice product 
15243 Excellent purchase. Worked like a charm! Glad I bought it. 
15244 The product came with the brand name &#34;Camson&#34; written in front, it was not in the sample photos, I do not like how it looks. 
15245 A perfect fit and very fast service. 
15246 So far so good. I love that the lens can be tethered to e lens/camera so I don t have to hold onto it separately. 
15247 Excellent 
15248 Great price for a beginner photographer. 
15249 great 
15250 Inexpensive, works perfect. 
15251 This is a really affordable package when you break a light and need some replacements. I bought these as soon as one broke. Much better to buy in a package than to buy them singular. 
15252 Everything worked as expected. I would purchase again. 
15253 Case leaked while in Florida. 
15254 Bueno 
15255 The clip is good. Some angles are funky. It doesnt bend the whole 180 degrees so you cant get all the angles. Slips off of hard serfaces. Best use is on a backpack strap 
15256 Nice head strap, somehow stays cooler than its cheaper imitators. Get it so you can be a miner with a camera on your head. you know you always wanted to play miner..lol 
15257 Went all over Europe in my pocket. Over 6000 great pix. 
15258 Disappointed in the quality. Thought it would be leather. No plastic protectors , had to purchase them my self. WAY overpriced!!!!!!!!!!! 
15259 Works great and as described. Interesting that I didn t receive a wall charger for it though. Only a car charger? That s the only reason for a 4 star. No wall charger. 
15260 A great battery for my Tough 4 camera which I love! 
15261 Very happy 
15262 I was pleasantly surprised. The bag is bigger than I thought and therefore holds more equipment. It arrived rather quickly and more than met my expectations. It is a nice bag and well worth the money. T hank you. 
15263 Love this little bag but it was too small for my sons camera and lenses, so I had to return it. It is very well made, has little compartments and I recommend it highly for smaller cameras. 
15264 Useless. Unable to pan or tilt smoothly.. 
15265 Couldn t be happier!!! This thing is solid, and awesome! 
15266 Super fast shipping! I lost my original lens cap to a lake and this baby did the trick! The cleaning pen is awesome as is everything else in the package. For the price and quality, don t hesitate to click and buy NOW! 
15267 Do not waste your money-broke almost immediately on landing after third day flying. I would say I am a medium level drone operator and this product was poor. I own 5 drones, so take it from me, not worth the savings. 
15268 Works perfect, And fast shipping! 
15269 Case is as advertised. Wouldn t hesitate to buy from them again 
15270 They re a bit fragile but they can do the work, I use them to hold my reflectors and bounce cards. I like the tips because you can flip them over to adjust the grip. 
15271 Very comfortable. Item as described. 
15272 I bought this package for my daughter and she LOVES it. Great color case - my grandmother s favorite color - always loved it. Great gift idea to go with the scamera in the same color. 
15273 Incredible lens! 
15274 Fits my T3i camera body, 2 lens, and my speedlite. 
15275 I love working with ND filters and these give me a bit more to work with. They seem like good quality for the price, they may not be for professionals, but for me, I am very happy with them. 
15276 They work as advertised and working good and great products 
15277 Grest product 
15278 Hot Shoe Cover hits perfectly for my Sony a6000. 
15279 Installs pretty easily and has great picture. It s pretty cool to be able to check on my house when I m away. 
15280 Just as I expected. 
15281 Great product looks like it can hold and stand the test of time. 
15282 Very convenient and having no extra cords is a plus! 
15283 Absolutely am thrilled with such a good secondary battery for my T5. It holds a charge like a champ and hasn t caused me any issues on my all day shoots. Definitely recommend this battery if you want a good substitute or replacement battery for your Canon Rebel. 
15284 The best I have ever used! 
15285 keeps my need safe and secure, nice product for many needs. Thanks!! 
15286 Just right for my camera and &#34;stuff&#34; and at a great price. 
15287 works great. 
15288 Works fine but more instructions needed, like how to clear info. On chip. Does send out a lot of false alarms. Still trying to figure out why. 
15289 Works well. the cover/protectors are a nice value-add 
15290 Wow, this makes your GoPro look like a real camera. Its a little heavy. Really protects you camera. I got 37mm filter kit for it, works like a charm. 
15291 Like it it works great 
15292 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
15293 Rad 
15294 Cheap, compact, takes decent video. Not giving 5 stars, because the battery capacity is terrible, and the battery fits entirely inside the cam, meaning larger aftermarket batteries are not possible. 
15295 Great product, as usual from SmallRig. Just what I wanted, and exactly as advertised. I have built many custom rigs, and SmallRig is rapidly becoming my favorite source. My clients are always impressed with the quality. 
15296 Poorly written instructions and doesn t work as advertised. 
15297 These filters are fantastic! Makes my pictures look as if I knew what I was doing. 
15298 I was looking for a battery for my Samsung film camera that I forgotten about since the dawn of the digital camera. The price of this rechargeable lithium battery is about the price of a single non rechargeable one. No brainer for this one. 
15299 perfect for my coupons 
15300 Cheaply made and put together! The pieces of it don t even fit together so the led light emits from EVERYWHERE drawing attention to it and even annoying the wearer in darker environments. Stay away! 
15301 Amazing quality, shipped on time, I love them! 
15302 Works for me! 
15303 Great camera 
15304 Sounds quality was not as good as expected. Video quality wasnt very good either 
15305 Might be overkill to use this for a &#34;tough&#34; camera but it s rigid and can hold the battery charger and extra batteries, which is all you really need when vacationing. 
15306 Thank You 
15307 Works just as described! Exactly what we needed. Thank you! 
15308 Great product 
15309 I really like the ability to attach the tripod mount below this makes it very friendly to use. 
15310 Item as described. 
15311 Great color and size. It can be used as a normal purse... Cute! 
15312 Tips over easy 
15313 Good information in a nice hand held system. Would recommend it to any photo buff with a D7100. 
15314 I don t know what its made of but it works great. 
15315 Perfect! 
15316 This lens take amazing photos. Produces a very wide, highly detailed and proportionally correct image every time. Simply outstanding!! 
15317 Excellent camera for the money. I his is my third Canon. I have a 35 mm and an eos rebel. I like the compact size and color only one lens 
15318 Color is very poor in Auto mode. I ll have to delve into the documentation to see if there is a fix. 
15319 poor colors, al photos have a green screen with this papers… bad choice 
15320 Really awesome product. 
15321 I had tough time hooking this up. I called customer service and got Marvin on the line. Badge # AR004221, he was great, he walked us through it with patience. thanks Marvin! 
15322 Fits and works great with my Fuji finepix S1 Camera. 
15323 battery is faulty, we thought it was a problem with the olympus camera,however it is not and I still need a battery that works? 
15324 Works great. Time will tell how durable it is. 
15325 Thanks! 
15326 awesome bundle 
15327 A great set. My daughter loves and and is having so much fun using it. Thank you! 
15328 Good lense. Excellent results. Glad I got it. 
15329 Good camera. Haven t really used it other than few pics 
15330 Great mounting bracket?!?! Lol. 
15331 Good 
15332 Umbrella hole is too small for my 43&#34; Westcott Umbrella. 
15333 Exactly what I wanted. Camera stores don t normally carry screw-on caps. 
15334 Good design overall! Excellent videos made 
15335 Perfect fit for my husbands drone. Very lightweight yet very sturdy. 
15336 It s basically impossible to make this camera/feed work consistently. It is unbelievably frustrating and a waste of money. 
15337 This watch is supposed to be water resistant but water got into watch after a few months of use, now it s filled with water and not usable. 
15338 I gave Digital Goja 5 stars on my Altura flash kit! I am very pleased with my purchase, the price and the follow up Customer Service. Awesome! 
15339 love it!! 
15340 Perfect 
15341 Excellent quality - love this lens 
15342 Cheap - Don t buy this! 
15343 Quick, easy setup, very useful product. I can peek at my cell phone from anywhere and see what s going on at home. I highly recommend! 
15344 Received promptly, fits my camera just fine, price was right, I m very pleased. 
15345 Audio quality is not good like camera but over all. Good 
15346 Both batteries no longer work and I have only had them almost 5 months. I had pictures scheduled and had to cancel because I charged both batteries and neither worked.. 
15347 Delivered on time and as described 
15348 Nice fit with smooth finish. Doesn t seem like it ll fall off or peel away anytime soon. The low profile makes it hard to tell that it s even there. Clear glass doesn t negatively affect image quality at all. Good product! 
15349 They ARE &#34;Wireless&#34;....But they don t run on Batteries! (WOW) - Of course they need a PLUG to have &#34;Power from Electricity&#34;! These ARE &#34;MONITORS&#34;...Not secret SPY CAMERAS!! (LOL) 
15350 Olympus batteries are the best for the Olympus cameras 
15351 Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites! 
15352 Seems to work well. Used it to top-off my batteries and it charged-up quickly. Time will tell, but good so far. 
15353 Perfect. 
15354 Charger is fine but disappointed by the size of the batteries. Movie Cameras need bigger batteries and this was advertised for movie cameras. Better to buy the charger and batteries separately. 
15355 This is a great device that allows you to view things going on in or around your home from a remote location. It has a lot of the features of a CCTV system, but for a fraction of the cost. 
15356 fits cannon rebel well 
15357 great transaction. Product as described 
15358 was excatly as described. 
15359 The remote battery seems to be dead. It does not work. 
15360 Worked fine 
15361 Having trouble getting adequate focus for my eyes 
15362 works great! 
15363 Did not fit my Canon 5D Mk III with the stock 24-70mm. No battery grip. Decent build quality, but could not use. 
15364 very good on batteries, recommended 
15365 Benjamin Ward Excellent product and technical support. Would recommend. 
15366 Works great 
15367 Exactly what I wanted, and it works well. Convenient also that it can be reversed on the lens for storage in my camera bag. The on-board surface helps in reducing eliminating glare inside and outside the hood. 
15368 Perfect camera. 
15369 It works fine...good cost compared to others out there. Not a big fan of the BLUE strap but it works and easily replaced if need be. 
15370 It s doing what it s supposed to at a great price! 
15371 A great lens that I use on my Nikon d750. If you like a heavy, large lens this is the one for you. Photos are outstanding. Most pleased, by clearly if you want something light and small you may want to look elsewhere. 
15372 easy to install and add to sell phone nice you can look inside your home from your sell phone 
15373 it s a re-purchase 
15374 Good quality regardless of zoom setting 
15375 I really like the camera, but can t get the pictures off of it onto my laptop. And I don t know how to use the items that came with it...cause no manual came with it. 
15376 This projector is really good for the price and is easy to travel around with however i didnt recieve and hdmi cord to connect the projector to my computer and i dont like that,now i dont know which cord to buy 
15377 for this Price i was waiting almost a toy.. But are a Really GOOD product. i can compare this set with set of 35 us. 
15378 Didn t come with instruction booklet, but that was easy enough to find online. Doesn t hold charge, and randomly shuts of my phone. Don t waste your money. 
15379 Worked very well. Definitely needed the charger and extra batteries. 
15380 So far this along with VIDEO SURVEILLANCE SECURITY SIGNS Sign burglar- robber- thief video warning... has kept intruders from attempting to break into the back door of our garage. 
15381 Excellent camera but the speaker has some static. 
15382 It is not fitting to my d5300. 
15383 Great price and great item 
15384 They charge fast and work great. 
15385 I bought this camera ages ago - not sure why I wasn t asked to post a review then... :) Anyways, it s a good piece and I ve only had to invest towards getting the SD card compartment. 
15386 By reading the instructions before anything else, my first film worked great. I haven t finished my first film pack yet but so far it s worked just how it should. I m actually going to buy again after finishing this pack. 
15387 Excelente! 
15388 Only received 50 shots. Two of the 20-pack and one of the 10-pack. The clear packaging even says &#34;50 shots&#34; but they placed their own sticker over the top which says &#34;60 shots&#34;. Not cool. 
15389 It works. 
15390 So many fun facts noted in this book. 
15391 I am very happy with this battery :) 
15392 Good cable. Just as expected. 
15393 My wife really loved this camera! 
15394 Read the instructions upon arrival, you are directed to an icloud account to change camera settings, whereas the competition includes the software to monitor and change settings without the cloud account. I am sure it performs well, 115 degrees vs 126 by the competition. 
15395 The tripod is perfect for my needs. Compact and pretty sturdy considering its size. 
15396 Just as described 
15397 Very good product. 
15398 Does nice job. 
15399 This was plug-n-play with my NVR. Good picture on the test. I will update if that changes in actual operations. 
15400 Great! 
15401 these work too 
15402 REALLY GOOD, INCREDIBLY EASY TO FLY 
15403 Arrived on time and as described 
15404 Not like I had read but seller was great and a full return 
15405 good product 
15406 Fast service, simple! 
15407 battery does not last long enough 
15408 This is a definite must if you walk much with a heavy camera. This sling allows you to grab and shoot, never having to remove the sling. I use it at flying events and its perfect. 
15409 Works great. No problems. 
15410 Works as it should. 
15411 Excellent 
15412 Bought this with an extra 50mm lens. Love it so far. The extras that came with this bundle was like icing on the cake. Really happy with my purchase. 
15413 Flash is great but wireless adapter doesn t transmit TTL so it s useless. I couldn t even get my camera to trigger with it. 
15414 Love the cameras (3) of them. The picture is amazing. Vincent was amazing at his job and vary patient and professional. Thasnk you for your product. 
15415 Great product! 
15416 Really great for the price.. 
15417 Confirmed, bought this from Frys.com and had the exact same experience. It s unforgivable since I needed this for a special occasion and now I m hosed. 
15418 Very useful for my situation: OMD EM5 body plus ep3 body with 40-150 and a few primes: 75/45/25/14. The top compartment carries my headphone wallet and stuffs. Stylish outlook. 
15419 it iss exactly what i expected 
15420 Perfect for the C11. 
15421 very good 
15422 With Foscam support set up was fast. This is my 4th Foscam and I like the picture Quality of all of them except for the outdoor 
15423 Infrared is hard to clearly see anything. 
15424 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks!!! 
15425 Horible I didnt get all the sheets. 
15426 great deal 
15427 works fine on pentax. would buy again 
15428 Very complete kit and everything I needed to get started 
15429 I love this lens. Amazing sharpness, great quality build. My new favorite lens. I ll buy another. 
15430 So far so good. They charged properly and work just fine in my D3200, 
15431 Great value, love it. 
15432 Great product. Works fine with different branded flashes I own and my Sony A7ii as receivers 
15433 Seem to work just as good as the Go Pro batteries but are MUCH CHEAPER 
15434 Absof****kinglutey awesome. the batteries stay for many many hours of research. i personally talked with the manufacturer and he was more than happy to help with my questions about integrating the array into my system already! 
15435 Perfect fit 
15436 Awesome 
15437 Fast service. Great price. Great product. Could not find anywhere in our town. Thank you 
15438 I really like the look and feel of this case. It isn t a perfect fit, there is a bit of room in the case, but with the screw at the bottom it holds nice and tight. 
15439 It is a good tripod. It s not as sturdy as it should be, a little too light weight. But overall, a decent purchase. 
15440 great product 
15441 I love this camera! I have a bigger digital camera but this is much easier to use. Digital zoom and can work with one hand. Bought this for a cruise where we can only use fixed lens. 
15442 Stand was great and very easy to put up and break down. Would definitely purchase for future backdrops again! 
15443 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
15444 Actually it gets no stars! Am returning it shortly. Can load no photos from any source! 
15445 Good bundle and lots of extras included. Camera is great. Phots could be larger. 
15446 easy to install and do the job... 
15447 Good cameras and I did drawback does not have a particular site cameras for surveillance of mobile 
15448 Easy to install. Very good product! It works Very well! No regrets!! 
15449 Exceeded my expectations. Literally plug-and-play and very easy to set up. No frustration at all. I was up and running before my wife finished cooking dinner. 
15450 The animal frames are actually longer than pictured, and the circle frames are too big for the film, so the polaroids would actually fall out... The frames look equally sized in this picture, but they re not in real life. Cute frames, but not super high quality. 
15451 Nice unit. Was easy to program the Radio and Access. Keep in mind this doesn t support rolling codes. 
15452 Very high quality and compares perfectly to the Canon version. Adds noticeable weight to the camera, but not in a bad way. 
15453 This is a little snug for our camera but it does work. 
15454 Its awsome 
15455 Works perfect, you don t have to worry about your phone drowning! 
15456 good 
15457 really love it 
15458 These disks work miracles when shooting outdoors, it really helps get softer light when you don t have helping hands! 
15459 Well made piece 
15460 what power 
15461 Not for phantom 3 as described 
15462 Wonderful purchase...speedy delivery! 
15463 Great Kit 
15464 Fit in my camera nicely. Would recommend to a friend. 
15465 Lens is great. Cover arrived damaged, one of the latches was broken. 
15466 Very good product Works perfectly. I use it almost everywhere I go. Stunning video quality And just a fraction of the price of a GoPro. Can t beat it!! 
15467 Going back! Could not get the unit to recognize the transformer after numerous battery changes and 4 adults trying to program it. 
15468 The remote works fine. It s cheap built but works. The only problem was the manual that came with it belongs to a different unit. 
15469 Fits perfect 
15470 Incredible lens for the price! 
15471 Great price for 2 basic reflector umbrellas 
15472 great product fast delivery 
15473 This filter does not fit my camera, a Canon PowerShot SX530 HS. My mistake? 
15474 Believe item does not show sufficient authenticity. Would flashing light indicator help? Present location of camera is not in well lit area. This probably a deficiency. 
15475 These work great! 
15476 It really is 50 inches long, It is very light weight and will hold a phone perfectly. Won t tip over it can adjust it to loom up but not down. This is a great tripod for a amazing price! Definitely buy this tripod! 
15477 This has the quality you would expect from a Canon lens. Built solid and works great! 
15478 fits everything and the extras too ! 
15479 This tripod is very sturdy. I was caught up in a windstorm and the tripod and camera blew down. No damage to the tripod. Very easy to adjust and seconds to unpack and set up. 
15480 Good and portable 
15481 This is the second one I ve bought. They are great to take on location, easily packed with other film gear, very compact and it does the job of holding various size flexfills. 
15482 Great price love it feels very professional 
15483 As described. 
15484 junk! had bought a pair similar to this at BB years ago and they worked great (lost them)......these are just junk....never worked at all 
15485 Is perfect 
15486 This item allowed me to use 12 old filters from another camera, at a great price. 
15487 For the price you can t beat these binoculars. Not a big fan of the eye piece, still trying to find a set of shade out cups for a better fit and less glare. The clarity is good, adjustment is easy. For the price they are awesome. 
15488 As described but not the best 
15489 Works fine with GoPro. Feels cheaper and lower quality than real GoPro batteries. 
15490 Exactly what I wanted at a great price! 
15491 Easy to install and the position of holes to align the adjusting screws are accurate. 
15492 Works as advertised. Not sure what I can say about it. 
15493 As advertised. 
15494 I bought this as a gift to compliment the GoPro Black which I bought for a friend. He loves it and will use it on his trip. 
15495 Great person, I hope you live forever 
15496 Works as expected with the Nikon D750! 
15497 Awesome! 
15498 Cute design but it ripped in half already after me just opening it for the first time... :( 
15499 Great flash for the price 
15500 ok 
15501 This is a great system for doing close up photography. Very versatile and I ve been getting fantastic results, Highly recommended! 
15502 Good quality camera that is plug and play on the Swann 7200 series recorders. Night vision is very good, with a reasonable infrared LED array. Day vision is outstanding with good color and good balance between light and dark (shadows). 
15503 Nice little tool for the GoPro, very handy. 
15504 Backpack is holding up well. I put a dji phantom 3 drone inside with accessories along with go pro and point and shoot. Everything fits well and is protected. Good quality pack, very comfortable to wear. 
15505 Great deal. All of these are great quality, and worked perfectly. Packaged really nice as well, the case is an added bonus. 
15506 Love it! Ita a bit weird looking when not zoomed especially with a visible frame shot. Macro part works great. Cool carry bag. 
15507 It s perfect and really liked it. 
15508 Recommend this product 
15509 For the price the camera can t be beat. Performed as expected and the accessories which Listed as 90 minutes get about 60 min out of it.came with it work seamless. 
15510 its ok 
15511 Very good no problem for me 
15512 Garbage, does not do anything it is supposed to do, especially take video. 
15513 Love got it for my step daughters bday it was a hit does everything she needs it to do! Got here late and I paid extra for two day was my only knock 
15514 These are great. They let me use less expensive 3rd party batteries.. 
15515 good product for the price 
15516 Essential. I much prefer the two handled model. 
15517 Works great! It has almost 3-5 seconds delay on the relay mode and it is black and white at night. 
15518 I find this cam suitable for my purposes. I found the connection from wall outlet to camera, and to camera to USB to transfer recordings tedious,but other than that,good for the price. 
15519 Quicks ship, great service, both items work great. 
15520 This item s color is NOT what is pictured. It s really really orange, not brown at all. 
15521 Fit my Nikon 52MM AF and AFS lenses perfectly. it is always a good Idea to keep a few of these on hand and at the price you would be foolish not to 
15522 Nice product! 
15523 The bag is very spacious, camera isn t very stable, but everything else is secure. I would purchase this item again if I had to. 
15524 Perfect replacement for the lens caps that I seem to set down and forget everywhere I go! 
15525 Works better than my old higher priced item. I like that it uses simple AA batteries also. 
15526 There are some scratches. But It is a good price. 
15527 Works well with my older analog PTZ cameras. 
15528 This battery is a lemon. I bought it for photographing my trip to Europe and it simply did not work. When I charge it .. The indicator shows it s fully charged in a few minutes , however when I put it in the camera it s dead. Serious letdown. 
15529 This have worked out great. I ve had them for about six months now and they re in great condition. Definitely a great price for such and excellent product 
15530 Too noisey 
15531 Great for astrophotography. 
15532 Great product 
15533 Prompt delivery. Superb product. 
15534 Love this lens! This and my 55mm f/1.8G are my favorite and most used! 
15535 Does not work. 
15536 This worked great at first, but the mask was uncomfortable after the second or third use. I developed a knot and a bruise between my eyes and couldn t use it half the time on my diving trip.Not worth the $50 in my opinion. 
15537 Gift 
15538 Great bundle. I ve used most of the mounts from this and have had zero issues. 
15539 Twice the life of the standard battery of my hf400. 
15540 great 
15541 Love it and a lot less that Canon 
15542 fast shipping and just as described. Fit perfectly thanks 
15543 Won t Auto-focus with the Tamron 70-200 2.8 on D5200 works with 55-300 albeit very poorly. 
15544 It broke right away and we cannot return it... ITs junk.. 
15545 Fantanstic 
15546 LoveIt. I can video a whole wedding none stop! 
15547 Very nice, high quality and crystal clear. They work great. You can buy these with confidence in the Vivitar name. 
15548 Batteries just don t hold charge very long. 
15549 good 
15550 I was unable to get this due to coupon code issues wish this program recognized that 
15551 Gets the job done. Perfect for a amateur like me. 
15552 Works great at a better price than GoPro... 
15553 They work well. 
15554 2 additional years for less than the already low $19.99 they charge? Sign me up. It s a no brainer that if you get a Pentax you get the extended coverage. No complaints. 
15555 My camera fits perfectly. Haven t had it under water though. Tough and durable. 
15556 I like it as I longed for this one, but it is tad tight when put it on. I had to be extra careful when putting it on and taking it off. 
15557 It holds up well to the Nikon brand. I have been very pleased. 
15558 Very nice camera, very easy to set up, clear picture, I recommend if you purchase to spend the time to familiarize yourself with the settings. Also you install a 64gb micro SD card instead of a 32gb card. The phone app works really good for this camera. 
15559 Tripod is actually very stable and well built. Holds my Canon EOS 70D with minimal effort, I can, for example, shoot time lapses and have no issues. Overall it s a good product and it comes for a decent price. 
15560 performs as expected, good quality 
15561 One of the engines broke 
15562 Nice camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
15563 Works well 
15564 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
15565 Worth my money!!! 😊😊 
15566 Works great but mostly displays in black & white in low light conditions indoors. 
15567 weak that all 
15568 hands free video recording 
15569 Eats batteries 
15570 like it 
15571 Great lens and arrived quickly too. Fit my Olympus perfectly! 
15572 It works as advertised. I don t like that the battery only lasts about 45 minutes. Oh well, it was made cheaply and in China. Nevertheless, it serves my needs. 
15573 IT DOES NOT FIT IN THE CF SLOT OF THE NIKON D4 BUT IT WORKS IN NIKON D3 
15574 Awesome! We use them as baby monitors in addition to an Angel Care monitor and love them!!! 
15575 Excellent quality and perfect fit, really helpful in my last beach vacations! 
15576 cute borders! and they aren t flimsy. happy with my purchase 
15577 Does what a polarizer is supposed to do 
15578 One of the accessory the go pro need 
15579 Works 
15580 I haven t used it long enough to really know it s reliability but, it was at a great price, it shipped quickly and with no hassle. 
15581 Worked good. Inexpensive. 
15582 Excellent quality, highly recommended 
15583 Works great. Very affordable. 
15584 This case is very sturdy and the pockets are ideal not only for GoPro accessories but for other cameras as well. The net zipper pocket can hold a lot of stuff as well! I highly recommend this case! 
15585 I like it and good for the price too 
15586 Perfectly adequate CPL. No detectable loss of sharpness. but some graduated loss of brightness. I recommend multiple exposures at different rotations to see the results. 
15587 sturdy, good quality and a decent camera bag, can fit flashes and well organize 
15588 This is one of the best filters on the market. The threading is cut beautifully so I do not get that grinding feeling when taking it on and off like I do with other brands. Coating is flawless. No splotches or inconsistencies like some other MultiCoat UV filters. 
15589 Terrible customer support. Extremely difficult to setup. 
15590 Works great. 
15591 Works well and it has a car charger, which my original one did not have. 
15592 The P900 has far exceeded my expectations!i use it literally everyday. I have taken over 3000 pictures since getting this camera and can t believe the quality and capability of this camera! I take pictures of the moon everyday as well as the sunrise/sunset. Couldn t be happier! 
15593 Okay fit and finish, but the scale starts from the wrong end! Only really useful if the scale starts from the center of the camera, so that numbers are transferable to other setups. 
15594 4 hours recording and am out of 64Gig memory and still have just under half the battery remaining. Baddest batteries on the planet!! 
15595 Good camera, as I expected! 
15596 Just as described. Works great on my Canon 5Dmkiii. 
15597 This is a well packaged collection of must have tools to keep all aspects of your camera clean. Love the carrying case since it allows me to get everything together and it does not take up much space in my camera bag. 
15598 Nice case but save yourself some money and go to Harbor Freight. Exact same case is $25 or less there. 
15599 Not bad... Attachments were all too loose to hold gopro in on position but if you leave the bolts in the attachments very tight, it should bend the fittings very so slightly and make it work. And nothing is stainless so think twice about getting anything wet 
15600 I had the tough job of organizing my parent s photos. This book was perfect. I ended up buying several because they had so many photos. But for the price, these are very nice photo albums. 
15601 seems to attach correcto to nikon g lenses the manual aperture ring it is not so good as in a nikon manual lens good as comparison of other cheaper brands, not excelent 
15602 I am OBSESSED!!!!! 
15603 A little bit big for the Speedlight SB-500, you have to push it hard to fit well so does not falls 
15604 Love this product. Now I have three batteries for my GoPro and never run out on a trip. 
15605 Awesome and works great!!! Super fast shipping! 
15606 Filter works good, Gets the job done and protects my lenses.,also the vendor was great. 
15607 Very good 
15608 Nikon P610 Charges with this cable which is what I really needed it for, but does not work for data transfer. Would be nice if it worked to download pictures but at least it got my camera functional again for cheap. 
15609 As promised, works fine. 
15610 Speed! This lets you fire one after another on your speedlites/flashes. No more changing out the batteries every 10 minutes on your speedlites. Doesn t fit 430 EX II 
15611 I have no problems with the Syma X8W. I am just a horrible pilot. It is fun to play with. 
15612 I love this camera. I ve owned a lot of Nikon cameras in my life and this beats them hands down. Great camera! 
15613 Images are skewed or cut off, will not shuffle photos properly 
15614 Fits my 6d perfectly. Looks even better on it than the original piece. Great purchase. 
15615 Very Nice product but does not work in low light if thats what your looking for. Simple to use! 
15616 It did not work when it came in. 
15617 Works very well. Very pleased. 
15618 I lost my previous set of filters I had purchased at a camera shop. These are the same make and quality at a much better price, and easier than hassling the drive and parking. 
15619 Awesome security system! no problems at all. good for the price as well. I have recommended to several family members as they wanted one for them home. 
15620 Amazing lens - I was using the kit lens prior on my FS100 and holy cow this made a huge difference. If you are debating on wether this is the lens to get for a true 35mm on your E mount camera - go for it. 
15621 Item is as described. Reasonably priced. Well packaged. Completely satisfied and works as advertised. 
15622 Not very useful, it covers the wheel button to where it is very difficult to use it. It doesn t really provide that much protection either. 
15623 Very nicely made & easy to adjust & use. Olympus tough cameras are heavier than gopros but I tried it walking and with the stability system in the camera it seems to be just fine. Working up the courage to take it surfing..... 
15624 Printer won t connect to my android phone what can I do. It won t let me enter the default password. I ve even reset/restarted the printer and my phone but still doesn t work. Can t rate right now if product isn t working. Need some help 
15625 lenes works as well I thought it would 
15626 Very good picture and works well. Reliability is an issue. One out of five I purchased was DOA. Another one died after a little more than a year. 
15627 I was very upset when I left my extra camera battery and charger behind on vacation. I thought getting replacements would be expensive. I found this on Amazon for a great price. It works just fine and you can t beat this price! 
15628 Fast delivery very happy 
15629 I purchased this item for a friend who is extremely happy with this quality product. 
15630 Nice camera. Fairly easy to navigate, decent imaging, raw photos. I took photos of the moon and with breathtaking results. Zoom works great. 
15631 Exactly as described. Was surprised this was actually the go pro brand when I got it. Woked great when I jumped off the rock in Hawaii. 
15632 Small, perfect for a GoPro. Even fits in my padded GoPro case. It s a small Tripod so read the dimensions before ordering. 
15633 Great!!! 
15634 have two nice & smooth 
15635 holds well with pentax k5 & sigma 150&500mm lens& grip 
15636 great 
15637 A very light weight option for when you are not fighting the elements. Works great on a selfie stick. 
15638 Does just what I wanted it to do, protect the camera. 
15639 Portable, easy to use, does the job perfectly - no complaints. 
15640 I love these. I have ordered them twice. I especially like the size as so many of the cloths are tiny. 
15641 Housing looks great compared to the original clear housing. I have a all black motorcycle helmet so this was really needed. 
15642 Easy to operate. Getting good quality video. Very pleased. 
15643 Works fine. In order to prevent &#34;memory error&#34;, format it as FAT 32 and make the SD card as Primary Disk. 32 GB SD memory works fine on this. 
15644 This is my fourth Breakthough Photography Filter. You won t beat the Quality for Twice the Price. 
15645 Fast shipping and correct product! 
15646 Great buy 
15647 the kit seems to be what i ordered and i have clean lens now 
15648 Very sturdy, quick and easy set up 
15649 I got a lot of electronic devises in this bag for my trip. The bag is made of very nice material and looks nice. 
15650 What s not to love. This lens is aweswome 
15651 I guess this product is ok. It barely holds my I phone 6 without it popping off. 
15652 Have had no issues. Looks exactly as pictured.Pictures are the quality you would expect from a polaroid. 
15653 Just what I wanted... :) 
15654 Um… I never bought this… Yet it showed up in my Review your purchases … Mystery! Nothing charged in my name or on my account. I m sure it s a quality product, though! :D 
15655 Excellent product! Just what I needed for my lenses for an overseas trip. Fast delivery (sooner than promised!) and great price. Definitely highly recommend. 
15656 Works as described. I use it for cleaning my computer screen. 
15657 Used for snorkeling with the Go Pro and worked like a charm 
15658 Great product. Very clean and professional packaging. I used 3rd party software to configure my monitor instead of the included one, but works amazing. Would recommend to others. 
15659 This is a total scam!!! The adapter wasn t working at all!!! No specified 8V 3A output! It is a cheap crappy product, don t buy it! 
15660 Nice 
15661 Great security system, easy to install and pics on camera of surveillance is amazingly clear! I m impressed! 
15662 A little thin but over all its perfect for what I am looking for. 
15663 great 
15664 This kit works very well with my Coolpix camera. It has all you need. 
15665 So far so good. No issues in water. Product seems very rugged. Battery life is iffy. Buy some extras and keep them on hand. 
15666 Works great and comes with a ton of mounting options 
15667 Not bad for the price. NOT DGI. Product says DJI Phantom Prop Guards. DJI Is oddly similar to DGI. Coincidence? Product was OK. Fits Phantom 2 fine. Seems sturdy enough. Fulfilled by Amazon so no waiting for them to come from China. Not bad for $7.50 including shipping. 
15668 Great for carrying filters and it also carries my wireless remote for the camera. A lot easier that using the camera bag. Everything is right there when I need it. 
15669 The kit es very good, the antenna need s upgrade beacouse the range is poor. 
15670 great lens 
15671 Great Product 
15672 Ok. Its a bit complicated to use 
15673 Excellent for use with Lazes Levels.Very light weight. 
15674 These shorts are so comfortable, I don t want to take them off lol. Perfect size, not too big/not too small! Will definitely be ordering from here again! 
15675 Did not work when it arrived. Junk. 
15676 Great build quality of this charger. It fully charges my gopro in about an hour. 
15677 Awesome ....you can never go wrong with GoPro.... 
15678 works great, even in low light 
15679 An excellent pair of binoculars well suited for all outdoor activities. 
15680 Good high quality case. Very compact if that is your main focus it s the right case for you. If you want storage for more accessories you ll want something larger. Very pleased! 
15681 it s hard to get the top mount level/flat to take pics. it s very light which is good for transport, but kind of cheap feeling 
15682 DO NOT BUY!!! Charge lasts for 2 minutes.. waste of money. 
15683 I finally got to open this package.I love it. It was fun to put together. However my package was missing the equipment tray. A bit disappointing. Now i have to call them and go through the process. who has the time for that 
15684 ok 
15685 its ok for beginners 
15686 I actually use this for Nintendo 2DS! Works great. 
15687 This product is so much better than previous frames we have tried. Delighted with it! 
15688 Huge backdrop! Easy to use. Has a rod pocket for easy and fast installation. Machine wash & dry. 
15689 nice packaging and product 
15690 Small tight fit 
15691 Cute and works as described. 
15692 It is great! My daughter uses it for her photo shoots, and loves it! 
15693 These lights are wonderful for my youtube videos!! And the price I paid was even better. 
15694 Very nice. Compact. 
15695 Contrast leaves a little to be desired during use in full sun light but otherwise a very nice product. 
15696 Bien 
15697 Really like it and works well 
15698 this camera was for my daughter who is doing a lot of photography. .She is really satisfied with the quality. 
15699 It s small printer which is great to print small photos. It s great product 
15700 Love it. 
15701 Didn t work for very long. Worked exactly 2 months....now they won t take it back...very disappointed. Would not buy this product again. 
15702 It s ok. 
15703 It is excellent, is beatiful camera. 
15704 works like a charm!! 
15705 Two batteries, and a charger with car and European adapters, what s not to like? 
15706 Beautiful camera in appearance and function. Bought this as a gift for my wife to use for her other hobby of oil painting. She loves it, I m a hero and she uses it every day. Everything a person needs comes in the package. 
15707 I like this lens, I just wish that it would come with an adapter. Instead of having to purchase one separately 
15708 I like it very much. The only problem I have is that the monipod unwise very easy and it starts lowering. They need to put instructions with it. It took me a while to figure how to make the monitor the correct height. 
15709 AMazing, Bright WHITE, theres no hint of yellow at all in this bulb. Worth the upgrade in bulbs :D 
15710 Great deal. quite bright and easy to use. Not yet on a shooting with it. Is quite light, still feels sturdy, barn doors sturdy as well, The light stand attachment is plastic as well, but feels strong with a large knob. All in all, I m happy with it. 
15711 Pictures were average 
15712 Great protection, cleverly designed 
15713 Great product and the fact that you can change the settings via the remote is absolutely essential. Only complaint is the battery doesnt last that long when using extensively. 
15714 Excellent 
15715 Great Camera! Everything was included as described. Order came on time 
15716 Works fine 
15717 prompt delivery, a very good value 
15718 It s been working for a long while now but is still a bit confusing when you want to upload pictures to it. 
15719 This is definitely my new favorite lens (I have a Canon 50mm 1.4 and a Canon 85mm 1.8) Here are some of the pictures I took with it in my last trip (with a 6D) https://www.facebook.com/sebas.cantillo/media_set?set=a.10152917884986568.1073741912.561506567&type=3&pnref=story 
15720 Too hard to get batteries back out had to use pliers 
15721 The strap inside doesn t actually fit the camera. 
15722 So many pieces...the camera is super. Haven t tried the wifi connections yet. But the camera is wonderful. Checked out prices, wouldn t of gotten such a good deal anywhere else. Glad I purchased it. 
15723 Everything arrived as promised. The attachment line works well to keep me from losing the lens cover. 
15724 A great camera. Very pleased with all features and the sharp resolutions of the pictures. 
15725 Great Fit, just what I needed! 
15726 Great 
15727 Factory parts, same as the one that came in the Phantom 2 V. box 
15728 I am just an amateur but it works great for my purposes. 
15729 I was afraid it would not fit well and may leak. This thing is awesome cant wait to go snorkeling. Mask is very soft and comfortable gopro fits on it like a charm. 
15730 Actually, it s a nice set but I can t compare to anything...still haven t used them. 
15731 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
15732 Too big for left side mount. Only fits right side. I decided to purchased Morros brand fits and both left and right. 
15733 excellent product. 
15734 Loved this! Took it to Cancun for all my activities and went to the highest pyramid of Cancun to some of the deepest sinkholes! Through saltwater and all. Definitely recommend it. Although it did break on a skateboarding accident I would buy again and recommend to anyone! 
15735 Good 
15736 very good 
15737 great little camera. 
15738 I only bought it because of the length. It s the only good thing. No TTL no matter what I do. I have another shorter TTL cable that works like a charm, so I know it s not my speedlights. Don t waste your money. 
15739 This charger worked perfectly as it charged up the new battery we ordered. I am very pleased with the performance with this charger. 
15740 Worked as expected. 
15741 Full charged batteries, put them in my GoPro, immediately after my GoPro showed 1/4 battery life. I returned and purchase the GoPro official battery charger and battery. 
15742 Great back with just the right amount of compartments for my gear. 
15743 Point and shoot 
15744 This is great so far. It s sturdy gets to a very good height. 
15745 Fabulous for the money! Secure, easy to adjust with very nice strong replacement hardware for the gopro. 
15746 Never have been able to get it to work. What s the secret? 
15747 I love my go pro, well made, durable. i use it all the time car,walk,bike, any where any time. if you are really active this is the camera for you 
15748 Not worth buying didn t do the job 
15749 Really helped us monitor our front door and our dog. Really came in handy when we got our puppy, saved a lot of anxiety. Still was pretty expensive for what it is, wifi drops often, and you need to buy the service really. 
15750 Solid. Has been reliable for a number of shoots. I would buy this again 
15751 Standard camera L-bracket works well 
15752 This is perfect if you are a blogger. It works perfect for food blogging and product reviews. I wished I had bought this sooner. The price is amazing, and it does so much for better lighting. 
15753 Not worth the money. Very flimsy and bends easily. 
15754 High quality extension poll. Haven t used it yet, but it looks to be very sturdy. Pole extends very smoothly! 
15755 Item came quickly. It works very well. It is easier to travel with since one does not need a cord with it. 
15756 Great deal! Just make sure that you hold the top of your camera when taking off the lens because some people have ripped peaces of the camera off! 
15757 Perfect item to add to your kit bag. I will use for wild life shots primarily and selfie family photos as well. 
15758 Good stuff 
15759 nice 
15760 Nice to have protection from dirt & dust. I lost original shortly after getting the camera. Will try to be more careful with this one. 
15761 This thing never dies. I never had to replace anything. 
15762 worked great 
15763 Very easy to put together due to the clear cut instructions on the enclosed video. This is not a flimsy product, it is well made. Will be using the MyStudio MS20 for my photography needs! 
15764 I always need extra batteries for weddings and this was a great price for a back up battery. It also lasts a long time! 
15765 Doesn t fit around the display very well. Especially by the flash button. 
15766 A must have for new flyers. Will save you from a crash. 
15767 Great product. Very good quality. I only wished it come with a rope or some kind of handle to easily carry it. For the rest, it has enough space and certainly will keep the GoPro save. 
15768 Great for party favors. Kids loved them! 
15769 yes I feel this is a excellent / for the money is great and I love it and I would recommend it to other people 
15770 Beware--These are not &#34;Sony Cyber-shot Digital Camera&#34; batteries! These are AA batteries and will work, but are not as advertised. Look closely and you will see they are made by &#34;Synergy&#34; in China! Misleading description and nothing special about them! 
15771 Fits perfectly using the 39mm filter threads on the lens, or on a threaded filter. Color matches very well to the standard Lecia lenses. A good deal, and MUCH less expensive than the lens maker brands. 
15772 instructions say frame the pic but there isnt even an opening (view finder) to see where it s aiming. further, the battery lasts not even a week. not holds a charge for a week, fails within a week. 
15773 Perfect for CANON EOS M3 
15774 The picture quality is very good both on the computer and the mobile app. night vision is also ok, this camera wont disappoint any budding geek like myself 
15775 I bought this pack with low expectation. I just want to try out ND filters. I m sure if I like them and start using them a lot I will upgrade to a set of nice quality, glass ones. But these are perfect to learn on for now. 
15776 very good I love it. 
15777 A must for serious lighting in the field for control and creativity. 
15778 I got it and charged it over night then it only worked for an hour then stop charging 
15779 Great tripod. works just at good as my $400 tripod. Wish I bought this first. 
15780 excellent item, solved my problem 
15781 nice 
15782 This battery performs as specified, and is good for 2000-plus photos with my Canon 70D. 
15783 easy setup to the wink system 
15784 The product was received as displayed and in a timely manner. 
15785 Compact yet roomy enough for all the essentials. We travel a lot and this is just what I was looking for to keep my gear safe yet easy to access. 
15786 It arrived a little later than expected. For the price it s definitely worth it although it falls off sometimes by itself. This is a great product although the original for my canon camera was much better 
15787 I love it! 
15788 Best cam in market for action sports, and it has so many accessories which make it the best! the only concern that it s so expensive I guess and you might need more than one GoPro to make a good videos.! 
15789 excellent 
15790 great seller - delivered as promised! 
15791 Perfect for a Canon digital & just what is needed. Nice case! 
15792 I would recommend any product made by this company. Their products are fantastic and the prices can t be beat. High quality merchandise and prompt service. When ever I want to purchase something for my Nikon I go to them first... 
15793 Excelent product 
15794 Good deal for the price ,will recommend it to anyone looking at buying a camera for a decent price. 
15795 The lens filter arrived in perfect condition. 
15796 Camera works real good, had a technical issue, but Walter worked it out fro me. 
15797 Works right out of the box when you add a photo source Looks great Nice Product with lots of extra features like music and video!! 
15798 Works as its description. Crystal clean video, fast setting, strong WiFi signal.! Great companion with Synology Surveillance Station! 
15799 This stand works fantastic on my desk. It does everything I hoped for at a great price. Easy to figure out without instructions. Very sturdy and light weight. Very versatile and allows you to more easily accommodate your creativity too. 
15800 Not very loud at all :( disappointing!!!! 
15801 Great product cleans glasses,computers,tv. I had a question and they answered in hours. Cloths are placed everywhere i need them. 
15802 Just one word........awesome! 
15803 wife bought this for me last xmas. works fine for it s purpose. had some problems with the &#34;water proof&#34; case. took it into the ocean and had some leaking. camera stopped working for about 24hrs. used camera with chest harness on a 5k fun run and worked within standards. 
15804 Good deal 
15805 cant go wrong for the price. 
15806 Love this Drone. Kind of wish I had paid a few more bucks and got the pro version, but this one still takes great video. I would suggest getting an extra battery though. 
15807 This is an update to my original review...Ritz did send the items that were missing (lens filters and another freebie instead of the remote). All replacements were Polarid brand. I was very satisfied. 
15808 Nice product and fast shipping 
15809 Recommended! 
15810 just what I was looking more. Exceeded my expectations. 
15811 Fast shipping, order 100% accurate, Thanks! 
15812 A great product. I bought it for a relative and he loved it. He uses it all the time and it still works great. You can see things clearly. 
15813 Great product to use with my GoPro. We needed something to use while on our ATVs. 
15814 Great bundle and great device. No issues at all. 
15815 The product was NINB but the buttons on the remote had scratches. Other than that everything works fine. 
15816 Broke/Fell apart within literally 30 seconds. The build quality was horrible. 
15817 Love this camera. It was recommended to me from a photographer friend as a good lower price range camera to start taking professional looking pictures with. It takes great sports shots and beautiful up close pics too. The bundle it came with had lots of great extra s too. 
15818 Light weight and durable! Works great with a GoPro! 
15819 ❤️ Them so cute 
15820 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
15821 GOOD PRICE AND PRODUCT 
15822 Great price. 
15823 The battery seems to be working correctly. The battery casing was coming apart when we opened the package but I super glued it and it seems to be holding so far. 
15824 The ball joint swivel does not lock very well, and the legs don t bend out evenly, some legs bend more and cause it to be uneven. 
15825 C6721625 - AROO4273 - Thank you Henry for your help - very knowledgeable about the camera I purchased. 
15826 Just right! 
15827 not perfectly fit but does its job. 
15828 These lenses have allowed me to take great photos with minimal effort using a cell phone! Highly recommended. 
15829 Great bag for the video camera 
15830 very useful stick. great for GoPro and phone and camera. I ll bring it to europe with me 
15831 photos developed great, really nice product 
15832 good tool works for me 
15833 Batteries.stay charged battery charger is light weight and can fit in your pocket. If you need an extra or lost yours Great set for the price 
15834 Had a bad experience. I will stay with the 70-200 2.8 is VERSION 1 
15835 does not charge other gopro batteries. 
15836 Worked perfect with my Phantom 2. 
15837 very easy to install and it looks nice having a new eyecup on my Nikon D90. 
15838 looks good 
15839 This camera is great and reasonable price for many components and camera. Also, it is proper to beginners who don t have deep knowledge about camera. 
15840 Awesome camera for an awesome price!!! The quality is unbelievable! I love the fact that the cam has a speakerphone, so I can talk to my dog when I m not home. Super quick five minute set up, and you re ready to go. Awesome awesome awesome!!!! 
15841 Good product. Everything as promised. 
15842 Best speed lite I have ever had! Was very user friendly! 
15843 Okay 
15844 it works well 
15845 Works as needed for extra power at a reasonable cost. A good buy. 
15846 Surprisingly good quality for the price. 
15847 Love it it s isn t really big but it is great so you can have all your pics in one place 
15848 It was easy to figure out, Now I can enjoy video chatting with my mom much better that putting it on top of the computer. 
15849 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works with camera as described. 
15850 You get what you pay for, sure there s better selections. But this works for me during a dive or snorkeling. 
15851 ok, but very small. 
15852 Pretty good for the price. I usually take filters off when photographing but put them back on for protection. Polarizer is okay 
15853 This arm supports my 7&#34; ikan monitor very well. If your rig s rails are already crowded, you can detach the arm from rail support and connect to any 1/4&#34; thread. For me, I connect it straight to the BMPCC Smallrig cage and hang off to the side. 
15854 none 
15855 Great product for doing video recording. 
15856 Great item!!! Helped me during E3 2015 
15857 great size of case to fit into a backpack!!! 
15858 Fast shipment. Easy to install..... As advertised 
15859 Fast and perfect.. Thanks 
15860 Set up was so easy. The image quality is great. And the remote use via iPhone is very good. We re very happy with the Nest Cam. 
15861 THis has allowed us to scan in pictures that could have been lost forever from times of our childhood. 
15862 A little pricey, but works as designed. 
15863 Perfectly fits the DJI Phantom 3 PQ Drone. Its the safest way to transport our Drone. 
15864 Pouches are excellent. Just buy em, you won t be disappointed. 
15865 Does not work well at all. 
15866 Much more power than battery that came with camera. 
15867 I have an FD 50mm 1.4 lens whose aperature will not open all the way with this adapter. There is an adjustment on the lens that will allow me to fully open the lens manually but then the adapter won t fit. Frustrated... 
15868 Excelente 
15869 Great case,the postage was outrageous 
15870 Cool! 
15871 Cool 
15872 Small enough to keep in my truck, so I can use when I really need it. I filled mine with rice, and it provides a good, stable rest for my DSLR and telephoto. 
15873 Nikon lens have a good performance, i love take pictures to distance that allow show a close up with wide background scenery. the delivery was on the provided time 
15874 Stronger then most. Can hold larger cams. 
15875 A great camera! The accessories included are pretty cheap except for the digital cards, but I have no complaints. Thanks Amazon and The Imaging World. j 
15876 This camera is amazing, I made wonderful pics under water , I recommend for everyone, and enyoy you memories en your pics 
15877 Great quadcopter, I was practicing using it in my house, and it was very easy to control. Took it outside, you can t tell which way is forward when it s high up in the sky. It flew away, out of range and I never saw it again! 
15878 It rocks 
15879 The video quality is poor. It looks like I am looking at a Sonogram. I am opting to rent a video line from Home Depot 
15880 I like it 
15881 The battery works perfect. I didn t have any fitment issues like some of the reviews I ve read. Definitely recommend the product for the price 
15882 The shipping was fast and the dedication from Amcrest to provide help and satisfy your needs is extremely nice. As for the product itself, the camera quality is really good, the image is nice and clear. The installation and setting it up and getting everything functioning was also insanely easy. 
15883 Very nice camera. It works well for what I use it for, it does some nice close ups but you got to be patient and wait for it to focus to get great photos, glad I bought it. 
15884 This is a great little quad. It s easy to set up and fly. For a beginner, I would recommend buying a crash set, with the prop guards, to go with the quad. 
15885 This is a good replacement part, not quite as solid as the Nikon hood but it does the job. 
15886 Excellent. 
15887 This is the perfect little light for the job. I needed some indoor pictures of a two-week-old baby. It is just the right light for the job. 
15888 Awesome little compact for my Camera. I didn t really use the solution or tri pod though at all needed the charger and spare battery which work great. 
15889 they work 
15890 Great and affordable bundle for the GoPro! Completely worth the money. However, it didn t come with instructions but if you just check out the GoPro website it is easy to figure out how to assemble everything. 
15891 I haven`t yet tried the audio, so...nothing to say there,others all ok 
15892 This little beauty adds more ways to enjoy my Go Pro camera. I clip it onto my backpack strap and I can instantly record anything I want. It s also very inexpensive and easy to use. 
15893 great 
15894 Not exactly what I was looking for but works well 
15895 Can be a little finicky and takes a long time to boot up, also does not find my wifi internet source on first try, but once it is up an going... This thing is a real gem. Better than any other streaming device I have used. 
15896 very good 
15897 If I was home I could connect but not 10 miles away sorry I had to return product. 
15898 On time, very good 
15899 Great deal! 
15900 I like the look of film 
15901 Good selection of mounts at a great price. 
15902 Great piece of hardware especially for the price. Using two of these to support an SB900 and a SB700 
15903 Still the best of the best 
15904 great camera 
15905 If you have a nex-5 you need this view finder. It takes your camera and your pictures to a whole new level 
15906 Works great, just what I needed for my camera. The batteries stay charged for a long while and I take my camera on the road so it s very important. 
15907 Amazing, just love it 
15908 Works as advertised. 
15909 Give it to my grandparents, they like it. 
15910 Works great looks great 
15911 good 
15912 ok 
15913 Great 
15914 it s ok 
15915 It s what I expected. 
15916 Amazing Lamp & Price! Light is bright and is a great investment for my job! Lighting is important for my studio and this just did the trick! 
15917 GOOD. 
15918 My students are really interested in the solar system and in reviews, this product, albeit a tad expensive, looked the best. We were not disappointed! Large, easy to assemble, looks amazing. 
15919 Had it for less than a month and already the wifi won t work and the car won t charge (the light doesn t turn on when charger is connected). I need to check if there is a warranty on this thing. 
15920 exactly what i was looking for. Helps organize everything and more. GoPro Hero 3 black edition. 
15921 Great fit! 
15922 Good protection and lightweight. The cover doesn t come with hardware to connect to strap when removed so you either have to hold it or place it down while taking pictures. There is a material loop which I was able to connect to strap with a binder ring. 
15923 I Love this little camera. It meets or exceeds all expectations 
15924 Got this for my gopro hero 4 and it works perfect. Awesome little case and we ll built and great quality 
15925 Great product from a great seller 
15926 just what my camera needed,, 
15927 Light works great. Came with easy to read instructions. Took a couple tries to get it to work, but once I got it. it was easy. 
15928 A great lense!! I have only used it a couple of times but definitely one lense I will take with me everywhere! 
15929 Awesome case. Highly recommended!!! 
15930 works perfectly 
15931 Great glass for the money. Can t beat Vortex for quality versus price point. 
15932 This is a great little camera! I like going to the Pacific Northwest rainforests so it is nice to have this along and not need to work about it getting wet. Takes awesome pictures too. 
15933 This is the worst product I ever bought Colors are not coming out after cleanning them twice it starts printing and after half a page it goes back to give horrible results 
15934 I purchased this as a gift to my husband for his birthday. He loves the camera. It also has a great video function, and records nice, clear videos. I would buy this product again for myself. 
15935 It s ok at best 
15936 Works great. 
15937 Good product. 
15938 Super fast delivery, product is awesome and works great. 
15939 Easy to install. Works as promised. 
15940 Awesome ! 
15941 Can t wait to get mine. The reviews sound great. Best part, I was concerned of it fitting my Sony A100, as it is not listed. But, one review was of the A100. It s on my wish list, can t wait. 
15942 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
15943 Fit perfectly, are easy to use, great price, and there are three of them! Can t beat that! 
15944 Worked as advertised. 
15945 Battery runs down too quickly. Does not record very much 
15946 worked great right out of the box 
15947 exactly match my tripod, official product! 
15948 We really love the images this camera records. Works perfectly now that it is setup. We mounted in the kids room and the image quality is fantastic during daytime or night time. It is nice to be able to control it remotely. Now we can get images anywhere we go. 
15949 Super handy 
15950 This is just the cord that I needed. My original is packed away in a POD and I wasn t able to charge my camera. Am now back in business. Thanks for the prompt service and perfect product. 
15951 Very pleased with quality and ease of use 
15952 Good! 
15953 I ve only been using it for a couple weeks, but it seems to work as advertised. Very happy at this point. I like the feature where it will recorder over the oldest videos if the disc is full. 
15954 Love this battery! They will run a lot longer than the OEM batteries which is important when you re right in the middle of taking pictures. 
15955 Just eh......I don t like how the plastic insert that holds the camera stuff keeps coming out. It is just over priced. The top section won t stay closed. I mean it works......but I wish I got something else. 
15956 It has a very bad resolution and it is very difficult to add or delete pictures. It is definitely not worth the money 
15957 I m reasonably happy with these batteries. I knew they would not match the OEM battery in usage time. 
15958 Returned after I got it. The picture quality was bad. 
15959 I have used these a few times. Like them a lot. Great for getting close up pictures without having to buy macro lens. 
15960 I m a professional videographer who routinely gets through an entire day of shooting on just one charge with this battery. I keep the OEM battery in reserve. 
15961 Have only used in the pool but works well. Wish the lanyard had its own mount hole but not a deal breaker. A low cost insurance policy when filming in and around water. 
15962 Great product. Use it for cleaning eyeglasses. They are larger than typical cloth used for glasses which makes it easier to use. 
15963 perfect! 
15964 Great Product 
15965 Works great 
15966 Great camera and the pictures come out awesome. 
15967 easy to fly,but battery does not last 5 min 
15968 Fits tight and keeps debris off the lens. It does not touch the lens surface when installed. I wish it had a lip so it would restrict how far it could be inserted. 
15969 Worked Great!!!! No fog like other cases. I went under about 13 feet without any problems. Clear pictures and all look amazing! Also, it float, so you can just put put the strap around your arm when swimming. 
15970 Excellent !! 
15971 Still learning how to use this. My brother loves his just like it. 
15972 Quick shipping, just as described. 
15973 Great lens. I use this lens for just about everything. The focus ring could be a little smoother as it tends to jump out sick when using the manual setting. Buy yourself a lens band, or a broccoli rubber band because it s weight causes constant lens extension... 
15974 VERY GOOD. 
15975 They made it right... a mishap corrected Thank you ! 
15976 Works really well...I just wish it came in better packaging so I could store it more easily. 
15977 fun and stylish 
15978 Makes noise while setting the focus, even in manual mode. Unfortunately, makes it impossible to record sound on the camera. 
15979 Internal charger in Kodak PlaySport bit the dust so found this as the replacement. Brought my PlaySport back to life in short order. 
15980 A fantastic flash at a fraction of the cost of the top brands. A solid buy for any photographer. 
15981 Awesome more fun than I deserve!! 
15982 perfect 
15983 Fits and works well. Panasonic should include this adapter as part of the camera rather than selling this as an accessory (since I believe that this was a faulty design at the beginning) 
15984 Can t beat the price 
15985 This bundle was actually cheaper than the just the price of the camera alone on another website; got a lot of extra stuff for a lower price. 
15986 Great 
15987 Finally got to try it, due to broken arm. Not what I expected. Don t know about t lens & was looking for more of a close up view. 
15988 great price/original nikon battery 
15989 not connected with wifi 
15990 I tried it with a37 and a65. Fits well, works fine, no problems, so far. Price was good, free shipment, and came fast. 
15991 This cord did not work and I was not able to return it 
15992 Good quality product. I recommend. 
15993 GPS is hard to use. Needs more match markings for barrel. 
15994 Ty 
15995 Love this! Seems to be very high quality, and for the price, it can t be beat compared to GoPro branded accessories! It has a VERY strong clamp, and the neck is very bendable. I m not sure why anyone would spend the extra money on GoPro brand stuff! 
15996 I am in love with this camera and my kid finds it very fun too. 
15997 Just fine 
15998 Works as advertized and certainly beats the high price of true Panasonic batteries. 
15999 purchased in 2010 for a Lumix and its a perfect fit and rigid 
16000 These provide good protection for the front lens element. I use Xume magnetic adapters, so I can have them on and off in less than a second. 
16001 Great cameras, work real good and clear. 
16002 Good case, protects your camera, and it looks chic and stylish 
16003 The best! 
16004 It s a great cam!! 
16005 So vintage and unique. The snaps on the back (the cover flap) come off too easily though. I am keeping it because it has such a warm caramel color to it! 
16006 Works as needed and is well made, what else is there to say? 
16007 Worked great in Romania! 
16008 best deal for the money 
16009 Very effective lens cleaning cloths. 6&#34;x7&#34; size is good and they are a good value as well. 
16010 Strong, solid, well made. I use them in my kit to hold my flashpoint streak lights, even at 90 degrees on a boom arm they are solid. 
16011 Good! 
16012 Good quality 
16013 This was a cheap replacement for an existing system. Q-See is fine for the home grade quality surveillance systems. Easy to set up and has a mobile app. Will work with most bnc cameras. 
16014 just received it ,but so for I like it 
16015 Absolutely outstanding. 
16016 This is a great product and works great with my GoPro, would definitely recommend this product and have had nothing, but a good experience when using it on my vacation. Seller was great and package arrived on time, as described. 
16017 Works like a charm 
16018 Great 
16019 Saved the day when the rain came!! Really easy to put on and coud keep taking pictures. Make sure you can the Pro version as it is the one with the velcro closure at the bottom. 
16020 great product for charging three GoPro batteries at one time. 
16021 Good product n easy to set up even if you are not an expert 
16022 Solid product. I was surprised at the size. This is a large case. I ll attach it to the outside of my camera bag. However it s designed to protect really expensive filters and protection matters. I have to get use to the size 
16023 Went windsurfing with it, and i didnt worry at all about my phone! It is an iphone 5c and I let it float with no problem. 
16024 Quite inexpensive and it delivers. I am surprised at how good the images are it produces. I would not hesitate to use if for professional applications. And the macro feature is very good too. I would recommend this lens to anyone. Russ 
16025 Great Tripod keeps my camera in place especially when I do portrait shots. Nice and lightweight easy to handle. 
16026 Henry at Foscam did an excellent job in assisting me with setting up my new cameras. He was very patient, methodical and explain what he was doing. I have had foscam cameras for 3 years now and have never had a problem with them. 
16027 Works great in camera, batteries charge up and camera works fine, again. 
16028 Received as described and promptly! Good quality and price. 
16029 It fits and all but it would be so much better if it was reversible for storage. 
16030 For the price you cant go wrong. This gives you the details you re looking for. 
16031 Yes it was used and had all the stuff, but it failed to operate. The code it was throwing was researchable on Google, but the fix listed didn t last. Sent it back for a refund. 
16032 No issues with the product or delivery 
16033 Perfect fit for my newest Canon Camera 
16034 Flys really good. Just wish it had more flight time 
16035 I m very pleased in how fast I received my order, I ordered the camera on Sunday and had it Tuesday morning, as we were leaving for vacation in Cancun and I wanted to use the camera under water. I ve played with the camera and so far so good. 
16036 Very good 
16037 Good quality camera for the price I wasn t expecting such a good picture I would buy again 
16038 Great bang for the buck. Works great. 
16039 Absolutely LOVE this thing. It s so cute and compact and easy to use. I ve already gone through most of the film I ve bought. I m going to use this for a guest book at my wedding, so people can include a picture in there &#34;words of advice&#34;. 
16040 So Far so good. Cloths are big, and I have enough for all my glasses and sunglasses to last for a couple of years! 
16041 Handy little wrist strap. I use it for my Canon G12. 
16042 So far it has worked well and the price was definitely a bonus for something of this quality. 
16043 Kind of big but its a great flash. I was very nervous to purchase, but glad I did. I use the front led light for nightlife photos. Helps a great deal! 
16044 The color,contrast and sharpness are great, I love how closeup it will focus. Feels solid, I have it attached to my OMD EM5 II - it seemed a little heavy and stressing my right-hand, so I purchased the optional grip and now it feels much better. 
16045 camera has great color and clarity 
16046 Works great, just the accessory needed 
16047 Works well for my small business. I even have one outside for back door security. 
16048 The result is awesome. Plain and simple. Is it crazy harsh light? Yes. It s continuous lighting so of course looking at the sun will result in some temporary blindness. Am I slightly exaggerating? Yes. See the picture :) 
16049 Love this frame, it is easy to use and easy to set up and has wonderful clarity. I wouldn t buy any other brand. 
16050 Love it! :) 
16051 More of a colorful child s toy than a useful instrument. NO focus after a literal few feet. They are ALL like this. WASTE NOT your monsy. Worthless as well in warm weather. 
16052 I have barely began to use the lens. So far excellent. 
16053 Item fits on my two lenses, works well. 
16054 just what I need fo macro photos 
16055 Smelly when I first got them, but I put them on my porch for a week or so and smell is gone. 
16056 Its fun, you get exactly what you expected, a different way to use your DSLR, also you get 3 macro, so you dont need to buy another product to play with. You also need to use it in lighten places, and on manual. Thats all you need to know. 
16057 Don t buy this. I am not able to close my screen completely after applying this. It s not fit for the d5300. Now this company wants me to explain the way I installed a screen guard. It s really pathetic. 
16058 This cage DOES NOT fit the a7rii. The battery door does not line up and the top dial is severely blocked. Good build quality however, just wish it fit like it claimed to. 
16059 Light work awesomely!! Have to take pics for my business website and boy do they light up!! Received them as expected, great packaging too! 
16060 Camera takes very nice pics. This is a very reasonable bundle. 
16061 great item,you can charge a battery. instead of using you camera. fast charging good battery too.great addition to your cam setup. 
16062 Honestly, spend the money and buy a quality UV filter. This one left my images all very fuzzy and streaky. I ended up taking it off my lens and the images were 10 times sharper. 
16063 did not come with a power supply. other customers said the same thing AFTER i purchased. o well. it is going back! 
16064 nice product 
16065 was exactly what I wanted. Worked perfectly on the device 
16066 Fast shipping great value everything you need to get started 
16067 Awesome camera works perfect and its easy to use 
16068 Great for viewing sun spots. Was hoping to see more than just sun spots, but maybe I m not using it correctly. Not sure if it s possible to see sun flares or other exciting events. 
16069 Bought the rotary slide tray,as I had a Sawyer slide projector given to me,but had no slide trays. The slide tray was given,along with the projector,to my relatives. And yes the slide tray was in perfect condition. 
16070 Basically no useable directions, and not user friendly at all. I can t even tell if this thing is broken or if I m not using it right. Definitely don t waste your money. 
16071 Battery works fine. Doesn t seem to last as long as stock battery. Still a good a cheap alternative. 
16072 NEED TO SEND BACK A $200 BATTERY THAT DOESNT WORK 64 GB MEMORY CARD DOESNT WORK EVERY THING ELSE WORKS 
16073 Clearer at night than day. Night vision is outstanding. Camera is bigfer that what was expected but very happy with it. 
16074 Gift for my mom and it works great. 
16075 poor quality. top button doesn t go all the way in. hinge is very poor quality. comes off so easy. 
16076 never worked. in trash it goes 
16077 best value I have been able to find. 
16078 It s an attractive bag but it s not constructed as well as I had anticipated. 
16079 incredible offer! 
16080 I was very happy with my purchase. Had a trip coming up when I ordered it, and I came in very handy, having extra charger and batteries. 
16081 Really Good !!!! 
16082 the best deal in cameras ever ! i own two and want more. 
16083 easy to hook up well made 
16084 These rear lens caps fit the lenses snugly and are the same quality as the Sony covers received with other lenses. I m purchased these go to on the Sony 28mm f2 lens which did not come with a cap. 
16085 Like it a lot, but wish I had spent the additional $$$ to get the 55-300mm instead. Probably would have been worth the money in the long run. 
16086 I believe in good metal screw-in lens caps. They stay on and are more difficult to lose. I ve used these since the late 1960s. 
16087 does what I wanted 
16088 Extremely pleased with the product. Arrived just in time for my trip to Southern California where there is just too much light. The filter did an amazing job in places like Palm Springs, Joshua Tree National Park and the Salton Sea. 
16089 This id the perfect screen protector for the Nikon D5300. Buy iy and you will like the protection it gives the display. Good price also. 
16090 Thank you, splendid item! 
16091 Very Nice will enjoy 
16092 it is goood!! 
16093 Camera came highly rated and did not disappoint. The only drawback was no manual but I knew that beforehand 
16094 Super sharp, not too heavy. Only thing missing is IS and anyone who buys this goes in with eyes open, so there s really not much to complain about. 
16095 I purchased the 2.5 amp version at the same time I purchased my 8&#34; Schmidt-Cassegrain and realized that the power was not sufficient. I purchased this supply subsequently. I like the addition of the screw connector on this model. 
16096 Canera excellent some of the accessories are of questionable quality but time will tell. 
16097 Pretty neat device with remote controlled pan and tilt. I used it while I was on vacation to look around the house and it worked pretty well in day and night. 
16098 I was unable to get the motion detection to work properly, despite moving the cameras to many different locations, and trying front-on and sideways motions in front of it. I returned the package to Amazon. 
16099 Does a good job of keeping on my shoulder. Not sure if much more comfortable than the wide canvas strap bag already has, though. 
16100 Love the boarders... 
16101 LUUUUUUUUVED IT!!!!!!! 
16102 Very well made product. Good value. 
16103 Great deal! 
16104 No problem at all. Meets all expectations. 
16105 Very Good Product 
16106 Met my expectation.and it s works good on my camera. Described as I received the right product. 
16107 Got camera without Instruction Manual in English. Please send me an Manual in English language. Regards, B. Jezdic 
16108 I was tired of the pantry light with a pull chain and this wireless wall switch was the perfect solution. It was easy to install and works perfectly. I love it and would definitely recommend this item to anyone with a need for it. 
16109 Nice camera and very easy set up. Works as well as expected. I will purchase more of these. 
16110 does not tighten properly. falls off camera every now and then. one shoe that does not have a stop fitted,has a tendency to have the product mounted to it,come off. 
16111 Thicker than your average Compact flash beware if your device has strict dimensions as mine did. 
16112 took a moment to understand the new lens attaches directly to the old lens not directly to the camera. Works well and does improve the zoom. 
16113 Great binoculars. This is the second pair I ordered. Very easy to adjust and the magnificatiuon is great. 
16114 Best Camera I have EVER had! Superb. Small, fit in small crossbody purse I had at Disney...and the photos are great. Easy to use and better Zoom than my previous &#34;Big&#34; camera. Will never buy anything but Samsung again! 
16115 Excellente item, excellent quality! 
16116 Excellent. No trouble staying on my D750 like the original failed to do, and seemingly the same style and material. 
16117 Works perfectly 
16118 pics arnt Fantastic, but there good 
16119 Love it! Great lens 
16120 Works well 
16121 Very good filter. 
16122 Does the job, love that camera! 
16123 Thanks 
16124 It works perfect. 
16125 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
16126 I bought this as a gift for my fianc&eacute;. Last summer I purchased the mini neo instax camera for his birthdays. I thought this would be a nice accompaniment. He absolutely loves it, and it works remarkably well. 
16127 Hard to find item. Glad to get it at a good price! 
16128 it s like a camera pillow for your eye hole. 
16129 Fit well on my gopro hero 4 silver. Everything I expected and will try them diving soon. 
16130 rec d as promised and as advertised 
16131 It is hard to rate this item since the battery that came with the camera was defective ( would not hold a charge ) and I could not replace the camera. 
16132 LENS produces excellent IQ. Priced very reasonable. Iwould buy it again. 
16133 awesome you just have to be gentle with it or it will possibly break 
16134 Great product! Gave as a gift , used onstantly! 
16135 Just what was needed for trips. 
16136 This item works fine as a screw-in lens hood, except that it only adds about 7/8&#34; out from the threads, not really much shading. Mine actually looks skinny relative to the one pictured. 
16137 Very nice camera. I really love it. Now if I can learn to use it a little better. 
16138 Worked very well! 
16139 Ok, fits well, looks nice. The unit I got had a mark down the middle. Looked like it had been scored by a box or box cutter when shipped. Arrived in time for our trip and looked good while protecting the camera. 
16140 The umbrellas that come with this are decent but the rest of the kit just screamed super cheap. 
16141 Quick response and a gfood product.Favorably priced. 
16142 Very Cheap And Defective. 
16143 too small for my canon 100-400 lens and camera shame, it was nicely made 
16144 Very good quality and versatile. 
16145 Great accessory especially for longer shoots. Slight learning curve but worth it! Keeps weight balanced and distributed to both arms! Definitely helps with arm fatigue!!! Been using it with my canon 6d. Its Small, lightweight and well constructed! 
16146 Awesome pair of binoculars for the price. Super clear, easy to hold and focus. Great buy. 
16147 Very satisfied with results of this product as of today. Received an excellent support from vendor with a couple of issues with installation. I would buy it again. 
16148 The battery charger arrived in no time at all! It works great and better than the original charger. Just in time for my vacation pictures. Thanks so much for the timely delivery! 
16149 good quality, exactly what i expected 
16150 This case carries all of my GoPro equipment. I love the color and material. Very handy when going on trips. 
16151 great camera and easy purchase 
16152 It is working like a charm on slides from the 60 s & 70 s! 
16153 I love this, it has everything I need until I can find the bag with all my accessories. 
16154 love this camera 
16155 Different from what is described and from the product pictures; mind did not have the white rubber grip stripes. Judging by other reviews, its seems that there are many version of this product. 
16156 Works great! 
16157 Very nice camera, all I wanted and more. 
16158 This thing is AWESOME! 
16159 good product for my go pro a real must at times. Thanks!! 
16160 Total JUNK!! Do Not Buy!! It would not connect to wireless router plus when you finally have the camera hooked up through wire but then screen shows up black no pictures!! 
16161 good 
16162 nice toy, impractical. Better get rx100 and connect it to phone 
16163 Love this little set up, I ve had it since 2011, I use it often and take it out on location too! 
16164 Fits my neewer vk750ii speedlight, a little loose but it will work. 
16165 Everything it said, everything works great 
16166 I bought this camera to peek in on my cats when away. It worked just fine. I didn t get the model that zoomed but if I were to purchase another I would get that feature. Good picture, easy to install and view. 
16167 This doesn t fit the Neewer flash at all. It s too small. The description says it will, but it s too small, even after trying to bend/shape it a bit 
16168 Poor quality and did not work effectively. 
16169 love it perfect 
16170 Perfect 
16171 Worked like a charm 
16172 I use these cloths to clean all types of things-cell phone screen, computer screen, eyeglasses, etc. A rainbow of colors and handy to have all over the house. This is a great value. 
16173 Great backpack! flew with it as a carry on no problem light and nice 
16174 I m enjoying this as a reliable camera with auto settings -- good pictures and easy to use. 
16175 Works great on Nikon DX AF-S Nikkor 18-55mm 1:3.5-5.6G ED. Took about 30 minutes to remove the old part and install the new one. 
16176 I bought this battery for my Nikon D3300, It did not work with my camera. Its not made for working in a Nikon camera. 
16177 Good sized bag. Fits camera body and two small lenses. Great for using when I m out on my bike. 
16178 Fast delivery. High quality. A lot of fun. Just buy and enjoy. 
16179 Great Kit for reverse lens macros! 
16180 perfect! 
16181 Perfect!!! 
16182 Thank you for the replacement of the remote control it work on my Canon 70 D thank you very much I appreciate for your kindness 
16183 great bag just wish it was a tad bigger 
16184 Vincent was very patient and helped solve my problem. Thank you 
16185 Very nice camera for non-professional! Easy to use and good results. 
16186 Love the camera! The quality is really nice, me and my bestfriend do vlogs and its the perfect mini dslr! Great buy! 
16187 Cowboy Studio does it once again. This backdrop is perfect for on-white photos. One side is almost luster, while the other is glossy. Its easily cleanable and stores nicely. 
16188 Works great! Just what I needed for my canon rebel camera. 
16189 good fit 
16190 Clear picture quality for price. Highly recommended. 
16191 Happy with it simple installation good picture quality i could see my house from anywhere anytime 
16192 A great addition to my collection. I highly recommend it. 
16193 Great, works fine. 
16194 Amazing quality for the price :) I was pleasantly surprised and WOW the shipping was lightening fast! 
16195 ok 
16196 I have one and need a second one, so I purchased again. Works well with the batteries for my Canon EOS M. 
16197 it brings life to my flash light!! love it! a must-have. 
16198 I got this for my camera so that I could use for my phone. It does fine!! 
16199 I ve had this for less than a month and it has already broken. What a waste. 
16200 great belt 
16201 quality product 
16202 I am just getting back into photography and love these little helpers. As I get better I will put them inside my camera bag but for right now I keep them very close at hand 
16203 great product 
16204 Very good remote control. Works well with my Canon camera. 
16205 Flawless. 
16206 Works well. 
16207 absolutely love it!! so nice to have two batteries charged at once and the graphics to let you know status. 
16208 For fun is ok but You ll get what you pay. Can t compare to GoPro lol 
16209 I bought this tripod to support my iPad. The mount I bought attached no problem but this tripod is not strong enough to support the weight of the iPad. Even when it s all tightened it droops down. Very disappointed! 
16210 Nice case. My Pentax K-30 fits pretty well, even with my longer zooms. It could be a bit too small for an SLR with very long lenses. 
16211 Great little tripod 
16212 I absolutely love this film and the price is unbeatable compared to others. 
16213 I am huge guy but still stripe is too large. I have it tide up to max but there is still a lot of space and possibility to slip from my wrist. 
16214 This is a great lighting kit. So easy to use.Well made. 
16215 Exactly what I was looking for! I immediately discarded the clamp that seemed weak compared to GoPro s version. I attached it directly to my kayak and now I get some great shots. Affordable too. 
16216 The quality of the monitor is good; it does come with a F970 battery plate and works perfectly; the overall design is compact and nice, good workmanship. 
16217 I guess it s a great product, never really used it. 
16218 Great pad 
16219 I received my frame one week ago. It was very easy to load and has worked perfectly since turning it on. The picture quality is very good. I would definitely buy it again! 
16220 Works really well so far. Good features. 
16221 I absolutely love this lens! It s perfect for macro shots of flowers, portraits and it s even great as a medium range zoom lens! I d definitely recommend it! 
16222 Fits PVS-14. I understand the right thread is 30.25, but the 30 is loose and this is tight. I like this better. 
16223 Very nice, great lens! 
16224 Awesome camera and lens package. 
16225 Item is scratch on the screen it look heavy used (not used only twice) as advertise missing Lens cap, dusty in side the Len but it is functions, next time better buy new don t trust the advertise. 
16226 will order more when I need it 
16227 Great price for a really decent tripod. 
16228 The floats worked great. i checked them in my pool and they kept all my cameras from sinking. i liked the fact you could use the quick disconect to go from float to regular strap 
16229 A cheaper plastic not sure how it will work under pressure or in water 
16230 Didn t pay attention to the fact that the camera is rechargeable. I don t always have the power supply to power up again on the road. Otherwise, it is a small, functional, and easy to use camera. 
16231 As expected 
16232 I suppose 3.5 stars would have been more accurate. Only one of the batteries worked. The other we only found out was a dud until after the 3-day return period had ended. 
16233 Just as advertised. My only wish would be for it to be little beefier so that it can hold a reflector at any position set. 
16234 Very good package. I recommend. 
16235 It does NOT have night vision and it DOESNT connect to my iPhone waste of money and time 
16236 Got these for fathers day and really think they are a great pair of glasses. Very sharp images and easy to focus. 
16237 Works very well. 
16238 Why waste $ on Go Pro? 
16239 great buy, batts last long, lightweight and portable. 
16240 love using it have gotten great results 
16241 Love it 
16242 We wasted our money on this one. It did not work in our camera. The camera did not recognize it. 
16243 Takes a steady hand but with careful installation and clean area the shield works fantastic! Fits perfect and is invisible on the camera. 
16244 Great product, easy to use, super clear and simple to focus. Can t believe they are discontinuing this product 
16245 Perfect as usual. You can trust Tiffen and save money too. 
16246 The filter often come off when changing the hood. Should have bought more. Can see hood in some zoom in shots. 
16247 Easy to use! 
16248 So far so good, great storage for my Phantom 2. Fits snug in the bag with H3-3D Zenmuse attached, quality is decent. plenty of room for accessories like batteries and tools i need like small hex screw and phillip. 
16249 No it s not working I needed return it? 
16250 Super easy to install and my test shots show a nice improvement over direct flash without the shadows caused by bouncing it off the ceiling. Definitely a nice option to have in my arsenal. 
16251 I was a bit leery when I realized exactly how lightweight this tripod was, but was reassured once I tried it out. Admittedly, my photography is mostly indoors; I don t know if this thing could stand up in a stiff breeze, but for my purposes it s perfect. 
16252 Great design and easy to use 
16253 Superb...A plus 
16254 Henry at Foscam tech service helped me set up remote access to the camera and everything is working as expected. The quality and price are great and it serves my purposes very well. The tech support person was very knowledgeable and addressed all my questions. 
16255 Very happy. 
16256 I am still leaning to use these but I highly reccomend them 
16257 Big, bulky 
16258 good 
16259 Wow, I should have gone to 2 inch viewing long ago. 
16260 works well but if you have the extender arm unclamped a small pin can fall out and make it unusable. Just remeber to keep the clamp locked at all times 
16261 Super cute camera! Doesn t include any film though. 
16262 Great product! 
16263 fast shipping and the replacement was great 
16264 A good product. 
16265 The camera was more than I expected. Great buy for the price. Also, the support and service was way above expectations. I would highly recommend Digideals4less. 
16266 This tripod is better than expected! It is light weight, but very sturdy and easy to use. Great company to work with, great product and great price. Thank You!!! 
16267 so it s good I like it but it don t pause so use WINDOWS MOVIE MAKER to merge vids 
16268 Great camera works as expected. 
16269 Arrived when promised, charged it up, put into my camera and it worked superbly. Thank you STK. 
16270 Does not fit my battery. I have to &#34;tape&#34; it down just a certain way, in order for it to work. 
16271 Very Good 
16272 I can now recharge my battery (or spare battery) inside or in the car. Good set. 
16273 Great deal, works great. 
16274 This thing is awesome, very straight forward. A bright LED attached to a heatsink. The ONLY problem with it is that the fan is too loud for audio recording... but what I m doing is buying a good case fan ($15 max) online and swapping it for a quiet one. 
16275 Exactly what was needed. works perfectly 
16276 It s a good buy for the price ..only thing tripod is the cheap model 
16277 Outstanding image quality 
16278 Went dead before I could even use them. They need to be uses as soon as they arrive. 
16279 I love this lens. Such a great deal for the price and the images are so sharp. Produces a wonderful bokah! 
16280 They get the job done for fair price. 
16281 VERY CHARING AND PROMPT... 
16282 Poor quality - juddery. Nylon slider guides seem to have too much friction to be useful for video work. 
16283 Works fine 
16284 Great product. Easy to use and very efficient. 
16285 These things are worth their weight in gold! 
16286 AAA+++ 
16287 Excellent product. Works perfectly at a big discount on the Nikon product. 
16288 Cool bag! Lots of compliments. Outside is almost too nice to accidentally scuff. Inside is very firm foam. Zippers...holy cow. Weather resistant and you can feel it when you use the zippers. Very resistant when used. Inside of lid uses entire lid and zips closed to use full space! 
16289 This is a great camera for saving memories. I highly recommend it. 
16290 An excellent, easy to use and sturdy table-top tripod--- works well with the FugeTek selfie-stick I also purchased. 
16291 [[VIDEOID:76a1a54ded862b79ccdd6f8e1362a7c8]] The product arrived on time, but one of the bulb was damaged. Tried resolving with seller, but could not. 
16292 great for my strobes and speedlights for the price 
16293 Its a good starter telescope,it does not have an adjust handle and you can only look at the moon 
16294 Great extension for outdoors surveillance camera. 
16295 It was nice 
16296 Almost perfect. Needs a closure for the inside (battery) pocket. as is, the battery falls out when removing camera. I will need to sew-in a Velcro strip to secure it. 
16297 Great hidden camera. 
16298 I borrowed one before I bought this, I liked it and it works well for a cheaper option, I haven t noticed that double circle you get with some of the other cheap ones. Good for the money 
16299 A bit heavier than I had thought but not too bad. Easy to use and takes excellent pictures. I was looking for a lens for shooting wildlife without having to pay for a pro level lens and this one is perfect. I highly recommend it. 
16300 Nice package for a good price. Although not evident from the photo, the charger and batteries are produced by Vivitar, a name I have come to trust over the years. Seems fully compatible with the Olympus camera, charger, and battery. 
16301 Love this camera. Takes great photos with a faster shutter. With an add bonus of using AA batteries. 
16302 I m really excited to take up this new or almost new hobby to be more than a hobby I dont know. I might not be like a Grandma Moses but I think the enjoyment wiil out way any bad things that might happen I expect lot s of fun 
16303 A good looking case, just fits my Nikon 3200 with zoom lens, but it fits and it works. Well constructed. 
16304 I bought this ring to use my 58mm filters on my 52mm Canon 24mm pancake lens. It works exactly as described, and the quality is top notch. The included cloth is a nice touch as well. 
16305 excellent 
16306 This grip is a lifesaver. Makes holding the camera so much easier. 
16307 These are simply wonderful!! The feel of the microfiber is really great &amp; they work nicely on my items. These are so nice I used the first one and placed it back in the plastic holder it was in...I ve never done that before with any other cleaners. 
16308 After getting hosed by a hobby shop in Detroit, I did what I should have done in the first place. Fast shipping, exactly as described. Thanks guys! 
16309 Good except the portion that holds the camera is flimsy. I just use it for my iPhone and it can barely hold that. 
16310 Works great! 
16311 Used at my shop door I installed facing down and do far -great! 
16312 This has made a large difference in my ability to manually focus my camera. Well worth the extra cost. Only gripe is that is sticks out a little more, but in a short while, you wont notice. 
16313 keeps it dry... 
16314 Nice for the price. 
16315 This is awesome camera... 
16316 Excellent camera, the LCD screen makes it easy to use in situations where the camera isn t on a mount. 
16317 Wonderful product!! So easy to use! 
16318 quality product 
16319 I LOVE IT! 
16320 LOVE IT 
16321 Great little charger for home or auto. I have not charged the batteries, but look forward to taking this on our road tr vacation 
16322 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support was very helpful in getting me connected remotely to the camera. 
16323 Just what I was looking for. Works as it should. 
16324 Does what you would expect, protects you lens 
16325 So handy and a better option (imo) than buying the instax camera. 
16326 Keeps the light out of the view screen, fit my D70s perfectly. 
16327 Excellent 
16328 Love this film! So stinkin cute and a really good deal! I use it with my Instax mini 8! 
16329 Great camera to keep an eye on things in your home when you travel! We bought it so that we could see our dog while we were gone! 
16330 That is a nikon lens. It should say it all. Perfect quality, Pictures come out perfect !!! Great lens for the price. 
16331 This product is handy, great purchase! 
16332 Does everything as advertised, an amazing machine. 
16333 Just as described, delivered quickly. 
16334 I ve not used any of them yet. Ordered them for a party. They are cute though. 
16335 Awesome lens love it on my camera 
16336 Henry fi9826p great help very good 
16337 Did not realize this shipped from china directly, so shipping took a little longer then expected. Overall a good product though 
16338 Great product so far 
16339 thank you 
16340 It s great having spare batteries for my camera! They work just as well as the original and the charger will charge the original battery. 
16341 I was very pleased with the camera and most of the equipment included in the package except the slave flash. The slave flash is extremely poor quality, the battery cover will not even come off so that i can try it out. 
16342 A bit expensive but ok 
16343 A very sharp lens. The camera is filled with features that move it past the usual point and shoot. 
16344 Very nice 
16345 Purchased this for my son for our Florida vacation! Was skeptical buying this unit. This little GeekPro is amazing. The quality of the video is awesome. It is worth every penny. Great product! Highly recommend! 
16346 Its a spare battery. Seems to do the job 
16347 Does the job, and the package came with a cute pink stylus and something else I m not exactly sure what it is. I think it s some kind of mini stand for a phone? 
16348 Great buy, especially for those that need the power. Pack has been going strong since purchased in 2007. I would highly recommend. 
16349 Awesome product 
16350 It doesn t work. 
16351 worthless. cameras stop working on first day. no warenty. 
16352 Excellent product 
16353 Great product. 
16354 Not good, cheap quality, come without instructions in an envelope. 
16355 Works fine! 
16356 Better than I thought 
16357 It s what I expected 
16358 Works extremely well and a great alternative to OEM batteries 
16359 Came on time. Works perfectly. No problems at all. 
16360 Exactly what we hoped it would be. Large viewing screen and clear picture. Love it. 
16361 This lens took ok pictures, but the build quality left me wanting more. The body was loose and rattled and the aperture ring did not adjust consistently. Because of this I returned the lens and will be buying a rokinon. Hopefully the quality is better. 
16362 Love it! 
16363 It s an OK bag. It s really nicely built, but it s not as big as I expected. I was looking for a larger bag than what my Canon EOS 7D came with. I will use it in place of the Canon bag. 
16364 Excellent pictures. Easy setup. 
16365 Cheap and works as it should! 
16366 Very good case, perfect for my camera. 
16367 These batteries work perfectly I my D3200, and the charges last a bit longer than the OEM battery that came with my camera. The car charger works great and will recharge a battery quite quickly, as does the wall charger. The chargers also will recharge the OEM battery. 
16368 Great camera for the price point. But if you plan to use AUTO mode instead of MANUAL, you will NOT be able to record to 2 SD cards simultaneously. If you like dual slot recording, so you ll always have a backup, it only works in Manual mode. 
16369 good product 
16370 as described. Thanks! 
16371 All perfect 
16372 Nice quality product. Delivered on time. 
16373 My pen came in and the camera was sunk down inside the barrel of the pen... I was able to align it.. For what it is, it works pretty good 
16374 Packing spares! 
16375 Exacly what i needed 
16376 Eliminates the sun problems you have with the gopro. 
16377 This thing is solid! Make sure to push the mount firmly against your surface then engage the lever to suck in the cup. Really good mount. I feel no worries putting my gopro on it. 
16378 Nice product for the price. Pictures look clear, sharp image. Easy to use. 
16379 i love this camera, excelent product 
16380 I use it for snowboarding. no problem. 
16381 Perfect for the job 
16382 not bad for the price 
16383 Great product. Fit perfectly with slik 6600. Received when expected. 
16384 Is a excelent len for a good price. 
16385 It s a good deal! The price is very reasonable. Both the battery and charger work great. I used the battery for over 5 hours in my Sony camcorder. The charger is so convenient for traveling which included a European adapter plug and a car charger. 
16386 software is weak camera better 
16387 Hopefully people can see my music is tethered to my brain. - John Mayer 
16388 Great item, burt I haven t used it since I struggled with how to get it going and no instructions came with it. Still I am happy I purchased it, just need some digital assistance. 
16389 Great value! 
16390 The ad said it fits Canon Cameras, I wanted it for my X, does not fit, wasted my money 
16391 Perfect piece feels very well made 
16392 Works as needed 
16393 Good quality product. A little heavy but offers a lot of protection. 
16394 Goog size. And seems robust. 
16395 Did not consistently work. Tried using the expensive Energizer batteries that would last longer, and the camera wouldn t turn on. Goes through normal batteries exceptionally fast. Pictures were acceptable, but with it not working much of the time, my son (to whom we gifted this item) was constantly disappointed/frustrated. 
16396 I love the camera. Easy to use, Arrived very fast. Faster than expected. The camera itself is a very pretty red. I love all the items that came with it as well. 
16397 perfect for the camera I have! well worth the price. 
16398 Very happy, Use in Hot Tub, & At night lights up water really well. 
16399 The remote worked well. It came on time. 
16400 Excellent 
16401 pictures are not very sharp 
16402 Cute DSLR for entry level users. Small and light enough to carry with you for traveling and sight-seeing purpose. 
16403 Very nice camera especially for the money I paid. Took about 5 minutes to set up. Easy to use with the app on my phone. Color, tilt, pan all work very well. Can check house when away, see if kids are home etc 
16404 but wow i got it like 2 years ago and iam still using it untill now !! 
16405 works nicely 
16406 They are great. 
16407 The cable I received was not RG59. The video wire was as thin as the power wire. There were no writing on the cable as illustrated. It would not have handed the elements. I Returned it and amazon gave me a refund. 
16408 Hard to use underwater but sit gave a better idea of what was really in your lens view verse guessing! Can t give info on battery life over yet but maybe down the road. Glad I have it as I do not like using my cellphone as a screen. 
16409 Great bang for buck 
16410 i got a deal on it to give my honest opinion. very cute one!! fo my daughter s BD gift! her dream camera! 
16411 Was absolutely wonderful for our trip to Europe. I wish the back pack itself was waterproof and didn t need a cover. That would have a earned the back pack five stars. 
16412 Very nice. Just what I needed. 
16413 Box was opened and look used. was missing the instruction manual. A 356 page book on how to use this very complicated piece of technology. Not happy.. not sure of the authenticity of the product. Zero stars If that was available. 
16414 Great spares for my Geek Pro. Hold a charge just fine. Perfect to have for vacations and long trips. Love it 
16415 This camera is awesome! The close-up picture are crisp and clear. An excellent purchase in my book! 
16416 functions well 
16417 Excellent value for the price. Easy to set up and use with iPad. The most helpful reviews were correct. 
16418 good product 
16419 great speedlight! 
16420 The album is exactly what I was looking for but the rings don t line up properly. 
16421 Thin and quick charger for Fuji batteries! 
16422 This kit has been just what I needed to make my Nikon work better than imagined. 
16423 Initially very impressed with how sturdy bracket is. After two months of use, the bracket remains unchanged and is still very sturdy. However, the mounting screw snapped off. I wished it was made with a more robust material. 
16424 I was extremely please with these lens bags. Thick neoprene fabric yet flexible enough to give when I put them in my camera backpack. Best inexpensive investment for my lens. The assorted sizes are perfect!!! 
16425 Great camera! Pictures turn out great! 
16426 The small tripod will not hold my Nikon D7100 upright. The other tripods are fine. Just the small one is bad. 
16427 works perfectly 
16428 The thing broke on the first day. Piece of trash. You get what you pay for. 
16429 Nice addition to a blackrapid camera strap to hold memory cards, batteries, etc. 
16430 Excellent 
16431 it works great , nice and clear transfer 
16432 I was actually surprised how easy the Nikon D3200 was to use. I was always worried that I wouldn t be able to take good pictures without a lot of studying the manual and a lot of time playing with the camera. 
16433 love it just what I need 
16434 Thank You for the fast service. The bag fits the camera and the price was great! 
16435 Great ball head! A wonderful addition to my gear. 
16436 The worst DVR and camera system I ever used, and I have installed hundreds. 
16437 Real nice 
16438 Great camara. 
16439 Everything you need all in one happy little box!! 
16440 Works great. I can use my old manual focus Nikon lenses on my Sony A7 now. I did add some shims to get infinity focus exactly right, but then I m picky about that sort of thing. Most photographers wouldn t even notice that. 
16441 So irritated! I bought this flash and had it shipped quickly to use for a wedding for my second shooter and it did not work. The battery would not charge and decided to swell up. Not worth $100. 
16442 very good charger ! 
16443 works good 
16444 Great kit you will get almost everything you will need. Great price 
16445 This set of camera is valuable, I love it :) 
16446 Just cheap. Brand new item but buttons almost broken. Not worth the price. I should ve gotten a Kidde or First Alert at a similar price. My mistake. 
16447 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
16448 They are great!! 
16449 never could get it to work properly. could be due to weak wifi signal 
16450 Bought as an additional battery. Thumbs up. 
16451 Very compact and nice 
16452 Didn t work 
16453 Perfect 
16454 This type of shoe mount is OK. I like the Frio better. 
16455 love this lense , its alittle heavy but does a great job 
16456 One of first Smatree accessories I purchased and have been impressed since day one. Everything is super solid, no play or slack. Feels great, easy to extend and retract. 
16457 This IS NOT the Hoya HMC haze UV(0) filter even though the title says so and so does the picture. The description clearly says it s the newer and not as good UV(C) version. Beware since Amazon seems unwilling to change the title or the image. 
16458 Handy to have for those &#34;necessary&#34; pictures a vacation needs. 
16459 Great inexpensive product. I used them to bypass my alarm window sensors and they worked perfectly. 
16460 So far so good! My son is a fan. This camera was easy to use right out of the box! Great price great video and great pictures! 
16461 Great product and so much fun for our grandson riding on his bike taking videos... he loves it! 
16462 Excellent screen protector, fits perfectly, easy to install, seems almost impossible to scratch. 
16463 I have to say.... for the money ... you can t beat this. I can take pictures sharp as a tack with great effect. Don t be afraid of a manual lens. Lots of fun! 
16464 Quick shipping and works as expected. One down side, gets dirty quickly and may leave smears. 
16465 The item does not fit the flash head of Metz 52 AF-1 Digital flash as it is supposed to. It is certainly not a snug fit. Maybe I should have gone for a Stofen unit (which incidentally was unavailable on Amazon). 
16466 Held about 1.5-2 hr on non stop recording at 4K 
16467 Everything I expected Thank you 👍 
16468 great product 
16469 Arrived quickly. The fish eye has some vignetting, but the close up and wide are great. 
16470 This battery has given me no problems at all! It is my backup for my nikon d5300! 
16471 Could be better...... Some of the pictures are blurry..... but overall great camera for regular pcitures 
16472 Really solid, easy to adjust, stands on its own - greatly reduces tripod need, speeds up a shoot for sure 
16473 Incredible service and great product. This is well built and the service was excellent. I will be purchasing more items in the future from Digital Goja for sure. Using the product on my Nikon right now and love it. 
16474 This is great for taking pictures of my food products. Easy to set up, take down, and takes up very little space in storage. 
16475 It came on time & my daughter loves it :) 
16476 Just what I needed. Great quality, fits perfectly on screen. 
16477 Everyone that see it wants to know where I bought it. I love it 
16478 The charger is inexpensive, well built, easy to use and is very convenient for charging the Olympus battery. Highly recommended. Also, Kastar customer service is excellent. 
16479 I lost my lens cap. This one works. There isn t much to say. 
16480 Haven t had a chance to use but better than paying for batteries. Uninterrupted power supply. 
16481 Nice product! 
16482 Awesome camera just what I expected. Everything in the kit is high quality well except for the tripod. Great extra batterie also. 
16483 Great video quality! More bang for your buck!! 
16484 Great drone for the price. I got it in a week. 
16485 Disappointed that the battery does not fit the charger very well unless you manuever it in such a way that contact is made. It should a snug fit. 
16486 I couldn´t use the selfie stick. It is not compatible with gopro cameras. 
16487 Product exactly as advertised and works as it should. 
16488 Extremely effective, these clean much faster than others that I ve used. Love the little reusable pouches and the screen buddy is a nice touch. 
16489 My Sony wouldn t screw on tight, it was loose. Other than that it was a great mini tripod to use to capture pictures of the whole family on a timer. I also tried to screw on an attachment to hold a cell phone but that fit loose as well. 
16490 NICE PRODUCT 
16491 Story evolves learning more about the character of each in every episode. 
16492 As advertised 
16493 Easy to setup, easy to use, highly recommend this product 
16494 For a pocket size camera, I am simply amazed. I can t get enough of it on my days off. Definitely wish I had gotten it earlier. 
16495 Used it this weekend in Paris. Amazing photo and video quality. I highly recommend this camera for traveling with friends. 
16496 I LIKE THE PRICE AND THE QUALITY 
16497 love my new receiver 
16498 Great camera, worth the money 
16499 as advertised 
16500 is a must if you have a celestron telescope, well worth it 
16501 Vincent did a great job taking care of our problem! 
16502 Product arrived without extendable pole which was one of the main items. Plastic is also very weak. Was very disappointed as I had no time to return product before using it on vacation 
16503 They are just what we needed 
16504 Its easy to use and it lasts a long time. 
16505 Henry was very helpful in assisting me in setting up the R2 camera on my PC and my iPhone. The R2 camera is very clear when viewing and it is physically smaller than what I had expected. The small size will be easier to conceal for surveillance. 
16506 nice lens - funny bokeh, sharp center ... definietly not sharp sides ;) ideal for having fun :) 
16507 Already shot 2 weddings and am very happy. Huge improvement over the SB-800. 
16508 Item arrived open inside shipping box and power supply did not work. I returned product. 
16509 Don t have proper lens to utilize it think first before buying one 
16510 The savings of buying in bulk really helps the pocketbook. 
16511 I m glad I bought this tripod/ mono pod. It is so handy, very light and easy to use. I always bring it with me whenever I bring my camera. 
16512 Great! 
16513 Good buy 
16514 I have not had the occasion to use it. But it appeared to be a good investment. 
16515 Very pleased 
16516 Amazing value! 
16517 A great alternative to Home Secretary 
16518 Great purchase! 
16519 Product delivered...but only lasts 20 min. really cheap product 
16520 Everything came as expected, but, head strap is missing bolt to screw GoPro into, therefore, I was unable to use it snorkeling over the weekend... Chest cam worked great, and selfie stick was nice. Other than the flaw in the head strap, I like what I got. 
16521 It fits great on camera. Rubber grip is similar to the camera, very good materials 
16522 Didn t fit my Olympus camerea 
16523 Very Good 
16524 I really like the product, but when it detects motion it says so where the clocks suppose to be, so if the person the camera detects sees the motion detected (clock) they ll know their being recorded 
16525 Camera takes good pictures but has a slow response. This is the only downside to this camera. 
16526 I LOVE IT! 
16527 Works great on my Nikon D7200 just as the review stated. All functions work and both batteries are displayed on the menu 
16528 Just took it on a European vacation. The straps up front don t close easily it besides this it s solid, inconspicuous camera bag and it looks great 
16529 [[ASIN:B00004WCGF Canon Deluxe Gadget Bag 100EG]] A little bit smaller than I had hoped but I managed to get everything snugged in. All in all a quality case and definitely up to the task of protecting my camera. 
16530 I really like this spotting scope for its compact size and clarity. I m having a custom soft case made for it. Pentax would enhance its sales if they were to produce and distribute it with a soft case. 
16531 This unit was purchased to replace a Canon ZR80 that burnt out. Suprisingly the ZR80 had slightly better picture quality than this one. Where this camera excels is it s easy to use features and menus. 
16532 Just as described. Works great. With screen was touch screen. Other than that, it works as good as my old one. 
16533 I can t really say that this modifier made a pointedly noticeable change but every little bit helps and My flash DOES seem a tad more controlled when on camera. 
16534 the battery does not work, it goes out in a minute of use. where I can buy a new battery. 
16535 Had all the bells and whistles plus more. 
16536 Fits as the original. Buy several as they come off easily. 
16537 Double zipper tabs would be nice, but overall it s hard to beat the price/value. Beefy strap and good weather resistance too. 
16538 Camera is working great Customer service agent Walter - was very helpful to get it set-up 
16539 Good 
16540 Fantastic product at a very reasonable price, i simply love it 
16541 Great camera at a good price. The variable zoom is perfect for pointing down my drive way. The camera arrived quickly with everything intact and working. 
16542 Works Good. 
16543 good charger 
16544 Love it 
16545 Thanks! 
16546 This thing works and is ideal. 
16547 leaked and cost me my go-pro, yes should have done a dry run, seamed durable and I was just snorkeling so figured this was my test before an actual dive. like the more durable clasp compared to the original housing. complete crap DO NOT BUY! 
16548 Battery fits well and works fine 
16549 This was the best a Big Bang for my buck!! I use everything here!! Can t wait to order more!! 
16550 I don t use mine very often and am disappointed that one of the straps had torn off already. Disappointing 
16551 We bought these at a reasonable price. They don t last as long as the name brand but are a great bargain anyway. 
16552 Good quality lens cloths. 
16553 Camera is excellent, software is terrible and very cumbersome. 
16554 Good Deal! 
16555 Bought this for my 15 year old son. It has a ton of gadgets in it. He loves it! 
16556 This was a Christmas present. 
16557 I used this camera on a trip out West to Yellowstone NP and most of the pictures taken were excellent. 
16558 This mount holds very tightly and I am glad that I bought it. I have this mount as well as the GoPro one and the BRLS is a lot sturdier than the GoPro suction mount. 
16559 its cumbersome to take the camera out. I replaced this item with an other product. 
16560 Good zoom 
16561 This is the best.... I just the pictures!!! I don t leave home with out it. 
16562 Granddaughter is thrilled, camera works great! 
16563 Works perfectly as a replacement for the OEM battery at 1/3 the cost. 
16564 Works beautifully and I got it for a good price! 
16565 Works well. Cannot find charger. 
16566 They are good batteries, work great. 
16567 Ordered this for our office to take passport pictures for students. This is easy to use. And will be an asset to the office. 
16568 Item as described and works well. Arrived on time. 
16569 Didn t fit my speed rings. 
16570 bought too many! wanna buy one from me? 
16571 Essential for your grab bag 
16572 Fits my 70D perfectly and worked awesome. The color is not far off from my 70d so it really looks like the more expensive models 
16573 Great backpack. Only gave it three starts because its not as handy as a messenger bag style when it comes to switching lenses on the move. 
16574 Excellent!! 
16575 Arrived just as expected! Looking forward to integrating these into our September wedding as an interactive medium for guests. Thank you for the prompt shipping! 
16576 Batteries fit perfectly into charger and camera. They don t hold a charge for as long as the original batteries, but they are great as back ups. 
16577 Very good. 
16578 Such an amazing combo for a great price. Not one regret about this purchase! 
16579 great 
16580 Works GREAT! 
16581 thank you.. 
16582 perfect 
16583 Fast shipping, pleased with purchase. 
16584 Easy installment.. could use a touch of threadlocker. 
16585 Meets my needs and very sterdy 
16586 This battery is just as good as the original Canon types. Three years an still no issues. If you need this battery, stop now and just buy it all ready. 
16587 Very disappointing interior material s quality. 
16588 Doesn t come close to doing what it s supposed to plus there s no directions. Very shotty 
16589 Works great for the price, effortless setup. The mobile app is nice and it provides just what you need. My only regret is that I did not get the 8 channel DVR. 
16590 Go pro?! WHY?!!!! This does the same thing, and is AWESOME! I use it on my drone, and it can take a BEATING so far! The waterproof case makes this a GREAT purchase! GET IT! 
16591 Hood doesn t screw on well. 
16592 Had to return the first unit due to not functioning second unit received a working perfectly fine 
16593 Works great--is exactly what i wanted. 
16594 Nice bag 
16595 Calvin did a great job hooking up my camera to the cloud Foscam lets me keep an eye on my property 
16596 Very good quality for the price, don t forget to buy a micro SD card to go with it, though! 
16597 This thing is really impressive, built like a tank. Holds over 200 lbs - i can believe it. I got it to hold a video slider super low and it will do that all day. Over bulty but light and packable. Great niche product 
16598 Just Great! 
16599 Great product, very nice quality and works as it should 
16600 Who does not love extra batteries! 
16601 This battery is marked as 1300mAh, not 1600mAh as described. 
16602 fits everything perfectly 
16603 As advertised 
16604 The kids had a blast playing with this waterproof camera on our recent vacations. It s definitely critical that you buy a &#34;floater&#34; so you don t lose it to the depths of the pool or ocean. 
16605 Is a great price for this camera 
16606 When playing &#34;random&#34; photos and with the motion detection &#34;on&#34; the screen freezes black after some time... But when the unit plays photos sequentially there is no problem with the motion detection. Not very happy and not likely to suggest this product to anyone else. 
16607 Good product and a fantastic seller A++++++ 
16608 perfect 
16609 Product was as described, and arrived on time. 
16610 Workscas advertised. My issue though is the thing to tighten the flash could be sturdier. 
16611 And turns everything blue. I live in LA and wouldn t purchase again 
16612 Very good 
16613 Is not a great camera. I have had issues with my pics being blurry. I wish I had sprung for a better camera now Im stuck with this one for awhile. 
16614 Product is excellent and fast shipping!!! Thanks 
16615 Not the most stable tri pod 
16616 This looks and operates like a GoPro3 for a lot less money. nice accessories. Be sure and purchase no more than a 32GB micro memory card. The documentation is a bit weak, but there are a lot of videos online to walk you through the operation of this 1080P camera. 
16617 Very good. 
16618 i am ashamed to say i love this product. you might have trouble getting it to take pictures if you have an older phone, but you can download an app. 
16619 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
16620 Great Seller Super! 
16621 Perfect 
16622 product is as described, well machined, works perfectly. either by hand or a coin. 
16623 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
16624 I found that the optical quality was poor. See attached sample. I bought this for moving water photos so maybe it won t matter in &#34;real world&#34; imaging, but I m disappointed. 
16625 Loved it 
16626 Smaller than expected but I guess good for the price 
16627 Takes awhile to get used to taking photos without a viewfinder or screen. Picture quality is quite good, I was particularly impressed with underwater shots. 
16628 i love this camera i ts one of the best. you can basically do anything that you can do on an Android cell phone including making and receiving calls with your google account, facebook messenger, oovoo, skype. i just wish it had a sim card slot 
16629 It s really light and fits so much gear! Genius design! 
16630 Got it 
16631 Awesome product very pleased 
16632 Extra to my needs at this time. 
16633 love the zoom. Have not been able to get the wifi to work yet, so hopefully it will. overall, takes great photos. 
16634 This thing is very well made and highly recommended 
16635 Great value. Well delivered. Thank you 
16636 Easy to use and mount.. But this is not what i expected... 
16637 great light,can carry it around in your pocket! great product. 
16638 Great little camera. 
16639 They don t fit Sony RX-10, contrary to what you read! I should have paid attention to some of the other reviewers who commented on inaccurate sizing. Both batteries I purchased stick and I had to use needle-nose pliers to remove them! Bummer! 
16640 Very nice protection for the lenses. Very usefull. 
16641 very good product, peace of mind for your much more expensive lens. (drop test: my daughter played around with the filter and accidentally unscrewed it from the lens and it dropped 1 m down to the hard concrete floor, and it did not break, nor scratch. Maybe I was lucky). 
16642 takes nice pictures and i easy to use 
16643 Fits my 430 EX perfectly! 
16644 Youtube channel: http://youtube.com/teainthetreesbp I get constant messages about the quality of my videos. EVERYTHING is filmed on that channel with this camera. I will probably buy the next one when it comes out. Best hd camera I ve owned. 
16645 Nice protection. 
16646 I got this one to replace an older one that was going on five years old and finally quit. It s capable of zoned operation in its sensing area to fine tune the field it monitors, and can be adjusted to only work at night. A nice little unit. 
16647 Great product 
16648 Nice idea but not use friendly. Hard to tel which mode it is in. 
16649 Awesome external flash! 
16650 The problem I had with this is that it was very easy to dislodge. A couple of times I did not notice that it had fallen off. Apart from that worked well. 
16651 Broken clasp as soon as I opened it. It also has a film glued to the back door. Wish I would have bought the real deal. 
16652 I purchased this for my father with many grand kids out of town. Although it seemed like a nice product, the software, especially the remote are terrible. This is NOT a good product for non-tech savvy individuals. I would avoid. 
16653 Although I had no problems connecting it to wifi, just could not get it to record to SD. 
16654 works great 
16655 I have replaced larger (too large) straps on my Olympus E-M1 and E-M5 with the Leash Camera Straps from Peak Design. I like the concept, size and weight and they are easily adjusted to a different length. Just perfect for the mirrorless cameras. 
16656 Pretty simple mount and work perfect 
16657 This is a fantastic lens at an affordable price. I have been having so much fun photographing everything from grandchildren to wildlife to butterflies! Easy to handle without using tripod. 
16658 Delivered as stated, packaging was great and batteries charged and work in my camera. 
16659 Great unit charges two batteries at the same time unlike other chargers. Speedy delivery! 
16660 I was totally amazed of how small and easy to handle, is the FotoTech ML-L3 Wireless Shutter Release Remote, I could not have been any happier. I had other type of remote before and this is absolutely the best, my congratulations to FotoTech. 
16661 Package came exactly as ordered. I needed the batteries and charger more than the cleaning supplies, but it is nice to have a fresh cleaning kit to go with a new camera! I always like to have a spare battery handy. 
16662 No. Very Silly. No where near loud enough. 
16663 Precisely what I needed to replace my older Lumix (also with Leica lens.) It s my fourth Lumix and as each is replaced I give it to one of my granddaughters. That way I get razor sharp pictures of my family. 
16664 This case is pretty nice! I am quite happy with this purchase. 
16665 I got this battery charger today and plugged my Nikon J3 battery into it. Worked great. Fast shipping and a third the price of a replacement from Nikon. I m a happy customer. 
16666 This case works wonderfully with my DSLR. I have a 55-300mm lens that fits well in this case while attached to my camera. I have brought it along while traveling internationally and it did a great job at protecting my camera. 
16667 Works great and a great price for the functions. 
16668 Great fun for my wife 
16669 GoPro equivalent w/ Camera viewing/controlling & file downloads wirelessly on phone (Droid or iPhone) or tablet through App. App allows you to take pictures remotely, view screen is low quality (circa 2001 digital cameras) but the picture/video quality (3000x4000 option available) is very good! 
16670 Excellent stuff. Canon makes good cameras. The bag is actually pretty good as everything from this kit that I will use fits just fine. The mini tripod is pretty much useless for a camera of this size. 
16671 awesome 
16672 just cant find a way to square them up to my eyes properly - really don t understand it because having owned about 10 different sets of binoculars over the last 40+ years, these ones just don t allow unobstructed vision in any adjustment range. its weird. 
16673 This is a great tripod! 
16674 Very helpful & handy! 
16675 Seems to be working fine. 
16676 Must have if you use the Sony RX100III, Affordable. I always have a spare batt in my pocket when I m carrying my Sony. 
16677 Cute product. Some stickers didn t stick well but others did. I would buy again with other designs. 
16678 The case is made of steel and, although gives protection to the PCB, adds a lot of weight to an FPV system. Better video quality than many others- I still use it on my 250quad 
16679 If you just want a case that could keep your GoPro and some basic accessories safe and with a minimal size at the same time, this is it. 
16680 Real bargin 
16681 Not a bad camera, but the color is way off! It works, connects is easy to use but the picture quality is very low and it does not display colors correctly. 
16682 It not the type of charger that will charge your battery? It took long time to get my camcorder charged enough to work right? I would like to find an original one for my camcorder instead. 
16683 This is a fun thing to have, but it is very hard to find anywhere to buy the film. 
16684 Excellent versatility. Out of the few I have seen this seems to be the most durable as well. 
16685 simple but effective 
16686 Only the clock worked. Web camera did not work. Recording camera did not record. It was a very expensive clock, that s all! 
16687 One battery wouldn t. They replaced it quickly. No complaints 
16688 Buy one! Having so much fun with this. Seems to work with all of my lenses, minus some vignetting on certain ones. 
16689 great product 
16690 For the price you cannot go worng, It is perfect for persons who travel as it is extremely lightweight. I was a little cautious at first to put my camera on it but it held up my Canon DSLR very nicely. 
16691 Excellent 
16692 I ve never used a circular polarizer before but this seems to be doing what I need it to do. It fits nicely on my Canon SX60 and has a nice case for storage when it is not in use. I m very happy with this product. 
16693 bulky 
16694 As opposed to other reviewers, I see no jumps or jerks with this. it just plain works. the 5-minute 360-degree is good for getting quick interior rotations. It is now an essential part of my kit. dead easy to use. 
16695 I did not use the stand up tripod but the lens work great. 
16696 I love those things and already used them a lot. No complains! 
16697 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16698 does *not* work for my new d3300 or mh-24 charger -- it just flashes rapidly. nikon website says this means defective battery. 
16699 Just what I needed. 
16700 This item does not work. I have bought it two seperate times and continue to have the same problem. Will Not Turn on, never even got a chance to test the quality. Very Disappointed. 
16701 Item delivered in a timely manner and was just as described on the web site. 
16702 Does the job of replacing one I lost while working on a window. No fiddling necessary. 
16703 Works like a champ. Good quality. Shipped quickly. 
16704 AWESOME! Worked great for fast lens changes while doing street photography! 
16705 Love it !!! And the delivery was awesome!!! 
16706 Good 
16707 The product is not set up easily by the average home owner, and the instructions do not tell you how to connect to your home wireless network, instead directing you to the company s cloud service. Only one smart phone can be connected--a product limitation. 
16708 Lens caps fit perfectly on my T3i and seem like they are an even better fit than the Cannon cover that came with the lens. 
16709 My wife loves it, enough said 
16710 Disappointing 
16711 Night view not as expected 
16712 No better than the 700TVL and 450TVL cameras that I have already 
16713 Does the job, but inserting a battery is tricky, I have to juggle it and make may attempts before the battery will go in. Something is not quite correct with the physical interface between the charger and the battery. 
16714 The lenses are loose and the glass actually rattles around. I am going to return them and order something better. 
16715 Worked like new right out of the box as it should. Still using it a year later and i m still very happy with my purchase. 
16716 Everything fits good, works good. No complaints here. 
16717 Didn t work for my Canon SX280 which has a known battery flaw, nice package otherwise though from other reviews the fast charger may cause problems. 
16718 I love this Camera..... 
16719 Nice backdrop. 
16720 Great product, 
16721 After installing this product, your nice bright camera screen becomes a blurry &#34;frosted glass&#34; hardly usable mess. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. I put it on a brand new Nikon Coolpix AW130 and removed it promptly. Its like looking thru steamed up glasses. I returned it to Amazon for refund. 
16722 Don t use the wrist mount I lost my hero 4 at the lake in the water the top of the part of the mount that spins broke off warning not use it 
16723 so thankful I found these 
16724 This drone is a bit difficult to control and camera quality isn t great so I mounted a gopro and got amazing footage. This thing goes out of control in soft winds!!! 
16725 This remote works wonderfully with my DSLR. It s very handy to have for photos taken with a tripod- much more convenient than self timer. 
16726 I don t know if the Energizer name is the same as the battery manufacturer but the price and multi-type card use capability caught my interest for the task ahead of me. 
16727 The audio/sound is bad. The capability to hear whats going on thru the app is very static. The microphone capabilty to talk thru the app to the device doesnt work at all. 
16728 Fits my Nikon D600 perfectly. 
16729 Works well. I ve purchased 3 so far. 
16730 Nice to be able to still get this film. Worked fine. 
16731 Excellent quality at a very reasonable price. 
16732 Good buy 
16733 Great trigger. 
16734 Ok 
16735 Good replacement parts. Both charged up very well. 
16736 Even when you are in others place,you also can keep closer to your house,your loved people any time by your phone or PC. 
16737 kenneth was very very helpful. He was very knowledgable about the foscam products and got me up and running in no time. 
16738 It worked great. My battery was charged in no time 
16739 Item arrived on time and works well. I have used it for sports photography and like it much better than the neck strap. 
16740 its ok 
16741 Great product, exactly what I was looking for! Excellent customer service. Highly recommend this case as a travel case for your GoPro... 
16742 Fix perfect to my AZ1. 
16743 This was bought as a backup in case my battery ran down and I had no place to recharge my camera. 
16744 they are very weak 
16745 Does the job....thanks!!! 
16746 Amazing camera and the best customer service I have seen in a very long time! 
16747 IDEAL! 
16748 Light weight, but solid. Exactly what I needed to attach my video light to my c-stand for a halo light. 
16749 love it 
16750 I love the feel of this little camera in my hands! Be careful with charging it though! Easy carry and fits in a small purse. 
16751 It is a garbage, can not be used. 
16752 Bought two of these, but neither works with the Foscam 9805w. The cables seem to fit, but not delivering any electricity. 
16753 Awesome product. Exactly like the original Gopro 
16754 Perfect for our SLR, very sleek and compact to do day trips with. Rain fly is clutch. There is no room for any other gear you want to carry, except for very small essential accessories like a battery, a lens cap, or things equally flat and small. 
16755 AWESOME!!!! 
16756 EXCELLENT, No complaints 
16757 Easy to use and everything you need 
16758 Perfect size. High quality photos. Love it! 
16759 I would have given it 5 stars -- delivered fast, packaged well -- but time will tell how they last. But so far, so good! 
16760 Just as I expected. 
16761 Excelente 
16762 Not worth buying! Came very wrinkled and you can not iron it. 
16763 Nice slim, filter. 
16764 Alsome works with vision 2 
16765 Super fast shipping! Great product! 
16766 INCREDIBLE. HUGE. GREAT VALUE-- high quality--- these have taken my portraits to another level. 
16767 Built-in Z-Wave Plus! Can t get better than that. 
16768 Great for the price. Real sturdy. 
16769 Sturdy Construction. Good resultas as of today. 
16770 Great product 
16771 I love using this! It is the best product! 
16772 Do not buy if you re going to be cliff-jumping or any sports or similar nature 
16773 Works like a Nikon lc-52 snap front lens cap should😏 
16774 Works great!!! 
16775 Arrived quickly- works great with my Nikon D3200 and I love that it also comes with the car adapter to charge on the go! 
16776 A++++ super deal! super fast delivery WOW 2 days from the order to being at my door! 
16777 Solid fast good product. 
16778 Accurate, fast, quality construction. 
16779 very good. thanks. 
16780 Fantastic camera, better than I hoped for!! 
16781 Didn t need all of them, but down the road am sure I will use them 
16782 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
16783 Good and economical at less than $15 
16784 These are great! Totally real looking, I trembled when I got them the package. I left my own house, before I called the police. They are big chunky and totally sell the gag. 
16785 Before buying good filters I wanted to try this package to see how I would like using filters. This package gave me some good options to learn and work with filters. If anything the adopter ring alone were worth the price. 
16786 great 
16787 Great lens and excellent price! Timely delivery. Included one year international warranty. I registered the lens online. The lens delivers sharp pictures, typical Nikon quality. 
16788 Great 
16789 great cd on how to use the camera 
16790 SOOOO much fun and easy to use. Have not tried to add my camera yet. 
16791 I love the ability to change the color with the gels. For video work, I use the blue for daylight color temperature. 
16792 so far so good, and it it arrived in a most timely manner. many thanks. 
16793 having trouble with the auto focus...servos will not operate. anxious about warranty 
16794 This is a great lens for the price. No need to go into great detail because if your a beginner like me it just goes over your head. However you can trust at this price point the lens will not disappoint! Get it. Great Value good quality. 
16795 It took the same quality pictures as before. 
16796 Patrick at Foscam support did a wonderful job of helping me to install and understand the IP camera. I thank him very much!!This is one of the best outdoor IP cameras made. Can t wait to get it mounted!! Thanks!! 
16797 Always got to have a spare! 
16798 horrible product. Felt very cheaply made and has little to no projection of light. It barely iluminates the corner of a 5x5 room. 
16799 Looks like a real camera and the red link blinks brightly at night 
16800 Works well on my non Nikon Flash 
16801 I am very disappointed with camera and am returning it I am not able to access it all day but. Half of the time when I try, it gives me &#34;Connect Timeout&#34;. It s a disappointment. 
16802 Unbelievably great price and exactly what I was hoping for. I will be grabbing a second one for travel, so I can do two at once. With the X100T a notoriously awful battery performance, at least it s cheap to buy extra power. 
16803 I haven t had much chance to use this item, but I m glad I purchased it at a wonderful price. I love the red color and it will be used quite a bit during my next trip. 
16804 Exactly what i wanted, exactly what i thought it was and what i needed it to do. Great product and great transaction. 
16805 GOOD PRICE 
16806 Works great, fast shipping, reasonable price. 
16807 I lost exactly the same camera and bought this as a replacement. I love it. 
16808 Waist of money 
16809 Battery s last just as long as official gopro batteries, and so convenient to charge 2 at a time... I have 6 batteries total since the life is so short on the gopro 
16810 works great and lasts longer than the gopro battery that came with the camera. 
16811 works great never have to charge batteries just plug the camera right into the wall 
16812 Works good for the price but the instructions are not not well documented and be sure to get a SD memory card for it. 
16813 2 the 4 no good they was used moters 
16814 Satisfied with the product. Should have gotten sooner. Just got it. Hope it lasts. 
16815 These batteries worked perfect for my Canon Vixia M500. The charger work good and charges fairly quick. Would buy again. 
16816 Easy to set up right out of the box. Couldn t be happier with it! 
16817 This small battery is perfect! The old one (that we had to use) was rather large and bulky - but it came with the camcorder (gift). Thank you!!! 
16818 I think some of the people need stronger fingers or use a tool to tighten the clamp. It works well. I have no problems. 
16819 Great product. 
16820 Used right after I received the package. Very happy about the purchase. Would recommend to friends. 
16821 worked as should thanks 
16822 LOVE the Samsung NX3000 and all the lenses I ve purchased for it. A great go-to camera, small in size, that delivers top-quality photos. 
16823 Not what is advertised. AT ALL. Trust me, if you re looking for a Sj4000L, this is not it. 
16824 fits into a laptop sized bag nicely, very sturdy when fully extended. Overall very happy with the stand. 
16825 Sonys mounts are crap.... And half of them are discontinued.... Buy a go pro 
16826 Great product, works great and does exactly what it is suppose to do. 
16827 Great 
16828 Fit perfectly 
16829 I need it. It was delivered quickly. So I m happy. 
16830 The mounts provided with the camera are somewhat useful in most cases, but difficult to adapt for non-typical applications. Camera works well, and very good quality video. 
16831 it is broken and does not work and no one has returned my calls to replace it. and my name is not richard, I am BJ at bjdaneshfar@gmail.com BJD 
16832 Fast service and great price. 
16833 Great rain/dust cover but unfortunately it is too large for my Nikon D3100. Thank you for the fast shipping!! 
16834 Does a good job of lighting up the front door for the security cameras. Cheap but works...I m happy. 
16835 Excellent value and amazing performance. My money was well spent! It is still flying well with no damage after 40+ flights of 7 minutes each.. 
16836 Ordered 5 p.m. and received 11 a.m. the next day. AMAZING!! The batteries came fully charged and carefully packaged. They fit into the camera perfectly (Casio x-s10). I can t tell you about the charger yet, but the entire purchase was 100% worth it. 
16837 I am very happy with this lens. It makes a great addition to my camera kit. Takes nice close-ups of flowers and plants which was my main reason in purchasing it. The filters that were sold with it are also good to have, as well as the cleaning kit. 
16838 Everything is blurred when the Magnifier is attached. Looks great when looking through it alone, but once attached, it s useless, unless you want blurred pictures. However, customer service was excellent o deal with. 
16839 Works great! 
16840 fits 
16841 It worked well for it s price. Not the best but not the worst. 
16842 Have been taking practice shots and the camera is very easy to use. 
16843 thankyou 
16844 Great film. 
16845 The metal strap was scratched (looked like a used product was sent) and crooked covering a half of the camera window, and as you can see on the picture it shows that is comes with a 16GB card what actually is a lie, there was no card at all 
16846 I have not had to use this protection plan but it is always good to have in case you need it. 
16847 This was the first flash kit ive ever bought and they work amazing! 
16848 The camera produced no signal, or was incompatable with my DVR of same mfr. Return process of defective product was very simple. I will probably order another 
16849 Have no tried it in the field yet bit seems sturdy. Using it with a Sony A5000. 
16850 I debated a case for the Phantom Pro 3 for about a month and am lucky I didn t damage it; this backpack works well - and keeps the unit secure. A must have to protect your gear. 
16851 Just received 2 of these. This item is falsely advertised it does not have 30 constant LED lights ,It has 1 very bright blinking red light. 
16852 It does what it s supposed to. Works fine. The tilt seems a little chintzy with the clicking you hear as it passes what I assume are &#34;notches&#34; somewhere, but it s working and tilting just fine. 
16853 Works great with my Canon hf g20, I only wish I had another camera so that I can purchase another on!!! 
16854 Battery charger works well and was a good price, too. Arrived in good shape on date when promised. 
16855 Had no problems with this. Worked like OE battery. I would buy another one. 
16856 Camera gets haze after a few months and amazon won t replace it. Not happy 
16857 Great product. Worked as expected. Easy enough for a 10 year old to use. So far only used on a video camera and worked without any problem. 
16858 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
16859 I ve said it over and over.. you can t go wrong with B&W. I am tough on my gear and B&W is always there when o th her brands fail. Quality glass and top construction. 
16860 Was not up to the dimensions advertised and not adequate for my needs. 
16861 Works great .easily recharges 
16862 Works up to about 60 feet for me. The only negative was that it took about 3 weeks to arrive from Australia. I would order another one. The good part is that it works on a 9v battery. 
16863 Eh. Kinda useless. Props still broke in a pretty mild crash. 
16864 For the price it works great!!! 
16865 works good put around our garden to scare deer out 
16866 Butter-smooth shots with my GoPro HERO3. Easy to use, but reco buying the Neewer Feiyu 2PCS Ultra Reach Carbon Fiber poles also for some nice different POV shots. 
16867 great seller - delivered as promised! 
16868 Very poor!!!! There s no reason to buy this product/item.... 
16869 ok. 
16870 I purchased this to use my 77mm Hoya ND filter on my 67mm Canon Macro Lens. The construction is solid. I m very picky in regards to what I put on my lenses, and I have no concerns using this adapter. 
16871 Wasabi Power is the best aftermarket brand battery maker I have ever owned. They just work. 
16872 Problems with quality. Audio is crap.. 
16873 It s okay but doesn t add too much difference to your regular lens. 
16874 Great value. Cheaper then the stories 
16875 Excellent product!!!!! 
16876 Great Product 
16877 Product arrived quickly as promised and works as advertised. I was able to tuck the clothes into various bags etc so as to have available to use on glasses, iPads etc. 
16878 Bought as a gift. For the price, it s an excellent set of binoculars. Little hard to adjust for comfortable viewing, but it s not hard to use. 
16879 Good economy spotting scope. 
16880 B+W and you don t worry about IQ degradation. 
16881 Exception Quality Glass. Doesn t introduce vignetting and is excellent for protecting your lens in harsh conditions. 
16882 a good camera. this was a good purchase. 
16883 This thing charges well and I have 2 extra batteries. Can t ask for more because shooting in the fly and having a dead battery this will Dave you time. Hasn t failed me now. 
16884 sets up really quick and easy. I like the size and resolution. 
16885 Very good 
16886 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
16887 it works so no issue with it 
16888 Pros: - Protects lens - Inexpensive Cons: - Feels a bit bigger than original Nikon cap; fits very tightly when in place - Doesn t clamp on as quickly as original cap; falls off a couple times before staying on 
16889 Works as advertised. Can always use additional protection. 
16890 it s okay for the price you pay. getting started the filter does the job, once you know how to use these tools you ll get a better one anyway - the one that covers the spectrum you desire for the scene you re after. 
16891 A great inexpensive alternative for the causal or semi-professional photographer. The battery continues to run well with moderate use. 
16892 a good back up camera if your SLR or smartphone dies on you while you re in the middle of recording. 
16893 These reflectors are exactly what I was looking for... I love that they are compact for travel and store easily. 
16894 My experience with this product has been excellent. It was delivered on time and was exactly what I expected based on the description on the Amazon website. 
16895 Just what I needed before taking a trip. The camera is about 6 years old. I ve been using the original battery since then. 
16896 Great item 
16897 This is great. Cheap price and good quality. 
16898 very easy to mount and setup. has good depth and wide angle. very clear picture both day and night. 
16899 great reflector - great price - no problems with it yet! 
16900 This is an excellent product. Shott Glass screen protectors cost a fortune. This is a well made, and good looking, alternative that is very cost effective. I ended up buying a second for another camera. 
16901 Great Product 
16902 Has a lot of features for the price, easy to operate, I think it is a lot better than my K-7 that cost more. 
16903 This is one &#34;great buy&#34;. for the money. Its an easy install with great built in features and the picture quality is excellent. I would highly recommend this product for all tech enthusiasts as well as parents with newborns for monitoring. 
16904 doesnt last long 
16905 Excellent 
16906 If you don t have this lens yet, what are you waiting for. Its a compact lens that has amazing clarity, and with a f/1.8 you cant beat that with a stick. It has the same quality feel an look you would expect from a Canon product. 
16907 product good 
16908 The camera is easy to use and carry in your pocket. I had it my pool and it worked fine. I m happy I made the choice and got it. 
16909 Very comfortable and floatable. Great product and great price. 
16910 Item worked exactly as intended, It enabled me to take photos and video of my snorkeling adventure in the Virgin Islands without worrying that I d lose my camera! 
16911 Perfect for my purpose 
16912 they work great 
16913 Recommend! Quickly detects someone in its view and alerts. Bought 3 of them! Great for anywhere around your home, set tones differently and quickly isolate the area you need to check. 
16914 Does exactly what it s meant to at a great price. Solid build and mounts firmly. Using with a 57mm 1.4 an no issues with aperture when on the mount. 
16915 Perfect 
16916 great value 
16917 Worked Perfectly for my Sony DSCHX90V/B Digital Camera 
16918 I had some issues trying to set up my foscam, and thanks to Danny all the installation went smooth. Great customer service thank you. The camera is looking sharp and I love the HD resolution. 
16919 quick service, product as advertised 
16920 Very good stuff 
16921 Remove the internal spacer and the fz70 snuggly fits in the case. Seems to be well padded and decent quality. 
16922 These are ok. I thought they would add it little more to photos, but I think they are really more just for photo gimic. 
16923 So easy to use! 
16924 The telescope itself works well after about 20 minutes of getting used to its adjustments the tripod however is flimsy trash. I believe 3 Lincoln logs would be sturdier. So before you buy just make sure you add a tripod to your order 
16925 Worked as expected. 
16926 This protective is very good. 
16927 Nice 
16928 Brought it as a gift and they love it 
16929 I bought this to wear a go pro while skiing with our group. Its a great way to wear under my jacket and have a hands free platform to capture our fun. Its well made and has plenty of adjustments to accommodate many situations. 
16930 This is great upgrade for any basic telescope. 
16931 It was simple to set up, the picture is excellent, and we ve especially appreciated having it during a crazy wildfire season. It gives us peace to be able to see our serene living room from a distance. 
16932 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
16933 Its solidly build all metal mount. I bought it to mount it on orion 15x70 and managed to do it and took really good pics of moon at night using this. 
16934 very happy with this easy to use- love the zoom - used a friends camera when we went on a cruise to Alaska took great pics- so I decided to purchase one for my next cruise- the package deal was a great find too! 
16935 Great solid tripod, better than expected for the price! 
16936 You can feel the difference by the packaging, but it won t stop there. The engineering and glass are really superior. It s worth it to have something of this quality on lenses you love and work so hard with. 
16937 The battery cuts out all the time. It says the battery is low then says it is full. 
16938 This camera works great. 
16939 BW the way to go 
16940 Very good 
16941 I love my new tripod, I didn t realize it would hold a camera and my phone! So affordable and it weighs close to nothing. Can t wait to take this bad boy on vacation. 
16942 I like it, its great for the price. It can be a little unstable when you a light and a sandbag on it raised high, its just smaller diameter metal poles. works great for a beginners boom stand though, would recommend 
16943 Hard to download 
16944 I have set them up to email me and also to ftp on my nas and it all works as it should be. 
16945 Works well but have had some issues using with Canon Rebel. It caused some issues with screen. Had to call Canon. Bottom line, must shut down camera totally before taking battery out. 
16946 The camera was as easy as the thermostat and smoke detector to set up. We had no issues. I would like ability to pan and tilt the camera remotely. 
16947 Works as intended! Great price too. 
16948 everything i expected it to be, took awhile to learn all of the settings but it is very beginner friendly. ISO above 400 or 800 gets grainy fast. 
16949 Works pretty well. However Feiyu support doesn t answer all questions. For example, why you can t trim the forward position even though you can trim the other axis. 
16950 Great Camera. I use of it for work and research. It s user friendly and very light. 
16951 Bought a second set of these cables and I sm very happy with the service and fast delivery. 
16952 I love this light box - takes a little while to put together, but worth it! I can take pictures of all the craft projects I do anytime! 
16953 Camera requires a ridiculous amount of focusing, pictures are blurry, it takes 3 or 5 times to get a non-blurry photo. Recording is blurry too. Just cheap and bad. It s a headache to just take one simple picture with this thing 
16954 Good job. 
16955 Great!!!!!! 
16956 I bought this unit when mine stopped working as a replacement , because the last time it went out, I had no phone and no internet.and I had to wait for 10 days before getting a new one from my provider, this is my backup unit. 
16957 excellent power for operation of camera 
16958 kept dropping off the network 
16959 Works just fine - a great lower cost alternative to the branded unit. 
16960 Protects the camera from Water but the audio does get muffled enough to the point where it s not very useful. Construction isn t great but it does the job 
16961 Horrible underwater quality, will be returning it. 
16962 Can t go wrong for price; primary work is macro. Bought to replace a similar unit that broke after less than a year. Only odd thing is the backside depression where your forefinger rests has locating nubs. It would be more intuitive to have the nubs on the trigger button. 
16963 Fast delivery! really good fit! all edges lined up. Thank you 
16964 Works as well as the name brand but much more economical! Please with our purchase. (Does fit tightly in the battery compartment so sometimes needs an extra push to get it to pop out). I would purchase again! 
16965 Seems to work as well as my OEM battery at a substantially lower price. Hard to beat that. 
16966 Wouldn t hold a charge longer than 20 minutes in the cold. the picture was acceptable and would have been fine if the battery would stay charged longer. 
16967 nice product for the price. love it. 
16968 bought it as a gift for my daughter, she loves it! 
16969 They get 2 stars because they are indeed waterproof. But picture quality is terrible- bad color, not sharp, and expensive to process (not too many film processors out there these days!). Don t waste the money unless it s for a kid to play around. 
16970 perfect replacement for the hood on my fuji 23mm 1.4, looks like a stock item. 
16971 This works great! 
16972 glad i got three, plastic and cheap they are i have broke 2 already hoping the 3rd one last until I get my aluminum ones i ordered 
16973 perfect 
16974 was worried that my battery would not fit.... I was delighted when it did. 
16975 Super socks and do stay dry. 
16976 I love this camera!!!! I m never without it!!!! The size is perfect and it takes the most fantastic pictures on Auto!!!! I just hold on to it!!! 
16977 This camera worked, but it wasn t very easy to open the compartment to change the batteries. The batteries also seemed to die out fast. I wouldn t recommend this camera. 
16978 This ring fits well with both sets of threads, no issues whatsoever with this stepping ring. 
16979 I love it. .... 😆 
16980 Exceptional quality for the price. Easy (and fast) to assemble to put to good use in the studio. 
16981 Wish I could see more! its probably just me--- over all easy assembly. 
16982 SMALL, COMPACT, AND PORTABLE.... I like it because its nots a big bag and I can just swing it over the shoulders. Has a enough space for small compact camera, charger, cables, batteries, memory cards and several micro fiber cloths. 
16983 Works great for my SJ4000 camera. 
16984 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
16985 Great filter for the price !! 
16986 Amazing 
16987 Horrible. Yea it mounts up nice, but once you get driving along, it creaks and rattles so badly I had to take it down. The mounting threads are weak too and will strip if you tighten too tight. I threw mine out. 
16988 So far they seem to be very reliable. I ve used them on a couple of jobs and they have worked flawlessly. Time will tell if these were a good investment. 
16989 Was missing the leather &#34;guard&#34; that would keep the attachment ring from scratching the camera - I found something else 
16990 High quality. 
16991 Incredible product, seems to be new, but some screens have problems with resolution, but not much to worry about. Some adaptors also don t match 
16992 The batter did arrive promptly and did charge. Assuming it holds it s charge, I ll change to 5 stars. Great price, fast service. 
16993 fantastic product! 
16994 I miss the viewfinder and you can t take pictures while are filming. In all other features, the camera is great. Wifi is nice, you can take selfi with your camera and send to Internet easily. 
16995 It is really easy to install and quick to understand. The video quality is not the best, but you can see everything clearly. I don t know why their are the negative reviews, maybe they are not tech savvy. 
16996 Can we say generic?? 
16997 Great camera. Does everything they said it would do. 
16998 These Marumi filters have gotten good reviews, and I have no complaints. They are well-made and work well. 
16999 Good camera. Nice resolution. However, occasionally loses connection to my D-Link AC1750 wireless router which is very close by. A pain to repower when power cord is not within easy reach outside. 
17000 It does exactly what it was made to do. The auto adapter cable is a nice bonus. 
17001 present for grandaughter, loves it 
17002 product as advertised, very good 
17003 Fantastic camera. Cannot believe all that it can do. Easy to set-up and use Beside all that the pictures a fantastic 
17004 Love it. 
17005 Awesome deal 
17006 Thanks 
17007 Does what its intended to do and fits the instax 7s perfectly, with room to store film 
17008 Pretty but so complicate to find how it works, I just want to return it because I try record so many time and this one do not work. The instructions are vague. I still trying to figure out how it works. Never record anything 
17009 exactly like the original 
17010 I got this item on a discounted price. I found it really helpful for my presentations and projections. I use this to hold my iphone and project it to the screen just like any projector. 
17011 Clever design and very sturdy. Easy to add to your bag without weighing you down. 
17012 OEM replacement for the Panasonic LX7 and Leica D Lux 6. These cameras are identical, and the batteries are as well/ 
17013 Very solid with great optical quality 
17014 This is a great item just as good as rocket fish with the clarity but much cheaper. 
17015 Love this strap. Would buy again if I had more cameras 
17016 so fun! 
17017 Used them for our wedding and worked out Great!! 
17018 Does the job. Effective on my Rokinon Lenses. Would buy again. 
17019 Its good 
17020 Very good quality, easy to set up, and easy to use. All good stuff here. No complaints. Have been using for about a month now and no issues to report. 
17021 Nice Product works as expected ! 
17022 Charges great. Nice replacement. 
17023 I have been using this for a while now on boats, on bikes, and underwater. It has worked wonerfully and the quality is great. 
17024 Nice addition. 
17025 Leaps and bounds better than built in D5200 microphone. It looks great too! Fantastic buy for the price I have some tests on my youtube channel https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqrVuiG7FXg https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9rpSp02sbOU Both of these videos were filmed with the mic!! 
17026 I needed a new battery for my Nikon D100. This battery works great. Good price, fast service. 
17027 saved me a lot of time and headache!!!!!! worked great! 
17028 Good replacement at a good price. 
17029 Very tight fit. You have to be careful when squeezing the camera in without any lens attached. It will cover the base quite well from any scratches. 
17030 it s nice 
17031 Worked as intended, kept water out :) 
17032 They do the job. Great price. 
17033 really can not see the details on the coins like I expected. 
17034 Best mirrorless camera I ever owned. In fact, I would put it up against my much more expensive DSLRs. Outstanding features second to none. Especially like the fast continuous shooting and focus. 
17035 This is a great product if you use in bright sunlight. Love it 
17036 It s a case...It does what it does well. But I love the design, wished there were more options though. The product showed up on time it was packaged professionally. 
17037 I appreciate how light and thin it is - easier to tuck in my AC bag 
17038 The batteries that came with the charger do not fit the charger. It was returned. 
17039 Best price I ve paid yet. So much cheaper then instores 
17040 exactly as expected and arrived super quick! 
17041 Ok for the price 
17042 Its a little smaller than I expected but I love the bag. The many outside pockets make up for the small interior. 
17043 A bit pricey, but I used during vacation in Mexico during the summer with success. Going from AC to outside and including snorkeling with 20 dives. No fog at all. It was worth the price to come back with good quality video. 
17044 Nice looking camera case. Very protective. Its a little awkward to flip open and let front drop ... I have to hold it out of the way. Still Its a nice case with a placed to screw my monipod. 
17045 Love this bag. Great for photographers who don t always have somewhere to sit the bag down to get something out of it. One of the waist bet straps came out of the adjuster, but it was an easy fix. 
17046 I have a Nikon coolpix P600 and these are a great fit with quick shipping. I am so happy with these lenses. I have been out everyday since i received them, trying them out. Cant wait until i actually set these up with a tripod. 
17047 Quick, easy, cheap green screen. You ll have to iron it out before use (just a note). 
17048 Works well even up to 90/100 feet and is very well made. 
17049 So far the camera seems fine, all early shots are great. However the additional items in the package were either rather pointless (ear buds to clean the lens!), or useless, such as the camera case which was too small for the camera, and the strap which did not fit. 
17050 These are a fantastic value, and I have had no issues charging them, putting them in the GoPro, or removing them from the camera. The charger also charges the standard GoPro battery, which is great. I ll definitely be buying more of these. 
17051 Fits what I need wish there were more pockets to store the extras. 
17052 Best Camera bag ever! 
17053 Very usable,perfect match for the camera 
17054 great camera 
17055 So much for easy installation! More than 3 weeks later still can t figure out how to install them and have to hire someone to do it :-( 
17056 Working well. Easy installation. This is the 3rd camera I bought 
17057 Works as expected! 
17058 This worked perfectly for cleaning my mirrorless camera sensor. All of the tools I needed in one kit. 
17059 amazing pictures 
17060 Mine came with a baffle. I put it together in five minutes. Brilliant product for my needs. 
17061 Easy to install and remove. Effectively blocks most glare and locks securely on lens. 
17062 Great!!!! 
17063 Works perfect on Nikon and off camera in S-mode. Bonus that it can be triggered by another flash going off. Build quality good. Only negative is that it over exposes slightly when used on camera in iTTL, though it is easily fixed by compensating. A real bargain at the price. 
17064 I really liked this Camera Case. 
17065 this is not what I thought it was. I didn t send it back because it cost more to ship it back than to purchase it. 
17066 Not delivered as advertised advertising five separate screens received one screen and a case that have different colors on it but not individual screen. this eliminates the ability I m doing a photoshoot with two different screens at one time 
17067 Very good 
17068 Works ok not consistent with exposure 
17069 okey 
17070 This is the best security camera i would have ,very easy to connect and is stil working well.I have no regret of buying it. 
17071 Very good 
17072 Work perfect very satisfied with it 
17073 This is only for the camera and strap. There is no lense, no flash, no bag. I was informed after my order was made that this is not what will really be sent. 
17074 It is exactly what I needed. It installed easily and feel secure. As for eForceCity they stood behind their product. The first shipment never reached me, they resent the item and I received it as promised. 
17075 Great 
17076 Synergy Digital substituted an EXPIRED OFF BRAND battery for the listed Synergy battery listed with no resolution. Beware ...you might not get what you purchased! 
17077 Great camera. Did an install for a salon & it works great. Very good picture quality too. Recommended. 
17078 This is the best floating handle on the market. I use it for my Bahamas trip and it work as intended on the pool and ocean snorkeling. 
17079 good float. 
17080 After struggling with the original finderscope and many replacements of same with no success, I finally bought this one and was able to align immediately. 
17081 Five star 
17082 the battery died after only taking 37 pictures. I was at a batchlorette party and missed all the good picture. Very sad. 
17083 If you need glasses at all, even just specs, this is a great tool 
17084 A little more skinny & spindley than I had hoped... But if you don t put a lot of weight on it or bump it during slow exposure, it should be fine. 
17085 Works great, functional, and at a good price. 
17086 This is a great solution to the lens cap issue. 
17087 Works just as good as the OEM batteries. No camera errors. 
17088 Sheds bad... Even after washing.. But photographs beautifully!! I might try combing it out.. 
17089 great batteries 
17090 Good Product for Such an Economical Price. 
17091 Excellent product quality, arrived on time and well packaged. Would definitely recommend if you want to design your own case layout 
17092 I bought these batteries to replace the ones that came with our dog s bark collar. They work but don t seem to work as long as other alkaline batteries. 
17093 I used it with my Kowa spotting scope at the shooting range. Worked great. Used it to photograph the northern likes with my Canon 70D. Worked great! I used for bird watching. Got great eagle shots. Very steady and versatile. 
17094 I loved it. I think this is awesome for the price. 
17095 Works awesome as advertised 
17096 Bought this for my husband for his Celestron NexStar 6E telescope. The scope, arm and base fit just fine on one side with pouches for accessories on the other side. This is a nice case. Spend the extra money on it. 
17097 Great VND filter! Works wonders on the BMCC, since it doesn t have an IR filtration itself. Highly recommend it. I haven t seen any video degradation in my footage while using this filter. In fact, my favorite footage that I ve ever shot using this filter. 
17098 Much better quality than a $60 tripod I purchased from Best Buy. I am very pleased with the quality of this product. 
17099 I ordered this for my Nikon D40 and the lens caps don t fit on the lens at all and the adapter is way to small to even fit on my camera. this was such a waste of money 
17100 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
17101 This is an awesome product. I can email photos to it. No more cables from the computer to the frame required. 
17102 Great deal! 
17103 Cable gives me super clear audio through my gopro hero 3+ black. It gives both engine audio and radio audio. Postage was also very fast to the UK. Very easy to use. 
17104 great bag, very sturdy/comfortable 
17105 It worked for a couple days. Now wont turn on. Battery is ok. 
17106 Item came without the cord that hooks the camera to a computer. Please send ASAP. Thank you! 
17107 This kit had most everything I needed to get me started with my GoPro fast shipping as always and packed perfectly.Great price!! 
17108 This goes in my husbands nikon and he is very happy with it. 
17109 Awesome! 
17110 Does exactly what it s supposed to. 
17111 Pretty good, but I ended up with a Tamron 18-270 VC which in my opinion offers slightly better image quality and obviously a killer range. 
17112 I d give it 5 stars except for the directions which are unintelligible. Very poor translation. Equipment works great so far. Revised 7/1/16. I m now giving this one star because it failed after less than one year. 
17113 I have been testing the cameras, now can suggest that aly004 with onvif technology is faster than p2p camera, the wifi setup is easier configure with lan cable using the software or the app, for now setup throught browser its not avaible. the camera works perfect 
17114 It s amazing ! My wife loved it. 
17115 Bought these for a Christmas gift, they re okay. Sturdy enough for the price, but even with all four set up, it s hard to get natural tones and eliminate shadows.. 
17116 Everything as advertised. Good quality. Good customer follow up. Highly recommended. 
17117 It does the job. Its a bit too fragile for my liking. Then again, the price is unbeatable. Had i known though, i would have bought a better, sturdier tripod. 
17118 Great kit! 
17119 Excellent filters they work great ! take photos during the worst high sub hours without washout. 
17120 best deal out there, great camera have used underwater with great results 
17121 Cute....no selfie mirror though 
17122 Great product very reliable, do not buy the wireless I have seen them fail in the field twice. 
17123 :) 
17124 Does not record video only audio, horrible item 
17125 Great DVR system. It would have gotten 5 stars if it had the hiddns ddns option. Excelente video quality and great mobile app. My customers are very pleased with this system. 
17126 Good battery for its price. 
17127 This stand works great! Much larger than I thought it was going to be! 
17128 Fits my nikon 17-55 perfectly! Great product from a very reputable brand/company! A must have! 
17129 Great addition to the Orion 4.5 StarBlast, fills the gap between the 6mm and the 15mm nicely. 
17130 Great product!! Would recommend to any Drone Pilot! 
17131 my nephew loves it 
17132 It s just what I needed. 
17133 Works as Advertised...love it... 
17134 Use on trips very nice. 
17135 Klarus!!! It doesn t get any better! A reliable tactical flashlight that allows single hand use! This should be the go to light for law enforcement! n 
17136 great did and still doing it job 
17137 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. update : night vision not working any more 9/25/2016 
17138 Makes shooting with the E-X1 a whole different experience. IMO, the camera should have been made with a better grip in the first place. 
17139 Came really quick, lens was great. Did a lot of research on this one and it s almost as good as the nikon counter part, the only difference is its a full stop darker sometimes, but can be adjusted through shutter or iso. Happy shooting! 
17140 This product worked great. We took it to Mexico and used it in the ocean, pool and while we were scuba diving. And it did float!! Super quality and worked great! 
17141 Great price and great quality. 
17142 Nice filters. 
17143 Great product! 
17144 Dog chewed up my old charger for my camcorder and this package came with everything I needed to start recording again at a great price. 
17145 Fairly light-weight, and holds the camera tightly. 
17146 My kid s love this looking at the pictures on the camera is not the best but when you upload them they are great and capture all the fun and smiles. I will be getting another for my other kid 
17147 Bought it for back-up when we travel 
17148 Very nice 
17149 Wonderful bag...needs wheels 
17150 It gives my baby power. Beautiful power and can t be angry with that......... 
17151 Works as expected. 
17152 A decent option for the SB-800 
17153 FAST shipping. Haven t been out to take some pictures with them, but I expect good results. 
17154 perfect perfect perfect 
17155 Great product 
17156 Bought it. Haven t had to use it. Can t say how good the response is to failure of the device. 
17157 8-in-1 for that price?! Hell yes. I use the selfie stick most out of everything. The chest one is pretty good. and so is the thing that like sticks on windows and surfaces haha. 
17158 Serviceable and attractive 
17159 It was great not flimsy at all for a low price! 
17160 Great buy! 
17161 The best of the best I use them for continuous lighting for cam shows and they are truly amazing!! 
17162 Great deal and they work perfectly. 
17163 Just wish I could open port 16 on my pc for full functionality. 
17164 god 
17165 Much crisper than the MKIII, a little slower but the sharpness is VERY noticeable. I shoot studio and landscape and a def worthwhile upgrade. I will hold onto my MKIII for now and sell when I used it for a month or so. 
17166 Nice build, light weight, but really to much trouble to use and adjust when I telescoping stick is so much more convenient 
17167 video quality is atrociously blurry, even when the subject is hardly moving. total waste of money 
17168 This is a great concept but an extremely cheap product. It s flimsy and the squeeker is tiny. I ll use a dollar store dog toy for the same effect. Not worth the price. Sending it back. 
17169 Seems to work real good as a dash can in car, you can also plug a power cord in it and run it all day long, also records over old video s. 
17170 The right battery for my Sp-100. Now I have two of them. I bought other batteries but they did not last. great battery. Steve 
17171 Heavy and not as much room as expected buy OK! 
17172 great price for oem battery. the Wasabi power batteries I have are much cheaper but perform at the same reduced rate, they do not hold charge nearly as long as the factory batteries. 
17173 The worst instruction ever. 
17174 It is the product I was looking for. Thanks! 
17175 Package arrived in perfect condition. 
17176 Works good 
17177 So far so good! But being my second one, you get what you pay for as well. Take careful care of the part that inserts into the camera when storing and you should get ample use out of it! 
17178 Missing parts 
17179 Very Good 
17180 It was what I wanted a little smaller than I thought but it is OK. 
17181 Perfect fit, focus to infinity ! 
17182 It works very well for me. I m satisfied in the video quality. Just need a noise reduction for the sound. If you put it in your motorcycle or bicycle and wind blows 30mph. You only hears loud wind and engine. But overall, it s ok. 
17183 Works great and easy to store away. In love with with gold one I recieved. Awesome kit if your looking for a selfie stick as well as a tripod. Very nice packaging also. Would make the perfect gift for any age 
17184 I love it 
17185 This is just what I want. JUST PERFECT FOR MY LENS. 
17186 Great clear pictures. Using with a Night Owl Dvr system. 1000tvl picture much clearer especially at night. Have 4 and would order more. 
17187 Just as expected!!! I love it! 
17188 This charger works fast and efficiently. Much better than having to plug in the whole camera. 
17189 Does not fit the Canon Powershot SX530 HS as stated by the seller. I wish i had read the other reviews before buying. A total waste of money. 
17190 I love the product, as I am using it to inspect small mineral growth. It s perfect for my use as I can take still pictures or video if needed. 
17191 Just a question. Since you can put a UV filter on the camera with the lens adapter, can you leave it on when the camera is turned off? I get tired of taking the camera s lens cap on and off. 
17192 About what you d expect for the price. 
17193 delivered exactly as the image 
17194 awesome piece for lens protection THIS IS A MUST, fits tightly, does a perfect job and it looks good on my camera .. now on a side note i feel this is something that should come with the camera already like every other camera around 
17195 Great bracket. Great people to work with. The remoter trigger release I received with the bracket didn t fit my Nikon D7100. Had to return it. Got full refund plus my return shipping charge. 
17196 Great camera great video excellent point and shoot 
17197 Very sharp lens. I was impressed. 
17198 good 
17199 It is good. And arrive quickly, thanks 
17200 very good pic quality, and at wery low cost and fast delivery 
17201 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
17202 I am very happy with my go pro camera very good value with all the asecssories 
17203 Great value. Love this camera! 
17204 Fantastic on the go tripod I use it all the time when I got out and can t bring my regular tripod 
17205 I love my camera. Very happy with the quick delivery. The seller was great. Thank you. 
17206 Like it a lot 
17207 ok 
17208 I love my camera. I suggest if you aren t familiar with this camera that you read up on its usage. The company did not adhere to the timeline set forth from them with sending the package. 
17209 i wish it came with big enough back drops, they are not big enough at all, everything else is 100% 
17210 Didn t fit the camera I got it for, but still found a way to make it work. 
17211 The color as same as photo👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻 
17212 Works without a problem with my Sony minicam. The only reason not five stars is that the charger can hold only one battery at a time. I would have loved to be able to charge both at the same time. 
17213 These lights are great. I bought one for every closet, and one above front door keyhole. Everyone who walks in my front door asks me where I got it. 
17214 good product 
17215 Good quality and works as described. 
17216 Great quality, cleans well and can be washed and used many times over. 
17217 I ve never been able to take such amazing pictures before with any other camera. Best camera I ve ever had! 
17218 Excelent product 
17219 great buy for the money 
17220 Exactly as described, fit my Canon Rebel Xti like a glove. Very happy with the purchase 
17221 These sunglasses are outstanding they re great I haven t had any problems whatsoever I would just like to say thank you for such a great product at such a great price 
17222 Hard to put items in place 
17223 I absolutely love this camera and the bundle was much more than I anticipated. I had one small issue with one of the items in the bundle and Focus Camera replaced it almost immediately. 
17224 It does it s job. I find it is just a cheap feeling replacement. It often doesn t thread as nicely as the original Nikon HB-32 lens hood. The extra included microfiber is a nice addition, but doesn t make me feel any better about the lens hood. 
17225 Works very well, but very poor manual. We use it for an elderly person who is in hospice care. We get a good clear picture night or day from anywhere. If you leave your phone on all night to constantly monitor there is significant white noise from your phone. 
17226 Fit great... 
17227 Surprised! Very nice lens for a bargain price. I purchased it for my daughter s film class along with a used canon élan ii body and tested on a Rebel T4i with great results. 
17228 Works as intended, it s great. 
17229 Good 
17230 Works very well. I use this a lot and have had no issues with it. 
17231 Great technical support! Technician handled my request in an efficient, courteous, and professional manner. Camera works great both local and remote. 
17232 Works good havent had a ptoblem yet 
17233 Foscam seems to have stopped supporting their products. j 
17234 Awesome! 
17235 Works perfectly for my 50mm Nikon Lens. Thanks! 
17236 I bought this over 3 years ago and I love it still. If you still keep an old camera you know how easy it is to lose your charger. It comes in handy on trips or when you just need a little bit of juice. 
17237 Great work, and speedy delivery. 
17238 It was a birthday present for my son who has started a small photography business, and he is very pleased with the performance, while I was very pleased by the price. 
17239 was very happy with product, arrival was persise. 
17240 Awesome, best quad I have used. Having a memorial service for mine today. Taken out by a white SUV :( 
17241 Replaced a lost cable. It works well. 
17242 excellent product 
17243 Absolutely what I wanted!! 
17244 Great!! 
17245 Fits my camera perfect, really like having it protected and the extra space for more sd cards. 
17246 works as it is supposed to. 
17247 I used this camera to record the school musical. It was easy to use, light weight and produced a beautiful picture and sound. I do think it works best with a stand of some sort. My arm was tired holding it. I did get a stand. 
17248 Works great, fits well. 
17249 great! 
17250 Very handy. Each is individually packaged. 
17251 Paired with a couple Nikon flashes, no one would be able to look at the photo and say &#34;You didn t spend $500 on that flash you used.&#34; 
17252 Works great, suction is strong. I have used it mounting my GoPro to my Mustang when racing and it s never fallen off. Even mounted to the side of my car it stays on. 
17253 Low light performance is unacceptable. 
17254 Ok 
17255 will order from them again. was exactly as what was posted 
17256 A OK.... 
17257 Perfect camera 
17258 Camera seems to work fine, but is not a US version. From what I m reading this is a version from a different country and has no warranty here in the US...... 😯 
17259 Would not set up with windows 8.1 I returned it. I spent way too much time trying to set this up. Not a plug n play camera... 
17260 Works. Could be a little clearer 
17261 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
17262 cheaper made than I thought but it was only like 10 or 11 bucks 
17263 Best selfie decision ever 
17264 This is not your same old peel stick sheild it is much better go on line see how they say to put it on take the time it is worth it and the sheild fits great 
17265 This camera is junk. You get what you pay for. Could not for the life of me get it to work correctly. Would not recognize my SD card and could not get it to connect to my computer. 
17266 Cheap and great quality. I lost my old one for my 2007 Canon Powershot. I was glad to find one here on Amazon. 
17267 This bag is a great bag, I knew it was a good choice the second i opened the package. it seems to be of solid construction. 
17268 I have only had this for a few days, but the batteries work (have to be charged when they arrive, no biggie), The charger seems to work. The package arrived on time and in good condition. The price was great. We have the cybershot WX9. 
17269 This is a very good camera case and i would highly recommend it. 
17270 cheap, holds long charge, good quality. 
17271 This is the only battery I use for my camera. It is a long lasting battery, holds it charge very well. I recommend this battery highly. 
17272 As advertised, was shipped and arrived in a timely manner. Would purchase again 
17273 Absolutely no customer support. Software is crap. 
17274 Battery works like a charm! delivery was very quick!!!! 
17275 Great product, however wasn t shipped on time. 
17276 Excellent camera!! 
17277 seems to work fine so far 
17278 Awesome if you have more than one battery. You always have one charged and ready to go 
17279 Outstanding product. Delivered quickly and the instructions are very simple. Now looking for soft case to store this product on my Tokina 16-28mm lens. 
17280 This selfie stick came just as pictured .Works great with my iPhone 5s syncs to Bluetooth feature .Perfect for traveling and being packed away as its compact size allows for easy storage ! Zoom feature is awesome .Takes great group pictures I recommend this product 
17281 Very sharp lens. Produces some really great images on the Nikon D810. 
17282 does all that is advertised so far... 
17283 Perfect for my 8ch DVR 
17284 Purchased for a friend, His D5200 was always draining the factory battery. I purchased this brand for My Canon & was so pleased, I got one for His Nikon. 
17285 Cheaply made. 
17286 I have only had this for four months and used it for three indoor shoots. The AC power cord stopped working in the middle of the third shoot. Very frustrating that I cannot return....this product stinks! $300 down the drain! 
17287 Got these lights very fast. Great price for such versatile lights. Came well packaged and the lights perform very well. The fact that these lights are portable and battery operated too is a plus! Helps out lots for outdoors shoots. Very satisfied customer 
17288 This camera has more than everything you will need. The tripod is a little weak, and the bag a little small... but the lens options and the wireless mic make this an ideal camera for quick filming and interview pieces. 
17289 smells horrible 
17290 Easy to install. I just put it on and it looks good so far. Decent price. Fast shipping. 
17291 Love the product. Made it so much easier having back-up batteries...and ones that last longer than my original one!! I highly recommend this valuable deal! 
17292 fits iPhone onto strap. 
17293 Great backdrop we used at our wedding! Quick shipping too! 
17294 Perfect and great price! Just what I needed. 
17295 Just received this item a few days ago and I am very pleased. It is exactly like the GoPro version, but for less than half the cost. It is very sturdy and easy to use. 
17296 Lens with good quality optics. However, the focus mechanism seems noisy & always try very hard with AF. Noisy barrel synonymous to poor quality control. May need to send back for either exchange or repair. 
17297 Love it 
17298 It did not fit my Canon G16 as stated it would, had to return it. 
17299 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
17300 Good strap! 
17301 Good package for a first timer with drones. 
17302 Its good. 
17303 Good product 
17304 No good bad quality even on HD wasted a lot of money on this pretty disappointed 
17305 my sister loves her camera takes excellent pictures and the picture quality is good 
17306 Performed as expected. Great for lithium batteries. 
17307 Its a great lens but very heavy. Pictures are sharp. 
17308 Only problem is screws are not stainless 
17309 Great value!!! So much fun to shoot with! Lots of useful tools came in the package. 
17310 I love my new Nikon. 
17311 all within expectation... 
17312 The camera does not take clear pictures. I can no longer return it and can t get a hold of the seller. 
17313 great price, lasted 5 months and will not hold a charge now 
17314 Wonderful! 
17315 Pure class. A Leica M6 with this strap slung around the neck and shoulder look as much like a major fashion statement as it is functional. Perfect. 
17316 Every piece of my New Nikon D7100 fits perfect in my new Backpack and it s comfy so far. Thank you 
17317 Works well 
17318 Great lens for the price. 
17319 Works. Bends. Stiff. Durable. 
17320 Nice Umbrella s. Work as expected. 
17321 Its nice and i thought it had a button and stuff but be careful what u buy 
17322 Works good but it s not too comfortable to use it. 
17323 Did NOT fit the Canon PowerShot G7X AT ALL. I wrote to them saying I wasn t going to bother with shipping it back. 
17324 Very solid and well constructed. Would buy again. 
17325 Good product. Would have given it 5 stars if it had a screw on ring to connect a carabineer. 
17326 good stuff 
17327 doesn t fit the lens. 
17328 Easy to get, cheaper by far than others I found 
17329 kenneth helped me greatly with my camera. I love foscam cameras. Customer service will talk you through and walk you through the issues you may have. 
17330 Great product 
17331 my husband loves the camera 
17332 Help protect my canon 70 D from rain. 
17333 I LOVE THIS CAMERA BAG. 
17334 Pretty good design, plenty of padding, but the top strap broke loose on the first use. 
17335 Poor quality, sound was spotty... Sometimes it worked sometimes it did not. Nest is better. 
17336 Just FYI ... With this camera or any camera you plan to use indoors for outdoor survalience, buy an inexpensive 55mm or smaller Polarized lens filter and figure out a way to gently attach it. This removes 90% of &#34;window glare&#34; from the equation. 
17337 Does the job. I carry this in the belt pouch with my filters so it always at hand. No problems with it. Great product at a great price. 
17338 Good 
17339 Durable and lightweight. Great product. 
17340 Great!! 
17341 Amazing. Does everything it claims to. 
17342 i got to alaska with my package and realized...NO charger was included and all the shops we went to did not have chargers...should have just bought in person 
17343 Works perfectly speedy shipping 
17344 Item was better than I thought! Extremely pleased! 
17345 This has been very difficult to hook up and view out side of the home. The software is typical import stuff that seems to have been quickly throw together. 
17346 Fits like OEM eyecup. Good deal! 
17347 Awesome and affordable.Recomend it for starters 
17348 Great quality and strength. I ve used this for multiple shoots through cities over the course of 15 hours. Holds up well, feels decent on back 
17349 10 points. everything was as expected 
17350 Took this white water rafting and stayed on my life vest the whole time. The clip is very tight, sometimes even a little difficult but perfect to secure a camera. 
17351 This is a great product! Affordable and fast shipping. I really only needed the dust blower to clean my camera. The extra accessories were bonus! Would recommend and would buy again from this seller. 
17352 Great remote trigger, the button has a slide lock for shooting bulb. Nothing to complain about. 
17353 Good carry-gopro-bag! 
17354 Product is fantastic. I highly recommend. A good value and works perfectly. Software is flawless. 
17355 excellent product, very satisfied with tripod. 
17356 Good 
17357 very good item delivered as expected. 
17358 A very clever and useful tool for dolly shots 
17359 attaches easily and securely. 
17360 Installation is simple and easy. Like others said, the sticky tape provided is not good and used 3M extreme mounting tape. All sensors are working with factory settings. No issue. 
17361 I got my order on time and it was.perfect 
17362 Takes great pictures 
17363 an inexpensive and super wide lens 
17364 Very happy with this purchase. 
17365 Good build and design. Tripod mount is metal under center of lens. No block on speaker and LCD monitor tilts downward and upwards. Good weight balance with XF23. Feels good in my hands better than Fuji hand grip MHG-XT10 especially with bigger lens like XF56. 
17366 It works perfectly. 
17367 Camera worked Great I love it so much. Shipping was only 10 days. I would definitely recommend this camera 
17368 Wife loves it. 
17369 Worked fine, but would sometimes stick when trying to extend, and was difficult to fix. 
17370 Exactly what i wanted to replace the one i broke. 
17371 Works as expected. Great to have the camera working again. 
17372 work great 
17373 Perfect just exactly the safety we were needing. 
17374 Bought for a 8 year old fishing nut and he loves it! Caught his biggest fish shortly after receiving this camera! 
17375 Lenses caps fit tightly, and the elastic band is strong. I have one of these on each of my lenses, as I do a lot of active shots. This is a great buy. 
17376 perfect 
17377 except for the labeling, battery is exactly the same as the one that came with the camera. Charged it up and away I went. Works great. Nice to have a spare so you don t have to be charging all the time. 
17378 Smaller and not as stretchy as the write-ups imply. 
17379 Everything was a presented. i thought the case was a little bigger but my wife says it s fine and she is the one using it.. 
17380 This grip works great and easy to use. Slides on without any problems. Does add some bulkyness to the camera. Did not break and was not defective. 
17381 Worked well on my dive trip. 
17382 This product was as advertised. Everything was present and the shipping was on time. Having only played around with most of the features of this kit, I would say that I m impressed with its quality and price. 
17383 great lens 
17384 LOVE IT! My lens arrived on time and came in perfect condition. The box was wrapped as if it was brand new. The Lens had no scratches on it. Definitely worth the price. 
17385 My 7-year old Cyber-shot camera died and I was glad I could replace it with one that was similar: pretty much the same features and operation, uses same card and battery, not too expensive. It will be way cool if I can squeeze 7 years out of this one. 
17386 this quadcopter is amazing! the camera is super clear and stable in flight. the controls are a cinch to handle. Its great in wind and will stay very stable using the gps. really, its incredible. Photos are super clear. 
17387 Love it! 
17388 Really good 
17389 Great service, quick ship. Product packaged really, really well. So far the product performs as I expected. No complaints! 
17390 Excellent polarizer. Build quality is good. Does an amazing job at removing reflections (see attached photos). One must be mindful of the exposure time however as it does darken the image some and the best way to compensate without having to use a tripod is to increase ISO. 
17391 Nothing fancy, but for the price you can t beat it. It fits my canon g7x. 
17392 This camera was working as advertised for 2-3 years, but this summer, I took it to the beach and water got into the camera (LCD screen area) even though the latch was locked. Now the camera doesn t work. 
17393 Fits my camera-plenty of room to add on devices. 
17394 The camera arrived on time. Took on vacation this summer. Takes very good pictures and the price was right. 
17395 Camera does not work and phone app does not recgnize camera. Two thumbs down!!! 
17396 Very good 
17397 My 15 yo daughter loves it! 
17398 Just what I wanted for a great price! 
17399 I use this frequently when I am taking landscapes. It weighs nothing, is simple to connect, and works flawlessly. Cable is just the right length. 
17400 Package deal with all the extras for your new camera 
17401 They hold sand like they re supposed to. 
17402 I am starting in DSLR cameras and the Nikon D3200 is perfect for beginners who wanto to grow at fast rate. 
17403 I use camera batteries as fast as I can charge them. These Vivitar batteries last as long as my Canon batteries & these are A Lot cheaper in cost! I use them in my Canon SX700 HS. Also fast shipping by seller. 
17404 was supposed to be color, but the prints come out almost sepia. would not buy again. 8 prints for over 20.00 should be good quality 
17405 absolutely SOLID !!!! my original broke while skiing, it ruins the day it is well worth the peace of mind. feels heavier but it isnt. 
17406 I was happy with my lens filter 
17407 great camera 
17408 Fits tight but not to tight 
17409 Works fine for what I needed it for. 
17410 Fits perfectly in the hot shoe on my A6000 
17411 Camera works great! Software is smooth. Easy to connect. Update: This camera sends all of your video to the &#34;Cloud&#34; located in China. If you are into privacy I suggest you try a camera that connects to your home WiFi network rather than directly to the Internet. 
17412 Fits well. Keeps things clean. 
17413 Nice camera for the price. Be aware that it comes in at 240, the 933 cameras come in at 480, so this is not quite as sharp. Does the job for what I need, tho I do wish I would have known this before I bought it. 
17414 Great device for controlling lights! Representative AR004627 was a great help on DLINK 
17415 Wonderful product. We use it on our binos. Great quality. Love the soft neck strap. 
17416 I m using this with a Fuji X-E1 - works great. 
17417 SUPER PRODUCTO 
17418 Works great, has a few quirks to get used to. 
17419 Gets the job done but the instructions are not very good! Tilt function did not work. 
17420 Great product have been using it for years. 
17421 Item shipped was not as described/pictured. 
17422 Still going strong, after all these years. Great quality and design. Very light weight too. Great for trips and special occasions. 
17423 Good 
17424 Works great, suitable for close recording in low light areas. 
17425 Thanks! 
17426 Great camera. PTZ and connects with wifi about 200 feet away. 
17427 These things really are magic. We use ours to remote mount cameras and flashes at weddings. The versatility of this arm is amazing... and worth every penny. 
17428 As described! Better than expected! 
17429 This battery replaces one that been in use for a couple of years... best recommendation I can give. 
17430 Good camera case but wish had more space to get extra SD cards etc 
17431 It works as expected! 
17432 Cap perfectly fits and has a very good quality, almost as good as original one, also it has a hole and a string to attach it to camera, its very helpful 
17433 This soft box is great for the price! It was easy to set up and does the job well. Getting it back in the pouch was a little hard but the same could be said about 99% of these things! 
17434 Item just as stated. Worked perfectly 
17435 So good The best color calibration tool 
17436 The battery is good so far. I will find out more when I take them to a long vacation next week. The battery can only be charge with the Nikon Coolpix W130 NOT W120. Don t know why? 
17437 My sister in law loves it and is easy to use if you are familiar with smart phones. 
17438 Neither of the batteries worked in my camera even though they were the correct type and model, 
17439 Sturdy step up ring, nothing fancy, does what it needs to do. Bundled cleaning cloth is a bonus. 
17440 Good price, solid metal construction. Fits on my A7S well and it is easy enough to take off. No light leaks that I can see. 
17441 Night vision sucks everything else a+ 
17442 I like it, it s small 
17443 Nifty 50 works great on my Canon Rebel T3i! 
17444 keeps popping off 
17445 Perfect fit work great! 
17446 Pretty good, for the price. Not the best quality mask or camera, but it has lasted a couple of years and it captured some good memories. 
17447 Great price for getting two backup batteries for my SX 510. 
17448 As far as the camera image quality is concerned, great, as well as the sound too. However, the lack of email alerts is a must have which this camera/software does not offer. The app you use with the cam is buggy at best at alerting you. 
17449 Super fun case 
17450 This contraption is perfect. Fits really snug and you can make any and all adjustments needed to get the perfect fit. My first time using this was for an alpine rollercoaster in Austria with no breaks. Solid and sturdy. Two thumbs up. 
17451 So far so good quality hardware. 
17452 Very cute album ! I thought it would be a little bigger but it s ok! 5 stars! 
17453 Bought a few times now. No problems at all. Everyone loves it at the party. 
17454 Good space, good side pockets, but........ shoulder belt side holders (hooks) are a disaster, totally broken with only a lifted. The dividers are poorly sewn, too much thread around 
17455 doesn t hold a charge as well as my other batteries, my camera shows the health as 2 of 3 bars when new. 
17456 Great heavy duty and heavy 
17457 Henry was excellent. He took over my computer remotely and fixed the issue within a few minutes. 
17458 Nice bag when you want something light and don t need a lot of protection. Great price. 
17459 A must to protect your camera. 
17460 love it 
17461 Excellent lens - A little bigger than the older I Had, a compact 20-50 ..which started with an 00 error and ended, a month later with a dead diaphragm, making all the photos totally dark. I m very satisfied with the Samsung NX 18 55mm 
17462 It s decent for the price. It does spin and after couples uses got a little sloppy. I Used it in the water mostly it hasn t rusted. 
17463 Excellent product and service 
17464 Good 
17465 Arrived right before my trip out of the country and it worked perfectly to charge my recorder! 
17466 Just what it s supposed to do. It connects an Olympus EM-10 to your computer. 
17467 Ok 
17468 Good functionality and fits the ARLO camera perfectly. It is a white/grayish color. Definitely different from the Netgear Arlo white. Although this doesn t bother me, it provides the angles I need so it s good! 
17469 Excellent 
17470 I did not received NIkon L28 20.1 MP the one I ask for. 
17471 This backdrop is pretty large, but it gets the job done wonderfully. 
17472 Very thin like a shower curtain liner, I was upset when I opened it up. 
17473 I would buy again with no hesitation 
17474 charger usb collapsed and broke ! purchase a separate charger! everything else very well 
17475 Easy to use for a beginner Sturdy stand nice lens 
17476 This is the perfect products for my camera! 
17477 This was for my father, and it is great. Simple, functional, unexpensive, compact, the menus could be easier to use but my 70 year old father learnt the basics and be happy with it. 
17478 Excellent for price for what it does 
17479 Fits perfectly 
17480 Exactly like factory cap, fits perfect. 
17481 This lens hood is nice, and works probably just about as well as the Canon one. The only problem that I have is reversing the hood. Other than that, it works well for pictures and video. It s a good buy. 
17482 Using this on an ASP-C sensor (A-6000) to great advantage as a 36-360 mm. Sharpest just beyond close focus. Great bokah at widest f stops. 
17483 Works like a charm. 
17484 Works great!!! 
17485 I have an older Nikon Coolpix point and shoot and its wobbly on this tripod. I got it for shooting videos outdoors so I can attach to a tree limb and it should be fine. The loose part is right at the junction of the 3 legs. 
17486 The product was good once hooked up, but the instructions and software did not work well. I had to program the cameras by using a direct IP interface. If you have some IT know how, you can get to work. 
17487 OK 
17488 great batteries 
17489 Very good camera great photos very good 4k video 
17490 Worked perfectly with a Canon 6D and a 24-105mm lens in a trip to Yosemite. 
17491 Fits perfect, Love it 
17492 Works just fine. Easy to connect to phone. Easy to use the companion app. Photo colors are alright but a tad off. Ink doesn t smear. 
17493 Died just after using for 2 nights. 
17494 Danny was so great! helped me for over an hour! 10000% HAPPY! GREAT CAMERA ALSO! 
17495 Nice looking but the snaps are low quality. First time I unsnapped the top piece the snap broke off. Replacement snaps are difficult to find. 
17496 Amazing quality and works great 
17497 It doesn t give any information it s very expensive and you don t know what your buying 
17498 Excellent product. I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
17499 Magnets and snaps could be stronger - front flap frequently falls of when trying to use camera 
17500 Nice styling. 
17501 Wow! What a great product at a great price! 
17502 Great, same as the name brand just way cheaper. 
17503 great 
17504 Excellent case. Highly durable and a good price. Fits all your gear for your go pro. The pocket on the inside is a great feature. Everything fits in the foam snugly and wont go anywhere or get damaged. A+ 
17505 Very good camera case. Basic, with some useful pockets well made. 
17506 changed out the battery for wife s Sony camera and it works as good as the original battery and didn t cost very much 
17507 awesome and seals 
17508 When i bougt it i think there is a cable for i phone 6, but it dose not 
17509 Great little camera. Has an external mic plug so we can plug it into the church sound system. Getting nice videos. 
17510 Waste of money, none of then worked 
17511 Great idea, Needs more solar panels...charges WAY to slow but it does work 
17512 Nice 
17513 When they say it fits the GoPro 1... they must mean a different one than what I have. Mine came with a case that isn t removable. I had to return the case and just replace the piece that came off. Bummer. 
17514 Liked the feel, weight and capabilities but went for the Samsung WB2200f instead 
17515 The knurling of the ring makes the rotation of the filter easy through the hole in the lens hood of my new Canon 100-400 zoom. Much easier to use. 
17516 Works ok will not transfer video. Make sure to put in airplane mode when transferring. 
17517 Works fantastically. Would definitely recommend 
17518 This little camera works great. Had some trouble with the wireless connection. But thanks to the excellent tec support this little camera is working fine. Thank you Mylene #AR004212 case# c6721279. Ask for her she s great. 
17519 Very fine 
17520 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
17521 These are great. I lose these all the time so its nice that they come with 6 in a pack. They work well with or without a cleaner. Great for my iphone and ipad and they also are great on eye glasses. 
17522 This is my second Targus USB 2.0 Digital Card Reader and it works great. 
17523 Lasts longer than factory battery and multi use charger is handy for trips. 
17524 Henry performed a Remote Install for the FOSCAM F19816P camera I purchased. He performed the install without any problems got the install completed in less than 45 minutes. Very pleased with his service. Real pleased with the quality of pictures from the FOSCAM. 
17525 Easy to use and setup whether you use it internally or view from external networks. View on 3 iPhones, iPad and a computer. Haven t tried the SD Card features. 
17526 Extremely happy with my purchase. This camera is so easy to operate and takes beautiful photos. Already wanting to buy some better lenses! 
17527 a bit tight fit 
17528 Great kit for any phone to help with pics 
17529 Great buy for the money. 
17530 Thank you! 
17531 Most excellent range. Superb build. Prime focus points throughout. Travelling through India with this lens has been a pleasure. Few other lenses were needed. And it has been rained on, smashed against trains, auto rickshaws, and mass humanity. No problems but real fun. 
17532 So far, am quite happy with it. I have not used it much yet, still learning how to use it. 
17533 We bought these cameras for three rooms in our house and I love them!!! They work great and are at an amazing price!! We plan on buying more!!! 
17534 It s good 
17535 Great 
17536 I love this product. It allows me to know when someone comes down the driveway and extra security at night. I plan on getting another set and putting on the steps on the deck to protect the back of the house. 
17537 This Tripod gets the job done, but it is extremely flimsy. I thought it would ve been a little thicker to be able to hold my canon t5i comfortably. 
17538 This is just the ticket for all the extra things you need while videoing. The arm is very strong and as long as you keep the weight even it doesn t bob up and down and all around. Very useful to a videographer. 
17539 all 4 are exactly the same, all have the same product number 
17540 Great! 
17541 Very good walkaround lens. Beware it´s big and a bit on the heavy side but this is a step up from any kit lens. You won´t regret it. 
17542 Good fit for Nikon d3100 
17543 It is a real nice looking case, but it is too small. 
17544 it has alluminum legs, very stable even w/ a 4 lb binocular. 
17545 This is exactly what i need to work on my youtube videos with 
17546 Works well as a replacement for the Leica batteries that came with my camera. 
17547 I m not reviewing the product, the product didn t work out for me, not that its bad, it wasn t compatible. The service of the seller was excellent, resolved the issue well, stayed in contact throughout. thank you 
17548 No instructions at all. Still trying to figure it out for android and no way will it mount on the binoculars. 
17549 it broke literally 10 minutes after getting into the water and I lost my brand new camera! 
17550 We purchased this case to work with Nikon S9900, unfortunately it didn t fit well. It was extremely tight fit and we re afraid it might scratch the camera. We returned the case immediately. Positive side, it arrived quick. 
17551 Works as it should. I would have desired a power cord to plug in, but with 4 AA batteries and the LED system, it works just fine. The more solid diffusion rings are a bonus. Using with Sony A and 49 mm without issue. 
17552 Well built, provides extra space and cushion for SLR cameras, I m using this one with a canon EOS 60D with 18-135mm lenses. I m able to fit battery charger and extra memory easily. 
17553 As expected. Got to see Jupiter and Saturn with it in a clear night. It s pretty cool. 
17554 Sweet charger, not as fast as I expected. But it works great, and easy to charge, too! Fast shipment, packaged well, and a great price. Thanks! 
17555 excellent! 
17556 as advertised 
17557 nice camera for the price 
17558 I m still finding things to use. I just got done with an afternoon of wearing the head mount while I was climbing a tower [inside] and walking on campus. Worked great. 
17559 I m really satiafied with this great combo. 
17560 Great, but be careful not to over-tighten. 
17561 Excellent choice of lenses at a very good price and very nicely packaged for easy transport with my camera. 
17562 Light and cheap, fits perfectly, but to be honest the original ECG-1 is better - more grippy, slimmer base which is better for pinky finger and doesn t get so cold, so if you can get that one, I would recommend it more. 
17563 Very low quality. Short life. 
17564 Lots of missing items, the camera s fine though 
17565 This is a great buy. Also my neighbors think that I have a real security surveillance system. It a great but to deter Crime. The blinking solid red lights on the camera make is look realistic. 
17566 Great 
17567 The hook broke after couple of months. I never received any response to my email. 
17568 Awesome mount and fitting is perfect. Used it at the beach and caught awesome moments. Well worth it s price. 
17569 I definitely needed this! 
17570 Perfect. Just prepare for long wait, arrived 10 days past due, but it works good. 
17571 This is a wonderful lens 
17572 Good 
17573 Fits my Nikon D7100 and was very useful in shooting in rainy Alaska. 
17574 Good deal/product 
17575 This scope works exactly as I expected, using the Cheese app on the Fedora 22 version of Linux. A problem with the ON/OFF switch on the first unit I received was quickly resolved by an immediate vendor replacement. 
17576 Works great and charges my batteries quite fast. 
17577 I like it very well and work great in many positions and keeps secure. Thanks!! 
17578 I m criticizing myself...not the product. I should have noticed that I was buying BOTH a remote and a camera cleaning kit. The remote can be purchased by itself for around $20 elsewhere on Amazon. 
17579 Works well, no issues. Great price and does the job. 
17580 Probably one of my favorite GoPro accessories. I can easily get the footage I need when doing a run and its easily transportable. I personally think there is less shake vs the head and chest strap. 
17581 It is smaller than expect but the resolution on the screen is great. 
17582 Love them 
17583 Excellent 
17584 Kool look will fool you but the only thing it blanks, and a real cam don t. 
17585 Giving a 4 start only because it lacks the ability to collapse it to store in your camera bag... But for the price I wouldn t complain... 
17586 Item worked once and then stopped working. 
17587 Love it. 
17588 Everything we needed! 
17589 it works really great on iphone and android. I bought this one for a gift but i tried it first to be sure it works pretty well and my friend loves it! 
17590 My wife loves it! Still learning how to rock the shot but getting some amazing photos. 
17591 Works perfectly with camera and charger. So happy! 
17592 like the colored borders 
17593 For short footages is an ideal tool. Lightweight, strong and confortable make me gladder that I though 
17594 The joint and plates themselves seem to be pretty well made, but the shipment lacked the hardware necessary to connect the case to the plate. Be prepared to supply your own nuts. 
17595 This camera does not have a jack to support an external microphone. 
17596 clarity was less than expected 
17597 Love this paper. The color works very well for my children and maternity sessions. 
17598 Perfect for what I needed 
17599 People keep running into my wife and I ve looked for a decent little camera to use in the car. Then, some neighbor dogs attacked her while out walking ours, she needed something to clip on and take with her. This little baby does both pretty darn well. 
17600 fast shipping will do more business 
17601 I have just used this remote shutter at the fireworks show on Aug 22nd without problem. 
17602 Crystal clear focus without the Image Stabilizer! This is wonderful. The USM is required if you need quiet such as photographing wildlife. 
17603 a 
17604 great product great price works as description 
17605 Poor product had to send it back twice product was open already and used 
17606 the tripod assembly is a tad difficult when assembling the unit, but other than that a fine refractor. 
17607 Even though it s a little harder to carry this case with you everywhere it does hold alot if you are going out to take pictures. 
17608 Great product, and perfect little photos for keepsakes, would recommend to edit photos on your phone and increase the contrast and saturation since the pictures do fade a little bit when they print, but overall I m pleased with the products 
17609 Great price for a nice, basic camera case. Item holds up well. 
17610 Great kit! 
17611 Very happy with the picture provided. 
17612 works nice 
17613 Lightweight, and quick and easy to assemble. Material could be a bit sturdier, but as is, works well with paper or other lightweight backdrops. 
17614 Functional 
17615 Perfect for what we wanted. Works very well, easy to use. 
17616 Kenneth was a great help setting up my Foscam to send email when motion is detected. He is quick polite and knows his data. Thanks Kenneth, Jerald 
17617 Great product and fun for many events. Everyone loves it. 
17618 Camera does a decent job even in relatively low light. The housing clip got loose after only a couple of uses. 
17619 Great Items.. My customers are really happy... 
17620 Excelkente! Fits all accessories! 
17621 Good finish and packaging macro lens is also good 
17622 Very handy item,more when you forget the charger, and have one fully charged in your pocket. 
17623 Great camera for any small application especially for FPV embedded in racing quads. I have had a few cameras on various models. Also, comes with easy to use wiring harness for attaching to video transmitters such as FatShark/Immersion. 
17624 So far so good. SOMETIMES the individual items move around and that should t be. Otherwise no problems 
17625 good 
17626 Great! 
17627 Grate 
17628 great idea, not great implementation, doesnt slip on or fit easily onto the screen 
17629 So cute 
17630 Works great 
17631 works as planned, ideally matching the a6000. 
17632 Works good and in new condition. 
17633 Product is exactly what was advertised 
17634 This accessory fits perfectly for my camera! 
17635 As an owner of both a Gopro 3, and Gopro 4, this is a fantastic charger than can handle BOTH batteries, and can recharge from my computer s USB port. 
17636 Super filter for the money! 
17637 Is as advertised 
17638 Perfect - does what it says on the tin! Very sturdy and easy to fit 
17639 Works great, fantastic feal! 
17640 Works fine at a good price. 
17641 Delivery on time. Was due for new battery, old one about 5 yrs old and wasn t holding charge very well 
17642 Works well. I have only tested this and not actually put it to use. It should eliminate the camera shake when I press the shutter release button. 
17643 Does exactly as it s supposed to do. 
17644 I love it. 
17645 This camera is pure garbage. Until iIbought this camera I ve hadn t ever submitted a review or even a star rating. Now I wish there were an option for a —🌟rating. 
17646 Work just as good as my og canon battery and super cheap. 
17647 Takes nice pictures above and below water. Seems like the ones under water are nicer/clearer if the sun is directly above you. For the money you can t beat it. 
17648 these are propellers. I used them as such 
17649 Awesome 
17650 Great. 
17651 I m very pleased with our purchase. Camera works with our iOS devices flawlessly! We can monitor our little puppy from most everywhere. I would highly recommend this to family and friends! 
17652 Was attempting to take photos of the glorious mountains in our backyard. These lens did the job, though I had to edit with instagram afterwards. 
17653 Can t beat the price - bulbs burned out within 2 days - but very pleased with the quality. 
17654 I love this large air blaster. It works and works well. I always keep it with my camera and lenses as I use it before any shoot just to be sure that I get the desired impact from my equipment. Compact yet effective. Thanks. 
17655 Great when shooting all landscape stills or working with video cameras. Mounting to longer lenses causes some issues when going vertical but a work around is to have your vertical lens on you dominant hand. Good quality material. 
17656 we love it!!! 
17657 The camera was easy to setup. To access it on the computer remotely on another network was easy and picture quality was great. Even the app worked great on my phone for remotely viewing the camera and allowed for pan and tilt and speaker and mic usage. 
17658 Much better fit than the one that came with my lens. The branded original kept falling off and I ended up losing it. This cap is so secure I feel it is safe even though I removed the lanyard. 
17659 Works for basic monitoring 
17660 Does have lots of features too. However many people have complained about interference with garage door transmit and I had same issue when i put it in my garage. So beware. 
17661 Super cute and easy to carry around everywhere with me! 
17662 Good size float 
17663 Love this light. Fit perfect on my canon rebel. Just what I needed 
17664 Had an XE1&2 This is a great camera. I do wish the flash could be manually tilted back to bounce the flash like my XE2. Also I love the drive dial! 
17665 works well. small enough to put in your pocket 
17666 Print very small, not really what I would like to have as a quick reference guide. Need magnifier to even begin to see what they are saying. 
17667 Another satisfied grandkid. Super easy to use and takes good pictures. 
17668 It doesn t stay on an active dog very well. 
17669 This thing has some zooming power, but you need to purchase a tripod to help hold and steady it. Looking forward to getting some moon shots; so I`ll let you know how they turn out. 
17670 Great 
17671 Excellent! We re very pleased! 
17672 great head, very heavy sturdy build as you d expect. just as good as other name brands but 30% cheaper :) so I have a couple of these now and happy with them 
17673 It doesn t actually detect my dog. 
17674 There is not enough space to tell one how I feel about this product or the company customer service! 
17675 good 
17676 This is what I needed. 
17677 fits good cant wait to try it out. 
17678 work hard to make this work 
17679 Works perfectly. 
17680 Great bag and perfect size! 
17681 My cousin is happy with it! He was searching it for a long time. So let s see, how long it s gonna last. 
17682 Need to learn all the begins the scenes fearless of this phone but love it! 
17683 As with all the other Pelican cases i ve used in the past, this is a top notch product. I use it to store a Nikon D5300, multiple lenses, a portable hard drive, a portable NAS controller, backup battery, nikon battery charger, and memory card case. 
17684 For those claiming the cap has poor fit, it took me a bit to figure out as well, but you need to TWIST it on so that it mounts properly after putting it on the barrel. It will snap into place and fits excellent afterward 
17685 Small, light weight and perfect for a 180mm or smaller quad. 
17686 Very nice quality. 
17687 Kept camera from sinking and came in very handy! 
17688 Works great. Do wish it had room for a second lens though. 
17689 playing with it all the time! 
17690 bought one more than a year ago, it has worked so well I got another. once charged, it lasts a long time, about five hours. extremely satisfied with the purchase and the second one was actually cheaper than the first one. 
17691 Does the job though the plastic is cheap and tends to chip off. 
17692 Difficult to focus 
17693 Fits perfectly on my camera screen and doesn t make it blurry to see photos. Very clear and easy to keep clean. 
17694 Nice 
17695 Fit perfect and strong 
17696 Great lens!! 
17697 Fast Shipping, product as described. 
17698 Quality product for a very reasonable price. 
17699 These cases are so amazing. Holds my sniper rifle and a couple pistols with out a problem. It takes a while to cut the foam but it is so worth it in the end. 
17700 having lots of fun with this 
17701 All the parts you need to make 4 lanyards. Pick your own length. Works great, and easy to make. Just need a hammer and lighter. 
17702 such a great, fun camera. I love the the pics it produces. Such a great camera to bring to a party and hand out the pics 
17703 Best deal for the amount of accessories in the box. 
17704 worked great. forgot my charger on a beach trip used my prime to have this delivered love amazon! 
17705 Ideal 
17706 Works great for us! Thanks!! 
17707 It is just right and came with in a few days of ordering. 
17708 Will this work with other lenses or just the 16-50mm? 
17709 Cheap and doesn t work right 
17710 its a very tricky camera if you are trying to setup wirelessly quality of this night vision camera is great and price is ok too but man its a headache to set it up, it should come with a Advil 
17711 Works good. 
17712 Best thing ever... 
17713 Very cheap quality! Bought 2 and one of my buttons were already broken! Also product heats up very fast so it is a potential fire hazard! Was looking forward to these but on to the next amazon find! 
17714 Thank you, it good quality. 
17715 Absolutely brilliant little piece of equipment! A must have for astrophotogtahy with an SCT. 
17716 I have had the speedlight for about 3 months and the mode button longer works. 
17717 Fraud. 
17718 Works as expected with no issues 
17719 Gave 5 stars because quality was good for price paid. Holds a6000 with no issues and will be perfect for traveling. Little flimsy but if you take care it will work fine and last. 
17720 Out of the aftermarket BP-511, these seem to work the best with Canon 50D. 
17721 Good price. Good quality. Fast shipping. 
17722 it s a good items. 
17723 Great product! Easy to transport, set up, and use. I love the lighting I achieve with it indoors and out. I definitely recommend either having an assistant to hold it if you are outdoors or bring sandbags as a 60&#34; umbrella will blow over in the slightest wind. 
17724 Great start up kit. 
17725 Works perfectly! Very happy with the product. Especially the price. 
17726 Don t wast your money - you ll never use it. Way harsh on the orange. 
17727 Excellent product , very satisfied with it s function. I recommend this item in a heartbeat. 
17728 Clear and crisp photos. Good price! 
17729 Great price. Works as promised. No issues at all. I mounted them both behind the 16-50 PZ - no issues! We had a little fun creating a lego dance scene (captured on a Sony a6000) 
17730 Got the quadcopter running and after a few dry runs got the hang of it and it runs very well.....I am very happy with it!!!!! 
17731 Perfect camera mount for car dash or windshield. Sturdy and strong, very reliable. 
17732 If you have 70 yr old eyes as I do you better get real good magnifying glass 
17733 These perform as good as if not better than the Canon battery that came with the camera, and at a fraction of the price. UPDATE: Batteries last 1.5 years and then completely died. Took to a camera expert - and said that neither batter was holding any power after charging. 
17734 I rarely use the camera and it stays in the camera bag most of the time, however, the jacket started to crack after several months. 
17735 Always an excellent product. 
17736 This was super easy to set up - the hardest part was finding the button on the camera. Once that was set up, the remote worked instantly. 
17737 Perfect!!! 
17738 Holes only 4.3mm not the 8mm advertised. I had to return it, would not fit photoflex box rods. 
17739 Ok ordere the camera nad htis drop magic together, camera was dropped by amazon 
17740 Not too smooth moving it whilr shooting 
17741 Extremely sturdy. Love pistol grip 
17742 I recently purchased this kit and I am very impressed with the quality of the product! The images are wonderful and the kit is very easy to set up. It is definitely worth the money! 
17743 works well. 
17744 Great inexpensive, alternative to baby monitors! Great for the price!! 
17745 not good Quality.. take too long to arrived 
17746 If you need a reliable battery. These are the best out there. They constantly out perform my GoPro branded batteries. They last around an hour and 15 mins of filming and the price is great. Don t overlook these batteries. They are amazing. 
17747 Great case. The cube foam works great and gives you a very professional result. Very satisfied. 
17748 DEI products are my first choice for security and remote start 
17749 Kinda weak ,but ok for price 
17750 These batteries last forever. I snagged a spare and have yet to run my primary battery down. 
17751 I bought this for a gift for someone and they really like it. Does everything they want to do with a camera. Very good lens apparently. 
17752 Fast enough for my 810. 
17753 loved it 
17754 enjoying 
17755 works as needed for little dollars. Don t know how long it will last. 
17756 Spend 12 hours won t able to work stay away 
17757 does what it s supposed to. 
17758 Works perfect. 
17759 Perfect. 
17760 This product is awesome and works great! The video is very clear and clean, I suggest everybody that wants to spy and look cool get this product!!! Great product SpyCrushers!!! 
17761 lets me take picture of different objects without the burden of having difficulties in finding the stable position and exposure. glad to find this camera before our exposure trip in the slums of detroit. 
17762 Only half of my purchase works. Somehow one of my light fixtures and a bulb doesn t work. Sending it back. 
17763 Perfect, performs the same as the old one. 
17764 Works great. Easy to install and use. Great picture and sound quality. Love that there is an app for it. And send notification when any motion is detected. 
17765 Thought I was getting new prod this whole order was a disappointment 
17766 Battery life is comparable to the OEM battery, however it is a bit snug in my X-T1. It doesn t come out as easily as the OEM battery. I have to pick it out with my fingernails. 
17767 Works great. 
17768 camera came with 2 batteries and a charger.. but having another is NEVER a bad idea.. especially when this one comes with a car adaptor! charges actually FASTOR than the canon one!! product was delivered on time as well!! very pleased! stays in camera bag 
17769 A low cost alternative to Zacuto products, for certain things. 
17770 OK, the câmera is very goood!!! 
17771 Although i have too many lenses for this case it is perfect for my favorite two. I love the rain protector and how solid the straps feel. I totally trust this case with my most expensive equipment 
17772 its ok 
17773 Canberra does a good job for the price. Takes great pictures and once I know how to use it better I m sure video and picture quality will a go up. 
17774 It has met my expectations. Easy to install but with fact that this was for a new home build and wiring already in place. Very good mobile app that did the job when went out of town just after getting it installed. 
17775 I purchase it to extend my LAVIEW camera which works fantastic day and night view is great. 
17776 cool toy 
17777 I love this camera it has a stablizer which helps me take beautiful pictures!!! 
17778 so far works great! 
17779 Nice case! 
17780 Good camera, only use it a couple of days but it serves our needs very well. 
17781 I got missing parts 
17782 Very happy with my purchase 
17783 The effect in photography is as intended, however the plastic feels much less sturdy than I expected for the price. 
17784 does the job, but a little awkward. 
17785 Met my expextativas , good near vision 
17786 good lens kit from Goja. I am really loving the look of this and set 
17787 I got this to charge up and use for a back up on my camera. It appears to have charged well, I haven t had a chance to use it yet! 
17788 Great 
17789 Great Pics....Manual lenses are the best 
17790 Works fine but there is this problematic &#34;feature&#34; that turning it on/off 4x in 4 seconds makes it reset / forget the network. So far my kids have done this twice and it s really annoying. 
17791 Arrived as promised. 
17792 Great results every time with this film. 
17793 Love the metallic blue color! 
17794 Love this! Awesome purchase! 
17795 THE ONLY ONE THAT I FOUND CAN FIT AmazonBasics 52-Inch Carbon Fiber Travel Tripod.... 
17796 Would not work with computer - very dark photos - not easy to use. 
17797 strong holding mounts. need some extra mounts for the go pro. these hold up well, used some on the RZR running bumpy tarain and they have stayed mounted. 
17798 Great batteries at a fraction of the originals. 
17799 These things scratched the crap out of my 2 month old glasses lenses, even with glasses cleaner. Thanks. 
17800 Didn t work for long... don t waste money. 
17801 Good value. 
17802 Lightweight and exactly what I needed for all my gear. 
17803 never used a selfie stick before.... Very easy to set up, just charged it, held down the shutter button until it flashed, paired it with the phone, and started using it. It works great! Compatible with all the apps on my phone. The folding design makes it very compact. 
17804 Nice value 
17805 Pretty much didn t work for me. Too bulky, and i don t like letting my camera dangle by one side. I walk - a lot - when i shoot, and this just forced the camera to bang against me, no matter how i rigged it. 
17806 efficient & accurate 
17807 Crap 
17808 Not a solid yellow case as depicted in the photo. Otherwise a typical quality Pelican case. 
17809 Great Buy ! 
17810 It s not as heavy as a Pelican case so it s much easier on the back. The case seems exceptionally well designed. It fits the drone perfectly and the storage slots are well thought out. Everything fits perfectly. 
17811 Great product! 
17812 i have this product and I definitely recommend it. i can see my kids whenever wherever i want. totally worth the price 
17813 good 
17814 Excellent fit and was amazed that once installed my screen actually looked brighter and clearer. 
17815 Could not get it to work properly and couldn t get the lighting adjusted. I ve never had this much trouble with a digital camera. It wound up going in the trashcan. :-( 
17816 Broke the first time I used it on a motocross bike and lost my friend s GoPro that I borrowed for a shoot. Spent hours looking and had to buy her a new one. So this piece of junk actually cost $400. 
17817 Extremely good value. 
17818 didnt work for me but quality looks good 
17819 We love it! 
17820 Great camera, good price 
17821 Great product, highly recommended 
17822 Perfect pictures but SONY colors are nicer. 
17823 love it love it, pictures are very clear easy to carry around 
17824 Great bag for the price! 
17825 This kit is the worst. No instructions, just a mess of products most of which I have no idea how to connect or what they do. No instructions 
17826 Good!! 
17827 Work for the camera I purchased them for 
17828 A little pricy but worth it 
17829 nice bag 
17830 Works very well, easy to attach and take off, simple lil mirror accurately helps set up the shot 
17831 great deal 
17832 Just fine. Camera works now 
17833 All parts are quality, love the package! love the price! 
17834 Excellent 
17835 Original item, functions perfectly! 
17836 I have mix feelings about this. Thought about returning it but decided to keep it. The selfie stick is extremely short. Everything is just cheap quality but gets the job done. The case is probably the best thing about the kit. 
17837 not bad it is very usufull 
17838 Sometime it didn t adhere to camera... 
17839 Great light. It is plenty bright and can be dimmed. Also, like that it comes with a battery that can be used in your GoPro. Fits perfect to the camera. Would recommend. 
17840 I never want to take this lens off of my camera. It s so sharp and focuses faster than my Canon 50mm 1.4. The lens distortion is minimal. Love it. 
17841 very good 
17842 I am very impressed with this lens. It is very sharp and the Bokeh is out of this world. My portrait business just went up a notch. 
17843 These work great! I like the cell phone screen cleaner it works pretty good too! 
17844 Excellent 
17845 As advertised 
17846 working great,no problem 
17847 These batteries work just fine they power my digital canon camera just as they are supposed to do. 
17848 Great camera--so pleased with it. 
17849 A big help in keeping a full bag of gear on your shoulder. Highly recommend. 
17850 really surprising 
17851 Works awesome, camera see s this device as a Nikon product. Its built well and all functions work flawlessly 
17852 Great affordable product, but the software is quite glitch. You often need to close the software, shut down the FLIR device, turn it back on, and load the software back up. Or else it d be a 5 star. 
17853 Great easily charges batteries. highly recommend 
17854 Easy to adjust and use, good quality. Great for hiking, etc. Good solution when you need a quality product but don t want to pay a small fortune for an item that will only be used on an occasional basis. basis. 
17855 Quality is great, no complaints so far. I use them for wiring outdoor camera s and they have held up to direct, hot sunlight as well as rain and moisture without any deterioration. 
17856 Works great for going through hundreds of slides. Great sellers 
17857 Purchased a couple of these for kids going off to school. One of them was defective and the owner promptly replaced it (thank you!) They work as intended - pull the cord and it goes off. I just hope my kids never have a need to use it. 
17858 I have an 8&#34; Dobsonian Zhumell. I have used this time of camera eye piece previously. Could not get it to focus at all with this purchase. Tech support suggested that I move the main mirror. Back in the box for a refund. 
17859 very good product 
17860 Awesome camera. I bought this for my wife for her birthday. My oldest son played with it and ended up buying one for himself he liked it so much. 
17861 High quality A/V stick. Works well with Saumsung S5, Iphone 6 and Hero 4. I was able to use the stick with a Hero4 in air flight going around 100 mph and the device worked flawlessly. No turns or twists like the cheap sticks. 
17862 For the price, which was very reasonable, it is a great charger. Seems solidly built. Of course, I ve only used it once so far. I had a charger of similar size, brand X, which was pretty flimsy and stopped working after a while. 
17863 Very handy, and just the right size! 
17864 Is great and is the best mini camcorder ever 
17865 Easy to use, good quality. 
17866 Got these as a gag gift for my brother who is a photographer, but he actually loves them and uses them often. 
17867 Uh it ended up not working but I was sick of trying to figure out how to work with the files AND the camera itself. Bad product for me. 
17868 Everything was exactly as advertised and well packaged. My son loves the camera. Great value package!!! 
17869 works wonderfully my first photo backdrop stand would buy again would recommend to others 
17870 Great value and always handy to have extra power for my go pro on hand. 
17871 Works great. Planning to use it for remote live video of a baptism. Can t wait to see how it all turns out. 
17872 This was a gift. 
17873 good buy 
17874 It fit and work as described in the add. It is working great 
17875 Jonathan Reed from foscam tech support did a fantastic job helping set up my camera 
17876 looks cool 
17877 Great bag, for a great price! Fits both my camera bodies, lenses and flash. It s much easier to transport my equipment in a backpack. 
17878 Created a new quadcopter from an old quadcopter using this and some new blades. The frame is stuff and solid, odds are that it ll break the first time it falls out of the air (but we won t let that happen). 
17879 It doesn t Work 
17880 Wow fit perfect 
17881 excellent product. deliveried on time as was promised. 
17882 Great 
17883 This is perfect to keep my zip from just being banged around in my bag. 
17884 Works great! Awesome value for the money! Does exactly what I need for 1/4th the price! 
17885 Good quality for the price. 
17886 Great little camera...no problems so far!! 
17887 hard to find yet you had in stock at a low price. I am impressed 
17888 The charger works perfectly and the delivery was extremely fast. I highly recommend this product! 
17889 Not meant to be on a supervised system, no &#34;in / out&#34; leads. 
17890 i have LOVED using this instant camera. its fun & vintage! takes great shots. even my 3 year old loves using it. we display the photos on our fridge and in an instant film sized album. 
17891 The optics aren t great but I guess you get what you are willing to pay for. At this point I think I would have spent a little more to get one that will last longer and have better optics. 
17892 It is good. 
17893 I am sure it works well, but I couldn t use it. I thought I only broke the lens but turns out I completely destroyed the camera. Giving it 5 stars because I can t justify otherwise, but I did not actually use it. 
17894 The bag is very beautiful 
17895 The batteries are very good !!! The charger is very slow, but they give you the charger like a bonus !!! 
17896 Excelent 
17897 these are TOUGH 
17898 Kenneth at Foscam service did a great job walking me through the setup. The Foscam works perfect and looks great! I would recommend Foscam because of the ease and customer service. 
17899 Just what I needed to help in the digitizing of my slides ... saved time sorting what should/should not be saved. 
17900 Works perfectly!!! 
17901 Item shipped fast and was as described. 
17902 Works fine. 
17903 Henry did an excellent job of support. It is the first time the ipad has connected to my foscam camera. I also now know what to do to access from a remote location. THANK YOU HENRY. 
17904 Illuminati. 
17905 Works great! High quality! 
17906 Excellent 
17907 This was my first time placing a order with amazon, very pleased and will be ordering again soon. 
17908 Does not auto focus on a D3200. 
17909 Works extremely well. 
17910 Henry has been very helpful in setting up all my Foscam Cameras. Great tech support! 
17911 Lost my charger while on vacation , got this because it came with a battery for my camera as a bonus. Works well and haven t had any issues so far (2 months). Battery doesn t last as long as oem but it does have the smart info. 
17912 A set of standard cold cathode tubes with all required hardware to mount in a computer. I use these for interior lighting in my car as well. 
17913 Easy set up instructions! Took me 10minutes to set up and that was mostly due to the fact that I forgot my home wifi password. The quality in picture both day and night vision are very clear! I am so happy with this purchase! 
17914 I ve enjoyed these filters immensely. They ve been a huge help on my sunset and landscape photography. 
17915 Just what I needed 
17916 Battery only hold half the charge time as an actual Sony Battery. Good for emergency backup but no way would I use this as a first line battery. Very disappointed.... 
17917 Good service and product. 
17918 Nice set. Works great.. I d get it again. 
17919 Great package - great camera - service was very responsive. 
17920 Not my favirate a replaced this one with a much better that also holds my wifi remote. 
17921 works great for easy close up shots and much cheaper then buying a macro lens just for a few fun shots 
17922 Excellent, Love it 
17923 It never worked even once, and the company refused to suggest a repair. 
17924 This is my first drone and I must say am truly enjoying this. 
17925 Work good didn t have any problem 
17926 Okay product 
17927 Love it and easy to use which is a must for me! 
17928 Good buy and it s light and nice 
17929 All in all it s ok. The pin in oddly rounded and makes for an ill fit for a lot of lights. The tensioners are plastic. 
17930 Works beautifully for the EF-S lenses whose focus rotates the lense, ruling out the use of a petal hood. Best features are the accordion collapsibility for wider angles or storage. Being rubber it does prevent the end of the lens from some knocks against walls and such. 
17931 Good 
17932 Very pleased so far with the package. I really like the adjustable screen position. 
17933 Great product. 
17934 Really expensive to use, but totally worth it 
17935 I was under the impression that they would have sand inside of them. Needed them for a last minute fashion photo shoot, but since they weren t full, they were useless to me. The quality seems decent though, but since they come without sand I think they should be cheaper. 
17936 Just what I needed for my GE X600 
17937 This is a lovely camera i m learning how to use it,other than that it takes beautiful pictures. And oh delivery was so quick 
17938 Awesome lens. Gives a much larger view with minor distortion. 
17939 Caution: Does not fit iPhone6 Plus. I had to modify it. 
17940 absolutely love my Polaroid! easy to use and small enough to carry around! although the Polaroid can easily get scuff marks on. the best way to use the Polaroid is by watching a video on how to use so every picture will come out great! 
17941 Great product. Very sharp display. I increased the saturation and contrast slightly, but very pleased. Initially had a problem, but realized I had a corrupted file, and as soon as I fixed that, it worked great. 
17942 works great 
17943 Really nice construction. Quality product. 
17944 This unit is priceless. Nice and compact and does the job. 
17945 these cameras need SOMETHING for bright sun. This helps, but I d rather have a viewfinder. Don t like that it uses adhesive, but can t think of another way to do it. 
17946 Excellent.. Super easy to install!!! 
17947 A great charger 
17948 Very powerful despite its size. 
17949 Great deal 
17950 This is a great size to put my camera. I could put a Sony a6000, Sony Carl Zeiss 16-70mm lens, and have enough room for storage with a Goal Zero charging stick. 
17951 Thank 
17952 AVOID, especially from this seller. Mine won t turn on and the seller won t take it back. Thanks for the $300 paper weight! 
17953 it would be nicer if it had some sort of timing feature 
17954 Great! I love it! 
17955 Great so far - does what it s supposed to at a great price and I haven t noticed anything awry so far... 
17956 I cannot tell if cases were &#34;used&#34; as they said because they look brand new! Highly recommended! 
17957 AWESOME 
17958 Worked well 
17959 Works perfectly with no degradation of quality. 
17960 product as expected, delivered on time 
17961 works perfect. Great fit and finish. 
17962 Very nice and high quality 
17963 For the price nice piece of gear. 
17964 Great Flashes at a Great Price.. 
17965 dont buy this it s trush work fine at the start few days later less then 1 week it not working it s junk 
17966 I use this with my Microsoft LifeCam and it works great!! Definitely worth the money!! 
17967 two months after installation the hard-drive stop working, can t get help from Zmodo, email only support. I do not recommend this system, poor quality and no service. 
17968 nice chair, works great 
17969 A great tool to take your pic s very well made. Thanks very much 
17970 perfect. easy. durable. 
17971 Very good and faster 
17972 Was very disappointed because the Coolpix came with only a user s manual written in Arabic and couldn t find instructions or manual online. 
17973 DO NOT BUY. Hard to install. Tech support is a joke. Returned. Do not buy. It s a POS. 
17974 I have not figured out how to get it to work TTL. Must be me, however I used to be in the camera business. This flash/camera combo has me perplexed. 
17975 Received when promised. Good quality product. Will be buying more. 
17976 This lens has been wonderful at teaching me about depth of field. I m still learning of course!! I love the look of my youtube videos when using it and the look of my photos. The price was excellent for me as a beginner. 
17977 worked as advertised. Full charge within a short time...replaced original. 
17978 This lens is what I expected it to be..It s well made and offers a more graduated transfer from ND to UV that most others don t offer... 
17979 Perfect for small trail cameras. 
17980 Great system and service!!! 
17981 The cameras are good but they are not wireless.Thats why I gave 3 starzs!!!If they were wireless I would give camera system 5 starzs.The setup is very easy... 
17982 You can t go wrong with these cases. They ll last a lifetime. 
17983 The Mount works perfectly. Sticks like glue to the windshield. 
17984 It was a good purchase 
17985 So far, these batteries appear to last as long as the original. Most important, the Panasonic FZ1000, for which these batteries were ordered, absolutely consumes battery power so quickly, a couple of extra batteries from DOT-01 are necessary! 
17986 versatile, compact, easy to use, excellent picture quality. 
17987 Really handy accessory for the point & shoot cameras. This is my 5th or 6th one (I keep giving them to folks who have not seen one before). 
17988 sturdy! 
17989 Used the batteries on my sony action cam and it works great. So much better than buying at the store for a lot more. 
17990 Hard to connect. Wish I sent it back before it was to late. 
17991 Snapped right into place on my Nikon D90. Same as original eye cup. 
17992 Awesome, loads of fun to fly. 
17993 Perfect for one big lens and one small lens 
17994 It s really light, easy to fold and unfold, sturdy, and all: the seating area, the size when folded and the height of the stool are just perfect for my husband and me (weight 240 lb.) I will buy another. 
17995 Could not get a response back from the supplier. The motion sensing does not work well at all. I would not recommend this product if motion sensing is what you want. Also apparently there is no support from the supplier so I suggest finding a different supplier too. 
17996 I bought this lens primarily to shoot high school football, and it does a fantastic job! Built like a tank, operates very smoothly, and has great optics. You can t beat the Canon L glass! 
17997 Slider works well. The screws for the feet were sized incorrectly. I replaced with my own screws, works fine! 
17998 Great value, good lense for close up/portrait 
17999 WILL NEVER WORK NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. A REAL PIECE OF GARBAGE. 
18000 These batteries are a screaming deal. I have the two pack plus the original for my K-3. I am pretty sure that they last longer than the stock battery that came with my camera. Don t hesitate to purchase these for whatever camera system you use. 
18001 Great product, no issue at all. 
18002 Changed the way I shoot iphone footage. Takes a little bit to get the hang of it but the difference between with and without are staggering. Can t wait to try it with my GoPro.. 
18003 AAA 
18004 My glasses broke after the second day. The ear piece dosent work and broke inside of the glasses. What do I do about this? 
18005 Exactly as posted. Thanks! 
18006 Absolutely, it came complete with battery-charger and cable. It would have cost me close to $50.00 to get these items on line from Panasonic. 
18007 like the way this ride on the side of the body... a true neck saver! 
18008 this works GREAT! I was shocked that it cost so little! Wish I had it sooner! 
18009 One of the best low budget cameras. Super cool pictures and the display is really awesome. Only thing is the delay while taking the snap which I don t worry about. Excellent 5 start. 
18010 Flishing is fine but does not include any len cap 
18011 Got this for my daughter, she loves it. Works as it should, 50 count, and shipping was fast! 
18012 I use these for both the Nikon Remote and for spare SDCards ! I use 2 of these one in each camera strap ! Very useful little item ! 
18013 Easy to install. take me for less 5 minutes to completed. The camera look good with the blinking red light. I love it, it perfect. Hopefully nobody messup my front yard. 
18014 Works well. I use it on my bicycle. It grip well and it adjusts well. 
18015 All good, no issues 
18016 This item could stay connected it would be awesome. as soon as it says the download is starting it disconnects and the download is canceled. currently it just hangs on my camera strap but it dosen t work. 
18017 I didn t realized it had no hard drive so I cannot record. 
18018 These come in really handy, because sometimes your oe battery will run down and as soon as it does you just pop one of these in and continue recording. 
18019 Love my camera just what I expected 
18020 Great product! 
18021 Just right and beautiful. I bought these lens protector filters alongside my canon 24mm -105mm lens. The quality is unbelievable and well built. I truly recommend this product to anyone who wants to buy a good quality lens filter on a limited budget. 
18022 I love this thing. I can fit everything in there, except a mini tripod (gorillapod) and my larger RAM mount attachments/arms. Really nice to have everything in one package. 
18023 Ricahrd did a great job of helping me get this set up Great product and great price 
18024 Great product. Is working flawlessly. I only wish there was an option to turn off the in-mirror display. It is fine with it on, and doesn t really mess with your ability to use the mirror, just a personal preference. 
18025 It is everything that it said it was. Plenty of room for all of my daughters equiptment 
18026 great camera, great value 
18027 Fits the camera well. All buttons can be used while in the case. 
18028 Very good product 
18029 Does not work with the GoPro which i bought it for but it does work OK with my Nikon 
18030 great solver for battery = ) 
18031 Great 
18032 liked very much 
18033 As advertised. 
18034 Excellent quality /price ratio 
18035 Now he has a second battery and can keep shooting. 
18036 For the price this is really great. I needed it so I could get family portrait shots and I have used it a bunch of times successfully. It is WAY cheaper than other ones. 
18037 Incredibly solid and sturdy unit comparable to ones costing significantly more. Very good adjustment features. Holds an 80mm Kowa spotting scope at various heights and positions without a problem. A great buy at twice this price. 
18038 This is great way to use my camera now I can connect to my computer in the field without wires running everywhere. 
18039 I was expecting the body to made of metal like other cameras I have that were like it 
18040 Its the perfect accessory to protect your lense. A must if you own this camera. 
18041 Poor product. Easily comes off strap, does not hold cap well. I threw it away. No way to fix it except design a totally new product. 
18042 I got this for my granddaughter s 14th birthday and she just loves it. She told me it takes great pictures. I highly recommend this camera plus you can t beat the since it includes so much more than just the camera. 
18043 Bought extra cameras to synch in with a previous purchased unit. Works great! 
18044 Good product. Holds GoPro really good. 
18045 If you are looking for a floating handle...do not buy this as it definitely does not float!! 
18046 Works fine in our Olympus Pen PL-7. 
18047 These battery replacements were just ok, for me. I have found them to lose their charge more quickly than my 2 year old original Nikon battery. 
18048 Not the easiest to use but takes quality photos. 
18049 Excellent piece of kit, I was looking for a decent frame mount so the head strap was a bonus. 
18050 Great camera 
18051 Too much noise. 
18052 Great little kit for my Nikon D3100. Nice quality filters and accessories. I have purchased from this company before because they have good products. Super fast delivery too. 
18053 Perfect, exactly what I needed. The cover is cardboard with a thick plastic slip over it. The inside pockets do not stick to photos thank goodness!! 
18054 Great product 
18055 Whenever I purchase a camera the first thing I do is attach a clear filter for lens protection. B+W is the best out there on the market. Their quality control is stellar. 
18056 Great Product. works well. 
18057 I purchased two of them and they both ran *extremely* hot. Hot enough that you couldn t even touch it for more than a few seconds. 
18058 Perfect for GoPro. Same quality as name brand. 
18059 I Love them. 
18060 Product is exactly as the same as described, easy installation, good quality video pictures and a must-have for home security!!! 
18061 Good 
18062 Made in the Japan!!! This product came all the way from Japan and it is the perfect fit for my camera!!! 
18063 i like it ! 
18064 Worked as expected. Very fast charging 
18065 Installed it on my PVS-14, works great for the money 
18066 This Canon EF 28mm F/1.8 Wide Angle Lens has made such an improvement in my photography. Now I am getting more wide range images especially with mountain landscape shots. I am very pleased with the product. Canon is a favored product at my house. Highly recommend both! 
18067 While the image quality is excellent, the audio quality is really poor. 
18068 Only one battery was any good and tripod broke on first use. The other battery was swelled and would not fit in camera. Lenses work great though. 
18069 Can not claim to have a lot of experience withthe camera yet, but ran out of battery firt time using it...-yes it was fully charged, and yes you can buy extra battery capacity, but this should be standard. 
18070 Great unit for the GoPro - I attached it and forgot about it. 
18071 Happy with gift 
18072 Everything is OK. Good quality product as described in the announcement. Thank you! 
18073 Nice pack. A touch short for a D810 with an 80-40-- but its manageable. 
18074 It is such a cute and functional little bag. I just adore it! 
18075 I bought this for my daughter and it never worked. 
18076 Works in my camera just fine. Priced right! 
18077 Works great; It is delicate however. If you are a &#34;masher&#34;... well you know...buy a kodak 
18078 it is written on the box, IP Camera &#34;Internet Security Camera&#34; and it only works in the same network. That s a joke! 
18079 Lots of storage areas, hold camera and lenses tight and secure. Plenty of room for additional equipment. 
18080 These cables worked fine. Connectors matched. Video and power seems to both be good over the cable. 
18081 This is big enough to hold my camera and all my accessories safely. I love it. 
18082 Provides quick convenient protection against bumps, scrapes, condensation and dust when carrying a camera outdoors in cold windy situations or when my camera is thrown into a loose bag or back pak. 
18083 Woks very nicely to steady hi power binoculars. 
18084 Excellent product. Light and easy to carry and very useful 
18085 Arrived on time and as described 
18086 Fit and finish: good to excellent. Battery tray sometimes unclips from the charger, but appears to be quite robust. Gets a little warm for my liking, but not as warm as the supplied charger for my iPhone. Quite happy with the purchase. 
18087 Works better than described. Lights everything amazingly. 
18088 Good picture. Fairly easy to set up. 
18089 fits perfect works well 
18090 excellent, met my expectations! 
18091 The setup was some what of a pain to get online with my secured router. I have been using it for months now and it shows great reliability and app works great. Great purchase for the money! 
18092 It fits but falls easy when underwater 
18093 Nice camera add-on, but extremely difficult to remove from the camera once attached. 
18094 Looks like a photo on smooth material, pretty heavy duty. 
18095 great transaction. Product as described 
18096 Works great. 
18097 This camera is awesome! Takes the best pictures and it s simple to use. 
18098 perfect little lens. 
18099 It has solved my main purpose of connecting my lense with the desired body. Only due to it s inability to connect with the circuit of the body, many functions like Focus Point, AF etc are not working. But you can use it if you are expert in manual functions. 
18100 what I wanted 
18101 Great camera 
18102 What an amazing camera 
18103 works like it should 
18104 I love it! 
18105 Just what I was looking for. Much easier then the earlier versions. Definitely more cost effective since it came standard with the LCD display. 
18106 Superfast shipping. I love the camera. 
18107 Works great. Would not stay submerged on it s own and did not allow a drop of water into the case. 
18108 From the description I was expecting two. This isn t worth the price for only one. 
18109 excellent product. 
18110 Great lens. Awesome upgrade from the 18-55 Nikon lens. Very impressed with the colours and quality. 
18111 Great product 
18112 Good and fast shippinging 
18113 Works great.. 
18114 It s a good filter. I did have to clean it as there was some sort of film all over the lens when it arrived. Luckily it leaned up well. 
18115 It does what it has to do. So far it have endured cold weather and a lot of adventure. 
18116 Poor picture quality, slow 
18117 This floaty is awesome!! Make sure you do not use a selfie stick with it because it will sink, otherwise it worked great in the water! 
18118 Perfect fit for my Sony DSCHX90V/B! 
18119 Easy to hook up. Great quality picture. 
18120 Just as shown 
18121 very good. keeping the smudges out of my camera lens 
18122 It is great for the things I want to use it for thank you 
18123 great product 
18124 Terrible, Go Pro hit the water and the Velcro separated.........Go Pro is now at the bottom of the lake!! 
18125 Used this wakeboarding, hiking, snowboarding, and around the neighborhood. Great length, I really don t need more than the 40&#34; extension. Vey sturdy, no flex in the pole when it s fully extended. 
18126 No issues with the camera however it is not supported by Hikvision USA since it is not North American version. Called them for support on their NVR and they refused to help once they saw where the cameras were from.... 
18127 Excellent 
18128 great! 
18129 ONLY LAST CHARGE FOR 2 MONTHS JUNK. AND WILL NOT KEEP A CHARGE. I GOT A NEW BRAND 
18130 bad 
18131 not user friendly 
18132 Ended up not needing this order. But it was exactly what I would have needed. 
18133 I never knew i needed to measure light, but damn my photos have improved dramatically, post production time has been cut in half. Overall works well, but the build quality is a bit flimsy for the price. 
18134 Not worth spending money for this seller or product company. Its totally a garbage item lying in my house .And its of no use 
18135 The fit is fine. I have yet to use them, you will be bugged for a review every few days until you fill one out. 
18136 It fit on my Nikon J1 camera easily! It comes packaged in small transparent bag that easily opens without ripping. 
18137 Works well the the camera where some extension needed 
18138 Great items to have. 
18139 some reason it becomes hard to connect to other than thru android 
18140 Product failed after about 3 months of VERY LIGHT use 
18141 not an electronically robust product. Unable to return to seller since it s past 30days 
18142 After just a few shoots - it started to smoke. Faulty capacitors overheated and melted. A FIRE HAZZARD 
18143 DO NOT BUY 
18144 I used for 3 years now and still going strong! 
18145 A set of 4 lenses that can be stacked to achieve some amazing macro results. The set is compact and carries easily in the case which is included. 
18146 Does exactly what it is supposed to. Highly recommended. 
18147 Excellent bag; roomy, sturdy enough to pack camera, lenses, and overnight gear. 
18148 Good quality, great price 
18149 this quad is my second best of 11 quads that I have 
18150 Great frame, very easy to use and setup 
18151 Arrive on time. In good condition. Working as should with camera. Very please. 
18152 lens hood was just as stated perfect fit no problems. 
18153 The mount that came with it was not the one pictured. It isn t the mount I wanted or was expecting. The mount that I received is for a bike not a shotgun. 
18154 good battery 
18155 Love this film! 
18156 These are amazing. Big capacity and long life. So worth the money and I highly recommend this item. 
18157 I use it all the time, no problems. 
18158 Outstanding battery and seller!!! 
18159 This is a little bit hard. 
18160 Added an extra one of these transceivers to my kit that came with the controller. It works great with Canon and Yongnuo flash units. No issues so far. 
18161 Love this drone! 
18162 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. 
18163 One of the zipper-pulls on the main compartment of the bag snapped the first time I used it. The bag appeared to be functional and well-built apart from the zipper issue. It does have a nice rain cover and comfortable straps, but because of the zipper issue, I returned it. 
18164 The worst assembly instructions ever. They should try out one together using their instructions - not possible. The instructions are flat in wrong order and confusing. 
18165 Really good item 
18166 I feel like a professional. 
18167 Don t bother. Don t know what I expected for the money. Fish eye is exactly that everything looks barreled, the other lens combination does absolutely nothing. Very strange. Packaging was probably worth more than the lens. 
18168 Just wanted to say that this thing is awesome 
18169 These cameras are great. 
18170 THEY LAST SO LONG!! 
18171 High Quality and great price! 
18172 Tried it once received & it s very good. The packing is also very good. 
18173 This stand works great. I used it with a muslin backdrop for the first time yesterday. Although the poles were labeled with the wrong letters it was pretty easy to assemble. 
18174 Doesn t work with Sony Nex 5 LT as description said. Waste of money 
18175 Bought 2 of these. As long as your router can keep up, these cameras are awesome. Setup was so simple! 
18176 battery is good 
18177 Awesome !!!!!!! 
18178 Okay 
18179 it was ok 
18180 Case is awesome but I m missing the padding that was suppose to come with it 
18181 Works without a problem. 
18182 it works. 
18183 Very Nice 
18184 While these items are not the quality of OEM lens caps, they are very good quality and given the price the value is amazing. I am completely pleased with the product and would definitely buy again -- and definitely before buys an over-priced OEM product. Great job guys! 
18185 well-crafted 
18186 Pretty good 
18187 Nice size. Good quality. Easy to use. 
18188 Arrived super fast and fit perfectly. 
18189 Awesome lens... but you already know this. 
18190 clamps work wonderfully used to hold photo backdrop tight 
18191 Price vs quality and performance I haven t seen a better PoE camera 
18192 Nice product. very water proof. Does interfere with the auto focus a little 
18193 Lots of pieces for a good price. My only grievance is that there was no instructions. The pieces should have a least been labeled. 
18194 It s a good switch for automating on/off. Just make sure you have access to the RadioRA 2 software beforehand. 
18195 Don t know how I lived without it. 
18196 way too small for canon t2i 
18197 Awful. Won t fit in my T3i. 
18198 Great deal!!! 
18199 There were only the barest of instructions included with the camera. To learn how to operate it, you must download an 85 page instruction book. I find that very inconvenient. 
18200 it was OK 
18201 If summed up in one word, it is a short board camera. I the deepest impression of it is his top focus system, the menu focusing system option is only up to a lot of pages, for its predecessors, is definitely a big improvement corners. 
18202 Yup just buy it you won t regret it 
18203 Water gets stuck inside and takes forever to get it out. One more downside is the camera cannot be tilted 180° (upside down). 
18204 it s very good. the condition of the product is good. there is no scatch and no used. 
18205 Battery works just as my real canon battery! Love it and great charge. 
18206 love it 
18207 Works great......thanks 
18208 LOVE this. My camera charger access quit working and now I can recharge the batteries with NO trouble! Got a spare battery to keep on hand, too. Love my camera and didn t want to replace it. 
18209 Love these backdrops. Lot of fun to use. 
18210 It works perfectly, straps around my wrist comfortably was great for vacationing, water sports, stays on tight - drys out fast. Well made and makes the go pro easy to find in mucky waters of for any reason it ever fell off. Very happy I got this 
18211 great deal, we use the camera all the time, saves jacking around with a cell phone, pix are exceptional, camera easy to use. 
18212 Up close pictures are kind of fuzzy. 
18213 not work well. lost my gopro.a big loss. not good shopping exprience 
18214 Love this! Will use with the umbrella light kit for photo booth. Will order another one soon. 
18215 Brilliant little well stocked kit, I might recommend picking up the cleaning solution if only to save on another order. But i ve already made great use of the pieces in this kit. 
18216 Handy. Compact. My new traveling tripod! Thanks! 
18217 Works well as a relatively affordably little light modifying system but I definitely don t think it s up to commercial lighting standards. For me it just works well for impromptu events/gatherings. Good bonus is that it is portable. 
18218 No comments 
18219 VERY nice camera bag!!! 
18220 Our Studio is 100% manfrotto and these plates are a new addition that work so well! Wether you have the traditional 577 plate or the new &#34;long ones,&#34; this will integrate into your system perfectly. 
18221 Simple, rapido, buen servicio, y excelentes tutorias. simple, fast, good service, and excellent tutorials. 
18222 The batteries work well and the charger is a small size - good for travel. Just remember to push the battery to the right to remove it form the charger. 
18223 Better than the part it was bought to replace 
18224 I love it 
18225 Works fine as long as I have a 37mm lens on the camera. Which is the lens I use most. 
18226 Very good 
18227 Doesn t shoot well in low light, but you get what you pay for. 
18228 Good value for product bundle versus price. Batteries work well. 
18229 Does not work for the Sony A-6000 camera (doesn t physically insert into the Sony). Unfair to give it a low rating for that, since they don t claim it will, but the compatible list has several Sony cameras they I thought were similar. Dummy me. 
18230 I received this camera yesterday. I have not been able to set it up. The directions stink, the video gives the same info as the instruction book if not less. My Galaxy wont pick up the camera. Cant seem to find a phone number to call for assistance. Not happy. 
18231 These work so well and they are perfect. I am new to photography and these are much less than the Canon brand. 
18232 It s ok I was expecting the whole thing lit up 
18233 I love it. 
18234 I put this on a model rocket and the videos it has captured are great! 
18235 Comes with every accessory and has a great video quality, I use it mainly for offroading and shooting competitions and it works perfect, the belt clip accessory clips perfectly to the strap of a hat for a perfect first person point of view 
18236 works wee. 
18237 Just a cable - works fine.. No issues 
18238 Love the camera. This is my first deviation from the point and shoot. Great deal for the money. Everything is in excellent condition. 
18239 This was a gift for my daughter. It was shipped in a timely manner and at a great price. Everything was as described. She has loved it. 
18240 works fine with my Nikon Coolpix S01. 
18241 Genuine Canon LP-E6N Battery. I don t trust cheap third party batteries for my 5d Mark III camera. One star off because its Made In China.. 
18242 Excellent equipment for a great price! 
18243 This is the second one of these I purchased. It is very well made, and I love the bag, but geez, I wish it were a bit larger to carry all of the accessories todays cameras come with --- and the reason for the 4 star rating. 
18244 Very good 
18245 Excellent tripod. High quality. Shipped very fast. Highly recommended 
18246 Fast delivery, items as advertised 
18247 [[VIDEOID:58d2b7f2a34eb0053781a1de8164886d]]Great camera for the money. 
18248 Best extended battery than the gopro one. 
18249 Love this camera, nice image, really easy to use App, easy installation. 
18250 once installed works like a charm 
18251 A great case and does exactly what I need it to do. My only complaint is for the SD cards the slots are a bit loose and I have to be careful when opening it. 
18252 Fits perfectly. 
18253 It s more bulky than I thought it would be. It s really for full-size DSLR, so if you have Sony NEX lines, don t get this. 
18254 Fit camera nicely, A little snug which made it slightly difficult to release. 
18255 Works Great! Easy to assemble and disassemble, sturdy, and adjusts easily. Having the quick release is very handy, though I ve had tripods that are quicker, this one seems to stay still better. Overall worth it. Oh, and it come with a bag! 
18256 It worked out really well, I needed something to hold plans for an airplane I m building and it held every page in a well protected plastic sleeve with plenty of additional sheets for Engineering Changes, notes etc. would definitely recommend. 
18257 excellent 
18258 Needed a back up battery for my canon and so I order this. It came in a in the mail fast and works perfectly! 
18259 It helped. Bright reflections around water. I understand that is a big test. 
18260 Fit perfectly on my D800 and much clearer than the original. Recently opened my camera bag and found the protector damaged badly. Took it out and suprisantly found my camera screen still in tact, not a scratch. Buying another one to replace right now. Highly recommended. 
18261 Good value and works very well. 
18262 great product. GOPro works well with this 
18263 I use this with my Canon 1.8 50mm prime and it works great.. it s obviously not going to be as good a legit macro lens, however it s fantastic when you consider the abilities this $20 metal tube. Would recommend. 
18264 A TOTAL RIPOFF! Batteries will not haold a charge. Cannot get 10 pictures per charge. 
18265 A great little camera for the money. Bought it as refurbished, but looks and works like new. Canon makes a great camera. 
18266 It worked as advertised and the price was very good. 
18267 This works perfectly with my Phantom 2 that I have Fatshark goggles installed on. It is nice to have another monitor for other people to watch or sometimes it is just easier to fly without the FPV goggles. 
18268 Works great thks! 
18269 just what the Doctor ordered 
18270 A gift for my son, he says it is great... 
18271 Didn t have all the film !!! 
18272 good 
18273 Works well. 
18274 I received a tripod with a defective ball head (it won t stay in place). Over the course of months I tried to contact Manfrotto so it could be replaced, but got no answer whatsoever. Shame on Manfrotto. 
18275 My husband loves his watch but has tucked it away to use on special occasions which I find a bit strange, but I know he is really pleased with it. 
18276 I have not had the opportunity to use it to the full extent as of yet, because of my work schedule, but the little time that i have had to play with it I love the small economy size of the camera, and it came with every item as advertised. 
18277 This system works well for us as we travel a lot and can watch our home. 
18278 Great little quadcopter, perfect for learning. Do buy teh blade protectors for it. 
18279 Fast delivered, very nice! 
18280 Works Great 
18281 I am in love with this product. Works really great on my Nikon d3200. Absolutely recommend this product for others. 
18282 I didn t purchase this on amazon but through a local store but I have to say that it takes absolutely gorgeous photos. Really amazing and manually focusing with the A7 cameras is a breeze. Highly recommended. 
18283 So far Loving it 
18284 great 
18285 Works great! 
18286 Works great! 
18287 I m not happy with this product, is really bad, I d never recommend. 
18288 Great compact size camera, i have a canon 60D and it fits fine with a standard lens. 
18289 Love it, but the battery life is under 30 seconds. I think there is an issue and I m not sure who to contact. Could you contact us? 
18290 I received Different camera that I bough t and I Lost money 
18291 Very good 
18292 This has helped me from straining my voice from yelling across the house. It s my voice saver. :) 
18293 Worked great no issues 
18294 Works fine, no problems. 
18295 Super easy to put on my D3200. Looks GREAT, and makes the camera easier to grip/hold on to. I have had lots of complements on it. LOVE IT!!! 
18296 The motion notifications is amazing. I m able to cut pieces of videos I want and share it with my family. I truly recommend nest cam. I also have the thermostat and is awesome. 
18297 this paper is so fun, and now it s so cheap! 
18298 Very nice case with lots of adjustable compartments for an additional lens, extra batteries, etc. I would recommend this case to a friend. 
18299 Awesome! 
18300 Very impressed. Need to see the You Tube video for installation. Takes about 10 minutes to install. Watch the video. 
18301 Great insert if you have a bag large enough. 
18302 I felt like it was hard to good a good angle.. Complicated and failed when I needed it to work. 
18303 cool 
18304 Perfect for handgun storage. I own a dozen Pelican cases of different sizes for storing everything from handguns to a high end camera. Foam is pick snd pluck for a perfect fit. Sturdy, water and dust proof. Also TSA compliant for airline travel. 
18305 Worked like a champ did have problems with led but you can turn sensitivity down and back up light will go out. I m guessing the bad reviews were given by people using to fast a shutter or to slow a lens. 
18306 Good for priceG 
18307 Excellent quality photos and easy to use! We had a Canon similar to this for the last 8 years and it just now started using a lot of batteries. Love the zoom and other features! Great color too ;) Will always stick with Canon! 
18308 Great...Worked out very well for filming parent children interactions 
18309 Fits and works like the original, but at a lower cost. Great deal 
18310 Great protection for the camera. It has got a nice little side pouch to stuff in any extra cables, etc. There is also an extra side zipper where i stock extra batteries and sd cards. 
18311 Perfectly convenient and durable bag to carry my new camera in that has a nice shoulder strap making it easy and safe to carry. 
18312 Good price 
18313 Not bad 
18314 Definitely met our expectations! Very nice! 
18315 enjoying 
18316 This bag is perfect for my camera. Durable, quality construction. highly recommended. 
18317 A neat gadget for anyone with a smart phone that enjoys photography. It is nice to have a few more options to the iPhone s camera. 
18318 It works great with my new camera! 
18319 Perfect for my camera. 
18320 Couldn t ever figure out how to set up 
18321 Good 
18322 Charged up easily, held charge, and WORKS! 
18323 Quality of pictures was not good. Customer service explained that they might not be compatible with existing analog DVR. He gladly set up a return which I did do. 
18324 Great camera and kit for the price! 
18325 I bought this case for my husband for his GoPro for our anniversary and I am so glad that I did. It s extremely heavy duty and fits everything including accessories very well. 
18326 I love this little camera, so great to check on my property from 3000 miles away. The images are good enough to identify a person s face at a good distance. Totally worth the price. I got this as a gift. 
18327 These batteries work well and hold their charge. 
18328 Great set to have!!! 
18329 Good product. Good service. 
18330 Worked fine. 
18331 They work awesome, I will recomended this product to everybody. 
18332 nice quality 
18333 It works fine but the bucle is quite fragile, must close it with care:-) 
18334 good product prompt shipment 
18335 Works great. I even dropped it shortly after buying it and only a tiny piece chipped off. Wonderful product for the price and greatly extends battery life. I leave it on 24/7 and hardly ever worry about not having enough juice. 
18336 great does all the cameras with the one plugin 
18337 Lost the one that came with the camera. This worked like a charm and at a great price. 
18338 Very happy with this purchase. Prompt shipping and everything arrived as expected. 
18339 Came neatly packaged in its box with directions! :) 
18340 Works as intended with my vk750ii speedlight. I like that it uses AAA batteries vs hard to find batteries like the altura flash. Two step remote button for focus then capture is a great addition! 
18341 Returned this item. No directions as to how to put it together. Did not seem to be flexible enough to move and catch the light in a timely manner. I just use the reflectors by hand now. 
18342 Got the charger quickly, without a problem. Charged up our extra batteries and it works fine! 
18343 Great tripod for the the price. I am in no way a professional photagrapher but you can tell this is a high quality product. 
18344 Perfect little container with premade slots for my basic GoPro equipment. 
18345 Works great. The first time I have used a light meter, but in unusual lighting situations it has worked out very well. Why did I wait so long to get one of these? 
18346 This camera is amazing just what I was looking for. 
18347 fast delivery and good product, works great thanks 
18348 Works great. I bought the D3200 Nikon Book for Dummies which helped a lot with initial use. You need to take the time to learn all the features available. The perfect camera for my needs. 
18349 This selfie stick gets tons of use! A perfect holster for the Gopro Hero 4. 
18350 Very nice. Takes great photos. Just what I needed. Not a blurred photo since I got this camera. 
18351 Looks more powerful than it is. I might as well used a small pair of binoculars. It was a birthday gift so I don t want to be to critical... 
18352 what an excellent product .leave your premises with no worries and best of all no cables. 
18353 Good protection for the camera. Great Product. 
18354 I just started taking photos with my camera, and this has made a huge difference in the quality of my photos, especially outdoors. I highly recommend! 
18355 Good price. I will buy these again. Got them when they said I would 
18356 Great size if only 1 camera and couple lenses. 
18357 Not recommended for mounting accessories to your camera rig, since they seem to wobble even when torqued down tightly. 
18358 good battery 
18359 I have a few old Canon 40D cameras that were in need of new batteries. This package deal of 2 BP-511A batteries plus charger fit the bill perfectly and the price was very reasonable. Very happy with the purchase. 
18360 This tripod is very good, it is lightweight which makes traveling easy while being sturdy considering its weight. But most important of all the tripod has great stability and captures good videos for vlogging and pictures for memories. 
18361 Delivered on time. Great price. Works great. 
18362 Easy to use and the zoom power is great 
18363 Just what I needed to keep my Canon lenses and sensor clean, at a good price 
18364 Lens seemed to get a little foggy, but easily wipes off. 
18365 Not what I expected. 
18366 WiFi is weak and not friendly. Reverted to an Eye-Fi card. Good price. 
18367 This bag is perfect for travel and allows me the versatility of packing not only all my camera equipment and computer, but also other small things I need from my purse so that it is not necessary for me to carry a purse any longer. 
18368 This is great. It keeps me from backing in the garage too far. 
18369 A little bit of learning curve but truly great resolution and ease of use! 
18370 Good camera for the price. If you want to have a high quality camera for vacation, causal shooting and etc, this is perfect. But if you aim for more professional shooting, this is not enough 
18371 good sttuff 
18372 OK. What was sold was an older version.than current new. So far so good. Wish it had a a zoom! 
18373 batteries came charged and lasted a good amount of time 
18374 As Tina Turner says &#34;simply the best!&#34; 
18375 Loved the binoculars , but they were toast after dropping them ONE TIME. I baby all of my gear, but come on... You re outdoors and things happen. If your product is shoddy enough to break after one little drop, I ll look elsewhere. 
18376 Works great. 
18377 Love this bag!!! Very cute and roomy too! The material feels nice as well 
18378 Great price. 
18379 Good product, but NO MANUAL. Be careful. Frustrating to install but once it s done, it works very well. Until now, I don t know how to create multiple PIN and delete existing.. 
18380 Why can t you at least provide 1 hour of video history for free? I don t need or want 7 days of video. All I need to see what just happened a few minutes ago. 
18381 Good entry level mount system. Works great on road; but allows camera wobble when off road. I have since gone to a metal mount with a rigid clamp system. 
18382 While adjusting the angle gently, it broke. I super-glued it back together but now it s at an odd angle and looks fake. If it wasn t broken it would look okay for the price. 
18383 Fast delivery and pretty quick charge. Great product, as stated. Haven t used it besides charging cause I bought them to replace the one I lost due to really not using the camera. We will see how well they hold a charge this weekend in Disneyworld :-) 
18384 I lost my camera 
18385 Good product and transaction. 
18386 Excellent product, price and delivery 
18387 It s great 😍 
18388 Cheap, and work like a charm 
18389 Excellent product, fits and protect the camera (nikon 5200) and all my gear perfect 
18390 This camera has nice zoom range and video capability but the picture quality is only average. 
18391 it sucks 
18392 Hard to adjust and kind of looks stupid in your head. It works, but I immediately started looking for other methods. 
18393 It was perfect. After all it is just a lens cap. 
18394 Just what I was looking for to be able to attach a small microphone to the side for better voice clarity. Fits perfectly into the tripod as well. Good choice. 
18395 Works perfectly! 
18396 Excellent 
18397 IT S WHAT I SPECTED. GOOD! 
18398 Ended up returning this item as it did not correctly describe that it does not support continuous streaming. 
18399 Stand is worth the money. Stable & ridged. adjustments work and it folds up small. 
18400 Not the highest quality picture but gets the job done. Close up range is rather narrow. Looks like winter all year long. Everything green is white. 
18401 Great little camera. Has the features and then some. Easy to allow your creative side to come forward. 
18402 Great case except could use a little more room for batteries and charges so it could be a complete kit 
18403 Purchased this for a backup for a wedding. Works great. 
18404 I didn t expect it for a week and it came 2 days later. Awesome!!!! Love it. Keep up the good work!!! 
18405 Video is ok, set up is rather easy although not well explained, especially for iOS. However, both my Foscam monitors clicks very loudly throughout day and night, waking up my kids every single night. Both my monitors are now in the attic collecting dusts. 
18406 This is exactly what I needed for my camera. The product was on time and worked perfectly. I need a backup battery for my Nikon Prosumer camera and will by from this seller. 
18407 Still learning how to use it, so far it s been a great tool 
18408 Love this camera so far!! Am learning to shoot in manual mode to get even sharper images!!! Only wish it had a view finder!!!! 
18409 Great product!!!! Incredible at evening out light.... Great for on the go photographers. 
18410 All went well with the purchase 
18411 Took these as backups on several trips and they worked flawlessly. They seem to get a bit less charge than the oem Sony battery, but definitely worth it considering the price difference. Used in a Sony RX100 m2 camera. 
18412 Excellent fit for my 7D MKii Great! 
18413 The worst matte box ever !!! Don t waste your money and you time !!! 
18414 Works great - light is bright, and close up picture (macro lens) is great. 
18415 It took me a little patience to put the hood and lens cover on with the filter already on. I first thought it wouldn t fit and then just &#34;relaxed&#34; and tried again! I like having the different filters and the case as well. 
18416 Works as expected, very sturdy and doesn t slide around, attaches well to the camera. The product was shipped and delivered surprisingly quickly. All around very happy with the product and order. 
18417 Do not like it 
18418 Nice quality product. Excellent price! Delivered on time. 
18419 I m not a camera person...not what I expected... 
18420 very good 
18421 This is a good bag, and is a very good size. I just wish there were more padding included to make it a bit more stiff. 
18422 Very durable, nice camera bag. It gets a little tight when packing more than one lens, but mostly fits what I need. It looks nice and I feel my camera is protected. 
18423 Really Nice Case 
18424 Awesome camera, great features easy operation. 
18425 In fact it was not a good buy. The product has good resistance, but unfortunately my shaft with the cake support bar, which causes the two wheels never touch the ground. Also bad finish of the wheels that generate some shaky movements. 
18426 Cleans better then expected. I got it for my ASUSZ T200 and it cleaned my wife s ipad better then her cloth. 
18427 Happy with product. 
18428 The app for the phone sucks I have HTC m8 I can download the videos and pictures but I when I watch the videos no sound 
18429 Love some pieces but the tripod stand is not sturdy, gave it to the kids to play. Many pieces missing in the package too. Not happy, will not recommend it. 
18430 1st pair I purchased worked ok for several months until it stopped synching properly. The new pair never synched properly and I was not able to return it because my first photo shoot was after the return period. Very disappointed. 
18431 I just unpacked and assemble and I m very happy with it. The seller shipped it quickly, it was double boxed and arrived in excellent shape, even all of the light bulbs worked. The quality is very good. I would buy from this seller again! 
18432 Great camera. Use it while boating, camping. Fine photos and meets all my expectations. 
18433 Good Quality. It came with Nikon D3100 bundle. So nice to have this once if you buy bundle. Personally I don t use it often though. But yeah sometime you required this. If you are not buying any other lens 18mm-55mm and 55-200mm will work great for beginners. 
18434 Not as flexible as i was hoping, but it s very sturdy. 
18435 Not bad. 
18436 Great. The perfect cost effective solution to water fun with my coolpix. 
18437 Really nice strap. Works just as your expect. I almost bought one of the Black Rapids straps, but this one is higher quality and more attractive. Looks damn sharp 
18438 Excellent product ! Thoroughly recommend - super for glasses ! 
18439 I AM SURE I WILL LIKE IT, IF I CAN EVER PURCHASE ONE. HAS BEEN ON BACK-ORDER AND MAY NOT BE AVAIL. FOR ANOTHER MONTH. 
18440 I purchased this item for my 13 year old granddaughter. She likes it, but has not used it enough to offer meaningful feedback. Delivery was prompt. I was surprised it was delivered on Sunday. 
18441 Fits perfectly and easy to hold onto. looking forward to using it in Hawaii! 
18442 Work good and last a long time on a full charge 
18443 Excellent. More than I expected. It has so many functions that you may not have to use the retouching programs. The Zoom is awesome !! 
18444 SO COOL 
18445 Great product! 
18446 Nice device. Clear and compact enough to carry easy. 
18447 Excellent walking stick with camera mounting at good price. 
18448 The system is great. Simple to install and makes you feel safer. 
18449 nice little camera 
18450 Great grab n go back for your DSLR, and a few lenses and accessories. 
18451 Even it is not perfect goods,but still has all the key features a security camera needs. 
18452 Great for cleaning eyeglasses and small screens 
18453 They can be easily stored in your pocket for that on the go cleaning 
18454 I got one and then bought one for my wife. They are a simple point and shoot that does a good job of taking photos. 
18455 Handy 
18456 Charger works great! I like the fact that you can charge you batteries AC/DC. Batteries not so good! 
18457 Waste of money. Save you dollars and by a good macro lens 
18458 Once installed, I was able to increase my original GPS from 4 satellites to 9 and fly safely. 
18459 Perfect fit. Same as the ones that came with drone 
18460 Great everyday lens, need the hood to prevent glare thought 
18461 nice 
18462 Great camera still learning how to use it properly 
18463 great Companion to my Pentax K-50 
18464 These are like some smaller ones I bought for eye glasses except much larger and a better value. They are great for large screens or any surface I do not want to scratch. They are one of the best I ve ever used. 
18465 Very nice night vision picture quality for the price. 
18466 Perfect replacement unit for my aging ADEMCO - Drop in replacement, didn t have to program a thing. 
18467 I have already used a few of these packs and just started on the shiny stars pack! All the film works great and I love love the themes! I def recommend this pack as it was also such an awesome deal!! I use this with my Instax 8 
18468 The battery last a long time. Simple to use and to download. They produce surprisingly clear video.exceeds my expectation. 
18469 Perfect 
18470 Battery last for very long time and quickly charges. The power of this Flash is far more than I expected. Time between firing the flash is very short, leap change compared to Canon 430 EX II Flash 
18471 Fast shipping, just as expected! Thanks! 
18472 good quality product. I ll buy it again. 
18473 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! Easely fit a 24-70 2.8L ii 
18474 Brought two as gifts but you get what you paid for. The power adapter gets &#34;hot&#34;, not warm but hot. The unit would restart for no reason. The speakers are low end. Would not purchase this again. 
18475 to big and complicated to use 
18476 Camera case is very nice and my camera fits nicely into it. It has good padding and places for batteries. I didn t want something too big. Perfect. 
18477 Worked as expected. 
18478 Great plan 
18479 Followed directions, plugged in, little spark, died. 
18480 good quality 
18481 very shaky if attached to moving position. 
18482 cheap 
18483 Great lens to be used with Canon DSLR cameras. I hated to purchase the Canon brand lens for so much more, when I only use this lens as a hobby. Great zoom lens for a good price. 
18484 Works perfectly, fits perfectly, highly recommended !! 
18485 Works great Wish they offered a round version for people with glasses 
18486 Great Camera. Got it to send pictures with the Wi-Fi. Works great. Easy to use. A+ 
18487 It is good to have it, but hard to use it, 
18488 Excellent multi section monopod. Reduces to just over 15 in to easily fit in small suite cast. Easy to extend sections quickly. Strong when it is extended. Light weight. 
18489 Love this zoom lense. You just need to make sure you have a way to stabilize it for. 
18490 It works great 
18491 Broke after a month of use. 
18492 Works but it came in a case far to large for a 58mm filter. Also the case had a large crack going down the front of it. 
18493 Great 
18494 No problems 
18495 re-furbished- so was not sure about the quality. met my expectations. thanks 
18496 There are many times I want my binoculars but its just not easy to lug around my full sized set. These are serious binoculars with good optics, weight, and feel. As with all Vortex they carry a no hassle lifetime replacement 
18497 The charger was fast and the batteries held their charge. The entire set was great for my trip to the Caribbean. 
18498 pictures were blurry and underdeveloped 
18499 Great little machine. The company is having growing pains in the customer service area, but the device is first rate. 
18500 Very Good Product 
18501 You can only replay video that was recently recorded using your mobile device. When going back a day or two it takes a very long time if at all. The image and sound is delayed. Not worth $10 a month in my opinion. 
18502 The best lens on the planet! Dont settle for anything else..., 
18503 No support. 
18504 All lenses should be protected with this inexpensive &#34;insurance&#34;. Works as advertised and expected of a Nikon product. 
18505 My toddler pulled Grandma s Nikon D50 off the kitchen table and broke the bayonet ring on the lens. Rather than buying a new lens, I was able to replace the mounting ring! 
18506 Perfect 
18507 poor image, poor focal range, not for small places, poor battery, poor software and manual, sound better than image. it s a middle range USB pen drive more than a camera. 
18508 Loved this set! A great versatile set-up, looks professional, obviously not quite what you would get for hundreds more dollars, but I was very impressed. The lightboxes are really nice and the backdrops are huge and work well. The carrying cases are very nice. 
18509 Very low quality battery. I get about 40 shots on a fully charged battery before it goes dead. By comparison, my 3 year old Canon battery gets 300+ shots on a charge. Would not recommend. 
18510 The clamp has an adjustable rubber band inside the jaws. Useful in keeping the clamp from sliding forward. The gooseneck is eghh... 
18511 GREAT!!!! 
18512 great product used it to take family group pictures and didnt have to hire a photographer to do it set it up and used the remote to take the group picture with love it 
18513 Durable and stays in place.. Highly recommend 
18514 Good quality glass with convenient carrying case. 
18515 Very sturdy and fits camera well. 
18516 love the product works very well. Can charge multiple products and is very well made. 
18517 Word great.Idea Product 
18518 Delivers as promised. Works very well and included the 12v and european converter. Great price 
18519 good quality 
18520 The user interface leaves a lot to be desired and the motion alert and recording fails constantly. But it is cheap and otherwise works. My one worry is that if the manufacturer ever stop supporting it via their website then the device is entirely useless and inaccessible. 
18521 Works great. Just what I needed. 
18522 The insight switch would not connect to the internet. I was on the phone with Belkin and they couldn t help. The cam connected to the internet but it kept losing connection. Sent them back. 
18523 love it.nice and light.compact.fits my canon perfect.nice traveling case 
18524 excellent deal, no complaints , and fast ship, thanks, -J 
18525 The LCD screen on your camera could easily be scratched. You re crazy if you don t use a screen protector. 
18526 The build quality is superb. It s solid and balances nicely on my D610. Produces beautiful portraits with nice bokeh. A favorite of mine. 
18527 perfect 
18528 thanks 
18529 ok 
18530 used mine in a dive off the coast of la jolla and it took great pictures and videos 
18531 Simple to operate. Gives more value for the money, and gives quality pictures & videos. 
18532 Wow what a camera 
18533 Works but takes a lot of practice. 
18534 Fantastic 
18535 A little bit disappointed with the unit. Picture is not as bright as another brand that I already have. Besides that when displaying some of the pictures it cuts them so I can t see the picture complete. I bought it to give it to my brother as a present. 
18536 Bought for grandson. He has used several times and loves wearing it while he captures all the action. Fits comfortably and doesn t slide. Even wore it white water rafting. 
18537 good deal! 
18538 Good quality for the money. 
18539 First class! 
18540 Picture makes it look big but in reality it is very small. 
18541 It is super tiny and incredibly uncomfortable. Not sure what human this was designed for :-( Sorry. 
18542 Perfect - works great! 
18543 Works well! 
18544 very good 
18545 The Flycam 5000 is harder to balance then it looks. I am still working at it. 
18546 Works well with Olympus C5060 and C7070. 
18547 It s convenient to dive 
18548 Product received in a timely manner and as listed/pictured. Thanks! 
18549 No need for warning tag. Price can be reduced 
18550 Nice camera. Order came on time. 
18551 Product packaging solid, fully applicable to outdoor sports, good quality, practical,I have used the suction cup and it did a fantastic job,and will use other accessories for a free time. 
18552 One of the best thing i ever did i think this lens is magic,of course lens like this Tripod must if you want the best result. 
18553 Seemed cool at first, but the problem is that while it shows what you re taking a picture of, this item attaches to your lens and will blow out photos due to the way the lens attaches over and doesn t compensate. 
18554 Good system overall. I wish the codec was in a .mov or .m4v format instead of .avi. 
18555 Love them 
18556 Easy to install, fixed my problem (scratched lens). A whole new case is only $15, but save a few bucks and this works just as well. 
18557 My niece loves it 
18558 good, but I like the other one I purchased better 
18559 works great 
18560 very nice 
18561 Awsome product! I used everything in this kit and it was all A ok. My only complaint being the plastic is a lil cheap not high rated type I feal. 
18562 cool nice pic and video for the money 
18563 Easy to assemble, fun to use! 
18564 Super nice and light for a case this size. Wish they made it for the Phantom 3. 
18565 works great. 
18566 I am So glad to have left the Nikon/Canon world behind, after playing with this x body for almost a full month there s NO way that I would go back to the BIG two. A+++ 
18567 Good for the price 
18568 Great 
18569 Perfect lens for my camera shoots. Sharp pictures. 
18570 Good, just don t use it while diving 
18571 Works great and fast delivery. 
18572 Fantastic binoculars for the money. Watched 2 wolves fighting over an elk carcass with 2 grizzlies in Yellowstone on their first use. Wouldn t have been possible without them 
18573 Great product, works as it should. Delivery was fast and without issues. 
18574 Worked perfectly. It lets me use my old Vivitar telephoto lens on my Nikon D3100. 
18575 I couldn t resist the 2-pack, but quickly lost both due to a not so secure fit. The eyepieces just don t seem to click in the same way as the OEM part does. 
18576 PERFECT 
18577 Good size for my camera. Plenty of pockets for accessories. 
18578 Awesome Charging Device ... Works exactly as advertised! 
18579 Pretty awesome compared to most tripods I ve seen. I only wish the feet were heavier for two reasons - so they d drop and fully extend without pulling, and to be more stable. It s nice and light for carrying. 
18580 Product as described...works great 
18581 I bought this as a replacement for my battery pack, but this one broke off in the camera as I was pulling it out. Worked great, but not super heavy duty 
18582 Although it s cheap, it works swimmingly. I sank my point and shoot in the sink to test it first and then took it to Cancun and the Green River in Moab (not in the same day). Worked perfect and kept the camera dry. 
18583 American Craftsmanship at its BEST. Far nicer , more functional, and less expensive than the OEM grip!!!! 
18584 This is exactly the head I was wanting to get. 
18585 Great, my brother love it. 
18586 good 
18587 I lost my charger and this was a very cost effective replacement. It even came with a battery when I only needed the charger. So now I have two! I haven t tried the car charger yet so I can t comment on that item. 
18588 works well as advertised. Beware that Disney parks do not allow it to be carried inside just like other parks. It can not fit in the pocket. But otherwise does its job well. 
18589 the filters came unprotected one of them is al scratch up. Will return them. 
18590 Great Product 
18591 Battery and charger work perfectly!!! You brought my old video camara back to life!!! Thanks!! 
18592 Perfect 
18593 Just used it once for in car race video in dirt oval stock car 
18594 worked fine. not go pro quality I suppose but for 50$ i ll use it again even had a bit of a wreck and no glitch.no trouble when used with PNY brand micro sd card. 
18595 When you zoom out you get a black vignette. 
18596 great price for a great product 
18597 A little difficult to figure out when you first get it. But once you figure it out, it works great. Great for long exposure photos. 
18598 All is ok! 
18599 It functions the way that I expected. 
18600 Great batteries. Would buy again. 
18601 Works Great 
18602 Build quality is cheap, but that s the norm nowadays. Light as a feather. Battery life is less than I expected. Projector works as expected, enough to share pictures and movies while out and about. 
18603 All batteries came expired. Very disappointed 
18604 Some access were missing. 
18605 Good wireless camera system. A little bit of interference based on distance. 
18606 garbage 
18607 Not the best quality, it is hard to make the lens move, sometimes as if it was stucked and the pictures are not really high-pitched. 
18608 Great camera. I ll be buying another soon! 
18609 Fits my new Jamstik+ perfectly, with room to spare for strap and other accessories. One star off for the extremely long shipping time, but the wait was worth it. 
18610 Great price! 
18611 Came with everything I needed to put it on and the instructions were easy to follow. 
18612 rec d as promised and as advertised 
18613 As advertised. Works just as well as the OEM batteries and I will buy more in the near future. 
18614 I wish I could say I love this bag. Oddly, it doesn t hang right. It s very uncomfortable to carry. Hangs at a strange angle. The snaps are very difficult to close. It looks fabulous, but I never use it. It s become a storage bag. 
18615 They do work, but are pretty cheap on the tie on end 
18616 Looks good and fits well - no complaints. 
18617 Fast delivery and worked perfectly! 
18618 I haven t had a chance to use the tripod with my camera yet but it looks good and easy to use. 
18619 Aircraft flys extremely well but am having problems with video. This is the second one. DJI seems to be having problems with transmitting video from aircraft to controller. Ritz Camera is very very fast with their shipping. Very pleased with Ritz. 
18620 Door doesn t even close right, the foam inside does not hold the battery tight the place where the iPad is advertised to go is filled with foam. Would not recommend this to someone else 
18621 follows up on any issue. Good quality cabes. 
18622 Do yourself a favor and swap out your heavier aluminum rails for some of these. 
18623 This lens is great 
18624 worked great! Good value. 
18625 Best E mount lens out there 
18626 this is easily be the single best monopod i have ever owned! 
18627 good camera, night vision and internet based monitoring 
18628 So far, I really like this camera and their technical support is awesome. Today I needed assistance connecting my camera to my i-phone and the Foscam technician (Calvin) was very informative and helpful in assisting me. 
18629 Henry was a good tech, Henry helped me with clearing up my major issues I was having with my connections.Thanks Henry for your help. 
18630 Perfect---quality and shipping! 
18631 This strap works great, it is adjustable to fit hand size and camera height. Noticeable increase in stability. 
18632 Works Great! Love the Price 
18633 This tripod will work; i like it. 
18634 Fit perfect. Good quality. 
18635 Good set of pouches to protect your lenses. 
18636 I thought it was going to be difficult to apply. Maybe I would get it off center or with an air bubble but it was very easy to apply. Now my new camera is protected. 
18637 Great price and great quality. 
18638 I took this to my trip to the Philippines. One of the activities I used it for was tubing - horrible decision. My GoPro snapped off and got lost in the river! Thank goodness the locals found my GoPro after a couple of days. 
18639 Works well. 
18640 The camera is very good and easy to use. The case that I bought, and was recommended, CASE LOGIC DCB-302 is too small for this camera and someone made a mistake suggesting this casa to be purchased along with this Olympus. I will return the case. 
18641 I mounted this to my airsoft gun, fits on their tight, didn t need to tighten after a few hours. 
18642 As someone who uses my gopro a lot for just random purposes, it s awesome! I ve had it now for about a month, but I ll do a proper review later on. So far though, I take it everywhere! 
18643 Product was exactly as described and at a great price !!! 
18644 excellent purchase, exactly what I needed! 
18645 One product is missing. 
18646 grabacion aceptable 
18647 Cheap, works well with my J1. 
18648 Works great, gives a little more room when turning the camera to portrait 
18649 Great it works 
18650 Works as advertised 
18651 Works great! Refurbished but it s a very small accessory with a small case designed to attach to the strap. The WPS button and indicator light is an easy setup along with the Nikon WMU app. 
18652 It was prefect beside that strap that made my camera drop but it okay so I am happy 
18653 Does the job! 
18654 Thank you 
18655 Very strong item. I would highly recommend this to protect your high dollar camera on the DJI Phantom 3. 
18656 Incredible barging 
18657 Owned one exactly like this and loved using it. It met my every need; traveling, pictures for newspapers and monthly articles about our club. Was happy to be able to find the this camera to replace the one that was worn out. 
18658 Perfect size for mirror-less system and 3 lenses. Using with a Sony a6000 and could not be happier. The belt stores when not needed and included should strap helps to stabilize. Think Tank is, as always, very robust and well built. Thumbs up! 
18659 Excellent 
18660 Great Product .....easy to use ! 
18661 Not easy to adjust the length But it seems that the quality is good, I felt that the product I ordered was too old or used because the stick was covered by dust inside its Box. 
18662 Works well but the swivel isn t very strong and can t support a camera in every position. 
18663 I was very disappointed to find that the lens opening on the case is too small for the Samsung WB350F. The lens opens but then shuts down. Bummer! It s too bad as it was just what I was looking for! 
18664 Holds a charge, better than the one that came with it. 
18665 Horrible Item. Cameras POS. 
18666 Having trouble with this camera. Went to the Bahamas and it only took a few pictures. Very disapointed. 
18667 So far so good. Will see how batteries hold up 
18668 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1CPL polarizer and it is just as good. 
18669 Needed sleeves to hold index cards on a magnetic white board, these worked out. 
18670 I love it. 
18671 Very Nice 
18672 I like the style of it but the functionality just isn t there. The sliding on switch didn t stay in the on position so if you wanted to turn it on you had to hold the button down. It did come with 4 color filters which was cool. 
18673 Pretty good although it will not work with the Sony vixia hf r62 with the battery attached. You can remove the battery and stuff it in next to the main unit. This would have been helpful to know before I bought. 
18674 Easy enough for a monkey to install. Prettier than a foscam. 
18675 Good product I enjoyed using it 
18676 Very good battery, I use it all the time, thank you. 
18677 Cheap! Broke 
18678 Works like a charm, people think these are real cameras! 
18679 Love it 
18680 Great product for the price. Nicely made and the length is long enough to cross over your body. The camera lays about hip length. The color is vibrant and the leather gives a secure feeling to hold a heavy camera. 
18681 very good 
18682 Bought for Son s birthday. Awkward to download data. 
18683 good product. Fits my lens perfectly. 
18684 good little tripod. could be more sturdy, but overall, not bad quality. 
18685 Very good!! Works very well..we can see in the TV...it was awesome!! 
18686 Great price, great fit, fast shipping - a five star seller! Just as good as Nikons - as if they really make them!!!! 
18687 The cords arrived very quickly and they are really nice heavy quality 
18688 Nice product for sure. Very quickly delivered and was everything I had expected. Many thanks:) 
18689 I expected the front to hang from the back cover when you take off the front cover to take a picture, but it always falls off. It looks great, fits great but not useable in the field. I returned this. 
18690 I like these better than my other baluns that are longer with a swivel - this connection isn t flawless but more dependable than the other kind 
18691 Picture quality is decent, so is audio stream. However the motion detection is very inconsistant. Sometimes they alert for no reason and othertimes you can walk through the room with no alert. 
18692 Great product. Haven t had a change to use it much yet but it seems to support my Vortex 85 spotting scope well, 
18693 Excellent lens with great optics. A little challenging to get in focus off hand in lower lighting, but it will force you to take better thought out shots. It s my only lens carried on my camera now, even though I have several. VERY flexible! 
18694 I really love the quality of these lens covers. perfectly easy to used and step up. Now to get the other size for my smaller lens. 
18695 Stop working after the 2nd day. 
18696 Cannot tell the fake TV from the real one. 
18697 Love this lens on my Nikon D3200. I bought this for a walk around lens for vacation however I haven t had it off the camera since getting it. 
18698 When used in the manner describe on the back, all the labels will be upside down to the user. Seems like a design oversight/flaw. It is also much smaller than other similar charts making it harder to find what you want or read the (upside down) labels. 
18699 You have to take off the front ring of the LX7 and the Neewer cap bayonets into its place. Its not very elegant looking but works very well. I have had it on the camera for a couple of months now and it works flawlessly. 
18700 Simply didn t work ...bought 2 thinking first one was defective ...got 2nd one ....same results 
18701 Kept giving me same reading regardless if I increase intensity of my flash or light source ....or near pitch darkness. 
18702 they are great quality, but I though it would work with reflectors, but it only works with lights 
18703 Excellent... love the camera and accessories so far... Not sure why Panasonic doesn t include the adaptor and batteries with the camera like other brands... 
18704 Works very well with my camera 
18705 It is a great little camera 
18706 Holds photos well very cute but only has 49 pockets NOT 72 
18707 Love the look and the feel. My son bought a pair and raved about the support. I totally agree and I have sensitive at times painful feet. 
18708 Fits great to my Phanton 3 drone 
18709 Great little camera -awesome pictures. Usually always just use my phone, but decided to try small camera for Hawaiian vacation 
18710 Great product, good price! 
18711 Love it 
18712 Great camera I only wish it am with a sim card. 
18713 So glad I got extra batteries for the GoPro!! Dive trips with multiple dives and video made the extra batteries a must! 
18714 I have a small point and shoot and wanted bag that would be a better fit. Yes this bag is the better fit for my needs 
18715 Strong design and perfect size for my monopod Oben ACM-2400L 4. 
18716 It did exactly what I needed it to do it stable , lightweight and easy to transport 
18717 camera fits well in case. Product received promptly by seller 
18718 love it all!! Great camera! 
18719 Good product. Works as advertised. 
18720 Happy with product. 
18721 Everything was there... save for the instruction book. Would really like the instruction book. How can I get the instruction manual... other than I love the camera. 
18722 Love the high-speed sync without the typical high-speed sync pricing! The recycle time is a little slower than I d like but, for the price, it s worth it. 
18723 this is a nice case to put all of your equipment in 
18724 Perfecto por ahora. 
18725 Diferent 
18726 Really enjoy the camera strap. Had a Joby previous and was unhappy with the thin strap. The shoulder pad on the Fastfire is much more comfortable. I prefer the attachment point of the Fastfire. Never really felt secure with the mounting point on the threaded tripod hole. 
18727 Fit well on Sony a6000. Pain in the A** changing battery! 
18728 Quality is okay for the price. 
18729 takes great photos but the stripes ripped off!!!!! don t buy cheap plastic. I want a full refund 
18730 Easily telescopes and is pretty durable 
18731 Definitely small. Good for specific uses but going to need something bigger to hold everything I have. 
18732 Nice product, all is well 
18733 Good 
18734 Still being exposed... 
18735 It does work for it s purpose. However, when the mount is screwed all the way in, the GoPro doesn t line up straight with the way the handle faces. 
18736 Works just like a cell phone screen protector! It was perfect! 
18737 Easy set up. Simple to install. Cameras work really well. 
18738 Great case for the price to protect my lens. 
18739 I was expecting this bag to be smaller. from the photo it looks like i can fit the fuji polaroid 210 perfectly in there. I can fir the camera in there and a small village. good quality though, shipped quick so kudos. 
18740 it would work great with light weight speedlight but not able to lock well on heavier ones 
18741 best thing ever to be created 
18742 Didn t fit camera. 
18743 camera does not record to micro sd, the software that came with it doesn t work either. 
18744 Fast delivery. Works great! 
18745 Highly recommended for The Phantom 2 users! This gimbal is awesome! took my ability to capture smooth crystal clear video from my gopro hero 3+ Black to a whole new level! 
18746 Every accessory I can think to use. 
18747 I received the batteries promptly and they are as advertise I am very please. 
18748 Works good. 
18749 Review for GoPro 4 Ssolid snug fit with all parts and pieces. no cover for the additional UV lens though which stinks but at least they throw in a lens cover for when the UV lens is not on. Overall very happy 
18750 great 
18751 I bought this per recommendation of my mentor, who s an experienced prof photographer, and he was not mistaken, it s a great product! 
18752 Samsung s server has been unavailable since I received this item on Thursday (today being Sunday). Friday when I called Samsung, they said they were sure it would be taken care of by the end of the day - it wasn t. 
18753 Wouldn t fit my camera good quality those. 
18754 Great product! I live on the gulf of mexico and have used my Smapole about a dozen times in the saltwater and it has worked great and shows zero signs of wear or rust! 
18755 Received quickly, all parts and items were accounted for and in condition indicated. Great set of accessories at a great price! 
18756 I love it,bought it few years ago for Canon T1i and it still works fine, using it with Canon T4i. 
18757 great back up batterys and came quick in mail 
18758 Installed it myself. That went smoothly all parts labeled clearly-what plugs into what-etc. Did need help from support to get the remote access working Amcrest s support was excellent. Still exploring the feature-rich capabilities of the system. Very satisfied with the product. 
18759 satisfied This product was very satisfactory and much fun for all the family I would highly recommend this product delivery was prompt. 
18760 These are a joke. Wasted my money 
18761 It is an older version no metal on locking holes and fastners are not double throw. 
18762 Great little umbrella for location work. Inexpensive, easy to use. 
18763 Much better than the 5X5 cloth you get with your glasses or sunglasses. This is exactly what I expected and the price was right! 
18764 Love it! 
18765 This is a fantastic camera for the price. It has a very good quality image, both day and night. 
18766 Very good video quality, best bang for the buck. 
18767 It s always good to have a few extra batteries handy 
18768 I am using this, along with several other cameras, in my vacation home in Arizona. I use it in conjunction with an INSTEON HUB, these work together very well and was easy to set up. 
18769 Looks very nice and the quality is very good. Is a bit uncomfortable to open take off the whole thing when you want to take the memory card out, but it s not a big deal. 
18770 Great deal 
18771 This was a great purchase 
18772 Coolest invention ever, I use it all my smartphones and you get stability of steadicam on your smartphone. 
18773 Product was as advertised. 
18774 not bad 
18775 excellent product. 
18776 SFSG....and you can t beat the $$$$$ 
18777 It s an &#34;okay&#34; system. The software is a bit tricky to sync with the camera itself. The picture quality in daylight is fantastic, but in low light the picture quality is poor. Seems to work fine. Does the job. 
18778 Cheaply made, only use for storage, will fall apart if you actually try to ship it. 
18779 i use it all the time on hikes and under water 
18780 it was the exact size I need it! 
18781 This camera is amazing and takes the best pictures! 
18782 Good quality, and firm connection without being too tight. 
18783 very well pleased with this purchase 
18784 I bought this camera because i was seldom at home,i could speak directly with my family when i was on a business trip. 
18785 Great deal 
18786 Great tipod for travelling fits every backpack 
18787 poor quality. It looks and feels like a cheap plastic toy. 
18788 Exactly what the picture and description shows. 
18789 they fit my camera perfectly... 
18790 Not able to keep lens pen in pen holder. Side Pockets are very tiny and unusable. Padding is not great at the bottom. 
18791 Great price! Much better quality than I was expecting. Very user friendly. 
18792 It works great on my camcorder. 
18793 Good camera for the price. 
18794 Great it works. 
18795 Cheap! software was not user friendly. The siren kept going off at every movement because software wouldn t save settings to shut it off. I ended up getting the Kodak camera to replace this. 
18796 Recommended by Amazon when I bought my Sony A3000. Just barely fits camera and extra batteries. Consider something bigger if you plan on carrying extra lenses, chargers, etc. 
18797 Good quality, has trouble staying on when moving fast 
18798 Bought this as &#34;refurbished&#34; - Nikon approved. Delivered &#34;as new&#34;. Saved about 60% so was well worth it. 
18799 The product s instructions were in Japanese and completely unusable. Previous review was not accepted by Amazon 
18800 Works great 
18801 Camera plastic mount broke off after 6 months. 
18802 good price.... 
18803 Awesome lens! Totally great from a business perspective. You have to have lots of room to get everything in view when indoors, but the bokeh is beautiful and it s quick and sharp focus. Totally love this lens! 
18804 Works great but rotation left/right has not been working. 
18805 lite came to me in an obviously pre opened box.lite is missing battery holding part.no instructions leaflet to advise type of batteries to use.i only paid 10 bucks. not worth the hassle to return it. 
18806 Works great. Fast delivery! Awesome. 
18807 good little camera for my needs. 
18808 legit 
18809 Just what I wanted in a flash. I needed something with more power than the built in flash. It s great for inside photos, but I wanted it for photos of owls in our tall trees in our yard. Love it! 
18810 great 
18811 Love how this thing softens the light, love how lightweight it is and its so easy to install and compact to carry, definitely im buying more and ill be switching the softboxes for these 
18812 GREAT 
18813 Danny @ tech support was patient, knowledgeable and awesome!! 
18814 The strap does not stay on. Lens protective filter works great. 
18815 Works fantastic!!! 
18816 Missing 1 of the sd cards. 
18817 Ugh...it works! Lol. Good construction and fit both tripod and gopro fine! 
18818 I got this for my 67mm canon lense to proactive from scratches. Works great and my lense cap fits over it nicely. 
18819 Great 
18820 easy way to carry an extra battery 
18821 its a good head strap for a cheap price. use it a lot 
18822 Give you that assurance of tight fit. 
18823 Great product 
18824 Great for the price. Bought new camera and only had one battery 
18825 Worked for a week then stopped now no computer recognizes external connection - bummer Cannot easily replace is Nikon has specialized connections at 12 buck a shot this is not acceptable 
18826 Received it on time and was exactly what i was expexting 
18827 The balance is not good, The grip is very loose, They should inform buyer you may have balance issue. 
18828 Great Product! Came in a timely matter and so far I am very satisfied with this Camera. I m very excited and confident when purchasing from this buyer. 
18829 Great filter! I didn t notice any discolorations. 
18830 Love my Yongnuos :) fast shipping and awesome product! 
18831 Perfect 
18832 My Polaroid 100 Land Camera is up and kicking thanks to this. No need for a battery mod. We ll see how long it lasts, though. 
18833 This replaced another mount. It is an exact match for another brand. Worked great and at a very good price. 
18834 This little camera is awesome!! Great footage 4 wheeling in the woods, crystal clear, picks up all the surrounding sounds 
18835 OK it all! 
18836 The battery is gerat! However, all the other stuff like the &#34;off-brand&#34; charger can be without. If I had to do it all over again I would get the Nikon Battery & the Nikon Charger to go with it (if it was offered that way). 
18837 Does what it should. 
18838 Works as expected. Decent build. I don t use it much but it does the job. 
18839 Now I am able to film underwater. Yeah! 
18840 These are great! I hate fingerprints/smudges on my iPhone and macbook screens. These cloths work great. Love them. 
18841 Good lens for the price. If you would liek to save money get this lens 
18842 It works great,I like it. I will buy more of it,it helped for recording vedio during my last crusade 
18843 It is very good quality! I love it! I just hope they would make it in different colors too. 
18844 Everything in it was just what I needed to get started. For the cost of another battery I got got so much more. The case is lightweight and well made. Plenty of room for the camera, spare battery and a few lens covers. 
18845 this is one of the better ones I got this to use in case of power outage for use with a portable solar panel it is nice to have the option 
18846 The threads for the screw that holds the hot shoe were stripped when it arrived. The screw needs to be longer. Functionally useless, but not worth the cost of shipping to return. 
18847 Worked great and was very inexpensive. Leash could be a little longer. 
18848 I used some other light diffusers, that worked great but was much bigger, this diffuser works great as well but is much more compact, small and carries a big punch. 
18849 Good 
18850 Very nice compact tripod. Its a great travel or hiking tripod that can handle moderate weight. 
18851 So far I enjoy my little camera. It takes beautiful pictures. No complaints. 
18852 It s what I m looking for. But the batteries won t charge. It seems that the charger & battery are not compatible. 
18853 item as described 
18854 You can shoot a lot more stable on hand held shots. Very comfortable. 
18855 Excellent video and easy to use. 
18856 ilikeit 
18857 Worked well. 
18858 Door sensors do NOT work with vera 
18859 Could have used some instructions on mounting this plate. 
18860 This camdera produces photographs that equal cameras 3 times the cost and with automatic focus and exposure setting. 
18861 No complaints 
18862 These performed perfectly! 
18863 When it s not falling off my camera due to the crap connector, it takes great pics! 
18864 Item arrived fast and secure. High quality accessories. 
18865 Generally I wouldn t write a review for such an inexpensive item, but I thought I would pass on to anyone considering this that it works perfect for me. I have it on my Canon EOS 70D. I slipped right into the hotshoe and does it s job perfectly. 
18866 Excellent visual quality. Plastic screen cracks easily if not secured in shatter proof box when packing in suitcase when traveling. 
18867 Great product. I use it on every photo session. Works great 
18868 Works great!! 
18869 Excellent service. Great product. 
18870 Good 
18871 S***ty, tinny audio quality. Buy if you love mediocrity. 
18872 Loved it! 
18873 Works well - did have it jump off the network once and re-establish a connection with a different IP address but was easily fixed. 
18874 Excellent item, quick to post, Thanks 
18875 Arrived as promised and earlier than I expected. 
18876 Didn t line up exactly but we made it work. Excellent quality!! 
18877 Love this! Took it snorkeling and parasailing on vacation and it did an awesome job! 
18878 Very useful for shots that require a long exposure time and a tripod. Love it! Works perfectly with my Nikon D3200. 
18879 the monitoring device stopped workingwith less than 4 months of service 
18880 The quality is not quite as good as the real GoPro stuff, but for the price it s definitely worth it, very good value and better quality items than I was expecting. 
18881 THIS WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED! I want to start up my YouTube channel and I needed a camera to do so :) this one takes incredible videos and audio isn t bad either! 
18882 kenneth was great and walked me right through 
18883 simple & functional; easy to use 
18884 okay. 
18885 this is a huge improvement over the standard plastic snap that comes with the case. This will outlive the camera for sure. 
18886 Thanks for fast delivery and the best product came in a good way with everything written and shown in the pic 
18887 Great battey. Lasts and then some 
18888 I was a little worried if it s going to fit around my vanguard tripod, it actually attached snug on the foam part of the leg, only one lever to control both of the angles was not the best, but it got the job done for now... 
18889 Giving this 5 stars now because it is a well made product and an excellent value. I revisit this after I see how long the batteries last - that is key! 
18890 We got my 13 year old a dslr for her birthday. Needed a fun looking, but sturdy and secure bag. This fit the bill perfectly!! I m a photographer myself and would love one for myself. 
18891 Good price vs Nikon product. Nice inclusion of a charger. Theses are small batteries to start with so not spectacular but as good as Nikon. 
18892 Work s great. No problems at all, charged the battery quickly. Arrived quickly nicely packaged. 
18893 Excellent product at a great price. 
18894 Does not fit! Pieces are too tight. 
18895 Vincent was very helpful and very patient with me for me not having no knowlege of cumputer and the camera s are great I would highly recomend the camera and again THANK Vincent. 
18896 Very comfortable and lightweight! 
18897 As promised. 
18898 Cool. 
18899 Quick delivery and great product 
18900 It was quickly delivered. Very good. 
18901 I am finally able to carry and store my gopro properly. 
18902 I couldn t get it to work 
18903 Works great! 
18904 10 points. everything was as expected 
18905 Toy binoculars! These are okay if you re a kid who wants to use their imagination. These binoculars do not focus very well and I would only recommend them for someone under the age of eight. 
18906 Great pack! 
18907 works great and cant beat the price 
18908 Beautiful photos. So glad I got this filter. 
18909 Like the product, Great tech support by Walter 
18910 I wear glasses and they some what work out. It s good enough for a substitute. Its annoying adjusting them sometimes. 
18911 i love it 
18912 Sooooo the cameras are black and white picture with no resolution and they aren t really wireless... Also did not receive the remote needed to control the LCD screen.... We just set them up, and they did not meet my expectations. 
18913 Almost perfect. Works fine and all but has a few scratches. I wish it was flawless :I 
18914 Sometimes you get what you pay for. If you really want a gopro, buy one. This has everything you need but just doesn t work. I have no memories of my trip because my camera didn t work! 
18915 Just a nice lil charger. 
18916 Well designed with sturdy pouch. Good value. prompt delivery. 
18917 This frame did not fit my GoPro Her 4 all that well, it blocked the shutter button. 
18918 These are great. I ve been using these straps with my go pro to record working on a vehicle and the accessibility is awesome 
18919 Ok 
18920 This camera is SO extraordinary-- I recommend over any other camera on the market-- easy to use, AMAZING sound and video/image quality... And at a reasonable price! I m just super over the moon about it! Also shipped in a secure and expedient manner! THANK YOU!! 
18921 Works well and attaches to the lens easily without binding. Be careful not to over tighten. 
18922 Ordered this for my daughter 
18923 She loved it ! Takes the cutest pictures 
18924 Very good construction. You can design your own layout as I did to accommodate my Sony NX3 video camera. There are many storage compartments of various configurations to store and organize the way you work. This is a professional bag with the option to shoulder or wheel your equipment. Nice.... 
18925 Just what I expetded 
18926 Works great 
18927 Works exactly as expected. Great product! 
18928 I was very pleased with my purchase. It was shipped right away and exceeded my expectations. I will purchase from these guys again. 
18929 Good value for the price! 
18930 Yes....just what I wanted and expected. Convenient, strong, can be used as a walking stick or a camera monopod. 
18931 I love the film for my new camera. Received on time! 
18932 Nice system. Not the best but works fine for the size and the cost. 
18933 Not bad. So far so good 
18934 Awesome. Everyone loves it at parties. 
18935 A little loose and comes off sometimes on its own. 
18936 Protect your investment and make sure it doesn t sink to the bottom of the ocean. Comes with a new backdoor and everything you need to affix it. 
18937 Excellent reasonably priced product from camera producer Nikon. 
18938 Henry Campbell helped me figure this thing out. great camera but setup is a doozie. called customer service and sat on hold for a few min and he had it figured out. 
18939 I ended up returning this item, because I found one that I liked better, but that was all just preference. It was a good lens, I just decided I would rather have a macro lens. 
18940 The soft box is is great quality, the mount was wobbly because the two Philips screws were stripped, i applied some glue and now it is very sturdy. 
18941 Not big enough for all my equipment. 
18942 Works great, thanks 
18943 Great lens but everyone knows that already 
18944 I love this!!! Amazing kit 
18945 not as tight as expected 
18946 great seller - delivered as promised! 
18947 Melts when left exposed to the sun! Don t leave your helmet locked to your bike and expect the camera mount to be there when you finish lunch. 
18948 over priced period 
18949 Great product. I use this as a backdrop for short informational training videos and interviews. Well made and appears it is built to last. 
18950 Fantastic deal! Couldn t be more satisfied with this digital camera. For all the accessories you receive along with the camera itself...Best deal we ve ever found on Amazon!! Awesome! 
18951 Had to take a file to the plastic mounting foot so it would fit the hotshot on the camera...now it works pretty good. 
18952 works well and much less expensive than brand name 
18953 Not happy at all. Wrong plug in for US 
18954 Comes with everything except the clip for the brim of the baseball cap. Would be nice to have that included. 
18955 Great value! 
18956 I do enjoy it design and Bluetooth operation and connection. 
18957 By far my favorite lens. Quality is crisp and sharp, takes excellent low light photos and depth of field is superb. I would highly recommend this lens 
18958 I m confused, some people say yes it does come with an AC power adapter some people say no. Jeff Thoele 
18959 I purchased 2 and I need to return one. 1 works fine and one failed to turn on 
18960 &#34;Good points Easy setup Well built chassis Long enough power cable&#34; 
18961 the best case for a single camera !! 
18962 I use my go pro 3+ as a dash cam for my motorcycle trips. Extra charged batteries are a must. This is a great product. 
18963 Great Diffuser, I was looking for one that fit my Neewer NW670 / VK750II 
18964 Not exactly shaped but fits perfect. I definitely recommend it. great product! 
18965 Awesome!!! Totally worth the money and I still haven t got to play with everything yet. 
18966 Great product, for the price. Worked as advertised. 
18967 Worked great. Wish flip was still in business. I would recommend gettng a tripod that has legs that wrap around railings and that are flexible. Otherwise this tripod was perfect. 
18968 Seems like a great tripod so far! top notch, with a great bag included. The only thing I miss is an arm to pan. 
18969 Rubber strap would ve been easier than Velcro. Kinda hard to fold and put away without loosening Velcro all the way 
18970 Everything was as advertised...great way to carry/store GoPro and accessories!!! 
18971 Excellent! 
18972 Jerks when rotating. 
18973 Not even worth one star. Bought this for our cruise and took pictures while snorkeling in Cozumel. Returned home and went to download pictures and they were gone. Can t return for refund because my time limited was up the day we got off of cruise (yesterday). 
18974 Very sturdy blocks 
18975 The camera I received didn t work I charged it several times even tried a different usb and tried an electrical outlet and it still wouldn t hold charge. 
18976 Products are very worth the money. Only object that I don t like/can t use is the tripod, it s very cheap. Other products are on par with GoPro brand products 
18977 Great addition to the kit for my Camera. Tripod is a little flimsy, though. You get what you pay for. 
18978 fits nice and tight. tighter than stock parts. 
18979 Fit great. I feel better knowing my new camera is protected. 
18980 Works great, very inexpensive. I used wasabi batteris for my Sony and Canon DSLRs, other brands just cannot match performance and compatibility. 
18981 Works just like it shows. 
18982 Does the job well... 
18983 It works perfectly. 
18984 Loving it! 
18985 Best suction mount for the GoPro Hero 4. 
18986 Don t waste you re time or money. I got it free as a promotional and still feel ripped off. Video is beyond horrible, pictures are un viewable and embarrassing to show to anyone. You would get better video and pictures from an old smoke signal flip phone. 
18987 Works great -- I just wish the microphone sound was better quality like D link. Otherwise so far, so good. Great value. 
18988 This is a great case. Nicely put together. Of course, every case is particular to your camera and how you like to use it. So I m managing to make it work for me. It can be used in a variety of ways. 
18989 Great for travling 
18990 Just a good accessory to have. I bought both my grandson and husband one for their Go Pro s. 
18991 I had some trouble connecting to my wifi because I use google chrome. Tech support was very helpful. Too bad this doesn t work to watch the outside from behind glass 
18992 great buy, good price. 
18993 works great! 
18994 Works as described. 
18995 Pretty easy to use, but you have to make sure the images are the proper size or else it stretch and distorts the image. 
18996 Title says it all 
18997 Grandson s Christmas present. Wasn t really submersible. 
18998 Way better than the generic ones... spend the extra. 
18999 Does NOT come with memory card. 
19000 I m very happy with the case. It fits perfectly and the strap is a perfect length too. I will defanetly recommend this case to anyone. 
19001 A++ 
19002 Just what I expected 
19003 It fit my Audi perfect. The price was lot better then dealers. 
19004 After experimenting with different bags this is the perfect bag. I really feel my camera gear is safe and secure. 
19005 Superb lens. Lovely bokeh, sharp even at f/1.4. Nice colors and contrast. 
19006 Its started to getting hanged while recording. Media card is not read properly. Lost some images also 
19007 I would have give 5 stars BUT, it missing one memory card. Everything else was good, delivered on time and well packed. 
19008 After receiving my replacement stick I m quite impressed not so happy with the part that hold the phone. I find the spring to be a bit cumbersome but overall it does its job. 
19009 Awesome is about all I need to say the constriction is solid and out has good features I have a mini ball pivot on top, with a Canon sx50 camera and it supports it easily I really Like this for shooting on the go very stable base 
19010 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
19011 ok 
19012 Thanks for the fast shipping. Looking forward to future business. Also it was an easy install and works great!! 
19013 More than I expected and better quality could have hope for. 
19014 This is exactly what I was looking for to be able to take pictures on the water with out the glare off the water. 
19015 hard to manuevar 
19016 Fantastic filter but Does not work with 24-105 canon 
19017 Very easy to apply. 
19018 Good value for the size and quality. Outside is hard enough to protect against normal wear and tear and traveling and inside foam pockets have a versatility of use. 
19019 Fair Price good Product 
19020 Love the gimbal, works great, the app could be better. 
19021 Beautiful and functional custom soft release button. Expensive but well worth it. Has an rubber O ring that keeps the button from unscrewing, unlike the cheap plastic soft release buttons. Highly recommended. 
19022 Initially, it is only OK for a emergency situation as backup to take a few more shots. After a while completely useless. I have had my original Canon battery twice as long and it is still going strong. 
19023 Very useful tripod and great value. Give it a shot! 
19024 Very good quality film 
19025 fit perfectly and happy with the purchase. 
19026 Works great with my D3300. Just turn it on in the camera s menu and push the button. I believe this to be a camera thing, but you must focus the scene using the camera s shutter button ahead of time. 
19027 Great item just what I was looking for. 
19028 No problems with it yet.. everything fits fine. Good price too. 
19029 Excellent price and very fast shipping 
19030 not a clear view distributor, not a new product, product is not under warranty. call clearview direct 
19031 Battery did not fit Had to be returned 
19032 I don t want to give a bad review because it wouldn t work with my NVR system (Q-SEE QC838) My mistake for not checking the right specs! 
19033 nice 
19034 It s a high quality material , easy to use, perfect size for shot a portray. 
19035 It s amazing..we loved it.. 
19036 Works great 
19037 Quick delivery, item just as described. 
19038 Not a toy. Need to get used to it. Learn how to fly it 
19039 How do turn. On the camera 
19040 I really like it but the diffuser fabric is already starting to pull away from the seams. 
19041 Camera take great videos. Came with lots o accessories. Waterproof case works great. Great camera for the price. You can click on the links below to view sample videos.

19042 Shipped fast and amazing quality! 
19043 I love B&W product 
19044 REALLY BAD, THE THREAD FOR THE SCREW IS MADE IN PLASTIC, AS SOON YOU MOVE IT WILL BRAKE APART...DONT BUY THIS EVER !! 
19045 great little flying machine for the price. It s a great little quad to learn on. I originally got a dud but the company had great customer service and sent me a new one. This one flies perfectly. It can handle good bumps and crashes as well. 
19046 My Yongnuo YN600EX-RT does not work as Nikon Slave in iTTL mode, firmware version 1.8.3, anyone face the same problem. Nikon Slave M mode was working well. 
19047 Absolulty love it and I recieved it quick 
19048 Time saver. Easy to use. Nice and bright. Has audio too! 
19049 B+W is a trusted brand and first class product. 
19050 super easy to use. Works GREAT. 
19051 This cover will be perfect for my Peerless watercolors. Oh and I did get 2 in the pack! 😊 
19052 Well I bought mine for YouTube and I think the video quality is amazing but talking thru it isn t and it sounds like I m a far distance away so that s very disappointing. Taking photos with it is okay but in probably going to take it back ! 
19053 Better specs than the OEM item. No issues with charging or delivery. 
19054 The product was described as having no damages except a small scratch, but the automatic cover does not open or close all the way. I can easily push it down with my fingernail so it doesn t bother me. Especially since this was offered at such a fantastic price. 
19055 Exactly the product I need. This is very useful and the quality is outstanding. Gives me the angles that I need especially when doing outdoor shots,group pictures. Holds my big IPhone tightly without worry. Price is very reasonable and delivers swiftly. 
19056 Very good quality case just like my Lowepro sling bag. However, this is just not a fast out great travel case like I have for my old film cameras. Nothing wrong with the bag, but I don t love it like I do my sling Lowepro. 
19057 Works great and costs much, much, much less than a Canon original. Awesome. 
19058 Seems solid. Just didn t trust it for my SLR. Wife has it on her pocket cam know. 
19059 Just I hoped. Great deal 
19060 Easy to install and operate, good quality, functional. 
19061 Great amazon purchase! Thanks. 
19062 Good basic wired remote 
19063 so far so good 
19064 very good 
19065 excelente 
19066 Made of very cheap materials. The Velcro is barely on. The design does not allow for it to be angled down. 
19067 good so far learning it with flash kit 
19068 Was perfect but had some white spots 
19069 Great except for the swivel lightening shoe that broke hopefully the replacement does not brake! 
19070 It works fine 
19071 Pricey but got my Canon EOS Rebel up and running. 
19072 Good product 
19073 This item only came with the speed ring insert and not the actual speed ring as shown in the photo of the product. 
19074 Excellent and fast shipping 
19075 Very much like the camera. Four stars for not great anti-shake capabilities. 
19076 It works well. Sometimes, it is difficult to place though. 
19077 Came fast and work as expected. 
19078 Works well. I get two days of hard use with it with my Sony DCR-SR45 camcorder. 
19079 excellent 
19080 Does just what you need it to. Count only goes up to 399 but you can set it to go forever if you need more exposures. It won t work for exposures less than a second long. 
19081 Old GPS quit working, so the drone quit flying. After many minutes of trouble shooting and youtube videos thought that i would start with this bugger. Worked like a charm. Fairly easy to get to and replace (even for someone with big hands). 
19082 Bought this as a present for my father. This device was his first experience with a &#34;smart camera&#34; with a touch screen. It took a few days but he has become quite the wiz at using it, editing pictures and videos, etc. Basically this was a huge hit. 
19083 This monopod is definitely lightweight and durable.... Had it for about a few months, and no problems yet! There really isn t anything else that is worth saying, because this product is exactly what it says in the descriptions! No lies or anything. 
19084 Happy that I purchased this package will now have extras on hand 
19085 purchased for my wife in 2010 and its easy to use and takes great pictures 
19086 bad design, when power on P3 yr gimbal will hit it. 
19087 Worked out great. A little noisy but okay. 
19088 Shooting even a few minutes of video drains the battery. The regular Canon battery, though it has lower capacity, has no problem doing such short clips. Fully charged battery, two or three minute clip, first the battery warning, then the camera shuts down. Returned it. 
19089 perfect. 
19090 My son enjoyed this for 1.5 days and then it broke after hitting a tree branch. Needs to be more durable. 
19091 This case does fit the old/outdated Magellan 6000T with room for the AC adapter. 
19092 Good price, but not for the model television listed. Bulb can be carefully removed and placed in housing from old bulb 
19093 such a great case. goes well with my pink camera. 
19094 This case is fantastic. It fits all of my extras in here along with my new Gopro Hero 4 Silver. Very happy with this purchase and the price was great too. 
19095 Looks like a simple cradle but I really can t write anything about it because I didn t have a need for it as a result of returning Removu RM-R1. 
19096 The only problem that I had with this is if you utilise other products - such as the Vello Snap-On LCD Screen Protector - it does not fit well.Without any other attachments works well. 
19097 Works great! Easily adjusted and the positions are solid. Great little tripod. 
19098 Everything works exactly as advertised; the colors on the monitor are accurate and sharp. I also use it on my tv. (my tv runs off a 2nd computer) Easy to use, nothing else. It s awesome. 
19099 Great camera, works perfect. I only wish it was a bit more compact. 
19100 Works perfectly. Delivered exactly as promised. Vendor was very responsive and easy to contact and work with! 
19101 Excellent product. Very happy with the quality and craftsmanship. 
19102 It works as advertised. I lost the directions and forgot how to use it. 
19103 Nice! 
19104 Great for taking wildlife shots. 
19105 Will they come back ? I need some more 
19106 I have been using these tubes for a couple of years now. They aren t fancy but they get the job done. You can do really quite amazing stuff with them. I shot a video recently about how to use them. https://youtu.be/qtW4uCNjqzU 
19107 As a long term DIY video home security guy I have purchased many different cameras. If these led illum. has as a long life then this is the best in my experience. 
19108 Good photos, was a gift for a 7 year old child. Only downside is lack of a rechargeable battery. 
19109 very good material 
19110 Works just fine for the job 
19111 Works great and is very useful. Came when promised 
19112 Works as advertised 
19113 On time, as advertised, with contact info if needed. A great value. 
19114 Great product with excellent support 
19115 Very good, I like the camera! 
19116 Great speaker. Thanks 
19117 Really good product. Velcro makes the fit snug and secure. Only tried it on around the house but think it s going to be great while hiking and dirtbiking. 
19118 Works perfectly in my camera. 
19119 Built like a tank, durable, the pinnacle of B+W quality. 
19120 Its exactly what I needed 
19121 Pelican cases are fantastic! The pre-cut perforations make customization easy. They really protect whatever you put in them. I live in the desert, where very fine dust is the issue, but I have to believe that if our fine dust stays out, so will rainwater. 
19122 Fantastic, customizable. I keep my GoPro cameras and accessories in this. It s perfect for bringing the cameras to some other location or just to bring everything to the garage without juggling a bazillion expensive gadgets. 
19123 Works great! 
19124 simple to use and works well 
19125 Straps are a little thin and the rubber bottom hits me in the small of my back. Otherwise it is a great product with good protection and storage. 
19126 cant compete with the Canon dslr in quality but its still a very good camcorder 
19127 .easy to set up and quick too 
19128 .you can always make up for the quality during Editting 
19129 .so? 
19130 The picture quality is great. I use it mostly as a dash cam. The screen is real small and I have not been successful with connecting to wi-fi. 
19131 Good uv filter for panasonic lx100 
19132 its an awesome camera 
19133 Good product 
19134 Falls out easily. 
19135 Good product and nice price 
19136 great product and fast delivery! 
19137 Good, compact, powerful, simple scope. Not working with Windows 7 though. Only XP.... 
19138 These are small, which is specified and what they are meant to be. They are much easier to take along than a large grey card. The only problem is learning how to use a smaller card which is user error, nothing that the card did. 
19139 Its too small and feels like it is going to brake :( 
19140 the best low coast drone out there. great trainer... for the money, its the way to go.... 
19141 Great product ... Exactly what I needed 
19142 Very nice light weight case. Plenty of storage areas for batteries and accessories, and fits the Phantom 3 Professional with prop guards perfectly. A bit pricey but worth 5 stars for quality. 
19143 great buy 
19144 For the price it s hard to beat. I plan to sell it to upgrade to a 70 200 in the near future though 
19145 good 
19146 Does exactly what I wanted it to do -- for my GoPro... Easy to use. 
19147 Easy to use and does well as a cary along quick clean. 
19148 Great lens ! Great price 
19149 good idem 
19150 good product 
19151 This is one of those things that I hope I never see how well it works. 
19152 Exactly what I was looking for 
19153 I have zero complaints. This tripod is easily the best I ve owned and it feels so solid. 
19154 Love it. 
19155 Cool 
19156 I was worried about the film being left in warm conditions but it develops perfectly and looks great. Film was within use by date. 
19157 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
19158 Not what I spected for $24.00 dollars. ...one sheet of badays plastic, I ended buying a cell phone screen protector it work bettet.. 
19159 Great for selfies and tripod videos from different heights and angles. 
19160 Just what we expected! 
19161 Great product for the price!! 
19162 Worked like a charm! 
19163 Good product 
19164 The camera is outstanding so far, sharp images at day and at night. Worths the money! 
19165 Doesn t fit my Nixon Coolpix cameras eye holes at all. Much too wide to slide into slits. 
19166 This is NOT a neck-strap! Don t be fooled. Def a great shoulder strap though. 
19167 I use my own tote bags and just move this from purse to purse when I need my camera. Love it! 
19168 Works like a charm with both my Neweer units and both d5100 and d7100 bodies. 
19169 I wish the batteries came with the protective plastic cases like they have with past orders 
19170 Inexpensive, but works perfectly...charging the batteries a little faster than the charger that came with the camera. Excellent product at an excellent price. 
19171 Works great. I use it attached to the end of my pole and it is able to hold it up. 
19172 I bought my first tripod Its good I like I saw many videos before buying it The only reason i am giving 4 stars is the one button to open it wide was coming off the body So i have to glue it and now it cant use wide legs 
19173 Too big ....need a smaller version with the same loudness. Something you can comfortably fit in a pants pocket 
19174 A must have for the extra chargers to keep at the ready. 
19175 Arrived fast, easy to attach to my T3i 
19176 Love the look at night. The adhesive on the lights could be better. I had to tape it to keep it on. 
19177 Using this in several trips abroad = quality product that is worth a few extra dollars. 
19178 Great item! 
19179 Great quality. Sturdy and seals perfect. 
19180 Work Pefect 
19181 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
19182 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
19183 Absolutely perfect. This is a steal for the price that it s at. I highly recommend it. It comes in a little case, so you can put it in there without worrying about it getting scratched up. As someone who is experimenting with long exposures, this was a great lens. 
19184 Good quality definitely! They have nice little details. The elastic fabric (I dont know the technical term) feels so soft but firm. They have the non-slip coding, which makes the firming pretty steady. 
19185 These are such AWESOME lights. I use them when I film my YouTube videos and they make my videos so much better when it comes to lighting. 
19186 Backdrop is good for the price that you pay. The screen sizes are very misleading as the picture makes it seem like it is meant for a larger screen but they are relatively small sized. 
19187 Fast delivery and works fine 
19188 The screw and metal loop on the bottom started rusting right away. 
19189 Works perfectly! 
19190 I just bought this camera and i dived for 21 meters and when i went out it does not work anymore.. 
19191 Awesome flash for the features and the price. Works great with my 70D! 
19192 I use this for all my batterys and it works perfect with no problems 
19193 Will recommend this to anyone 
19194 not to work never got chance try until to late to send back 
19195 Great for travel and makes all your shots even better...was unsure what to expect but love them. Got it as a gift for my sister, said they were amazing and worked on both iphone and ipad, Would buy again! 
19196 Seems to sometimes not work with my android (it looks like this is ONLY capable with android phones) but I think it might just be me...so far I really like it! 
19197 thought it came with a sd card , did not explane well and i could get better quality from an old phone camera do not buy this. 
19198 Really helps with low and high angle composition 
19199 Very useful & practical size. 
19200 So much more reach than the prior 11-16. So bright , so clear. Almost no distortion so little or no software correction when processing in Lightroom. Wonderful for taking pictures in the forest. I photograph sun rays in fog and see none of the flare reported in prior copies. 
19201 Factory product, quickly delivered. 
19202 perfeito pelo preço 
19203 Great travel camera. Takes two AAs so it s ready to go when you are, no need to charge before you go to that important event. 
19204 I bought this to store my new ViewSonic PJD5255L video projector. Even though it is designed to be more of a camera and lens case, It fits perfectly. Only complaint is the plastic hinges and latches don t seem too sturdy And may wear out if used often.. 
19205 Nice product and it just works! 
19206 would not focus correctly 
19207 This is a small company that offers a quality product and really extraordinary customer service. I rarely have the time to write recommendations. MooJou Enterprises moved me to make the time. 
19208 I bought this as a birthday present. The preteen loved it. I think it might have been her favorite gift. 
19209 Item arrived as promised (very fast). They also included a 32gb micro Sd card (thank you). Definitely would purchase again and will look here for any accessories. 
19210 Fast and Very Early. I have a lot time in my hands to finish the preparations on my Son s Birthday 
19211 What a great price. 290 refurbished is the way to go. !! Searched everywhere for the best deal and im pretty satisfied. I still need to mess with the camera a little more to learn more about it but overall im liking it :) 
19212 Quality great but disappointed about the print direction. It doesn t state it will be portrait printed. The picture of the item shows it to be landscape which what is needed and would work best for pictures. 
19213 As advertised. Works great. Short delivery time. 
19214 Had to send one back to HTC due to water getting into the unit. Will be trying it in water again soon, as that is one reason I got this. However they replaced without issues. 
19215 Works like a charm 
19216 It is definitely a good buy with the bag that I bought to place it in. 
19217 Fits my Fujifilm and 2 lenses well. Build quality is solid. 
19218 I got the item on time and nothing damaged. It is all they said it would be. I lreally like it 
19219 i took this to a trip in Rocky Mountain, mounted D7000+17-55 f2.8 (quite heavy combo) to it. Surprisingly, this little guy is very sturdy and the ball head is very easy to use, and I enjoyed it a lot. 
19220 Works well. Would get a &#34;I LOVE IT&#34; rating if it was not so heavy. 
19221 Arrived on time and as described. I have yet to really test the product but so far so good. 
19222 excellent product! meets and beats the quantum tubos at 75% less cost. And I use them in the harshest environment of all. underground photography all over North America! www.dupontphotography.com for examples of the work. 
19223 i would have preferred the VR mode in addition to auto and manual 
19224 works good 
19225 These float wristbands for holding camera are great. they have enough size and float capability to keep any small waterproof camera from sinking. Plus, they provide excellent cushioning when in a camera bag. 
19226 Fast delivery. Heats up a bit. 
19227 It broke really soon, on/off button did not work in some months. 
19228 Pretty good item Work great and nice 
19229 Great little video camera. Easy to use and great picture quality. I bought this off of Amazon Warehouse and got a great deal. 
19230 Perfect. I love it so much. Super cute, colorful and trustworthy 
19231 Really nice quality photos! My room is very dark and normally when I take photos, they tend to be really dark and unappealing. With this lens, it really does make all the difference in color and clarity wise!! Definitely recommend. 
19232 Use it for an exercise device. Great power saver. 
19233 Great little flash dose a wonderful job very easy to use and understand no unnecessary mumbojumbo. 
19234 there were a few useful items and other things i ll probably never use. Bt considering the low price, the useful items seem well made and they make the package worthwhile. 
19235 Fit great, feel great, and work great. 
19236 too small. 
19237 This tripod worked great for me, fits all me phones including big ones like Samsung Notes. Great value. 
19238 Nice for off iPhone flash. 
19239 works exactly as advertised, and very reasonably priced. using it with a Canon 7D 
19240 Camera did not take pictures or movies when installed. It registered on the controller and the light showed camera active, but no video could be played. 
19241 Nice just as they said 
19242 Just got one and it works as advertised. Easy to use. Easy to set up. Very helpful as we travel a lot and will be able to keep an eye on our home. Might add a way you can also connect through a laptop. 
19243 actually has three mounts! 
19244 It works for personal use, no complaints for the price. 
19245 excellent product for the price 
19246 Make sure u update to 3.0 for 1080 60fps 
19247 Wow! Very impressed at the quality of this item. I looked at many other versions and am HAPPY to have selected this one. You will love it! 
19248 Great ball head I use this for real estate shooting on the manfortto pro 55 legs and the two fit together like bread and butter. No need to spend more for exotic materials. This combination gets the job done with flying colors. 
19249 Excellent camera and price. 
19250 cheap. good deal for what it is. 
19251 Love this camera and the price was great! The quality of the pictures is amazing and this is easy to use! 
19252 This is the best digital photo frame I ve ever owned. Pictures are crystal clear and fill as much of the screen as possible. Very little effort to set up also. Thanks, I love it!! 
19253 Ok 👌 
19254 Its an exceptionally solid FF for its price. Maybe a little heavy against the lightweight cameras it will likely be attached to. 
19255 Nice while it worked. I sent it in to be repaired and learned the repair cost was more than what I paid for the camera. 
19256 Great item - good price. Thanks! 
19257 Best grip for rollercoasters video 
19258 love it but i lost it:( 
19259 No issues, it is was it says. 
19260 Charger didn t work 
19261 This lens is compact, light weight and always come handy. 
19262 Unbelievable quality!! Super slim. Amazing clairity. Hoya- B+W- throw them away. If you are reading this - do yourself a favor and click purchase now. I received no incentives for this review - only read the review and agreed. You need this lens. You want this lens!! 
19263 Very cheaply made. My granddaughter dropped it by accident and now there is a lens error and the lens won t open so can not take pictures. It is a waste, now. 
19264 Good camera at a reasonable price. You really can t go wrong with a PowerShot from Canon. This is actually my 4th one over the years. This model is nice and light and only requires two batteries. The quality of images are great and it s easy to use. 
19265 It s OK! Seems kinda useless. 
19266 Coats 6$ to return 
19267 Great accessory kit. The kit comes with more items than I know what do with them 
19268 My only complaint is the camera doesn t fit snug in case. I am pleased with kit and would do business with seller again 
19269 excellent! 
19270 The cap fits fine, but the adhesive for the strap was completely dry and useless. Super glue took care of it easily however. 
19271 Everyone knows GoPro is at the top of the Sports/Action Cams. Best camera quality, lots of customization for settings and all around amazing piece of technology. 
19272 buuenas camaras 
19273 Great thanks! 
19274 Works good 
19275 I am rather disappointed as the Camera does not appear to have night vision or it is certainly not working. what are my alternatives as I desperately require night vision on my camera. All of my Logitech cameras have night vision and are very clear at nights except this one.???????? 
19276 Easy to install. Fit perfect and waterproof. All I can ask for $6 
19277 looks real 
19278 Is great!!! 
19279 nice 
19280 charger looked great shipping on point- but due to my own error it was thew wrong one and i had to return it 
19281 Soft-sided but very well made. I love the bag and use it every day to carry my K-3II with a 24mm Sigma lens and my lunch to my office. A+++ 
19282 This thing is useless. Doesn t work at all. It worked, marginally, for a day or so, then stopped all together. Changed the battery for a new one-still nothing. Zero stars. 
19283 Pro: Light and compact Easily adjustable/remove Con: Lack of padding makes uncomfortable after long day if you have a dslr w/battery grip and heavy lens 
19284 This item is sturdy and very easy to set up. 
19285 I think it would work great if you had sent instruction I could understand. You need to get someone who speaks fluent English to write your instructions. Please send them to me. I cannot use the camera because I cannot understand how to set it. 
19286 bang for your buck and still have the whole set going strong. if you take care of it it will last you. very good especially for a starter set in flash photography! 
19287 It works. My camera will float. That s all I ask of something like this. 
19288 did not work for me with GoPro black and fatshark... could not get video signal. Played around but it never worked. 
19289 Great product and great price. Highly recommended 
19290 New version of the Fuifilm NP-45 Lithium Ion Rechargeable battery worked as it should. I was disappointed in discovering my old battery charger for the older version of this battery isn t the one recommended for this new version. 
19291 I have bought these before, in a 100 pack. Now just hoping there be enough. Well made, no problems. Little slow on shipping. 
19292 Skeptical, due to price. Read previous reviews here & decided to buy. Great bargain. So happy I gave it a go 
19293 Good protection wish it came in different colors. 
19294 after less then 3 days of owner ship the eyepiece will no longer adjust for power setting. 
19295 Excellent! 
19296 Excellent service, nice product 
19297 Easy to use with auto settings, fun to experiment with advanced features. Great camera for the price. 
19298 I bought one for my girls but have been using it quite a bit for myself. Good quality and works really well. Love it!!! 
19299 works great 
19300 Works as promised. Excellent produce at a fair price. 
19301 One of the packs was damaged and it comes out filled with ink! 
19302 Great buy love my gopro!! The extra batteries come in handy 🙌🏼🙌🏼 
19303 For years I had wanted a Nikon and when I purchased the D3100 I was not disappointed. Great camera for amateurs like me. 
19304 as described 
19305 Really good camera. i took it on my trips over seas and took some amazing shots. I am not a professional photographer so this camera helped in making my shots better. 
19306 Everything arrived as described. Thanks so much!! 
19307 Short shaft. Didn t fit right. 
19308 Very appropiate for the Go pro cam and it´s accessories. 
19309 Works like a champ 
19310 This is the third one I ve bought and none of them work. They only work for the first 5 minutes you have it going. I kept buying them because they are cheap and I thought maybe I was just having bad luck. But nope, they just don t work. 
19311 Good product, will not lose/break your camera--just as soon as GoPro original accessories. I just wish there were extra screws in package--lost one almost immediate upon arrival! 
19312 It s ok 
19313 Not what I wanted! 
19314 Works fine. 
19315 Not working as well as when new.. 
19316 Don t like it like the white one better 
19317 The camera that was supposed to have come new was used and had damage ax they left the batteries inside the camera and the had fallen out and rattled in the box leaving dents and chips in the camera body. 
19318 Works well 
19319 Purchased this for my son s Gopro, he loves it. Makes it easier when fishing and hunting. 
19320 Good quality handy, collapsible white balance reference reflector. Easy to stick in the camera bag so no excuse to not carry it all the time. 
19321 Excellent product BUT terrible smell of leather which was not possible to remove at all by several known methods 
19322 Amazing for the price! Haven t failed me yet! 
19323 works as advertised... 
19324 I love, love, love having this when I have to shoot a busy baby or toddler. I can turn on my phones front facing camera and they can make faces at themselves or turn on a favorite movie. Great product. 
19325 Super easy to install. The material looks real from a distance but once close and when you have it on your hands, it s a very cheap plastic material. 
19326 This is an excellent product. Well made and well worth the money. Perfect for my Nikon 3300. 
19327 These are replacements for my old ones and worked perfectly! 
19328 I will recommend to my friends as it came quickly, looks nice, video quality is great. 
19329 excelent 
19330 Pricey but works as it should. 
19331 Work, but when my camera given that still has 20 % of the load suddenly goes off and makes me lose Scenes 
19332 Excellent product and fast delivery 
19333 A good medium range lens. On the Sony Nex7 I found results very good. 
19334 goes with the camera 
19335 original fit, and perfect ability 
19336 I love this camera. Very easy to use. Favorite part is the instruction book that gives tips on taking better pics. 
19337 C6722043 TECH ID AR004273 My customer service personnel was friendly and helpful. Thank you D-link for providing me with the safety I deserve with a &#34;very&#34; small business. 
19338 I purchased this as a gift for a relative last Christmas. I was blown away by the quality. Great bag for the price. 
19339 Great 
19340 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
19341 The camera was shipped promptly. I have only used it a little bit, but so far it works like a charm. Takes photos quickly and they look great! Very easy to use and so lightweight... 
19342 Love it.. bought it due to the one that came in the box was always out. After the replacement I got up to 4 hours without any issue. 2 hours each battery shipped. 
19343 Worked just fine.!!! Perfect. 
19344 great lens. i use it for northern lights photography and it works really well for capturing landscape. 
19345 poor signal very difficult to connect to wifi... 
19346 A very nice frame. works well; nice size to have. I am well pleased with product. 
19347 Garbage, don t waste your money or time. 
19348 Great lens for starting out! 
19349 Easy to install, The design is attractive for a sensor. I haven t had the opportunity to see it in action and I hope I never do. 
19350 Camera is great and the bundle is a good deal. I love the hero 4 silver. 
19351 Not compatible with Nikon D5200. The product description is misleading in mentioning that the product is compatible with all 5000 series DSLRs 
19352 A really excellent camera that is wonderful to operate. I m a bit angry that 2 months later there is an updated version that I wish I had. 
19353 Very expensive, but it works right, and now I have two. I still wish I could sell the camera for nearly what I paid for it, though. 
19354 We haves bunch of these around the house. Like, 5 or so. Weekend have one outside, protected from the rain, in Miami- no issues. 
19355 I like it ,but after the first pic it start to shot black (blank) pics. 
19356 great product! 
19357 Great to have on had in case you forget one or don t have it attached to the bottom of your camera. Looks like original MEFOTO. 
19358 As advertised. 
19359 Great! Well designed, had room for camera w/ lens plus two addition lenses, flash, accessories, with some room left over. Lots of adjustment on the partitions, a big plus. Just wished it had a chest strap between the shoulder straps. 
19360 It flies so easily! Controls are not too confusing for first timers either. 
19361 PERFECT. 
19362 Turned out not needing 
19363 The binoculars came with a nice strap. 
19364 I got this to shoot video reviews and blog posts. After reading reviews about the knock-off versions, I decided to spend a little more to get the real thing. Also, I love that I can hang my phone upside down or mount it somewhere if needed. 
19365 This is the first accessory that I purchased for my GoPro 4 camera. It is easy to put on...easy to attach the camera to the Chest Mount. And, it is sturdy and comfortable to wear. 
19366 Good, works perfect but a little pricy 
19367 works great, easy to use 
19368 Hoya glass is the best. This is a great variable nd filter for video. I ve used it several times now and have never noticed any diminished quality to what I m shooting. 
19369 I loved this camera outfit, great product for a great price. Loved the accessories that came in package, liked having everything I need in one deal, easier shopping. Now just to learn how to use it. It takes good pics. 
19370 I have used their outdoor camera for years, excellent product. Customer service is also very good--Walter helped me diagnose and fix a minor problem in no time at all; also very courteous. 
19371 saved my lens when i dropped it on gravel. 
19372 This filter was about 3 stops darker than the ICE 10 stop. Well worth the money. 
19373 It was the wrong item and was returned. 
19374 After purchasing the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT, I ordered this unit, hoping that it would work. It fits the Yongnuo YN600EX-RT perfectly. I ll probably be picking up a few more Yongnuo YN600EX-RT units, so I ll definitely get more of these Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce units as well. 
19375 Very nice quality!! 
19376 We love it. Works great. 
19377 Does just what I wanted it to do. Makes preparing the camera gimbal for flight easier than the included DJI camera lock. Love the bright color and lens cap. 
19378 This is another stand i ve added to my collection of other LimoStudio stands. Cant beat the price and service of these stands. Stoked on this purchase and previous LimoStudio products. Steven Caro SCg Shoe Co 
19379 This is easily 1/4 the price you would pay for the same amount of product from any photo equipment site on the internet. Fits easily in a backpack and is an amazing tool. 
19380 battery charger works like a charm, I love it 
19381 Nice stuff, cleans with no residue. 
19382 It is a super long lanyard so I feel like the gopro could hit the ground and then be dragged. 
19383 Quality light but the boom stand was poorly design. Over all OK for the price. 
19384 The lights are weak, the stands are s***. The best parts are the umbrellas, but especially the bag. It s become my go to case for stands. 
19385 Looks good and will do a good job. Is closest fit that I could find for my phone. 
19386 Great idea and works flawlessly. Very snug and comfortable and easy to use. Cheap too :). 
19387 I use primarily for above and below water deep sea fishing photos/videos with my GoPro Hero 4+. It s strong, light, and easily transportable. 
19388 battery charges and holds its charge works well 
19389 Excellent product. Rubberized, finger grips, easy mount system. 
19390 Easy to use, like!! 
19391 Takes great photos and HD video! Love the way it feels in my hands This is my 3rd Sony camera in 8 years - however they are more point and shoot cameras....but I do still use all three of them. 
19392 Does not fit 1.25 scope I repeat DOES NOT FIT 1.25 SCOPE.The specs do state dimensions as 2&#34; but also states fits any 1.25 scope.I feel it was wishful thinking on my part but really bummed out my crystal clear night sky. 
19393 Rock solid! Best tripod I have ever owned! Worth every penny. There is nothing about this tripod that I don t love. 
19394 Good build quality, but did not fit my Sigma 50mm 1.4 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
19395 Great filter...is very much as promised by the manufacturer...I have the X1UV and it is just as good. 
19396 Excellent flash. I love it. 
19397 Works great 
19398 The extra large cleaning clothes seem easier to use and clean better than the smaller size. 
19399 Easily hackable. I had the camera on one day and it started moving. Someone had hacked it and was panning my living room. Creepy. Never plugged it in again. 
19400 Definitely dont hold a charge near as long as a nikon battery but it does a good job if your photo shoot is short otherwise without backup, your photo shoot will indeed be short lived. 
19401 It does what it s intended to do, hold my cam nice and steady! 
19402 Light is green as hell, but look how cheap it is! 
19403 This film is great and the photos come out perfect. I m still learning with my mini8 camera, but this film is perfect. 
19404 good 
19405 The screws popped out of a couple of accessories almost immediately. 
19406 my granddaughter (13) loves it 
19407 love it - nice and sturdy. thank you! 
19408 Very good product for the price. I would buy it again 
19409 Love the ease of using this camera! 
19410 I have purchased 2 of these cameras. They are very easy to set up and I can view and point from my android phone. 
19411 Great price. Not sure yet of the quality of pictures. 
19412 Yes it saved my life from spending money on that bitch I found her sleeping with other guys , so I dump her , I m so happy today ,thanks again a lot 
19413 great 
19414 I bought it for my wife as a gift, she is the camera hobbyist, she loves it so much, it adding to the quality of the pictures so much, also very easy storage, isn t bulky, nice case 
19415 The instruction are vague and you need more than what comes in the package to install it. 
19416 Batteries work flawlessly! Fantastic purchase, especially for the price. 
19417 Worked perfect 
19418 so far it is performing as I hoped 
19419 So impressed with this product! Easy setup and works like a charm. Didn t anticipate this, but I love the 24 hour activity log I can review on my phone. Even when I don t have the alarm engaged, I have a sense of what s going on. 
19420 Works as advertised. Very sensitive to sound. Works great with Foscam fi9805W. 
19421 excellent product will have to get more 
19422 works as expected 
19423 Great accessory kit with just about everything you could need for your gopro! 
19424 Fit device 
19425 great camera for young filmmakers starting out i just used this camera for a short film and it worked perfect id buy it again if i have to 
19426 For the price this can not be beat. I use it with my Note 4 and have no issues. I am very happy with it. Holds the phone secure and has plenty of adjustments. 
19427 Quality product! The white parts are grippy so that you can hang the tripod virtually anywhere, although you need to take some time to make sure it s balanced because the camera s weight will throw it off and might fall 
19428 great 
19429 malisimo 
19430 Not sure if it the stick or not but my mom that lives in Ark. Can t seem to get it to hold the phone. I live in a different state so I can t help her. 
19431 great technical support - Walder 
19432 really good for my needs 
19433 So far so good. They did well over a 5 hour shoot with about 700 photos. If these hold up over time, they will be a much cheaper alternative to the Nikon. 
19434 Great alternate to the expensive gopro cameras. Great features and image resolution for a great price 
19435 Fit my camera perfectly and now I have backup lens caps. 
19436 Haven t used it yet in the water, but it works great as a handle and for storage. My son stores the charger cable inside. 
19437 great tech service 
19438 Excellent for what I want. 
19439 hope I don t have to use it. 
19440 The camera worked well, however the film I received did not work well. Overall the camera itself was a good purchase, and a blast from the past. 
19441 Not sure how pleased I am. The first 8 batteries only lasted 2 months in my trail cam. 
19442 Works perfectly for my needs ! Couldn t ask for more for the price ... 
19443 Broke The second day i bought, i was on a concert.. 
19444 fit very tight 
19445 Bought this specifically for a snorkling trip during our last vacation. Good performance and easy to carry. Wish I had spent more time learning the menus because glare from the sun made it tough to make changes on the fly. 
19446 My favorite favorite selfie stick- so easy to connect, holds the charge long, highly recommended!! 
19447 Delivered on time. Great deal! 
19448 This battery works just as well as the original battery. The seller gives instruction and guarantees the product. 
19449 I enjoyed gazing into the starts at night and I am just so happy that my son finds it fascinating as well and this telescope has been helping him view the stars above in the sky at night 
19450 I just really dislike this tripod. Flimsy when fully extended and doesn t feel like it supports the camera well. 
19451 Would NOT work on my Leica M. 
19452 Direct replacement for my broken lens cap. One of the two plastic springs on the original cap broke and it will be interesting to see if this one is any sturdier. 
19453 I called customer support because i was having issues viewing the cam outside of the wifi it was setup on. Henry was very helpful. He got our foscam working in no time. Thank you! I will recommend your services to friends and family. 
19454 really weak 
19455 Great product 
19456 Work great, and have been using them since I bought them. 
19457 Just scared people away 
19458 It only came in one piece not as advertised! It only has a small piece that doesn t cover my entire lcd for the mark iii such a piece of crap 
19459 very big , much larger than other cameras ,, but nice nite view 
19460 Good one, but hard to wear and use... I will bet u will not use it often.... 
19461 Great product. Very nice camera 
19462 Only works up to maybe 5 feet away... nought this to take my family pictures and didn t work for me. 
19463 Bought this for big family trip to New York and absolutely LOVE it! Got some great pictures with it and transferring them to my phone has been soooo easy! 
19464 It s awful 
19465 Works pretty good with my 70D canon. No problems. Kick ass price, too. Canon should lower their prices. 
19466 no memory card including 
19467 Sharp, crisp photos and videos. 
19468 These directions are terrible and I dont like that u have to have a computer to review the images. 
19469 I have now had time to use this device and it performs as expected. 
19470 bag looks flimsy and does not hold the camera in place 
19471 Used this product for a couple of weeks in order to give a proper personal review... WOW! What a piece! Won t focus, can t single to one image, zoom is complete junk, coma is HORRIBLE! Can t even see saturns rings! Go with Baska 
19472 Great camera!! The case is nice also! 
19473 Must have if you re shooting with a 4BLK. Been through many charges for a few months now and still working great! 
19474 I like that this chest mount is so adjustable. I put it on my grandkids over their life jackets while they were wakeboarding (age 10 & 14) and then put it on my husband while he waterskied. My husband has very broad shoulders and chest. Got some fun footage! 
19475 This one fits what it says it does just by luck. Very hard to figure out according to info given. 
19476 Takes pictures well, and the zoom is great. Dies in 3 minutes if you take a video. 
19477 I don t know if it s the paper of the printer, but every picture has a blue tint. The paper fits as advertised but prints odd colors. 
19478 Works as advertised, Nikon D-3100. 
19479 Go-to lens for portrait and inside work... 
19480 I used to have this camera in the year 2007 boy do I miss it! It was so reliable I am glad to see it again! Purchase button CLICK!!! :) 
19481 Exactly what I needed to add a Rode Mic to a canon g20. Works great! 
19482 Sorry, it did not work after about an hour. Had to return. 
19483 Completely transparent. Works perfectly. 
19484 Now really I trust.... 
19485 Don t spend the money on Sony batteries this brand works just as well at half the cost. 
19486 Did a lot of research and glad I ended up with this one. Small but well built and takes great photos. 
19487 very light and easy to use 
19488 Everything fit and worked great. Nice having the extra battery for backup! 
19489 I only have one thing to say...BUY IT...I recommend this to everyone, It s incredible....The last pic is a pic of my Mom s house in a dew drop on a pine needle... 
19490 I use these for my wedding film shoots and put LED lights on top to add great lighting. Sturdy stands with great quality to them! 
19491 Very pleased with product. Shipping was quick and packing prevented any damage. Will consider when purchasing again. 
19492 Guy that I bought this for loves everything about this camera. Was shipped super fast.. 
19493 Love the images these attatchments take. Dislike that I have to remove my phone case in order for the lenses to set flat. I use an otter box, I will purchase another case with a smaller lens opening so that the attachable lenses set flat. 
19494 the caps don t stay on well, come off easily when bumped. the lens hood was alright, kind of a pain to line up nice though to shade. 
19495 These eyepieces are probably One of the best values available.Every amateur should Consider this set. 
19496 Ok 
19497 Amazing number of accessories and surprisingly nice quality. Will have to take advantage of the online tutorials to be able to handle all the functions of this gem. The bag to hold everything--doesn t. It needs to be about half the size larger. 
19498 great construction. Sturdy and well made 
19499 amazing product!!! fast shipping!!! just what i needed 
19500 Good cap for the Leica televid spotter... 
19501 Works great, what a bargain! 
19502 its great..alot of attachments..downside not sure what is for what 
19503 OUTSTANDING 
19504 Exactly what I needed! It s also portable so I can charge my battery anywhere! Amazing! 
19505 Had it about a week now and loving it! Easy setup! Great for watching away from home! Love remote tilt and pan!..and especially the notifications when alerts turned on!! Thinking of adding another! 
19506 The camera came on time but it was not a white one, it was black and silver. 
19507 Best investment EVER 
19508 Awesome 
19509 A must have they recharge fast 
19510 Beautiful case! Fits the camera like a glove. Great for protecting it and carrying it. A great buy! 
19511 I purchased this item at a reduced price for my unbiased opinion. I think this is an excellent security camera and well worth what I paid for it. I am considering getting a couple more to complete a remote security setup I have in mind. Easy to setup and use. 
19512 cute stuff, everything works. 
19513 working as advertised. like it 
19514 Perfect substitute at lower $. 
19515 What a major upgrade this is for the 50 f1.8 lens. Smaller, lighter & well built. A great choice for the money. 
19516 This is my first telescope. I ll probably need to take a class on how to use it. So far, do to my inexperience, I ve been disappointed in difficulty of use 
19517 super nice... la recomiendo. 
19518 Solidly made, works very well but you need high rings for your rifle and patients to tweak it to preform. Once done its a beaut! G :O) 
19519 Batteries hold full charge......great buy! 
19520 Worked as expected and came on time.... 
19521 I wish to know if this lens is compatible with Blackmagic Design Production cinema Camera 4K (EF Mount) before I place my order. Thanks 
19522 Great item 
19523 Wasn t as expected 
19524 Great lightstand!!!!! What I like most about it is, you can get it low to the ground. Great for setting behind a model and shining a light on the background. Works great for photographing dogs with it low to the ground. Sturdy, well made. 
19525 well designed and high optical quality 
19526 This tape leaves a sticky residue if left for a long time 
19527 I am glad I found these 
19528 I have 100 uses! Great! 
19529 I have been using both of these batteries and this charger for quite a while now, they work perfectly, and actually last a lot longer than the battery that came in the camera! Would purchase again! 
19530 Worked perfect !!! Helped me get an expensive camera working again! 
19531 I love it 
19532 It has room for various lenses and sizes. Perfect to take to hikes and get landscaping portraits. Very happy with this purchase!!! 
19533 This strap is great for many uses other than preventing serious metal detecting fatigue. It s strong velcro holds up to the toughest of jobs. I use it to hold my hammock together while backpacking. So far I have not fallen. 
19534 Arrived on time, and was just what we expected! Great job. 
19535 This was a great deal for your Cannon camera. 
19536 Simple installation, good quality, setup was okay. 
19537 Excellent birthday gift. 
19538 GREAT Clarity. Put it on my Sony NEXVG,, the zoom Not 2 smooth, But The Picture VERY Nice. 
19539 It is good value for money, but I bought if specifically to protect my Nikon Coolpix camera and expected it to be more of a tight fit. It did not meet my needs. 
19540 Works great , good price, stays where put , for mountain biking would be nice to have a shock absorbent mount. In rougher terrain the playback has a little rattle like sound. But so does all the camera s I have tried.. 
19541 As advertised. 
19542 It is a easy to use product. The price is low and worked better than my friends. 
19543 Great product! Took it on vacation and had a lot of fun with it. Easy to use. It fits my Note 3 if I remove the Otter Box. 
19544 Does not work. I will be sending it back. We tried it on several different phones. It came in a new box and appeared to be new, but did not work. 
19545 heck ya 
19546 nice 
19547 Works as expected and gpod deal for price. 
19548 sucks 
19549 Super Comfortable bag, fits my Canon 70D with my 18-55mm lense attached. I dont think it will hold a lense any longer than that with it attached. Fits all my GoPro accessories. 
19550 Came on time and nicely packaged. The quality is way better than I expected for such a small camera. Design and finish is very good. Exceeded my expectations. 
19551 Solid little stick. Unfortunately, I took it camping and lost the nut before I could even use it. I will glue another one in from my spares... 
19552 Awesome kit! It made my trip to Africa easy n efficient. I was always ready for the next shot. 
19553 Great strap! Easy to attach to my camera and its so comfy especially if you are using ur camera for a long period of time! Its good quality and I m very happy with this purchase! 
19554 Amazing results. Now, the sky comes out blue with white clouds... Most so called Pro photographers do not use this product and the sky looks white on thier pictures. Our sky is not white... Nice product. 
19555 Light and very stable for medium size weight. 
19556 Robust and durable. 
19557 Good product, thank you 
19558 This item was just what I needed to mount my GoPro to my road bike and take it on a 100 mile ride. The price was right and it performed as expected. 
19559 I was SO happy to get this. Can t wait to use it! 
19560 Fantastic !! 
19561 Works great but is really expensive. 
19562 It read i very good review about this camera and the shipment was excellent and new as described 
19563 For the money its a great deal 
19564 Excellent lens, one of my favorites I use when I am not using my 35mm. 
19565 These are pretty good, I like them. I ve used them for several years now. 
19566 functional bag, if a bit heavy. i will be using this as my DSLR bag/purse during my upcoming Italy trip. 
19567 Beatiful lens - clarity is amazing. Has become one of my favorites. 
19568 Amazing lens, built like a tank, I really love the build quality and the results. 
19569 very Poor Quality 
19570 Just what I needed 
19571 Great cover 
19572 Returned this because there was a bunch of wires and I expected less but returning process was quick smooth and easy thanks 
19573 Very nice camera takes great picts. 
19574 Don t buy, if you have a Galaxy S6 Edge. Wide angle somewhat of an improvement but with a huge drop-off in quality. Discarded. 
19575 I gave this polaroid camera to my girlfriend for our anniversary. Pink s her favorite color so I figured she ll love it. And she did! Now e have tons of photos posted on our bedroom wall. 
19576 Love it. Works great!! 
19577 Great deal for the price works like a charm! 
19578 It s a little small for all of the attachments we have for the Go Pro, but is good protection. 
19579 A great toy. I can tell you what not to do. 
19580 good product so long as one can fly the unit well 
19581 Not nearly as good as the Lumix battery but its ok as a back up. Dies really fast. 
19582 Extremely easy to use and comes well packaged as pictured 
19583 good for the price. Have been using it for a month now in my climbing trips and holds up well. Keep all my connectors, 4 batteries and extra backs and works great. Can toss in my climbing pack without being worried about crushing everything. 
19584 once I figured out how to get it on I love it. 
19585 Great case. Not too big, not too small 
19586 Work great for what I do - YouTube interviews with a DSLR. 
19587 Pretty dope!!! I like the fact that it has the plug on the device itself without the dumb cord a+ for that 
19588 100% dissatisfied, under the Product Details it says &#34;5.7x5.5x3.2 inches&#34;. Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and fond a 1x1 inch screen 
19589 too small but other then that great one 
19590 Batteries work fine, and was a quick ship, no complaints 
19591 Perfect solution 
19592 works as expected and reasonably priced 
19593 Small, but large enough that I can find it. Even the dark. 
19594 The lens arrived on time and in excellent condition. It is a great portrait lens. I am very pleased with the clarity of the photos produced with the Sony SEL18/B 50mm lens. 
19595 fits my aw120 just fine. 
19596 Great trail camera. Very sensitive capturing much more than expected. 
19597 Great amateur starter telescope, simple enough set up and good enough optics to view the craters on the moon! 
19598 Excellent by all means. 
19599 OMG!!!!! Thank you very much! We were worried that something would be wrong for that price, but everything came! The shipping was fast and everything inside was perfect. My DOUTHER so happy. It was her birthday present. Thank you very much!!!!!! 
19600 Works on my X100T. Documentation leaves a lot to be desired, but I managed to figure stuff out. 
19601 excellent lens for the money; the accessory kit was a nice bonus. 
19602 Fit much better on my lens than previous purchase 
19603 Exactly what I was looking for at a great price. 
19604 No good. 
19605 Works great - used it underwater and on hikes. Very comfortable, you ll forget you re wearing it. 
19606 Great value. We keep it in the car so we can always refresh our batteries while we are away. 
19607 ok 
19608 GREAT PRODUCT!!!!! 
19609 kept dropping off the network - pan feature did not work well 
19610 i love it! i thought i would have a hard time getting the thing attached to my camera, but it was easy. does a wonderful job, pleased with my purchase! 
19611 Photography is a big hobby for me and this camera does a really does a amazing job. I completely love it and would buy again in a heart beat 
19612 All I can say is this is a great deal! Charger & batteries all work great! 
19613 WIFE LOVES THIS ITEM 
19614 This pole was exactly what I expected and fits perfectly with my GoPro. 
19615 Excelent 
19616 This turned out to be an excellent, turn-key front light solution for my Parrot AR Drone, so I can fly it, see it better at a distance, and use the camera in low light situations. The light accepts all the factory connectors, and is super light weight. 
19617 The protector does not fit the rear screen on of my Nikon D750 well. Would not recommend to other D750 owners. 
19618 Works well. No issues. 
19619 Good kit and has been working well. 
19620 Was too difficult to attach to my Canon T3i. Celltime said they would have someone call me, but never did. Lens produced blurry pictures. Needless to say, this lens was returned at my expense AND a restocking fee, which I feel is unfair. 
19621 Works great thanks 
19622 I ve gotten some very nice shots with this lens. 
19623 Nice product for tripod work. Allows easy access to the microphone port and comes with a decent lens protector. I am very pleased with this product and have used it for approximately ten hours already with my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. 
19624 Functions as advertised 
19625 Nicely made item, but the cutouts do not fit my Hero 3+ and accessories. 
19626 Absolutely love this lens. I m an amateur photographer but this lens really makes taking a quality image so easy. I have had it for over a month and it is sturdy so far. 
19627 Works as advertised. The only thing that could be better is a more precise charge indicator. I will leave my OEM charger at home on my next vacation. 
19628 Great stick, used in salt-water with zero issues. The anodized blue parts look great and it feels top quality. 
19629 Works like original... 
19630 Love it! 
19631 Good 
19632 I use this on top of a monopod - works great, quick to set different angles. 
19633 Has been really useful in our camera kit, thanks 
19634 And GoPro sells their piece of plastic for HOW MUCH?!? This part is cheap and fantastically well made! Don t know why they went with hex-screws though... But you can replace them if you want. I replaced the one main one with a smatree metal screw on mine. 
19635 Works just like it should. 
19636 I got a defective item. I have tried to change a new battery. but i have never used it still now. so i want to return it. 
19637 works great 
19638 I m very happy with the purchase. All items work perfectly for my Nikon D5200 camera. I think the assortment of the products was a very clever one. I recommend this product. Many thanks. 
19639 Works as advertised. Very satisfied with this product. 
19640 very good product! Love it! 
19641 Yes, exactly what it says it does. Works fine and I have extra rings for all kind of needs. 
19642 Sucked. I have a rebel t3i which it says it is compatible with. ... it s not 
19643 Work as expected. 
19644 Easy set up and works great. Have also used foscam which is a huge pain to setup compared to dlink. 
19645 Doberman Security met my highest expectations, was easy and quick to install, and provides an extremely alarming signal to deter any possible break-in. 
19646 Looks like genuine parts. Thank you China! 
19647 Perfect camera. Have seen caregivers not taking care of my husband! So, it was perfect. I could check on him through cell phone when I was gone. I CAN TALK TO THEM, ALSO. 
19648 good 
19649 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
19650 Excellent! 
19651 Grip is very sturdy, and made if very nice material, it doesn t seem cheap at all. very happy with this purchase, would definitely buy again. 
19652 Fits perfectly 
19653 Charged the battery very fast but I haven t used the battery yet to see how it preforms. 
19654 Camera has difficulty focusing on small items, zoom is so-so. If I had to do it all over again I would shell out the extra money for a better point and shoot. 
19655 Works great only issue is getting connected to view it from my phone if i am not on the same network at my house. 
19656 Great camera, great for beginners but looks like you can go next level if you want to learn how to use all the bells and whistles. I managed to get it on sale for 300 which is a steal. 
19657 for the price its ok not stainless steal it rust within a day other than that it floats and holds go pro 4 very well in water i like that it has the screw hole on bottom thats why i went with this one 
19658 I just order for one.. then now after i reviced.. i found it double.. can i return? 
19659 I really do love this dual mount. Extremely affordable an great quality. 
19660 Great product. 
19661 Better than the one that came with the camera.I am very happy 
19662 For paying that price, It is good... 
19663 I loves me the X-T10, but it is small and not so easy to hold if you have large hands. This handgrip, while outrageously expensive, helps give a better grip. I wouldn t be without it. One star off for the price. 
19664 Excellent lens 
19665 Housing arrived exactly as described. Shipped and received promptly. Well made and good quality. No problems to 27m depth. See photos from Daymaniyat Islands in Oman attached. 
19666 I like that the hot shoe mount is on the handle to the side and not directly on top of gopro. I also like the foam grip. 
19667 This was purchased for my daughter for her DC trip. Takes great pics and very easy to use. After seeing the photos she took I want one for myself! 
19668 Good quality and good fit. Very satisfied 
19669 One of the batteries was defective or was not compatible with my Sony A77ii. The charger would not charge & stopped working a few days after initial use, & left me in a lurch work-wise. Would not recommend. 
19670 Does not fit Panasonic Lumix LX100 as some have claimed. Looks like a solid case otherwise. 
19671 Great option if your camera doesn t have a pre made version available. Nikon d5300 
19672 Great lens and probably the least I ll ever spend on a lens by far. Image quality is really nice can t believe this lens was so affordable. 
19673 Awesome accessory for my Olympus TG-4 
19674 Good 
19675 Flew for 5 minutes. No longer will lift of the ground. Don t waste your money. 
19676 I love it a great purchase would bye it again 
19677 excellent product. 
19678 Nice unit, very afforable. 
19679 Perfect,just what I needed. 
19680 A+ 
19681 Camera came and didn t record video, just took pictures. I returned it. 
19682 Works very well 
19683 Works as described. 
19684 great design, not dorky looking.. great space, fits my Phantom 3 pro + 2 bats very well.. raincover is a plus 
19685 grandson loves how clear the underwater vedio s are 
19686 Fit perfectly on my D200. 
19687 It had a bad camera and it would barley fly outside and the controls were very difficult to control. 
19688 I like it. I just understood it had wifi. 
19689 Super solid tripod. Great deal for your money. It s a steal, really. Highly recommend to people looking for a high quality tripod in the sub-$150 range. 
19690 Beautiful 
19691 Loved it! Best price and great pictures! 
19692 Thank you 
19693 not good...-.-;; 
19694 I have liked the results of using these filters. 
19695 I love the zoom-great deal 
19696 Batteries both fit perfectly. Holds a good charge. Obviously a great bargain. 
19697 They work, a bit more flimsy than one would prefer, but THEY WORK! 
19698 Nice wifi cams. I set them to record to my 3T external drive. Easy setup and a decent picture for the price. 
19699 good quality works great 
19700 It easily slips off but it s overall standard 
19701 Its a must have for the gopro! Easy to install and stays on through case removal after case removal. Must have! 
19702 These cleaning cloths are perfect for cleaning my touchscreen and portable too! Plus they come in great packaging to keep them all together! 
19703 Big, but beautiful results and isn t that what you really want? 
19704 Excellent ! 
19705 Great deal. I am very pleased with this purchase. The camera takes great pictures and has lots of great festures. 
19706 I am very satisfied with the package of 47 street photo. several useful accessories. as far as I gopro camera 4K super-happy with the performance. excellent resolution and crisp videos. 
19707 Great tetelscope! 
19708 Great! :) 
19709 It s a bit small for an Iphone 6 plus 
19710 works great! 
19711 Works great a+++ 
19712 Fit right on the camera, good quality 
19713 The alarm is fine if that is all you want, but the &#34;chime&#34; setting is loud and harsh and blares in your customers ear as they walk through the door. 
19714 perfect to my d3200, good hand Grip and more power to shoot. 
19715 great. 
19716 nice to be able to charge 2 batteries at the same time. You have to wiggle the batteries a little sometimes to get them plugged in correctly 
19717 Exactly what I needed; arrived in great time for upcoming cruise. A handy device 
19718 Delivered what was described, quickly. 
19719 Works perfectly. 
19720 Excellent 
19721 Good for the price. 
19722 good camera. everything fine 
19723 my batteries seem to last forever when you can put two together. plus the grip is comfortable. 
19724 Exact replacement at less than half the Verizon phone systems cost to me😃 
19725 Used it a lot until I bought the 18-250 lens 
19726 Really nice boom stand, as other reviewers said, this is a really nice stable and sold product. Im really happy with it. 
19727 I m very satisfied 
19728 complete camera for all ocasions 
19729 Perfect fit 
19730 Worst 
19731 Love the camera! Looks and works great! 
19732 Nice 
19733 This works great lots of features, interchangeable lenses, 
19734 Love this! It works exactly as described and very easy to install and can be moved around the house as needed. 
19735 it worked cliffdiving from 40ft! with the string was longer though 
19736 good, but on the smaller side 
19737 I got what I expected, I can t complain? 
19738 The axis are too loose..never expect to be disappointed for this... 
19739 As expected! 
19740 Product just as advertised. Great merchant 
19741 good 
19742 Piece of junk. Simply does not work and instructions were for a completely different device. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ITEM. I filed a claim with Amazon and we will see what happens. I am not going to return to China. 
19743 Nice bag! 
19744 Velvia never disappoints. 
19745 great 
19746 Awesome product 
19747 cheap. but do the job. 
19748 The product is great and we have not had any problems with it. It was delivered ahead of scheduling and the packaging was well done. 
19749 It s Wasabi Power. Charger, batteries work great. Much less than the Panasonic batteries in cost. 
19750 With a go pro it s hard to balance this thing getting it to balance without moving is easy but keeping it balance while moving seems impossible but maybe it s just me lol 
19751 Great value and great quality lenses. I m shocked at how good it is. 
19752 Good replacement 
19753 Mounted it on the ceiling, it works well, nice pix. 
19754 Absolute must have to protect expensive lenses from impact damage.... 
19755 The card makes it worth while, but probably won t use most of the items. 
19756 So far so good. An improvement over previous models. Touch screen. Easier navigation through menu opens. Easier download to memory card and thus to editing. 
19757 One battery lasts my just under a year in my range finder, playing three times a week. 
19758 Worked great 
19759 love it. 
19760 Considerably over priced, I believe. 
19761 They seem to have worked great while being used on my first dives and first time use of the GoPro! 
19762 Stands are very weak and wobbly. Lenses are mediocre. 
19763 Nice camera! 
19764 Shipping was a little bit late, 4 days but that was on USPS not on the seller. Great lens great quality and not full price :) cant be happier. 
19765 The LCD screen did not work 
19766 Item was fairly priced-described just as I got it-shipped quickly-great purchase 
19767 as advertised. 
19768 I love this camera...easy to use and SHARP pictures. The quick video button is a newer feature and GREAT! This is my 4th cannon camera and I would not consider buying any other brand. Focus Camera bundles are great money savers. 
19769 I m always trying to find the right mount, screw, whatever for all the mounts for my GoPro. This gives me a little more to work with. Felt it was priced a little high for what I got, though. 
19770 bad panel. Hooked it up and just made clicks. don t buy 
19771 Fits my Canon 430 flash well; snaps right on and does not fall off. Great item at a good price. 
19772 Easy to install, great picture day or night. 
19773 This is an amazing lens. I took it out for a test drive and it blew my mind in reach, clarity and contrast. 
19774 The harness looks very well made. I am looking forward to giving the Geekpro and chest harness to my Grandson for his 14 th Birthday Nov 2nd. I will be happy to review it at that time. 
19775 Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for! 
19776 Great product. Fast shipping. Thank You. 
19777 Great product. 
19778 Waste of money. Terrible distortion. 
19779 Fantastic light or the price. Pretty well built stand too. I appreciate the fact that it has 5 switches so that I can get exactly the amount of light I want. I did drop one start though because one of the 5 bulbs was defective and did not work. 
19780 DJI battery what can I say, it works well. 
19781 perfect carrying case for the fujifilm instaxmini8 
19782 These have every look and feel of OEM GoPro mount clips. 
19783 The hprc case is amazing. Just what I expected. Heavy duty baby. The only reason I didn t give it 5 stars is the foam layout was different than the picture. I wasn t sure if I received the correct case or not. 
19784 Not a great camera. My fault should have read more on it. Too slow to take a second shot. 5 second delay. Quality not as good with final photo. 
19785 These batteries are okay. They drain too fast for me and don t put out as power as I think they should. 
19786 Greatest glasses cleaner out there 
19787 Perfect, and so much better than paying at a retail store. 
19788 Just received mine yesterday. It s very comfortable and light, which makes my Nikon seem lighter when I have it over my shoulders. I also like the color designs on this strap plus it s not expensive. I d recommend others buying this brand of camera neck strap. 
19789 Bought this to store/carry all parts for Sylvania 9-inch portable DVD players (2 screens). Both players fit along with all the cords, chargers, etc. and 2 DVDs. Perfect. 
19790 Works great! Plug it into my laptop and upload my photos quick. 
19791 It functions as advertised - price is right. 
19792 great product thank you 
19793 broke on 1st use 
19794 Bought 2 neither one works. Waste of money. 
19795 works well sofar 
19796 Poor product. The lens is so lousy it cuts your pictures. The camera is so poorly engineered that the film gets stuck. The film is so small. The old polaroid was perfect why did they have to change it ? 
19797 No good resolution 
19798 Works very well on my Nikon. Very comfortable. 
19799 Sensors work as expected and you get 5 of them at a nice price. 
19800 It was pretty great, until it broke after about a month of use. The attaching screw on the bottom snapped in half, so now I can t attach a monopod or anything of the sort to it, therefore rendering it pretty useless. I got what I paid for, I guess. 
19801 Love it...perfect for selfies. 
19802 works very good on my helmet and very pleased. Thanks!! 
19803 Great price for this one! It s a steal! 
19804 I really can t find a fault with this light. It is bright and the quality of light is good. It has barn doors, a remote and other accessories. This is a very good product. 
19805 Works as described, arrived on time and with no problems. I use it in my daily log and it s great. 
19806 Scope works great. The program is a bit skepitcal. 
19807 You get what you pay for. Replaced it after a year. 
19808 Nice! 
19809 great product. 
19810 Works perfect for my camera!! 
19811 worked great 
19812 Can t figure out how to use the stupid thing. Instructions are as poor as they come!! Wouldn t recommend it to anyone. 
19813 I Traded in my Canon 7D, which I never really enjoyed (it has since been discontinued), after purhasing this camera! I love this camera - the pictures look amazing! 
19814 It works well. It helps me stabilize the camera when I shoot. 
19815 Just purchased this and found it only fires at full power on manual and TTL is stuck on one power as well. Tested it on several attempts. Hoping this is just a fluke. 
19816 Very durable and sturdy strap 
19817 very reliable 
19818 Has come in pretty handy 
19819 Not made cheap this is a steardy tool I use it on gun range in windy days does more then I expected it be for $ thanks for the deal 
19820 Works perfectly. Definitely adds bulk, but worth it to only need to charge my daily-use camera once a month. 
19821 Works well. Just a tad off in color though. 
19822 Great Deal, Fine product, Five Stars***** 
19823 Amazing~! I love it. Holds really well on most surfaces--glass, body panels on a car, most flat surfaces. Grip is extra tight. Get this! End of the story. 
19824 did not work for the model it says it does 
19825 The aluminum material was too lightweight and the head was not fluid enough for my needs so I returned it. 
19826 It works perfectly for me. It gives that extra light that I need and having the shoebox gives it a softer and warmer affect. Very pleased. 
19827 Works extremely well and can be used with either eye by turning the eyecup. 
19828 Great inexpensive tripod bag does the job, was a bit small but I can not blame the bag for my tripod for being a few inches to big Good price good quality travels nicely 
19829 Good for mounting outside 
19830 Fits well into the camera. Would have liked a car solution as well, but that was not promised. 
19831 This is inexpensive and does a good job. 
19832 solid app. worth the price. Caught my dog turning on my gas oven.. No joke 
19833 Works great! 
19834 beautiful and good quality 
19835 This is a great accessory for hiking, or really any hands free activity. The hat clip is genius, I like to clip mine to a bandana. 
19836 Comfortable and stylish 
19837 Bought this for my new lens and it is awesome. Easy to fit. A great purchase! 
19838 survived my purpose and the price was right 
19839 Nikon is the best! 
19840 It could be a little bit louder and a little more vicious sounding but I think it works fine 
19841 This accessory kit is amazing! You have so many options of ways to film from your GoPro! 
19842 Very light weight and easy to use. Takes great photos. Purchased for my wife and she prefers it to her Iphone. 
19843 A good product. Fast battery charging. Displays information accurately. Battery is compatible with fujifilm xp80. 
19844 I am satisfied with device and the product support. AR004218 was very supportive at DLink. 
19845 using it with the sony rx1r. Does the job even though a bit overpriced. 
19846 Having problems with some of the futures to my camera when the battery pack is connected. As for the power supply it works great. 
19847 Great handle for a gopro 
19848 great 
19849 Was not a Honeywell part, rather a generic off-brand replacement. Does work, but not what I thought I was buying. 
19850 Awesome 
19851 Pretty good protection and pricing, however it s a bit hard to take my Xiaomi Yi Camera out of it. The camera kind of gets stuck inside. I still use it daily though since I have bunch of goPro accessories to use between this and my Hero4 Silver. 
19852 Thank you, arrived as stated. 
19853 Nice color, nice design, durable fabric 
19854 Remote shutter release. Works as promised. There are cheaper alternatives out there, but I had two cheaper ones that stopped working after a while. 
19855 Could not get a clear picture Returned 
19856 Perfect! 
19857 This seller is fantastic! They have excellent customer service and their prices and products are great! I am a very satisfied repeat customer! 
19858 Great for most situations, It would have been perfect if it had a 180 degree rotation so that it can be bounced of side walls. 
19859 Arrived quickly and works as it should. Instruction aren t very good but YouTube can help you with that. 
19860 Great product and works really well. I use it as my outdoor cam without any issues. 
19861 Perfect! 
19862 Inexpensive and good quality. Will likely upgrade to higher wattage bulbs, though stands and umbrellas are great. Good customer service as well...they send-out replacement for broken bulb immediately. 
19863 Great little action camera. Well worth the price. 
19864 good quality everyday backpack. comfort, style, alot of pockets. 
19865 Camera case was great recommend this if you have move video Camera 
19866 Perfect an fast delivery 
19867 Great lens on a 5DsR. 
19868 Perfect 
19869 Ignore the negative reviews! I got this to see what my puppy is doing in the when given new freedom. Setting up the internet connection is not easy but following the directions closely will work. Very awesome! 
19870 Good communication and quick shipping. Excellent product-much better than expected. Does not leave filmy streaks like the others I ve tried, they disappear immediately and you don t need to go over your screen again. Can be reused several times. Great on cell phone screens, Ipad, Ipod, etc..Highly recommend 
19871 Item arrived as described. Quick ship. Highly recommend! 
19872 Don t use it 
19873 Great camera. My daughter loves it! 
19874 Made of metal so it s more resilient and can hold up to a lot of use. Threads seem to line up nicely and go on without a fight. 
19875 Great value brought for a present the individual didn t want it. 
19876 Took it to Europe buy plane and train, came back and it s like new. 
19877 Danny at Foscam helped me with the port forwarding so I could view the cameras on my mobile device while away from home. He was fast, easy tho understand and professional. 
19878 This is a standard UV filter. It appears to be performing just fine, 
19879 OK combination of price and performance. 
19880 Eh worth about what it costs 
19881 This was a gift to complement my daughter s 10th bday gift. It was a perfect fit and she loves all the extras. She has not yet tried the selfie adaptation but the rest I would recommend. The delivery was extra fast which was a great plus in my book. 
19882 Works great! Simple to use, paired easily with my S5. Much better selfie, and will use this a lot for event pics. Compact size fits in purse. 
19883 The device is pretty good, does it s job, nothing special about it, the clicking sound is a bit annoying but otherwise it s ok to know if it s still moving or not. https://youtu.be/yoQnYusGtPo 
19884 Great case. Fits camera like a glove. Leather and stitching excellent. Even ithough it was shipped form China, I got it in less than 2 weeks 
19885 bad 
19886 So many tripods to choose from, why not just get one from Amazon? I couldn t be happier! Tripod has very sturdy build, can be set to any height you desire, and any of the adjustments will stay tight wherever you put them. 
19887 Fits well. As advertised. 
19888 Hard to get camera in and out of case 
19889 Super easy to install and great picture. 
19890 small - compact - safe - wellmade 
19891 got this as a gift 
19892 perfect for what I wanted...holds plenty but isn t too bulky....very comfortable 
19893 this item is designed very well and installed pretty easy 
19894 They send me a completely wrong battery in a A640PX box. Don t buy this if you re looking for this battery! Very dissapointed. 
19895 It was nice to have these extra battery packs for my honeymoon! Worked wonderfully and would recommend to anyone! 
19896 love it 
19897 This is one of the best monitor we have worked with so far. Super easy useful interface, very well thought design, light weight, luts via SD card insert. It is worth every penny. Big respect for SmallHD to put such a product. 
19898 not bad 
19899 All the items in the picture arrived. I didn t test all yet, but at least looks good and work. 
19900 Been waiting for this truly wireless video security solution for a long time. It works exactly as I d hoped. I recommend this system to everyone that will listen. Go ahead and pass Go. 
19901 not a dvr 
19902 I haven t used it that much yet. Still learning. But so far everything Seems to be working just fine. 
19903 Beyond happy with the purchase might be expensive but well worth every penny, I had a phantom fc40 before but this well surpasses every phantom so far in every way, well imo it does the inspire was to expensive 
19904 typical 
19905 Perfect, works as intended 
19906 Really like having lens clip holder on my camera strap. I don t always take my camera bag or have pockets to put lens cap in. This solves that problem! 
19907 Love it. 
19908 Got this for my wife who s an amateur photographer. The kit comes with everything you need for a quick and easy lighting boost. From making home videos to shooting scenes outdoors, it works great. The price was excellent and gives you a lot for the money. 
19909 Took small tumble to the side and these cracked without even protecting the props. Chipped a prop and completely broke off a guard. Cheap pieces of s***. Very light though 
19910 Works perfectly as described. Anyone with a DSLR should have one of these (really though, they should just come with the camera...) 
19911 As addvertized 
19912 excellent item, solved my problem 
19913 Wonderful camera! Got it for my 10-year-old daughter for her birthday and it s her favorite gift! Love it! 
19914 Holds camera, USB cord and batteries fine. Less expensive than similar cases offered by camera manufacturers. 
19915 Does t put out much Ir light. the video camera has some IR led s and I see no improvment when I add this for extra light. 
19916 Great deal and excellent product for our purpose. 
19917 Perfect fit for my DSLR but the sting broke within a couple months of use :( 
19918 Fast shipping looks good works awesome battery doesn t last long do wich sucks connects to any smartphone doesn t have a motorcycle helmet attachments only for bike helmet wich sucks but other than that it s awesome 
19919 never worked peace of crap 
19920 it s hard to remote this DVR. 
19921 Great lightweight tripod. 
19922 Love this to turn any purse into a camera bag. I took it on a trip to Prague and it was perfect! I had a canon rebel t3i and batteries, Chargers, etc with plenty of room. 
19923 Just bought this product and two cameras don t work at all 
19924 Who do I send this back to ??? Amazon or zmodo 
19925 doesn t really fit the rx100-3 but is fine on my rx100 
19926 Works great with my Sony camera! 
19927 Not sure why people say it was stiff? It s probably the softest strap I ve ever felt. The next best strap would be an Artisan and Artist silk strap, but they re way more expensive. 
19928 Loud enough ! Works great ! Sensor is super accurate ! 
19929 Very nice monopod. The carbon fiber is very strong and this thing can take a load. Very impressed with the fit and finish of this item. Benro makes a Quality piece. 
19930 An extra battery is always nice to have on hand and if it is already mounted, even better. The grip works just great, but the remote is another story. I have followed the the directions and can not get it to work. 
19931 Great little shoulder rig for the price. Used it yesterday on a shoot and did the job perfectly. 
19932 Works great as expected. A goodvalue 
19933 A great alternative to using the one by Nikon, cost effective and sturdy, no issues works great. 
19934 Item performed great on our recent trip. Item delivered on time. Batteries charged & worked right out of the box. Very convenient on trips. Will order another set. 
19935 Love it. 
19936 Purchased for the tamron 150x600. VERY tight fit. Not ideal for this lens 
19937 Great 
19938 love it 
19939 when you turn the camera , I realized that in the configuration the WiFi option is not listed, this camera brings wifi? Help me configure the wifi 
19940 Works great 
19941 Came exactly as described. Works great with my GoPro Hero. 
19942 Clarity is good. A little too sensitive at night - even after adjustment. 
19943 Works great with my lumix. Would have loved an extra pocket for a extra sd card. 
19944 fits very well!! would buy again 
19945 Good as it is Nikon s. 
19946 I will give them a 6 Star if I could. It does not matter where I am I can see my pet. Great colors. Delivered on time and does everything the sellers says it suppose to do. 
19947 Not worth the money. The battery cannot be changed. Picture quality was bad. Returned it. 
19948 Wonderful 
19949 This is a great case. Fair price, keeps my expensive Nikon 5200 safe and snug. Plenty of pouches for other things, batteries, chargers, SD cards, etc. Highly recommend. Good quality. 
19950 Excelent for the price, but don t expect durability. 
19951 I installed this button camera on my clothes with a mini DVR, it looks very good, and no one knows this is a camera. Like it. 
19952 Just what I needed. Very White cloth. Very portable. 
19953 Great product at a great price! 
19954 Works well. 
19955 It s was just could meet d expectations 
19956 The action pack is a better deal. Wish I had waited. 
19957 Item does well jobs as described. Thanks. 
19958 just what I was looking for. 
19959 Good product 
19960 Very useful and great. 
19961 Half of the pictures would develop and the other half never turned out. Waste of money. 
19962 Thank you 
19963 As with everything Phantom 3 it s tough, durable and beautifully engineered and constructed. 
19964 Exactly as described and just what I needed to round out my Nikon d3200. :) 
19965 this backpack fits everything and I take it everywhere. I especially liked it it has straps that can hold my tripod on one side and the stabilizer on the other. There also pockets for all your little accessories including ST cards. It is also made of really really good quality. 
19966 This item was a waste of my money. It never worked right out of the box. The instructions were not in English and it went downhill from there. 
19967 1 
19968 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
19969 The description says &#34;Which Has The 18-55mm Lens&#34;... Lens cap (Polaroid) says right on it: 52mm. It does not fit a 55mm lens. Not the first complaint about this...but they still do not change the description. 
19970 Perfect for my telescope needs 
19971 The camera is that easy, or you can do it all manually. I love my new camera, and I am learning how to take a better quality picture with all the different options. 
19972 Perfect for the basics, holds camera extra lens, batteries and filters 
19973 Quit working after 2 weeks. 2 did the same thing don t buy. 
19974 Works great! 
19975 Works well, seems to be pretty steady and sturdy. 
19976 Saved me $90 from having to take it in to my local camera shop and clean dust off the sensor. Thanks! 
19977 Excellent product just as advertised. Well built solid. Only complaint Is view finder must be at a angle when opening or it hits the top of cage. Arrived 2 weeks early love that. 
19978 Great camera at a great price 
19979 Seems to be a nice bag just what I was looking for good size and movable dividers inside on Velcro 
19980 Good photos and video quality with shown mounts. Good for basic and occasional usage. L 
19981 Nice to be able to use my old lens again. 
19982 It fits perfectly with my requirements I even use it for my underwater photography. 
19983 Was spectacle at first, but they did the job as expected. Glad I brought these diving goggles!!! 
19984 Well done, I Like 
19985 Seems to be very solid quality 
19986 Works as advertised, no complaints. 
19987 Perfect camera for our kids works great easy to use. 
19988 Perfect 
19989 Items work great. Perfect description. FSt delivery. Great price. Over alll excellent transaction 
19990 It works well for my purposes. The app is easy to use. Replacement cameras are not too expensive 
19991 Nice camera. I ve made many a picture and memory with this camera. 
19992 Love it amazing 
19993 good deal! 
19994 Love this lens. First copy had front element fall out of it, as it was only secured by glue. Had to buy a second copy, but image quality and usability is great. 
19995 Haha good junk camera! 
19996 Fits my T5i like a glove 
19997 Great illumination from this. Saved from replacing a camera in which the IR died. Can now use at night without issue. 
19998 it did what i wanted 
19999 really good heavy duty camera... its a pain to adjust you need allen wrenches but other than that its a great camera 
20000 Too small for anything! 
20001 This is a great bag at the price I was looking for. I like that I can put my laptop in it, but it does make things cozy for my fat camera. I d buy this again. 
20002 perfect for capturing about 2 hrs of video 
20003 Saw the stand broken upon opening the box. I had wished to place the unit on a table but as a result of the broken stand had to screw it to the wall. 
20004 Floats phone in water and with a waterproof case. Fits great on any size wrist, even kids and stays on wrist. 
20005 This is a decent mic for the money and I have no complaints 
20006 Great product, just wish the cable was a little longer but not a deal breaker. 
20007 Didn t come with the 8GB card and had to send back. 
20008 Fits my T5i and extra batteries. Great for anyone who films. Also fits in another bag so you don t look sus with a camera everywhere. 
20009 Yes this is very good, easy release or attach for camera with help of ball release 
20010 Awesome product it is great for the price and works really well. 
20011 Actualy works 
20012 Value formoney 
20013 As expected. Very satisfied with the product. 
20014 Easy to use! 
20015 A most have for go pro owner, the go pro battery only last 2 hours max so it good to carry few back ups just in case. i have 4 of these because i go out on long hikes 
20016 Works great! 
20017 This camera was the perfect replacement for our parking area 
20018 It s a great looking strap, it s not that comfortable but what to be expected. It look beautiful with my film camera. 
20019 Great camera, easy to use. feels good, great pictures. 
20020 Love the camera, easy to use and great pictures 
20021 So far have had good signal strength with my fatshark goggles. Definitely needs power filtering, without filtering I was getting all kinds of horizontal white lines. I tossed in a cheap UBEC and then it went perfectly clear. Range tests coming soon! 
20022 Met my needs. 
20023 These cameras work very well. They were easy to setup and once they were setup I was able to go wireless. Work great with my Android phone. Looks like a good design and seem very durable. Try one or two like I did. 
20024 I like it overall, not always the best quality in low light 
20025 Very high quality battery for GoPro Hero 4 Black ed. Just like OEM battery from GoPro. Worth every cent. 
20026 Great product 
20027 I just received my set. I m now going to purchase units for ALL of my lenses. It s a great investment. I have noticed some vignetting when mounted on my 16-35mm f/4. That one might be returned. The 24-70mm 2/8 seems fine. 
20028 Did the job just right for what I wanted to do. I clipped it to a Garmin bean bag mount. 
20029 Great product. strong/sturdy/nice case/well made 
20030 Excellent!!! Great price. Prompt service 
20031 will not record for me! 
20032 I got mine.. And after one day it refuse to turn on.. I charged the battery but still isn t working.. Planning for a refund! 
20033 Fast delivery, product as described. Would do biz, again. LOVE this monopod! 
20034 Fit well, easy to install 
20035 Generally good, but i m in the bushes and trees a lot. The adhesive that attaches the strap to the lens cap is not good enough for me. 
20036 Excellent tri pod. I use it for my spotting scope. Light weight and fits in my backpack. 
20037 Okay. 
20038 Wish the camera came with this, works like it is part of camera! 
20039 This accessory kit fits my canon camera prefect. It is a great accessory to have to protect the len. 
20040 Super 
20041 Easy to work. Good quality. 
20042 great 
20043 Great camera, clear pictures with vivid colors. Like the long range zoom 
20044 purchased this pristine camera with battery grip, magnifier eyepiece, sigma flash. Well-pleased with everything i have used so far; have not used flash. Shutter count was low 1500. Seller answered all my questions to my satisfaction and i recommend this seller. 
20045 Not a very good replacement for the Panasonic branded battery. Short life, very fast rolloff of power at end. Wouldn t recommend, wouldn t purchase again. 
20046 Connects very quickly with other Yongnuo and Canon products. 
20047 Exactly what i was looking for. I use it a lot. 
20048 So light and worked perfectly on my rafting trip! Fit nicely on my helmet! 
20049 Everything fine, useful as expected & good delivery service... 
20050 The D750 camera is everything Nikon says it is. 
20051 Received in a timely manner and as advertised. Haven t utilized all of them yet but they do fit well on the adapter ring for my PowerShot. Thanks. 
20052 Another perfect fit for my studio from the good folks at Cowboy Studios. 
20053 Does what its supposed to. Easy to install. I recommend using a UV filter along with this to protect the exposed contacts on the back of the lens... the adapter has the treading for the filter so its perfect. 
20054 Good strap, but has a tendency to want to twist around & the placed side ended up facing out. 
20055 Nice camera for the price! 
20056 little poor quality zipper 
20057 I carry a Sony DSLR camera and several attachments in it. Not a lot of extra room, but enough. 
20058 Concept s OK but battery does not really last long. I used it few times but battery does not last +2 hours albeit I charge it full when I first got it. Not sure if I got a bad unit. 
20059 Great stuff for great price though the step up has wifi 
20060 Perfect fit, was a replacement for the one I lost. 
20061 So when I ordered these, I though they where air cushioned, they are not they are spring, however, they are 100% metal and I have no fear of the clamps letting go on them... They would be 6 stars I hey where also air cushioned 
20062 MORE THAN ENOUGH WIRE SERVED ITS PURPOSE GOOD BUY 
20063 Very easy set up. Quality of camera s is good during day and night. Able to view from smartphone with ease. I like being able to monitor my home while I am at work. 
20064 Very pleased with the camera. The instructions for the WiFi connection are sorely lacking. Fortunately Nikon was able to walk me through the procedure. 
20065 Great!!! 
20066 The lenses are a little smaller than I was expecting. But other than that they re really nice. Fit well and do not fog up at all. The zebra lenses are great from driving in bright sun to biking through shaded trails. 
20067 too big 
20068 I wear reading glasses and this help me see what I am taking pictures of without them. 
20069 Love this camera bag. Is the pecfect size, compact, not to big. My Canon EOS Rebel T6i with a 18-135mm lens fits perfectly! 
20070 Display is barely readable after only a few weeks of operation. Logitech has lost their hold on the WiLife market. 
20071 Exactly what we needed 
20072 These &#34;bags&#34; provide great protection for my Canon lenses. I keep a small Canon Vixia video camera in the largest bag. 
20073 Great Camera, for the price picture resolution a lot better than my cam s that came with my DVR. Im going to replace my other two cameras... 
20074 great 
20075 So far, so good. Haven t taken it into the water yet...we ll see what the second half of this review looks like... 
20076 Awesome for the money. Be sure to use 720p (60FPS) when shooting fast paced footage 
20077 waste of money!!! Not happy at all. very bad quality. 
20078 The NEST cam is wonderful but......The website to view the recordable is far far less than apealing to use in comparison to the dropcam website. The drop cam website had this ease of use whereas the nest website is slow and has a lot of bugs. Mainly slow...... 
20079 Works just fine 
20080 amazing 
20081 I bought this camera for my recent vacation. I had it in the water with me on several occasions. This camera is excellent for the price. I love the selfie function too. Overall I m very happy with this purchase! 
20082 Great deal!!! 
20083 is working real good. 
20084 Expensive but worth, my daughter love it and have so much fum taking pics with her friends! Received it quickly and well package. 
20085 I could not get the camera to charge, so I returned it. 
20086 So easy to set up and use. It s very practical. The Nest Cam gives us peace of mind when we re away from home. 
20087 as described. Thanks! 
20088 simple to use, excellent starter camera set for my friend s 14 year old daughter 
20089 Pretty cool toy, Easy to fly and best value! 
20090 Just Okay, Rarly use it due to its flimsy nature. Don t be fooled by it s rugged appearance. The part that turns is loose and never is really stable. Good for hanging a small LED light. 
20091 I wanted to tell you how pleased i was with the way my order was handled. It arrived earlier thank expected and the product was just as described. The customer service was \\ top notch\\ thank you 
20092 Great value pack for the price can t beat it batteries last longer than I thought they were gonna too 
20093 I never regret buying this. Great product by a great company which I have known since I was about 4 or 5 years old (in 1995 I guess) 
20094 They work, but was hoping they d be a little longer on the handle side. Probably would not buy again. 
20095 Works great! Good for placing plants in your house that have certain light requirements. 
20096 Great product for the price!! 
20097 This screen protector fits my Canon 5D iii with amazing precision and clarity. DEFINITELY an A+ 
20098 It works very well but the lens cap is very hard to take on and off. 
20099 Great bag, well padded and just the right amount of storage for day to day use. 
20100 Awesome product 
20101 LOVE the zoom.... really great so far. 
20102 Works Just fine. Would recommend 
20103 Not as listed and had white screen P O S!!!!!!! 
20104 Upon arrival, the rubber part came 75% off from the hard plastic frame that slips over the bracket. This was why I bought a replacement, as my original one had finally pulled apart after three years. The replacement was useless. 
20105 I like my tripod a lot. It s everything I needed. 
20106 A little cheezy for the price, but interesting to experiment with. 
20107 Great price and quality 
20108 Recommended, but slightly pricey. 
20109 Very good. Worked well. I have the door open at my store and need it something to let me know when someone enter. 
20110 Could be a little more sturdy 
20111 One of the batteries failed after one month. The camera simply doesn t register that it s there anymore. The other works just as well as my Sony battery. I average about 400-500 shots per battery, but I have airplane mode turned on and auto-focus off (Sony a7ii). 
20112 This step up filter adaptor is made aluminum instead of brass, so it has a tendency to bind. 
20113 My husband has not complained at all! 
20114 Great for what I need, not a professional, but works fine. 
20115 Great fit! 
20116 THE BEST AND SLICK LOOKING 
20117 I ve been using this everything has been great 
20118 Good product, have used it a lot. 
20119 LOVE THESE!!! Easy setup and install. Great quality product and super clean HD picture, both IR night vision and daylight. Very happy with these. 
20120 No problems. Got exactly what I ordered. 
20121 This Battery delivered a full 100% charge for the 1st few months, then dropped down to achieving only a maximum of a 50% charge... This is unacceptable as now I can no longer rely on it being a backup for my camera due to limited capacity... 
20122 Love it 
20123 Really easy to set up, you can do so with just your smart phone, some knowledge of networks/routers helps do the advanced features. 
20124 Best security camera there is. Motion activated, everything is recorded on SD card, but could be connected to wifi and be monitored remotely. 
20125 I picked this up as a spare for my 2015 Yamaha V1 Waverunner. It is is comfortable and seems to be a much better quality than the one that came with my unit. This has replaced the original as my primary lanyard. 
20126 Easy to handle, frame picture and carry around. 
20127 Great price, works well, will buy from this vendor again 
20128 fast shipping and good product. all mentioned item complete and works perfectly. 
20129 Very cool if you love science!! 
20130 Nikon !!!! no need to say more. 
20131 I liked the product but it took a long time to arrive. 
20132 Excellent price and works great 
20133 Amazing value for the price. Very high quality. If i dropped these in the ocean I would go out and buy another pair that day. 
20134 wonderful item, fast shipping, love them! 
20135 Great additional lens for my Nikon camera...great price..delivered quickly. .would buy again or recommend ! 
20136 I don t use it very often but it does the job. 
20137 The camera box arrived with a hole in the side and the camera has two chips in the paint plus small surface scratches on the face side at the shutter area. Beware on this camera. Not happy at all. 
20138 Love that it syncs my photos with my cloud storage. 
20139 WORKS AS INTENDED 
20140 ok 
20141 I HATE harsh flash effects. This will soften everything regardless of the angle of the head. Yes. it reduces effective range, but that is what software is for. 
20142 They were not bright enough 
20143 So far so good. I sold my Nikon DSLR for this and everything seems to be good. Image quality and zoom are amazing. It also has very good stabilization in the videos. 
20144 Very good accept for the sound. 
20145 had to use tin foil to make them work correctly 
20146 Best sandals (flip flops) I ve ever owned. However, a bit pricey. 
20147 The battery charger works well and SterlingTek was terrific to work with. 
20148 Be aware one of the items screws on counter clockwise. I returned one unit as I thought the threading was broken. 
20149 works good. stores easily 
20150 Excellent package at this price. The screw on lenses are marginal at best. The camera and zooms, however, are excellent. 
20151 vERY VERY GOOD!! 
20152 Really strong, used it on rugged trails for months now 
20153 Great product. Just what i needed. I have only used it for a day, but it feels well manufactured and durable. 
20154 Rigth rear motor (rear black propeler) does nt run fast enougth 
20155 Great Mic for the buck. Can t go wrong. 
20156 Adjustable, comfortable, and because of the rubber lines on the inside, it doesn t slip. Great! 
20157 Does what it says it would. 
20158 So far I love this lens. Nothing bad to say at all 
20159 I thought this would be tricky to assemble and not be sturdy enough to meet my needs, but it affixed to the lens and gives me the needed surge of handling zooming, focusing, and reading the screen with ease! 
20160 Great case, you can adjust it to fit any of your accessories. The camera with underwater case fits perfectly. Compact but very roomy for all your needs. 
20161 Woks well and is relatively easy to setup and fly... however, the lack of rotor guards is a big minus, as they break very easily (the Phantom has optional rotor guards that protect it from breaking when accidentally hitting objects like trees). 
20162 I am super duper SUPER happy with this seller. The lens is beyond perfection and I would think it was brand new unused if someone asked me. I would use this seller again and again! 
20163 A good camera strap to have. 
20164 Excellent 
20165 Not bad. Well constructed but the inner detachable walls in the main pouch don t really line up perfectly anywhere. Pretty awkward to organize. 
20166 a little bulky but work well 
20167 This works great for my gaming lighting set up. Small and portable. Great buy!! 
20168 Perfect for home studio. Great value, easy to set up, and seems to be sturdy. 
20169 I had the opportunity to use it in a recent trip to Cancún. It worked out great to give me the contrast I needed on different lighting situations. Definitely makes the editing process easier in Lightroom. I loved the final results. 
20170 Buyer beware you will Not receive what is pictured. You will get a totally different clamp that will Not work with the 2000 series meters. 
20171 It s working good 
20172 Great product. 
20173 I received this defective product with audio failed. This product can not use for car recorder due to the Polariod mount design limitation. 
20174 This is my first pelican and It definitely stands up to its reputation. Shipped faster than estimated delivery, made it to Illinois in 2 days. I might have to get a second one. 
20175 works great 
20176 alright 
20177 fine 
20178 Snapped on P-tap of V-lock battery with positive pressure. Repurposed this cable to feed 14.4 volts to my Sound Devices. Solid soldering and good contacts. Will buy again. 
20179 This is the perfect replacement/additional battery that we have been looking for. Excellent quality product - Highly recommended! 
20180 This accessory is cute and fun. The case gives the camera a little flare. My daughter loves the stickers. 
20181 THE BEST! 
20182 I had to return two of these, both had a defective leg clamp. Never had a problem with Manfrotto gear before but the same problem twice in a row is too much to ignore. Going to try something different. 
20183 My dog tested it by trying to come through the glass door and it set off the alarm. Good to know it works :) 
20184 Great little widget. It has 1/4 20 tapped holes on its length too but due to angle of bracket I don t see them providing any use except making it lighter. But it does exactly what I needed it to do. 
20185 I am very pleased with my new P600 and also with all of the goodies that came with the camera. The camera has more features then I will ever use but I am having fun trying them all out. 
20186 For less than 5 bucks I didn t expect much, but the overly strong smell of the rubber used to make this, makes me nauseous. Item functions great of you can get around the excessively strong rubber smell. 
20187 Badly directional and doesn t work from very far away. Never used it successfully. 
20188 Great for DIY instead of lefting a pro to fix for you. 
20189 I use this quite a lot. works well.... 
20190 Great zoom lens. Autofocus is perfect. Great for action shots at the baseball games. 
20191 Delivers even before expected... Can t wait to test it ! 
20192 Don t waste your money. None of the buttons are marked making it hard to remember which button is which. 
20193 great camera 
20194 Very pleased with this product. 
20195 Had to return for refund as one of the speakers wouldn t work, video is not very smooth and kept locking up on playback. Great concept that needs refining. 
20196 came as expected. the battery works fine. 
20197 low quality, died during the 1st serious session done with it. you get what you pay for :( 
20198 Great Product 
20199 Work great slide on to rails with ease 
20200 Good product and great performance. 
20201 Good quality for the price. 
20202 aok 
20203 This quality leather camera case was delivered exactly according to the description plus the unmentioned fasteners are also of good quality. The case fits my Nikon D5500 perfectly and I am pleased to recommend it. 
20204 Worked pretty well for looking in the cylinders of my old John Deere. Needed the mirrors to do 90deg that it does not come with. 
20205 Excellent deal! More stuff than I can use right now, but looking forward to learning about this amazing camera. Bag is not big enough to hold all items!!! 
20206 Arrived on time, and works as expected. 
20207 Very good product. 
20208 Not typically a fan of of brand products but how could you say no for the value. 4 batteries, a charger, a mini tripod and more for under $20. What a steal!! Batteries have worked fine so far. 
20209 still using it 3 years later 
20210 App wouldn t work for the people we gave it to. I plan to return it :( 
20211 Works as it should to be. 
20212 Purchased as a gift for someone in surveillance work. They love the lighter weight and clear focus of this choice out of the dozens to choose from. 
20213 Great case for carrying the mini monitor and some extras 
20214 The clip that keeps the case together broke within a week of me using it. 
20215 I m spoiled by a Canon XS50, but the peace of mind of having an inexpensive camera that water can t damage when kayaking is worth what I miss in control and image of photo. The photos are better than I expected and it s waterproof! 
20216 Keeps camera protected, perfect fit. 
20217 Love this! They all work wonderfully! I love to vlog and these help tremendously as it gives a wide view. 
20218 product worked as intended. 
20219 I bought this to go with my range scope since it has a canted eye piece. I can adjust this mount to hold the scope sideways and don t have to strain my neck to see perfectly. It s very stable on the ground. Love it. 
20220 Great! 
20221 Great set up. I wish it came with an owner s manual. I had to download the pdf version, which I can t carry with me when I m out in the world taking photos. But it comes with everything else I need, and takes great photos. 
20222 Tripod was damage. Delivery was fast 
20223 Good Product Works as expected 
20224 It s ok 
20225 it must have cost more to make this than I paid for it 
20226 Still learning all the stuff this camera is capable of.. Way more than I am.. Somewhat confusing menu system but hopefully I will learn.. Seems like good value for cost.. Excellent Leica Lens.. The long telephoto and great stabilization are real pluses.. 
20227 Nice Fit for my new Hero 4 Silver! 
20228 My mom bought this for me for my birthday and I love it! It takes great pictures and it is basically the talk of a party. Film is kind of expensive but it is reasonable. Love it! 
20229 Works great! 
20230 Convenient and easy to use! Great product!! 
20231 This little guy is like a tank. Very sturdy and functional for the price. 
20232 Good camera. Small size. 
20233 great 
20234 Works flawlessly on my X100T - no quality loss, no fringing, no autofocus struggles. Love how versatile it s made my favorite camera!!! 
20235 Item delivered on time and as described. 
20236 very good for watching baby room meanwhile we are away from home 
20237 It works well on lens and glass cleaning. 
20238 works very well 
20239 Battery on the gopro sucks so I had to buy this thing. 
20240 One battery worked, the other looked like it was charging, but never held a charge. If you can find OEM replacements, go with them if possible. 
20241 This thing is great 
20242 It is well made and sturdy. The zippers work well and does not snag. It exceeded my expectations. However, once a DSLR camera and the extra lens is in there, it gets quite bulky. 
20243 In love with my new camera! For the camera, the batteries, the pouch, AND the film, it was such a great price. Worked just like how I expected it would 
20244 Bought as a present for our son and his wife who moved over to USA with pet poodles, allows us to have a look at what they re up to anytime in perfect picture quality and sound. Can even talk to them if we wanted to. 
20245 This little cam is awesome! It is packed with features. And it works very well. I have compared it to a few different gopro and I will say that it s comparable on several levels! And only a fraction of the cost!! 
20246 very good combo 
20247 Great price for TWO batteries and a charger! The charger can be used in a standard US outlet or European outlet (with adapter). The car charger cord is a great addition! 
20248 We love it! 
20249 Very nice quality for the price! I was surprised at how nice it was! 
20250 A+ 
20251 It is pretty large and noticeable when mounted. It works well, easy to assemble and mount. Wish the angle was wider but for the most part it s a good item. 
20252 Came as advertised. Works perfect with my hero4 silver. 
20253 camera shots are not as clear as id expected 
20254 good deal! 
20255 Great 
20256 THIS WAS A VERY VERY GOOD + GREAT BUY!! I WAS SOOO RELIEVED TO SEE THIS AVAILABLE BECAUSE I RECENTLY THREW A BIG GRADUATION PARTY, AND HAD A DIY PHOTOBOOTH SET-UP, SO I REALLY REALLY NEEDED THIS FILM TO WORK, AND IT ALL TURNED OUT BEAUTIFULLY!! WAS A COMPLETE HIT!!! 
20257 Excelent and original product!!!. Matches perfectly in the LCD of my Alpha 77 II at the first application on it!... Five Stars!!!! 
20258 Lens fogged over after first rain. Get what you pay for !!!! Dont buy used !!!!! 
20259 Thank you very much. My lens filter arrived quickly and I m quite satisfied. 
20260 This is a great camera for those wanting more than just a mobile device snapshot. 
20261 good stuff 
20262 The strap is comfortable but the way it attaches to the camera did not seem secure to me. I wound up sewing it to make sure it did not become unattached. Still a good value though. 
20263 Smooth Transaction! Excellent Product!! A+++ 
20264 As advertised and they even put a signed letter in there thanking us for our purchase. Very classy and great customer service. Highly recommend!!! 
20265 Great product, very useful. Does not flote. 
20266 I really enjoy it! 
20267 Works and fits perfectly for my camera. Fast delivery! 
20268 Wonderful. Nikon D610w50mm + Two extra lens + Battery Charger + Remote + small flashlight + phone + u see it is quite versatile. 
20269 great 
20270 Worked well right out of the box 
20271 Product appears well made. I will be performing accuracy test on the product for proper alignment of laser during culmination. I will update review to five stars if test proves positive. Good package and shipped quickly. Thanks VITE has been working as it should. Very nice product. 
20272 We purchased this as a back up for our camera and choose the Canon as that is what our camera called for also we read some reviews for the knock offs which may not serve as well. 
20273 workds great thats why i got 4 
20274 PERFECT. this lil guy is awesome. i didnt need/want anything fancy....just needed something to hold up my camera that didnt cost $40+! 
20275 These work real well as you can use any wire for your security cameras with this set. 
20276 A few of the items are not the same as in the picture. Very cheap versions of the extra items ( flash, card holder, tripod, etc.) 
20277 So happy with this battery charger. It works well, I have already used it. I will continue to buy from you. 
20278 Great product. Great price. Quick delivery. Thanks. 
20279 Excellent 
20280 Really nice 
20281 It is a bit different from my other canons but I have learned that each time I get a new one I have to reteach myself but this one was fairly easy to pick up. 
20282 This monopod supports my heave lens and camera without any problem I also use the Sirui Aluminium Tilt Head L-10. 
20283 Works great! Good amount of accessories for the price. Green light when done. 
20284 Great camera, very good speed, overall quality and performance. I can t stop taking pics!. 
20285 Great camera. Use it to check on my dogs and it really works very well. Very easy to install. 
20286 I tried the camera 1 time so far. It has a clear picture and love it. Good buy and quality. 
20287 Great value for money. From a bit of a distance, you really can t tell they are fake. 
20288 Really great product and at an exceptional price. 
20289 Good quality, lightweight, and easy to adjust. 
20290 exactly what I was looking for and works great! 
20291 Great value 
20292 Great Quality - we recommend this item! 
20293 good 
20294 best 
20295 Great walking around lens. I also use it at work to shoot any product that doesn t require macro. 
20296 Compact and provides great protection. 
20297 this is one of my customers favorite backgrounds, it looks so real. I have used it often. 
20298 good quality product for the price, the case is very resistant and does great the job, about the quality of the images shot with it, a think is like 90%. lens are synthetic so, you will imagine. fit perfectly in 58mm mount. 
20299 Even nicer features than my DJI Phantom 2 Vision. Excellent delivery time and packaging from supplier. Truly “beyond expectations.&#34; 
20300 easy to use and works correctly 
20301 Great Camera! 
20302 Love this lens. Sharpest glass I ever owned. 
20303 My Sony was a bit small for it but it still worked great for white water rafting. Hope to use it in future travels. 
20304 Perfect 
20305 This filter does what it says...protects without introducing distortion. 
20306 The zipper gets jammed easy but it does it s job decently well 
20307 Nice unit worked very well 
20308 This has helped keep my SD cards safe and organized! I am very pleased with this purchase. 
20309 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
20310 WOW, a lot of light for a little money... 
20311 awesome! 
20312 Got my camera quickly and set it up in less than 5 minutes! Works perfectly. 
20313 They work awesome but you can go to any hardware store and spend maybe .50 cents on a 1/4 inch screw and have the same product. 
20314 Very nice bag. Structured and holds everything I needed. Now a limited number remaining, so glad I found one on Amazon. 
20315 This worked perfectly for my nikon D3100. Love all the filters and especially the macro accessory kit. 
20316 Very good item to purchase at the time of buying a drone. 
20317 the Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7DMKII was received in it orginal quality package. The grip was easy to install and use.allows me to take many photos than with the use of one battery, i recommend this Vivitar BG-E16 Battery Grip for Canon EOS 7D... to others 
20318 This is more camera than I ve ever had. I m still learning how to use it, but the auto mode has gotten me started rather easily. 
20319 Love it, my second one,- does all I need and for the price , one cannot beat it. Newer ones by all manufac have more bells and whistles, all depends what you need and want. AHK 
20320 works well! just what I needed for my Canon 
20321 Did the job. Only thing I d get alongside is some lights. Get some really strong lights, since some small desk lamps just didn t cut it. Otherwise, it s great for beginners who are trying to get into photography. 
20322 Holds a Nikon 650 with a 18-200 telephoto lens. Has a hard bottom that protects everything well. Like it and have used several different bags for camera & lens only. 
20323 I wasn t that pleased with this used camera. My camera (same as above) printed much better pictures until I dropped it. This one every pic is blurry and there is a rainbow that shows up and you have to wait until it clears to take a pic. 
20324 It breaks very easy. 
20325 (-: 
20326 It takes great pictures and video. I am impressed. 
20327 ok 
20328 My 8 year old loves this but the camera was broken (wires were not properly attached). 
20329 Great bag i love it 
20330 TALL...for someone that is 6 foot + tall this is a nice tripod so you don t have to bend as much. Only thing it doesn t have is spikes in the feet if it had those this would be perfect. Smooth operation and easy adjustments. 
20331 this is a fake SJcam but it still works. i was surprised when the wifi actually worked but you have to read instructions to figure out how to use it and for the pin. camera does not do well with fast moving shots but besides that its great. 
20332 Bought these for my wife for travel. She bought me a set a few years ago, really like them, powerful, lightweight, easy to pack. 
20333 Great case! Perfect as a carry-on when flying. 
20334 Returned due to inability to steer correctly. Also, it was used when we received it. 
20335 Exactly as described 
20336 The product was absolutely exactly as described and met or exceeded all expectations. 
20337 Works as expected. After many wild trips to patagonia, my case is doing very well keeping my camera dry and clean. 
20338 Better than expected and better than OEM. 
20339 Highly Recommended! 
20340 Best value package available! 
20341 My best buy last time. 
20342 Fits my EOS camera well and screws firmly into the AstroTech 2&#34; Field Flattener I m using it with. It has a firm lockup and positive release, both of which are great features to have in the dark while using the camera on a telescope. 
20343 You want a great quality camera that s fun to play with... This is it. Best quality and so much fun to play with 
20344 This is quite a good deal on items you want to have on hand if you buy a Canon Powershot camera! Excellent service, great delivery, very good mix of accessory products. 
20345 I am very pleased with this bag. High quality bag. 
20346 Works perfect, especially for $5. 
20347 Excellent! I thought I d never be able to use my portable picture maker again until I found this! Thank you!!!!! 
20348 Great deal. You just cannot have enough batteries or chargers for your electronics. 
20349 Perfect. 
20350 Very nice lens. 
20351 WOW, took 3 weeks to receive, then when I get it it is not even the same product.... everything is in Chinese. DO NOT BUY! 
20352 Great Lens for my Real Estate Business! 
20353 Bought this to have an extra one for my kit lens when I want to detach both lenses from the body for storage. 
20354 I love, I have had it for some time now and I have no issues with it. 
20355 great charger 
20356 I RECENTLY BOUGHT THIS SAME ONE AND LIKED IT SO MUCH I BOUGHT ANOTHER ONE! 
20357 This is decent, alittle too thick on the padding. but over all was descent. 
20358 Great stuff but pretty pricey. 
20359 great camera 
20360 Replacing the exact set and don t recall them being so right to start. Hopefully break in well. Soles on my old ones just starting to wear after two years of wearing 3-7 days a week. Top side worn as you d expect from heavy use. 
20361 Not much to say here. It worked and did not lose my GoPro. 
20362 great 
20363 Very sturdy. Met my expectations. 
20364 Worked just fine. Thanks 
20365 If im paying $1200 for a drone and it is supposed to be the best on the market i should have to deal with b.s. of having to update it. It should be ready to go right away 
20366 It is very good pic quality even at night. I am waiting to buy one more if price can be a little lower. 
20367 Best 
20368 Couldn t be happier with these! Can t beat it for the price! Works every time and haven t had an issue with it! 
20369 Does not fit the d750. The top piece needs to be much larger and it is not protecting it all the way. Do not buy this for the Nikon d750 
20370 Stick paper on back is terrible. Unit falls off! I ordered two of these and what a mistake that was. Also not that sensitive. I would not but this again. 
20371 Although delivery and packaging were perfectly fine, and apparently there are no scratches outside the case, inside my &#34;Brand New&#34; Pelican 1510 Case has a terrible, terrible cigarette smoke smell! The foam inside smells like complete smoke. I wonder if this is actually brand new. 
20372 not as advertised 
20373 Bought 3 units and they all are working great hope to buy more in the future. 
20374 It s alright. 
20375 the best night and day 
20376 Good 
20377 Works as expected 
20378 nice 
20379 I got this camera for the huge optical zoom feature. However, part way through a vacation in Europe, the camera locked up and stopped working. It is locked in the open position, but won t turn off, on or reset. Bad time to break. 
20380 They told me it would work for GoPro Hero 1 and it doesn t, very dissaponting! 
20381 This wired remote shutter release works very well and can be locked on for long &#34;bulb&#34; exposures. 
20382 So far photos are good, but it has a long delay in turning the screen on. That can be annoying when you miss shots while waiting for the screen to turn on. 
20383 The outdoor connection cable and camera wire need to be cover by duck tape. It is burned when wet. Mine one camera out of 4 was burned. I don t know if I can get a warranty to replace it or not. 
20384 Has very slow shutter speed 
20385 Very easy to set up, and I am able to watch my baby while im at work and she is at home with our Nanny. 
20386 Works well. 
20387 I ve tried several cases and this is the easiest to grab the camera. No more struggling to get the camera out of the bag. 
20388 This works really well ask a baby cam. We can now monitor our 5 months old even if we are in a different room. Great quality at a good price. We purchased it at a different store. 
20389 Excellent design and very comfortable to wear. Good selection and supply of dividers included. Very versatile. well shaped, etc. Can really make great use of the interior space. Superb value. 
20390 Excellent pair of binoculars. Light and compact - my wife has used them for the Muny Opera here In St. Louis and is thrilled with the results ! 
20391 Great Camera s 
20392 What can I say. It works. 
20393 Awesome kit! It was exactly like the discription, very fast shipping and great quality !!! 
20394 Does the job, nothing fancy. I realized too late that I should have bought the one with the remote, but that s no fault of this device. 
20395 great 
20396 Well made, attractive and adds a convenient handle rib to the front. Only negative is it adds to the height of the camera. 
20397 Very good！ 
20398 Perfect! 
20399 I bought this and immediately returned it. The head is made out of plastic and does not sit level when horizontal. 
20400 Great camera for the money 
20401 Hands down the best flash I have ever owned, although I wish I had waited and bought the model that has the built-in radio. Still works great with my wireless triggers. 
20402 Very bad 
20403 Spare battery for my cannon camera. It works just as good as my original 
20404 I had a little trouble with getting it to work with my LifeProof case for my phone at first. I tried it a second time and it works great. No complaints! 
20405 really nice works better than the battery that came with it 
20406 Pease of crap 
20407 Worth the price 
20408 Great products and price for a beginner like myself! 
20409 Great replacement battery 
20410 Great product 
20411 Came in scratched/chipped and clip broke immediately. Video is ok sound is horrible. I use it as a dash cam. So sound wasn t important. Kept it because it as cheap. 
20412 Shall i say more....it s an oem battery and it surpasses all imitators. Good price here on AMAZON 
20413 Works great. Have yet to field test them 
20414 great price and fit and quality 
20415 Clear view, not happy about case 
20416 Broke almost immediately after being delivered to may home. 
20417 It came without the base that attaches to the belt. 
20418 Most pictures came out blurry. My old 16.1 mp camera was much better. All this camera did was prove to me that there is more to pictures than megapixels. Videos came out fine though. 
20419 Pictures come out clear and quality of product is good! 
20420 Great product, great price 
20421 Good buy 
20422 Its very easy to work, its just what I needed! 
20423 Is works fine 
20424 Great fun. Had to re-bind the wifi so it worked but after that, awesome photos and videos 
20425 Nice an useful 
20426 Love this lens! 
20427 Well worth what I paid for it and it was so easy to set up! I ll be getting a few more. May 2016, NOT anymore...they updated and now both my cameras always say offline and will not connect. 
20428 Good product, good price. I like the rapid charger, it takes less time than charging on the computer and having the 3 back up batteries comes in handy. 
20429 Perfect for what I was needing to hold my Video camera while riding. 
20430 Great buy!!! 
20431 I like it 
20432 i totally loved this lens..but it only lasted about 3 years..then the focus element stopped working..:/ so i sold it to someone that was willing to have it fixed..it was too expensive for me..so i don´t have it anymore..someone else is loving it now..:) 
20433 Great case for my new camera and accessories. Plenty of room and easy to organize. 
20434 Great camera, easy to set up. 
20435 Very disappointed. These glasses would not hold a charge. 
20436 Perfect. 
20437 Good. 
20438 This light weight tripod is exactly what I was looking for. I record presentations using an iPod Touch, and this tripod is small enough to pack, tall enough to see over people s heads and strong enough to handle the weight of the device. 
20439 Cheap quality 
20440 A great camera. It s going to take me a while to learn how to use it properly but I m very pleased with it. 
20441 Good buy. 
20442 great battery 
20443 The camera s sensitivity is amazing since I can see even with dim lighting. 
20444 Tried it on a Nikon D3300 and it washed everything out and had a very strong flash even on the lowest setting. Its a nice idea for a flash, but didn t work for me. 
20445 I took about 300 pictures during the first half of my trip to Norway just fine. The next time I turned on the camera one third of the screen had black bars across. I have had the camera less than one week. I am not impressed. 
20446 Works, fits my nex. 
20447 I have long used Nikon but thought i would try Canon. I am not happy with the quality of my pics. I will be switching back and selling this one. 
20448 Just got it today, initial testings looks positive, will update after the filed test. 
20449 Excellent product! Great deal. 
20450 Great product 
20451 No zoom feature. Otherwise works well 
20452 Charder for my battery just fine. The materials that the charger are made from don t seem to be the best quality but it works just fine. It charges quickly and easy to store with it s size. 
20453 Good ítem!! Thanx 
20454 Very great camera for the price! Would recomend to anyone. 
20455 Oh my god,twice as cheap as the Canon type and oh so good. If this is what you need stop now and buy,buy,buy. 
20456 Yes it was in very good condition. Thanks 
20457 Love the lens. Works.just as expected

20459 good 
20460 Great camera 
20461 I mostly love this camera; however, I always have difficulties transferring the files to the computer. The USB doesn t work and the wi fi works most of the time but is very slow and skips files sometimes. 
20462 excellent item, solved my problem 
20463 Very goos 
20464 I m New to dslr photography, these lenses & case appears good quality and fair price. Always look to this seller first for my needs. 
20465 Very good 
20466 Great set!! Everything fits into the bag and easy to use! The lights are wonderful and take great pics! 
20467 Love this camera. It s a bit of a dinosaur, but the lens is top notch quality and has a huge zoom capacity. Easy to use. 
20468 Excelente 
20469 Great Buy ! 
20470 love it 
20471 Overall good product. However, the speed disconnect is wobbly when attached and the knob to turn the mounting screw quickly broke. These issues did not address the functionality too much. 
20472 Thes are a bigger than expected size and I love them! They do not smudge or smear on your lense. Clean and scratch free. 
20473 Stand is cheaply made only used it a couple times and one of the pins came out of the leg. I have it rigged for now. Spend a little more for a better quality product. 
20474 Lightweight and compact design with great power. Well done. 
20475 Great product!! 
20476 happy 
20477 This product works as expected and is well built. 
20478 Used camera on a trip to Canada. Wonderful films! 
20479 works great ... I actually purchased yet another so can adapt (through modification) old Bay 60 filters to my prime nikon lens that I use for scenics. Good price for what you get. 
20480 clasp and handle are cheesy, ready to fall off 
20481 Ohh man! Missing parts in the first fly! 1 in 4 motors stop working! I have to buy the new replacement! The camera no good at all, it s too slow and too dark, need upgrades to 12.Mb 
20482 Doesn t work! It was advertise that it will work with Samsung Google Nexus and it doesn t! 
20483 It works very well. There is even an extra battery that I didn t expect. 
20484 I have so many old slides from the early nineties that I am able to view with ease now. The back light on this Medalight viewer is nice and bright!!! 
20485 Works as advertised. 
20486 This product is awesome! I use this to clamp onto the side of an L bracket on my D750. It gives me another hot shoe adapter for a profoto B1 trigger so I can use off camera lighting alongside a speedlight flash. It is built solid and feels reliable. 
20487 Awesome! Works perfectly. High quality, sturdy. 
20488 It was broken when it arrived. 
20489 I love this tripod I used it for all my recordings and photo shoot ♥ 
20490 Seems good quality & worked for me. Good price. 
20491 No reason not to love it, simple enough! 
20492 Very Well Satisfied with my purchase. 
20493 amazing bag. Fits all my drone gear plus my a7s and 3 lenses and atomos shogun, all batteries.. goddang this is a good bag.. EVERYTHING! audio equipment too 
20494 Excellent so far 
20495 Excellent 
20496 Good camera for the price 
20497 PERFECT for quadrotor video recording paired with FPV. My gopros are a bit too heavy to put on my 250 racer, so this was a no brainer. Quality is on par with my hero 2 and hero3 silver. Size and weight is great and the quality is awesome too. 
20498 Sweet price for a bunch of handy power adapters! 
20499 I love this case. Hold my digital camera and extra batteries in a well-protected bag. 
20500 Will only support a small compact camera. 
20501 Holy moley this camera is a champ!!! Its so clear!! So many features; especially manually! Makes me seem like a pro :). 
20502 We use it to clean lenses that we rent. Its easy to use and has enough &#34;air power&#34; to remove normal debris. 
20503 Crappy video Quality. The 720 statement while technically true makes it sound like it can record HD video. However, the video and picture quality isn t even as good as standard definition 480i tv. 
20504 Great, met all of my expectations 
20505 Hi. Quick delivery. Product conforms. Thanks 
20506 Good product! 
20507 I was surprised at the quality of this - I ve had it on my camera for 2.5 years now and it s still holding up like a champ! 
20508 Great deal for backup and replacement batteries. 
20509 Would not hold a charge returned it Love Amazon they took care of me 
20510 Perfect for all my pictures 
20511 I love it, excellent bubble free screen protector, if you follow the instruction you can apply it in proper place- no hassle, delivery was before time, very good service. 
20512 Good camera but no alerts to my phone at work, sent back and got another that did more the Wi-Fi. 
20513 Super good and best part of this item the price 
20514 To expensive 
20515 They did not meet my expectations. They are not really what I would call microfiber, they are not as soft. 
20516 great case 
20517 A fine lens for a good price, well done Adorama. 
20518 Great product for the price point.. they give off a nice natural light and can be changed many heights and directions. Quite pleased. 
20519 takes great pictures but flash is cheaply made 
20520 Filter performed as expected. I m quite happy with it. 
20521 The battery leaked and the camera spoils. 
20522 Good Communication, very nice product, Item as described A+++ Seller 
20523 If you don t have steady hands or can t just pull a piece off to look at then this ain t for you. 
20524 I will order them again when needed. 
20525 great value and excellent product 
20526 these make an incredibly loud cheap sound, making it obvious that they are fake. 
20527 Loved it for the time I had it, became obsolete when the IPhone showed up, but worked well! 
20528 Pretty good looking and nicely made case! 
20529 its ok. ive had better 
20530 these blocks are so cute. the price is great. i didn t want blocks that looked too childish, as i knew i would be using them for years 
20531 For true color, quick setup, portability, must have for professionals. 
20532 Frame worked great. It held our GoPro on our car from NJ to FL! 
20533 Perfect fit and as good as the Canon version. 
20534 Works great! Awesome pricing! 
20535 Used this in the field with good results. 
20536 Works as expected 
20537 works as it should 
20538 Works well and doesn t interfere with controls 
20539 The latest model of Zhiyun,it seems great! I d like to try it! 
20540 Great kit and camera. I only wish it came with a floating handle for taking in the water. If you drop it, that type of handle actually floats with the camera. If they would add that handle to this kit.....it would be perfect! 
20541 Works just fine. I won t say it shoots every time, but it s pretty consistent. 
20542 Pudiera ser mejor. 
20543 Gift for my Father-in-law, he was very pleased. 
20544 Exactly as described, arrived promptly, well packed. New batteries have significantly greater run life than original equipment. Charger works well with the benefit of car adapter and european plug adapter as bonuses. 
20545 Beautiful Picture Quality. Decent stock lens. Highly recommend picking up additional lenses. 
20546 Love! Great underwater and above water pictures! 
20547 I love the case. I am glad that I can finally protect my camera. It s really a cute looking case. 
20548 Hard to use and focus. 
20549 I m using this adapter to mount my DJI Ronin base-plate. It s not a perfect fit, in that the safety mechanism doesn t function correctly, but it slides in and locks down tight. Nice budget option. 
20550 Worked fine 
20551 Great, just what we needed 
20552 Cool!!! Love it! 
20553 Good 
20554 Perfect fit on Hero 4 and good quality. 
20555 Works great on glass. Has some trouble sticking to other car surfaces. 
20556 Overall the product was exactly as described. The directions/manual that it came with, however was not very helpful. 
20557 Helped get pictures off of a discarded phone. 
20558 Had everything I wanted and more very pleased 
20559 It needs a bit of some flex for the screw to tighten down the camera to where it won t move. Other than that, it is built well and is heavy duty. 
20560 LOVE IT 
20561 Compared to the original one, it seems weaker. 
20562 This tripod is great ! Nice and sterdy amd I can count on it for anything. 
20563 Super portable and great image quality - awesome for hiking! 
20564 no complaints 
20565 Everything was great! 
20566 nice design, this would not fall off the camera as other s have, but I m sending it back because I d have to take it off for wide angle shots because you can see a portion of the hood in the shot 
20567 +1000 
20568 Did not as described or pictured. Does not come with bnc-bnc connectors. Comes with bnc-male rca. 
20569 It is the best microfiber lens leaner I ever used in the past 10 years. 
20570 I cannot give an accurate description of how well this device works. In the product details it clearly states that it works for the Nikon d750, which the MC-36B is supposed to, however the unit that arrived is the MC-DC2 for Nikon D90/3100/7000/5200/5100 
20571 Was good while it lasted, but not very durable 
20572 GOOD PRODUCT 
20573 works great, a little different than normal, but not a bad thing, very happy with shoulder strap 
20574 Fast shipping, easy installation and inexpensive. We installed them in every window in our house. It makes enough noise for unexpected guest. 
20575 Works like a charm 
20576 good quality 
20577 Camera works like it should, the only think I didn t like was that the app for foscam are not to good 
20578 It is what it is , great material great price 
20579 Price was right. As a backup battery we will see how it performs in the future 
20580 Siren cannot be heard @10 away Replaced batteries 3 different new ones two different brands three different packages 
20581 My teenage daughter loves this! 
20582 Perfectly designed for it s purpose with superbly quality. Works great with Desmond DBC-01 RC2 Compatible Clamp. 
20583 Not get to what I expected 
20584 Awesome. Very clear and work very very good at night. I put one on the front porch and there is no, I mean no light out there, it s still clear as a bell. I love them and would recommend them to my friends. 
20585 At last this is what my Gopro3 was missing a good lasting battery that doesn t drain by itself 
20586 I love these old style cameras and although the video quality is not great, I just like the style. 
20587 Price for this type of item 
20588 Fit my canon camera just fine and has plenty of strength for being quite a small chord. 
20589 They work so well I now have 4. No nonsense triggers. 
20590 Vincent did an excellent job setting up this camera. It seems a complicated procedure, but he zipped right through. I have not had a chance to try the cam out yet, but I was happy with the installation process. 
20591 Perfect 
20592 perfect 
20593 Haven t used these yet, but the first set of 50 were great. Grandkids had a ball taking pictures 
20594 Worked like a charm! I did not have to buy a special camera, just used an old one! 
20595 Very good 
20596 Needed for Santa pictures - worked out great. 
20597 Item came quickly and as described. Bought this 5 weeks ago. Straps are holding up well. 
20598 I could not give 5 stars, because the screwing mechanism was lose, and basically the upper and lower halves of the pen did not remain attached. But the camera worked. 
20599 Great deal! Great delivery time! Thank you! 
20600 Feels fake but it works well 
20601 excellent 
20602 Great for price but definitely not high quality material. It does what it s meant to do. 
20603 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
20604 Perfect size for my GoPro. Now I want other sizes. 
20605 Pain in the butt to hook into your wireless, useless if you re trying to see outside at night in front of a window. OK for interior use only! The mobile phone app is junk and always kicks out on you. 
20606 Not an infrared filter - it is basically a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter. 
20607 Did not like this product at all. I thought maybe the camear was damaged so I reordered needless to say, I was unable to that to work. 
20608 Works well and value for money. 
20609 camera was not reliable and just not to be trusted. i could be standing in room, jumping and moving around for several minutes and it would show me still sitting on couch from 10 minutes previous and act like everything was great. not great! sorry, but just not reliable. 
20610 so far so good 
20611 Buen producto ! 
20612 Seems to work fine. Great price 
20613 Fully compatible. Works great. 
20614 great product and is great at the price goes every where with him. 
20615 Works fine and doesn t wear down too fast. 
20616 Don t waste your money! 
20617 HORRIBLE TOOK TO GERMANY PICTURES CAME OUT HORRIBLE 
20618 Good 
20619 Great Product 
20620 batterys fit to tight in charger slot that makes them very hard to get in or out. 
20621 excellent product. 
20622 Worked great as replacement for old contacts 
20623 Everything came right away, I have used the head mount, floating handle, suction cup mount and the handle bar mount. It s all worked great so far, but right when I took the tripod out, one of the legs broke off and it seems really flimsy 
20624 These transmitters and receivers work perfectly on my Nikon D810 
20625 This is a decent scope, especially for the money. However, I upgraded tot he Celestron Regal 100mm and it is considerably more clear at all magnifications. If you have the coin, skip this one, and go for the upgrade model. 
20626 Camera arrived quickly and meets all my expectations. 
20627 ok for beginner video 
20628 Great semi-professional lens, especially for the price. Very fast focus. I use it on a D5200. 
20629 Yet again I have had to replace my lens cap after it has falled off the lens and been lost, but this time they have changed the design. I believe that the cap design is better - it appears to have a tighter grip on the lens. Time will tell!! 
20630 Film keeps getting stuck in back on my camera and wont print out photos. help? Very disappointed on the waste of money. 
20631 Worked perfect for my Cannon sx280 hs 
20632 Takes a llooonng time to find the right adjustment for your camera, and the product alone is quite heavy. My arms start hurting after only 15min of straight use. 
20633 We think it works great and brings things in much closer. 
20634 very disappointed very cheaply made will not work on my pc works on my dads pc hard to focus very light weight and unstable seller sent me the 200x not the 300x I ordered 
20635 It does not hold the charge as well as my original canon batteries, which are quite old. 
20636 Excellent filter. Better than my previous filters which scratched up easily. 
20637 This battery is not compatible with Polaroid t730. I am not planning to buy another battery, as I thought this brand would have been compatible compared to the other, also purchased from Amazon. 
20638 Works great! 
20639 This is a great option to protect my lens and to filter the uv rays. This is exactly what I expected and it is a great value compared to similar lens filters. 
20640 Great little charger. 
20641 I have had this camera for about a year now and it quit working. It would get moisture in it and wouldn t turn on when I wanted it to. I wasn t very impressed with it. 
20642 It is great cable wire but not what we needed at the time but, we did find another use for it by changing out the connector ends. Thank you once again Amazon for such quick delivery. 
20643 Great product 
20644 Great lens 
20645 Got this as a gift for my sil...amazing quality camera for the price! 
20646 These do NOT fit the Sony NEX-3NL camera. Otherwise they seem like nice lenses 
20647 Worked Great for about 2 weeks, not wont go up past about 1/3 of the way. If I reset and move the camera up my self a few times it works for a day then quits again. =( Really liked this camera too. 
20648 Product was as advertised. 
20649 Love it. If the package could include a gopro locking screw that would be perfect. 
20650 No complaints! 
20651 Great camera and customer service. 
20652 GREAT PRODUCT FOR BEGINERS! 
20653 very good 
20654 AAAAA+++++ 
20655 Brandon in technical support was great, he was able to install the camera in minutes and was very polite and helpful. Now the camera works with no problems. 
20656 Great professional camera! It was great experience. It included everything that you need to do perfect pictures. Delivery was in time, everything was great. 
20657 perfect size and very light, will love it on upcoming vacation. My Nikon P600 is perfect size in this bag with room for extra batteries and cards. Thank you. 
20658 Pretty easy to use, not sure how or if it can be used without Wi-fi as in can be used cellular and it s pretty slow to move the camera via wi-fi but it s pretty cool and cheap. 
20659 Just needed it and arrived on ti,e good quality. 
20660 The USB wire doesnt fit well the charger the battery doesnt charge, bad experience see picture, part of the USB stays out of the charger i dont know if thisbis normal but it doesnt work 
20661 Dead on arrival. Tried it with multiple flashes, fresh new batteries, and then a different set of fresh new batteries. Requested a replacement or refund from Yongnuo and they refused (so much for standing behind a warranty). Risky purchase, poor customer service. You ve been warned. 
20662 Just what I needed and it got to me so fast I swear I blinked and bam I had it. Great battery and price. Do not waste your time shopping around, here it is and at the click of a button it is yours and in your hands fast! 
20663 Worked from June to February and then because it is not waterproof, it rusted where the batteries are and quit working. 
20664 worked fine 
20665 This is the nicest bag - fit my Nikon and 2 large lenses plus batteries and charger. It looks beautiful and feels like my purse ( it also fits all of my purse stuff). Earth tone colors - perfect for me. 
20666 Loving it :) 
20667 I think this item is very durable and the price is also reasonable. However, the reach of the mount is a little short because it consists of two separated sticks, not three sticks. Anyway, it was useful for my diving. 
20668 Excellent service and product. I received my product timely and the item works well. 
20669 unfortunately the remote does NOT work, the right button is so low set that you cannot access it and the left hand button works only occasionally. I need to return this item, so please send return mailing label. 
20670 Even tightened all of the way down, the arms still move around. The result is a shaky video, and unreliable angles as the mount is move around (mounted on my motorcycle). I would look for a different brand. 
20671 Best point and shoot I have ever encountered! Pictures look as good as my Nikon DSLR 3100. More settings than I will ever need, but there if I want them. If you are on the fence about this camera just go ahead and get one before they run out. 
20672 It is inexpensive and works great..... what more can you ask from a light diffuser? 
20673 Not very well made. ....same thing with this pen. I have no more ink and have no way or replacing it....thanks seller. 
20674 These fit decently, but you can tell that they are not perfect. Don t quite &#34;click&#34; on the way they should and when the two won t screw together (bad sign). 
20675 Makes the slides gook great. 
20676 Nice little camera. Bought it to take basic vacation pics. Got a water proof case as well and took pics with it underwater. 
20677 I mean, what can you say? It is inexpensive and it works. Arrived when it should have. 
20678 Perfect little bag for on the go!!! 
20679 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
20680 These might be nice binoculars for viewing the stars, but they are terrible for viewing Dolphins from our patio. I guess the Dolphins are just too fast. 
20681 Good product but arrived without instructions 
20682 Don t tweak it too hard or the joints pop out. Can be snapped back but annoying. 
20683 Perfect fit for my 5 gal. bottles. Nice and tight. 
20684 great 
20685 very sturdy, works on uneven ground 
20686 battery works great with my camera 
20687 Amazing product!! 
20688 Everything arrived ok! Great product. 
20689 Awesome mounts 
20690 Great price!! 
20691 working very good 
20692 Almost no ghosts or anything. Cleans with ease by breathing and wiping with a microfiber cloth. Hoya HDs are the best. 
20693 Nice lightweight & adjustable! Very, very, very bright ont he highest setting. This will also take AA batteries or other various camera batteries. Includes the shoe/tipod mount. Very happy with the product. 
20694 In possible to navigate to set it up 
20695 Nice size and works as intended. Light weight so I always have it in my camera bag. Of the times I didn t bring it, I regret it. 
20696 Have you read setup instructions for wireless camera? OMG -- IP configuration required ..... give me a break it s 2015. Sending box back today! 
20697 Good, cheap insurance.... 
20698 Smallervthan I thought, but it works. 
20699 excellent 
20700 No words to explain how much I like it. 
20701 Very clear and good resolution. Does very close up pics. Color is accurate. 
20702 Solid construction and smart design. A great mono pod for a decent price. 
20703 They did a good job, film is of good quality. I would recommend this company to friends. 
20704 Acts funny in my camera, like it s not sure if this is an OE battery. holds a charge as I would expect. 
20705 This is a good quality versatile mount that arrives in nice packaging. Good value overall and works well 
20706 Fast delivery and as described, thanks. 
20707 Great product 
20708 I have 2 sj4000 knock off. The picture is great but the sound really sucks. But i use it on a quadcopter, so i don t need good sound. If you are going to record sounds don t bother buying this thing. 
20709 Very sturdy and light. A good fit. 
20710 Doesn t work how I expected. The night shoot is mainly why I purchased this camera and it works horribly. It was not checked before sold because it still had the last owners person pictures and video. The sound quality is also awful. 
20711 great 
20712 Delivered on time and as per description 
20713 Great camera for the price. We take it on vacation so we don t have to use our phones. 
20714 Does Not do what instructions say it does. Have not being able to set the motion detection. 
20715 No comments 
20716 Perfect for my needs. I am not a professional but take lots of pictures for friends and family. 
20717 Sturdy 
20718 I really love these styles that they come in and instead of having plain white pictures spice it up with these border stickers! 
20719 Happy with the shipping, the product and the price. Highly recommend! 
20720 Perfect gift for collecting memories. Good Value and Quality 
20721 Nice telescope. Setup was pretty simple. The star alignment process required some time to get it right but all in all we like the telescope and good for us novice. 
20722 Great and really works. 
20723 The battery worked out great. I purchased the battery as a spare for my lecia v-lux 4 which is the same as the Leica battery at half the price with the same specs. 
20724 The instructions are impossible to follow. When you call Tech Support, you they re angry and condescending. In the end, they can t help you and your stuck with a very expensive piece of crap. 
20725 I ve had my Hello Kitty camper for about a month or so and I LOVE IT!!! I recieved it fast and it was just prefect!!! 
20726 This is a perfect product what I am searching. Its awesome product and very easy to use. Don t miss like this product and its very cheap cost they are offering. Its looking very nice and very easy to handle with remarkable comfort. 
20727 On time and as described. Fits perfectly 
20728 I cannot off load any images what a waste of money 
20729 Really relieves the pressure around my neck on long wedding days carrying a heavy body and lens. 
20730 Well made cap. Lost mine during a basketball game and I am very happy that this cap looked and felt like the original cap. 
20731 Works perfectly, charges in Canon charger. Fast delivery. The only reason I didn t give 5 stars is that I don t know how long the battery will last, other than that don t hesitate to buy 
20732 It needs to be charged too much. 
20733 Good case but not as convenient as I thought it would be. 
20734 Doesn t fit newer hero s 
20735 not smooth! 
20736 Just ok 
20737 Great experience 
20738 Product is great for the price. it arrived quickly and suction cup adheres to the windshield very securely. The plastic screw mount is a bit flimsy when tightening the screw thread to camera but does the job for my small action camera. 
20739 Absolutely fantastic. 
20740 Does what it says on the tin. Offers better grip and good protection for the camera. 
20741 Nice!!! Much sturdier than the cheezy tripods often packed with inexpensive photo accessories. The ball mount actually locks tightly! 
20742 sme as gopro 
20743 I was lucky enough to not get a fake battery. Watch out for that. That s all I can really say, it works just like my original T3i battery. 
20744 Got it as a gift for my daughter and she loves it. 
20745 Bought this because of the price and I love it. Exactly what I was looking for to diffuse the onboard flash on my camera. Easy to use and folds up nicely. 
20746 HSS works with Cheetahstand CL-360 
20747 Great buy 
20748 The side screw has no function and I managed to work it with an old threaded rod I found. 
20749 Good service and everything in perfect working conditions 
20750 Light weight but yet sturdy. Fluid head 
20751 Awesome just what I ordered thank you very much works wonderful 
20752 Exactly what I ordered. The cable meets my needs perfectly. Thank you... 
20753 Is very good pictures are great and clear day or night but the back round you hear when the speak is on must be fixed 
20754 Great kit full of useful components 
20755 excellent 
20756 Aperture ring is rough - a so so so product 
20757 Really love these triggers! The best feature in my opinion is the ability to control your flash power on the controller itself. Saves so much time! 
20758 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
20759 Incredibly difficult to use. Minimal directions. Photos either did not display, or displayed upside down. I spent a significant amount of time reformatting photos and rotating them only to have the frame not save any of my work. Not worth the trouble. 
20760 This case is part of the reason why I wanted the Nikon 1. I loved the sleek design and the fact that it protected the camera without making it huge. We were happy that this fit inside my husband s cargo pocket when we were at an amusement park. 
20761 Charged the batteries without a problem, but when I put them into my Nikon D3200, the camera would not accept them as usable. So, they are useless to me. Money down the drain. 
20762 This gives the camera a better overall grip, making it more comfortable to hold and less movement (in my opinion) when pressing the shutter down. It s not a perfect match to the color of the camera but so close, you won t notice unless you re really looking. 
20763 it came 5 or 6 dys early the case is very durable protects camera from many things even knives(I was bored and I m a guy :-P) the camera is great especially for the low price the mounts work and it is definetly waterproof in case 
20764 This battery grip was well worth the money. It holds 2 batteries and works great for various picture positions, without the need to contort your hands. 
20765 great! 
20766 I like this so well I have one for every flash I have (5). 
20767 Im old fashioned! Miss the instructions on paper.... 
20768 The case is great for my compact camera and accessories. 
20769 it work very well and is preciely wha i needed.,good value for the money 
20770 i love it 
20771 My new lens came right away. Due to the hot weather, I haven t been able to use it much, but I m looking forward to enjoying it when the cooler temps get here. Thank you. 
20772 Very easy set up. App has an easy to work with interface. Night mode produces clear visuals. Very little lag within normal lighted visuals. 
20773 pretty good ofr watching birds 
20774 Works well. I bought several sets. monitor both the front and back of house. be careful though once you add a camera to a channel on one monitor it cannot be added to the same channel on another monitor 
20775 I`m pro wadding photographer w. 20 years of experience I just purchased that one to have extra lens in my case and I have exactly same lens made in Japan .... Compare both of them no difference in the quality 
20776 Excellent product 
20777 Good deal. Thannks.. 
20778 great value and excellent product 
20779 Will return to seller. 
20780 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
20781 Would not even lift off once. Bought extra batteries, fully charged them, nothing. Rotors spun but never lifted off. Thanks for ruining a six year olds birthday. 
20782 Not terribly professional except for the company logo embossed on the cheap plastic tie. 
20783 Holds all the accessories for the camera. 
20784 With the kit lens, it fits fine even over the viewfinder. Just don t forget to push in underneath the camera when shooting. 
20785 A+ would order from here again! 
20786 Did not come with a book manual on how to use the camera. My brother had the same camera so he was able to show me the basics but can find the user manual online. Love the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
20787 works fine 
20788 The waterproof feature worked great, but almost all photos on land were blurry. 
20789 Great 
20790 Great camera, easy to install, works great with the app. 
20791 This was terrible, I had it for less than a week and one of the legs wont stay pulled down and one of the legs slides off the top connection bit very easily. You get what you pay for with this product 
20792 Works great and way better priced (like half) than I found in stores anywhere. 
20793 great transaction. Product as described 
20794 Pretty flimsy, doesn t realy provide much support. I wouldn t trust an expensive camera in it 
20795 I love this i no longer have to pocket my lense caps and hope I don t lose them or forget where I put it 
20796 GREAT SELLER PRODUCT WORKED GREAT 
20797 Thank You 
20798 works well 
20799 This monitor is everything in description plus some. I will be purchasing again. 
20800 Very nice glass, highly recommended. 
20801 Don t go flying without it! It s nice to hear the beeping while flying so you know when to come in for a landing. There s nothing like losing power while hundreds of feet in the air! 
20802 Love this product. Such a good product for so little investment. I m Not a professional photographer though. 
20803 Arrival time was as posted, merchandise as promised 
20804 I love this lens. While I am still learning all the ins and outs of using a prime lens, the photos I ve taken with this really jump out ... I m very excited about learning more. 
20805 Such a fun item. Really love flying this drone, best one out there for the money to practice with. Only wish the battery life would last longer, but still a great product!! 
20806 Great filter. Fits perfect. The moon looks amazing. Thank you so much for a great product. 
20807 The lenses and accessories are great. I only wish there were some instructions. 
20808 I am very happy with this purchase. 
20809 Works great as expected. 
20810 Great performance! Love it! 
20811 Purchased as a gift. Super big hit! Fantastic product. 
20812 I couldn t be happier. 
20813 I tested each camera before installing on exterior of my house. 1 Camera had water inside of it and does not work the other three are good. 
20814 Exactly what I was after. Works well 
20815 The stick is not sturdy enough. When at full length, it is hard to handle it and take a proper selfie 
20816 Fine Dvr and cameras. Nice night vision too. Just needs better documentation. 
20817 Didn t work with my Nikon :-( 
20818 danny gave me great tech support and was able to hook up my camera. The camera is clear and easy to use. 
20819 somehow i need to use 3 swab to completely clean my D7000 sensor. Maybe the dirt has settled too long. 
20820 Great product for price. Attached to lens very easy. 
20821 These work great and will fit on any speed light. Good value. 
20822 Works Perfect 
20823 its a cool camera. the control on the dial switch for camera mode, moves on its own while you re shooting and that sucks. otherwise i would have given it a 5 
20824 Does a good job during the day and night 
20825 The extendable Telescopi Handle turns arround with the weight of the Go Pro, its not usefull. Tripod its OK. 
20826 The cameras have excellent clarity. Easy to set up - when I had a small glinch Dlink tech worked with me until it was resolved. DLink has the best customer service. Thank you Allen your were so knowledgeable and patient. AR004639 
20827 My old camera died after around 6 years love this camera for inside the house you can place it almost any place works real nice in low light 
20828 Was delivered on time. Happy with the drone. 
20829 good picture, great price 
20830 it s expensive and if you want to record you must pay monthly. 
20831 Awesome!! Great handheld light wand. Thin and the lights are very bright. 
20832 I was thinking is gonna come with memory card! 
20833 Recording time only lasts about 3 hours 
20834 works. 
20835 This recorder is working great so far , I will keep this updated in a months 
20836 This recharges batteries quickly. I purchased it for a long trip where thousands of photos are likely to be taken. So far there has been no problems. 
20837 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
20838 what I needed igot 
20839 Great quality and value. 
20840 Works really well. Not to difficult to add to the flash. Folds down and fits in my camera bag perfectly 
20841 Batteries arrived on time and were well-packaged. They are a fraction of the price of Canon batteries and do the job. I ll definitely do business with GOJA again. 
20842 Great product, Thanks. 
20843 Sorry for later writing the comments on it, this one is quite goods, it brings lot of fun in my life, I do see lots of nice birds. It s fantasic. 
20844 Works well. 
20845 we lost our camera LOL 
20846 Pin is too big on the door to use. Took to a camera store and they agreed... Can t use it. 
20847 This has worked fine for me for over 4? years. No problems... 
20848 love it 
20849 Heavy device. Needs a good tripod to use this device. Can carry bigger cam or photo camera 
20850 Great product! 
20851 Fitted nicely with my instax mini, but after using it for literally a few mintues the strap broke off. And the color is a lot darker than the picture. 
20852 Got it and setup was easy and it worked immediately. Seems to be a great product so far and I am looking forward to more usage. 
20853 As expected 
20854 Camera was awesome for a Caribbean cruise... Took great underwater pictures. 
20855 It performed as it was supposed to, but I returned because it covered too much of the LCD screen as well as the delete and review buttons on my D7100. Also, once on, difficult to remove! 
20856 It is awesome I would highly recommend this if your gonna shoot a lot of pictures. 
20857 There are many out there that look the same. This isn t the one that you want, can hardly hold a small phone.Waste of money. 
20858 It seems a little stiff, but soft. It smells HORRIBLE right out of the package though. I m just kinda disappointed, but if my opinion changes (when it smells better and loosens up) I ll change my review. 
20859 Pleasantly surprised. Easy to put on - no air bubbles. Works great and would recommend 
20860 one of the best camara protection I bought 
20861 Product was as advertised. 
20862 Them two extra batteries and 12V&110V charger is great thing to have they last 2x longer then OEM in my sony290 camera thanks for great deal 
20863 Great quality product with affordable price. Well worth the money. 
20864 Was pretty good. the seam on the handle broke the day I got it. Bummer 
20865 Excellent Camera!!! Highly recommend. Takes Beautiful Pics!!! 
20866 came scratched 
20867 Do not buy it! Damaged from my first use, very small and good for pocket, but since I used the coin to fix the camera, two of rubber pieces damaged.. 5 minutes only after unpacking! 
20868 Makes a world of difference on my D700. Manual focus is very sharp when using this eyepiece. I recommend it. 
20869 A perfect fit for my cannon camera and the 2 extra batteries is even made it better, didn t have to worry I was going to run out of batteries. 
20870 You get what you pay for. But OK. 
20871 Fits the camera it was recommended for fine. No issues. 
20872 I have used a Zomodo system which is really not good; I tried this WIFI NVR System without any high expectation,but so far it is good,outlooking, setting,APP,WIFI signal,service is also prompt.The problem is without ethernet cable which I think should be. 
20873 Great! 
20874 Great battery however, it would be smart to keep a few extra of these charged up in your bag. 
20875 good 
20876 Got it in a couple of days and works perfectly! 
20877 Don t buy it. It doesn t fit a Nikon as advertised. Spend the extra money and buy a good product. 
20878 Very sturdy construction 
20879 It s a lens hood. It does the job. While it s made for my lens, the fit feels off, 
20880 Died in no time, now I have to go thru hoops to get repaired, very dis-satisfied 
20881 Good purchase! Fast shipping! 
20882 Great product. 
20883 Totally loved this album! It s great quality and holds my pictures perfectly. 
20884 Better than I expected 
20885 I m happy to have a working camera again, thank you. 
20886 Works great for black and white film photography. 
20887 This is a present to the world. 
20888 great seller - delivered as promised! 
20889 Excellent lens. Very handy for street photography. I am keeping it all the time in my OM-D5 I hang around with this one, and my D7100 with the 18-200 on the other shoulder. Great combination. 
20890 I had low expectations based on the price, but the quality is quite good, provided the light is good. My only complaint is the Nikon style T-adapter cannot be protected by a Nikon end cap. It fits too loosely and falls off. 
20891 Only problem I have is remote. it shows low battery every time and does not working... 
20892 Works well once I got the proper macro lens. Product description is coy on that point. 
20893 Great pricing and just as I ordered. 
20894 Works great with GoPro Hero 4 silver 
20895 Use it as protection for my 70-200. Well worth price. 
20896 when an e mail is created to try to watch it outside the home, it doesn t let me. 
20897 Very sturdy tripod smart looking folds up tor easy carrying 
20898 Very handy item. I keep one in the glove box of both cars. I also would recommend the remote timer Hapurs Bluetooth to use with it. 
20899 Perfect for our T2i, and quickly shipped. 
20900 Works but not designed as good as chums brand version. 
20901 Great response from seller. One of the screen had a defect and was replaced quickly by seller. The screen saver works great and is holding up on the watch and minimize scratches on the glass. 
20902 Love it! Also have a wireless remote but I like this one better. 
20903 batteries perform at least as good as factory originals. No formal testing done though. 
20904 very sharp, great on street photography compact & light to carry around 
20905 Great bag! Lots of pockets! Wish it wasn t so bulky though! 
20906 nice gift 
20907 Wonderful product and so darn easy to use! I highly recommend. 
20908 light weight tripod stand. wish it was a little bigger. only like four feet high 
20909 WORKED AS PROMISED - THANK YOU! 
20910 This product totally served the need to which it was applied. We will continue to use the ZINK Photo Paper for our needs, as they occur. Thanks for such a reliable product. 
20911 Great 
20912 I am very happy with this purchase and it is really valuable addition to my gear. 
20913 I lost my Nikon D5300 Charger and I needed one—quick. With prime, shipping was speedy and painless, the company sent a friendly email and the product works most importantly. Much better than buying the $50 Nikon Product. Would recommend to anyone. 
20914 very good for the price--as described 
20915 I was looking for a case for my Nikon Coolpix S9700 and this one is a perfect fit. 
20916 The camera is performing nicely in my home. It sometimes loses its connectivity, but seems to reconnect over time. I held back on giving it 5 stars because of the price for a cloud account and no option to store video on customer hardware. 
20917 Very impressed with the USB charge system as compared to the direct charging system. Enjoy the use of product very much. Highly recommending the combination unit for purchase. 
20918 Lots of interference if you use as a baby moniter. We needed it for our mother who moved in. So it works ok as an intercom but it s cheaply made and we had to add 100 feet of extra wire. It s what we expected for the money. 
20919 Happy with merchandise 
20920 Great light ! 
20921 This filter paints a purpure sky while shooting on the film. 
20922 Great Camera but the GoPro Studio keeps on crashing on me. 
20923 works perfect with my video cameras... 
20924 Worked like a charm! 
20925 Great solid and sturdy lightstand for the price! I have a 4x6 softbox with constant light set up on it in my studio and have had no issues. 
20926 very good quality. Has 2 bubble levels to adjust the tripod. Fits my LG PA77U projector well. Good buy! 
20927 The product is as advertised, what more can you ask for. 
20928 This was one of my best decisions i have ever made. its so cute and the cheepest price on the market. works great and super duper cute! i think everyone should get one. quality is great and a nice fit in the hand. High remarks about this. 
20929 Hugely impressed by this product. Serves mainly as a secondary/slave. Excellent performance, nonetheless. 
20930 Love the camera, but would have liked the seller to advertise that camera does not have U.S. warranty. 
20931 nice! little heavy for dlite 4 
20932 Purchased this to cover my hot shoe on the [[ASIN:B00I8BICCG Sony Alpha a6000 Mirrorless Digital Camera - Body only]] I purchased. This is made by Sony as does a fantastic job at protecting the hot shoe since I shoot 100% without flash as a natural light shooter! 
20933 camera doesn t work right the picture keep rolling 
20934 Don t buy this product!. No connectivity, confirmed with a multimeter. Adds to frustration of getting a camera configured. 
20935 works great 
20936 My favorite camera... 
20937 Excellent product. Thank you!! 
20938 Very happy with purchase!!! 
20939 Excellent product as to price If you are entering astronomy, this is the right one! But it s extremely hard to colliminate 
20940 Thanks... Good product... Fast shipment... 
20941 The product is as described and would be fine. However, it does not appear to be very well made as one of the clips was broken on the honeycomb grid and also on one of the color filters. I guess you get what you pay for. 
20942 Purchased this to protect my lens and it works perfectly. 
20943 these were for my son; I haven t heard any complaints so he must be happy with them! 
20944 This camera works pretty good tested it at the pool also at the lake when about 5 feet under water no problem image its pretty good about same as my galaxy s2. 
20945 Did not work. Installed battery, LCD screen came on, then nothing would work, not even the light. Returned for refund. Refund was processed quickly and without question. Would purchase from Bopo again, just not from Dot Line Corp. 
20946 perfect fit for a Chrome Messenger and a LowePro Slingshot 202 
20947 As advertised fit and charges well 
20948 Great grip, very comfortable. Only problem I find is the bottom attachment is pretty bulky. Contrary to other posts, you CAN add a neck strap as I ve demonstrated in the photo. It comes with this metal bracket that is designed to add the neck strap to. 
20949 This head fits on my Sirui P-424 carbon monopod and can support the weight of my heaviest lens. 
20950 A bit pricey for what it is, but that s Canon s fault. Otherwise, it does what it was designed to do. 
20951 I found this camera hard to keep connected. Ended up returning. I ve owned 2 other Foscam camera s in the past, but this camera wasn t very reliable. One positive note: the setup was pretty easy. 
20952 Good value - picture. 
20953 Great Lens, high quality photos, contrasts and color! But taking video s with this lens on the Sony 6000 is very loud, you can hear the motor chattering when it s auto focusing. 
20954 easy tu use vert good 
20955 Fun, small camera and takes good pictures. 
20956 Love B+W I was highly dissapointed that after blowing these off, then wiping carefully with breadth/moisture and a clean microfiber cloth I still had micromarring on the surface. I feel like the glass/foil is incredibly soft in these. 
20957 Great for selfies. Easy to put on & take off. 
20958 Works perfectly. And I love being able to move it and see it from my cell phone. 
20959 Perfect! I charge my original gopro battery and my 2 smatree batteries at the same time! Gets the same battery life for a fraction of the price of original gopro batteries. 
20960 it is just ok, nothing special 
20961 Thank you 
20962 The item is bulky and cumbersome and did not perform to my liking. 
20963 Good 
20964 Works great 
20965 Great lens 
20966 Great product, clear, bright images. Definitely worth the price. The case looks pretty resistant to field work. 
20967 Enjoy this product, fun to use. 
20968 More than just a camera case - I would even use it as a purse. 
20969 This is a very nice lens, item was delivered ahead of schedule in a very secure packaging. Lens tested OK Looks good on my GX7 
20970 canon eos t3i works great. 
20971 Good price and fast shipping 
20972 Camera was good but the bag for camera was too small。。。 
20973 Great Product 
20974 fine 
20975 awesome protective case 
20976 I m very happy with the performance of these batteries. I bought two, one for each camera. I have a Gopro3 and 3+. 
20977 The right tool for the right job 
20978 Excellent product for the price, doing everything that I needed it to do. 
20979 Best you can get for the price 
20980 works great, price is great 
20981 Bought for fishing, fits great, the angle isn t great. When dehooking sharks, you see too much ground. Head mount is a better fit for that. 
20982 Pleased 
20983 was very useful and versatile.[[ASIN:B00PPXGY3O Black Pro Large Octopus Tripod with Adapter Holding 3 Kgs Size 250*60*60mm for Gopro Hero 4 3+ Camera Digital Slrs/dslr/dv]] 
20984 Definitely worth it for the money. No issues so far. Using with a Canon 70D. 
20985 It is very light weight and plenty sturdy enough for light weight light sources. For the price, it is very well made. 
20986 I really enjoy this item. The lighting it gives, out great for my photography. I own two of them. 
20987 Great product, exceeds requirements. 
20988 Great camera and great customer service from a guy named Kenneth. I was lost and he got me up and running in only a few minutes. 
20989 It s not as sturdy as I thought it would be but it s compact and easily fits in a backpack or even pockets. I would not recommend this for &#34;fablets&#34; like the iPhone 6 plus or Notes. 
20990 Excellent quality UV filter. I purchased this to go on a Sigma 150-600mm Contemporary lens, and I have not been disappointed. Thee are several less expensive filters out there, but this is worth the extra money. Jeff 
20991 gift for my son...he loved it 
20992 Works great. A very versatile charger. 
20993 This system was for a HS FFA program barn. Install was easy and setup was even easier. Been running for several weeks and it is going great. Can t say enough good about this system and the company that sold it. Great customer service. 
20994 Very nice 
20995 Very good 
20996 Very Good 
20997 Tudo ok! 
20998 Very nice unit with lots of thing you can do with it. Can t beat the price for such a versatile piece of equipment. Little bit bulky to carry with you. 
20999 Good product solves the purpose 
21000 Very Good 
21001 Great addition to the outside play area of the wife s dog business. Keeps the vandals out at night while providing great visibility to the people that have to do the late night potty break. Well constructed. Bright. Easy install. 
21002 work great nice videos, sound, pictures. it did`nt work at first but the memory card went in to far pull it out just a little and it worked fine after that. 
21003 Sturdy product and has worked for me on multiple snorkeling trips. 
21004 Bought it as a present for my grandma and she love s it. I doesn t have a great resolution but you can t ask more fore the price. Easy to use. 
21005 works well with Windows 8. auto crops the photo to perfect size. Instructions on the scanner tell you to insert every photo in the plastic-do so it is easy and gets you the best scan. Just be sure to keep scanning surface clean with tools provided. 
21006 Excellent 
21007 Battery was cheap. Doesn t hold a charge very long, but wasn t very expensive either. I guess you get what you pay for 
21008 These are GREAT. They were plug and play right away. The audio was clear and really worked very well with the filmed presentation. Very worth the investment. 
21009 Nice case. Durable. Shipped on time. 
21010 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
21011 Got it super fast and I use it everyday. 
21012 good! 
21013 Very low build quality. Not ready for prime time. Pass on this one. I bought two and they are expensive non-functional paper weights. It s the ptz motor ... It slips when repisitioning rendering it useless. Tech support virtually a joke. 
21014 Having a blast with it 
21015 Works well but after about a year of use the legs have worn down and causes the monopod to rest on one leg instead of all three. 
21016 I m very happy! 
21017 Wonderful, I view anywhere and anytime, daytime color very nice , night time with night visions perfect. Easy setup, give me 5 to 10 minutes , I will buy one more set later. Good price Thanks Eyesun Technology Co 
21018 Love this bag, Love the colors and it carries nicely on my shoulder. Plus I can carry cross ways and very comfortable. 
21019 Great product! 
21020 Adorable 
21021 Works as described 
21022 Excellent value and works well on my Cannon Rebel T5. 
21023 Threat 
21024 Ordered this two pack as backups for Nikon 1 v1. Neither battery would take a charge they put the charger into an error state ... fast flashing led. Good thing I still have two batteries for the camera. 
21025 Thanks D link customer service rep #ER004228. I was in a jam and she went above and beyond in helping me out case#C6723426 
21026 Will return these also. Read that props break on occasion and the ad stated that these are also bought with the Parrot Spider, however these are not for the Parrot Spider, much larger. Maybe should have read closer. 
21027 Simply perfect, they do what you spect to do 
21028 This that is so big !!!! Way big for my Pentax k50. If you what big it was made well. 
21029 Beautifully crafted and well designed case. Offers a reasonable amount of protection with decent access to the battery and memory as well as controls. A bit expensive but high quality. 
21030 Very good and sturdy. 
21031 Great charger. Much better than the stock nikon charger. 
21032 Yes 
21033 Great little camera.I would recommend this to EVERYONE! 
21034 Very impressive for a good price. 
21035 Looks to be a good buy for the price. Still learning how to use the camera, but am sure I will enjoy using it with the tripod. 
21036 This background paper is just what I needed. Received it quickly. Would recommend to others. 
21037 Glad we bought this for our screen 
21038 Greatly 
21039 Exactly what I was looking for 
21040 Product as described, fast shipping, a bit disappointed by the packaging which was minimally protective with respect to the expense and vulnerability of the product. Hoping the lens continues to function as intended. 
21041 The Camera is modelF19821W. I was assisted today by Walter. Walter was extremely helpful. 
21042 I would buy again. 
21043 Works great! Way cheaper than the Sony and has the wireless shutter release and intervalometer. The instructions on how to use the remote are terrible but if you keep at it, it can be figured out! 
21044 Fits perfect. For those moments when you dont need the original housing. I use it for most of the time for biking & surrounding sounds. Very happy with it. 
21045 Just what I needed. Thanks 
21046 Great case, smaller than appeared. But the quality is good and it does the job well. 
21047 The film was expired and produced black film. I would not purchase this again. 
21048 I was very happy with this iem 
21049 I wish this was the stock case that came with the action cams but very pleased with it. 
21050 It doesn t work and I cannot get any help from the vendor. It has potential, but there is no contact for help. 
21051 just what i expected 
21052 Love this , will be buying a couple more 
21053 This is a good bag but it does not fit a Nikon D330 and lens as described. 
21054 It works. 
21055 as described and match my camera perfectly 
21056 The picture are very sharp, Camera is made sturdily plus underwater photos are excellent 
21057 Package came perfect and fast. Still have to test product though. 
21058 Great convenient protection. 
21059 I have Qflash T4d and I was not sure if this diffuser is going to fit. It fits well, and I am very satisfied. 
21060 Much more convenient than my camera strap. It is comfortable and functional. Don t hesitate. 
21061 rock solid, ingenious design... total quality 
21062 Very difficult to use 
21063 simple, and practice! The pictures show better look after use this flash 
21064 Good product for my needs. Some lag in camera rotation, but still very useful for checking the house and pets when away. Very much like the night vision function. 
21065 Excellent! 
21066 Would not transfer data. 
21067 Product was as advertised. 
21068 I love this camera. Takes great crisp, clear pictures. This is absolutely worth it! Everything shown in the picture was with the bundle. 
21069 like it 
21070 cute, but not functional. No memory card included 
21071 Good camera, but not very practical and too heavy for me. I thought it was lighter to carry around. I wonder if I could exchange it. 
21072 good! 
21073 I don t use it because it is oddly shaped and I can t really fit anything in it. 
21074 Easy for setup and not expensive I like it 
21075 Received an envelope with no 0 screen protector. 
21076 I had lost my original cable and have still not found it. This one is an exact replacement. 
21077 finally can use my land camera with out modifying it, will buy again. 
21078 All ok 
21079 The head is not that smooth and the legs are not connected together. It is a sturdy stand for static shots but not for action or sports. 
21080 Good but the 910 turns out to be a little smaller than what I needed. Kept it anyway. 
21081 It is what it is 
21082 Awesome little camera. For hundreds less than the GP it s hard to beat! 
21083 Despite the fact I took me a while to figure out how to install the lens hood (operator error), the product itself is great. It does what it s suppose to do for a great price. 
21084 The digital picture frame will not turn me get damaged 
21085 Sturdy and compact with all the essential features. 
21086 GREAT 
21087 These were just the ticket for replacing a scratched lens. Fit well, and were easy to install. 
21088 It s description of the cord it will not work for ps3 or Xbox 
21089 Nice gels, but took a long time to get here (Chicago area). 
21090 Really nice but really hard to fly. 
21091 If you have a Gopro hero camera and don t have a case, this is well worth the money. 
21092 Perfect data transfer! Fair price. 
21093 Very cool to wear and awesome POV shots 
21094 Henry was the best 
21095 I am very pleased with the slide viewer and it came in very soon after it was ordered. 
21096 The best in price and quality. 
21097 Good..... 
21098 Great portable light modifier. Built well enough. Works as I expected. Great item. 
21099 sometimes working sometimes don t 
21100 I thought you could take pictures w/o removing it from case. Nope. But it will definitely protect the camera!!! 
21101 First time using it and the strap fell off, thankfully I didn t lose my go-pro. 
21102 Great. 
21103 What I really like about this backdrop is how flat it stores. Bigger than I expected tall/wide (a good thing i guess for backdrops) Those black things are heavy weights that work well. It comes ready to go, pretty simple to use. (I m a guy who never reads directions) 
21104 I haven t had the camera long but it has met all my expectations and then some. I am especially thrilled to have the 55-200mm lens which allows me to take up close photos of nature. I am very happy so far with the camera. 
21105 no surprise 
21106 Christmas gift, my wife loved it. 
21107 I love my camera. I need to learn more about it 
21108 Have had it for a month or so. Received it fast. Loaded all sorts of pictures (around 2000 portrait and landscape oriented pictures) in the supplied USB flash drive. No issues. Works great, picture is great, motion sensor is great.. No complaints. 
21109 Excellent binocs. Shipping speed was good. 
21110 Love this selfie stick I wasn t a big fan of it but now I can take family pics all by myself it s nice and small fits anywhere n very cute 
21111 Happy with this buy 
21112 Great camera, easy to use and set up. I linked it to my home wifi and can email the pictures directly to myself from the camera super easy! Takes great pictures 
21113 First time using these, the Phantom 3 was extremely unstable. Even after calibration before the flight, the drone was out of control, and crash into my car. Sent an email to DJI, but they did not respond. Beware before you try these. 
21114 excellent!!! 
21115 good, shipping fast 
21116 Happy with the camera. For a used camera it easy replaces the one that I lost.. Working condition, etc. perfect. Thank you 
21117 This was bought for my daughters birthday. We found the GoPro Hero 3 to be everything the write up said it would do. The package came packed secure and in a timely manner. Not only did it work great at the pool party but survived a group of amateur photographers. 
21118 Great camera, but the accessories tossed in are mediocre at best. The Flash is crap and the tripod is flimsy, I sure wouldn t trust it for my new Nikon that for sure. Still, not a bad deal when I bought it a few months ago. 
21119 great way to carry around some extra memory caards 
21120 Pretty average camera, but it works 
21121 One of the best for all those looking for a case for their heady glass or anything really. It has the pick and pluck float so you can fit litterally anything that can fit in the box 10/10 
21122 All the accessories are great! Love them all! So glad I got it! The monopod is the best feature by far! 
21123 Although the item seems to &#34;work&#34;, it has very poor sensitivity. It can alarm of movement if the moving person or object is within about 15 feet or less of the detector. It of limited use for most applications or driveways. 
21124 Poor fit in the D750. A bit too large and could not clear space below protector at two corners. Should be a bit smaller, the Vello was much better. 
21125 Works as it should. Nice strong clasp, doesn t fall off 
21126 Wasn t as expected.. very disapointed. Couldn t read the instructions because they weren t in English to figure out how to work it. Didn t come with any film either... bummer. 
21127 Work perfectly fine with my 1D MKIII. No issues. 
21128 Good product, quality and appearance 
21129 Freaking Fantastic! 
21130 Have been using this for a while and have had no issues. No bubbles...Great protection. 
21131 How do you possibly make sense of all this neewer stuff. You buy the bulb but didn t get the light. you didn t get the diffuser. the diffuser comes in 4 colors. why? 
21132 So happy with it. It s perfect 
21133 Good 
21134 Product is self explainable. Just make sure you measure before ordering this way you don t have to roll up 30 feet of wire. 
21135 Good Quality product! Heavy duty, easy to use, sturdy. I m extremely HAPPY with my purchase!~DUG 
21136 Excellent value. Works great with my Nikon P610. Light and sturdy. Very compact. 
21137 Tippy and very cheaply made 
21138 did not work at all - 
21139 The straps ripped almost immediately. 
21140 I ve had other lens adapters, and they were awkward fitting and using. Not the case with this. I bought it to use my Minolta lenses on my Sony A3000. It goes on easily, and swapping lenses is fast and easy as well. It s a joy to use! 
21141 beautiful picture quality. Takes stunning macro images and can be used as a telescoping lens in a pinch. Highly recommended for any serious or armature photographer. I m rather armature but have included an example pic of one my dart frogs. 
21142 The sleeves work, but I would like it if they fit the film a little bit more snugly. 
21143 Perfect ... as it supposed to be !! 
21144 good start. good price with lots of accessories. light weight, easy to take. 
21145 came on time was what I expected 
21146 I bought this thinking my used camera would be sent with out a battery. But always can use fresh ones. 
21147 Fit my alarm system, came in a plain box. Could careless about the box, batteries work and family is once again protected. 
21148 excelente 
21149 For holding it does good for when doing a lot of shots. Does not feel safe for walking around. 
21150 Bulky but offers a nice blast of air - better than those little grey blowers. 
21151 Although the battery is listed as a replacement for the Panasonic original it the camera rejected it since it was not an original Panasonic product. Check out the web for the exact issue. Do not buy this battery! It fits but does not function. 
21152 Did not fit.. 
21153 Unobtrusive and effective. They break now and then, but for the price and simplicity you can replace it and go on your way. [[ASIN:B00IP22A08 5pcs Anti-lost Lens Cover Cap Keeper Lanyard Keeper Holder Strap Rope for Sony Olympus Canon Nikon Dslr SLR Camera]] 
21154 Don t. Buy this it s a. Lie I looked and. It said it was compatible with my camera. And it didn t fit. It s like I threw. A few. Dollars. Down the street 
21155 Came in less than a week! The rig is about what you d expect for the price. Nice and basic! 
21156 The slide scans are way off color. Kodachrome negatives cannot be scanned to make a useful digital negative or positive. 
21157 Good 
21158 The size and weight all work well with my Rebel T51. Since purchasing and using it has added another dimension of quality to my photos. A must have. 
21159 It is a bit flimsy but does the job. What I expected from Polaroid. =) 
21160 The arm is solid. The tripod that s inside the handle...come gopro you could ve done better. Very flimsy plastic! 
21161 GoPro does not support warrentees if you buy from Amazon. Don t do it. 
21162 good product 
21163 Fits perfect.....great price. 
21164 I have owned this for 2 years and it is still in great condition. Depending on what you re doing you may want a higher quality/more versatile tripod. This one is great for an ameture photographer. 
21165 Great lens, very sharp and great focus. Great deal, especially for the price. 
21166 Still love the D5200... even since I left it on a train in Berlin within a month of purchase! Let me know if you re the one who found it :•( 
21167 I love that the power if built into the cat5 cable! I bough extra cable, however it wasn t needed. this kit had what I needed. The app is fairly solid! 
21168 This is an excellent value for a water white filter. I haven t experienced any issues with flare, and its color reproduction is far better than you d normally get for the price. 
21169 Oh, very good camera, feels like built with good materials. Small size, quick & clear focusing, photos better than my other digital camera. Love it. 
21170 Work out well 
21171 Loved it. Easy to learn and use especially if you are just learning how to work it. It is also good for beginners such as myself. 
21172 Wouldn t hold a charge and cost as much to return as paid for. 
21173 No issues here. 
21174 This GoPro handle really makes it much easier to get different angles and shoot more interesting clips. It floats so enables you to take underwater video without someone holding the camera. The strap helps a lot to allow movement without losing the GoPro if you are in the ocean. 
21175 The package was opened when it arrived and the screws were not the right size at all! 
21176 Sucks!! no way to secure to rail!!!!! 
21177 Great Items 
21178 It works as it should, despite being flimsier than more expensive brands. It does it s job. 
21179 lens fell out on first use, and casing became chipped immediately. Very poor quality item. No response from seller beyond requesting photos, which I provided repeatedly. Very disappointed. 
21180 excellent 
21181 YOU JUST CAN T BEAT THE PRICE AND HOLD S A CHARGE...HAPPY WITH PURCHASE.. 
21182 Product arrived on time and was exactly as described. Have only used them around neighborhood but have worked perfectly. Will be using them in the field in 2 weeks 
21183 This battery was about 1/16 inch shorter than the original 504 is was to replace. Waste of money. 
21184 i love it...as expected 
21185 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
21186 Worked exactly as described, and easier to use than expected. 
21187 These 1600 mah batteries last longer per use than Kodak s KLIC-7004 at 1000 mah Charger works well. Have used these batteries for about month. 1/17 Batteries continue to work well. Have gone over to Kodak charger. 
21188 Fat chance getting license plates or facial features. Too blurry.... 
21189 Works keeps it aflote 
21190 just sold this housing to a friend and upgraded to the same one but for the canon d5 mark iii, i love ikelite and they make a great product. amazing lighting products as well. well worth the investment1 
21191 small, durable, gets the job done. Highly recommended 
21192 Sometimes it is difficult to get the camera leveled, but in general it is a good product. 
21193 Arrived in great condition. 
21194 Good batteries, great value. Highly recommended. 
21195 Fast service and a true fit. Service is the key they have the products and system down pat..... 
21196 Well made and worth the money..... 
21197 Got a clean sensor on my Canon 30D now. 
21198 Wish the price for storage was 1/2 of what s being charged. Too rich for my blood. 
21199 Easy to install, work great. One had issues and replacement was very easy. 
21200 Excellent 
21201 Love this Lens. Color came out to be very good. 
21202 Works great 
21203 Fits great and works amazing. Sure, if you have time to set up there are light modifiers that will do a better a job but if you are shooting an event where things change too fast to allow for set up this does the trick nicely. 
21204 OK 
21205 purchase 2 of these for other deputies. I finally got one for my self I recommend it to all LEO s works great. 
21206 Unit worked once then quit working. New egg and manufacturer FAILED TO refund or replace defective product after many requests. New egg passed responsibility to CHINA company who has not refunded for product. RIP OFFS 
21207 I am using this case to hold my Pentax K-50 DSLR camera and it keeps the camera well protected; the small additional compartments can hold other accessories like batteries and battery charger and memory cards, etc. 
21208 Don t waste your money, time and frustration level. It s not worth it! 
21209 Works! 
21210 thanks 
21211 Complete junk 
21212 Its a cool little extra to have around but I wish it wasn t plastic, 
21213 Remote does not work for my Canon 60d 
21214 Very nice backdrop. 
21215 Perfect! Love it! 
21216 Strap won t fit through the loop on my Panasonic Lumix GF-3. Too wide. No instructions. Had to go to Youtube to see how to put it together. 
21217 works great 
21218 Exactly what I needed and workes great! 
21219 Nice 
21220 This little device is great. Works extremely well, and with the addition of the bush cover makes my confidence in the cleanliness of ly lens cleaning. 
21221 This works perfectly and better than expected. It gives me peace of mind! 
21222 Fit perfect lasts a lot longer than the factory battery. 
21223 Have not been able to use it yet, husband said it looks good 
21224 good 
21225 Okay 
21226 Excellent!....Just what I wanted! 
21227 Met my expectations and then some. I recommend. 
21228 i am having trouble setting them up they shut my internet down when i try to connect them i have conntacted seller and they will not contact me back 
21229 A very nice battery for my Panasonic Lumix FZ70. 
21230 Works well at cleaning the smudges off my glasses. Great value for a family like mine with many glasses in the house. 
21231 Really nice. Downloaded the instruction book on my tablet. Better than booklet. Not heavy either even with batteries. Love the color. 
21232 Easy to use and the instruction are easy. They are written in a conversational way that is easy to understand. 
21233 Perfect! I also bought the wrist strap so that I could swap according to the activity I am photographing. 
21234 works as it should. 
21235 Not at all what I wanted. Ordered wireless!! 
21236 Awesome value and works great. No issues so far. 
21237 very good 
21238 good lens cap bundle from CamKix. 
21239 It is great for all day shooting and is extremely easy, comfortable and convenient. 
21240 Great lens, great seller! 
21241 Good 
21242 Great lens for the price and it suited my needs using my Canon 70D and my 50D 
21243 This was a great deal on two batteries, charger and 220v adapter. I had to go elsewhere to get the Camera (Nikon 610), it was $100 cheaper at 42 street photo. 
21244 Works as represented 
21245 Binoculars are great. Able to focus quite close and far distant with clarity. Binoculars would get a 5-star from me except for lens caps that too easily come off. 
21246 This lens has made a sigma fan out of me. I had an older model of this on a Canon, was good but not great. This new model is much sharper, it stays on the Pentax body now. 
21247 It is to dark, and the night vision is useless!! 
21248 im not sure how long these worked for but very unpredictable. 
21249 Great fit and very easy to put on. 
21250 Little expensive 
21251 Its OK. Works. 
21252 great little camera!!!! i d buy it again. 
21253 Terrible quality 
21254 Sent it back. Not exactly what I was looking for 
21255 Works great. 
21256 Woah, this thing is awesome! It could light an entire room with it being the only light source. However it does come with a dimmer so you are not sliding all your subjects. 
21257 What app do I download 
21258 Just exactly what was needed. 
21259 I expected these to fit the op/tech camera harness. They did not mate 
21260 Fantastic camera and I will learn more as I go,, still reading and playing around with it 
21261 Item as described works with nikon d5500 
21262 Arrived as ordered, works fine. I ve been using SterlinkTek for years - great products at great prices 
21263 There is no way to attach the gopro to the chest strap. I think you will need to have a case that houses the gopro and snaps into the chest start. I wish the description stated that. 
21264 Exactly as expected. 
21265 Exactly what I expected. It charges superfast and lasts long. 
21266 Having a case that separated into two pieces and you have to take one off (and hold it) every time you want to take a photo is really annoying. 
21267 Not for iPhone 6+ 
21268 As described, works great. 
21269 Fun camera, worked under water in Hawaii with great video and pictures. 
21270 IS A GOOD CASE 
21271 This product exceeded my expectations. I m going to test it underwater this weekend during my dive 
21272 Great product for the price. I would recommend this polarizer anytime. 
21273 Caught my crazy neighbor and daughter keying my wife s car. Happen at 3:00 am night vision was crystal clear. 
21274 it s alright 
21275 It s okay, but not what I expected 
21276 Goes off line a lot and you cannot access camera from WiFi locations...I m very disappointed with this product. 
21277 Love it so much! 
21278 Didn t work, turned on then off. Instructions were terrible not very helpful at all 
21279 I m glad I bought this instead of the Canon brand! The price is excellent and it fits really well. Highly recommended for canon 70-200mm F4 IS. 
21280 This was a replacement for the identical camera that somehow quit working properly...........we chose to replace with the warrantee rather than repair for $125. 
21281 important warranty plan if you re a vlogger who might be prone to breaking things! 
21282 Oh so wonderful and functional... I love all the compartments! I ve used it for two weddings so far... It s great for carrying an extra lens or two. 
21283 The GPS seems to work reasonably well. Photos have come out quite nicely. Easy to use. Have yet to figure out how to sync with my iPhone which is why I ve not given 5-stars. Have tried on several occasions but haven t hit upon the correct sequence yet. 
21284 They called large but its not that large, i have to leave out some of my equipment. at least is well made. wished was a little cheaper because is a amazon basics product. 
21285 This camera is very average, if you wanting to buy this for less money buy the Vivotek version rather than the Cisco one. 
21286 I wanted the protection that the case offer, and for the most part I am satisfied with it, but it makes it difficult to get the memory card out of the camera and does not offer as much coverage on the sides of the camera as I had hoped. 
21287 product was as described, great quality 
21288 Really expensive for what it is. 
21289 great quality but expensive 
21290 it was very usefull and handy 
21291 Quick delivery and fit my camera perfectly! I always lose these so I m sure I ll be ordering more soon! 
21292 Love it. Easy set up. Great quality. 
21293 very good product. excellent quality 
21294 works great, just missed the fact that a spare battery wasn t included. 
21295 It works pretty well but some of the hardware is not the greatest I had a substitute a different stand bracket for the one that came with the clamp 
21296 Works perfectly, better then I had anticipated 
21297 I bought this for my husband and he was delighted! 
21298 It fits well and stays on the Sony Nex 7. 
21299 Was pleasantly surprised. Used on vacation. No problems yet. 
21300 Fast delivery and wonderful inexpensive product! 
21301 Only one of the batteries worked. The other didn t fit the charger 
21302 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
21303 don t work 
21304 The product fits too loosely. Lens does not click into adapter and adapter doesn t click to camera body. Slight wobble is enough to throw picture quality off. 
21305 Really great accessory to have when biking or attaching my GoPro to my motorcycle helmet, the laws of physics and mother nature may come into play. 
21306 It would have been very cute, however, it never actually arrived. 
21307 best price 
21308 handle broke within the first week 
21309 Great item for the price, can t wait to use it! 
21310 Not including the holder 
21311 Carl was a great help to me as I was setting up my camera. The camera does exactly as expected. Perfect for what I needed and with a little help setting it up, it was a breeze. 
21312 Excellents 
21313 Bought the imposter, now I ve got factory battery! 
21314 Quality Product. Looks Kool. 
21315 So far the camera is great, The only problem I have found is the the on/off button is easy to push while tring to zoom in or out. Just something I will have to get use to. But love everything else about the camera. 
21316 needs 120V power not battery operated 
21317 I, unfortunately, had a bad experience with this item: 1) Installed software update 2) Shut down the camera 3) Camera started to over heat 4) Opened the case to access the camera and removed the battery 5) Noticed that the top right corner had cracked 
21318 Good value. 
21319 Highly Recommended! 
21320 High quality strap. Too bad Carry Speed products are not sold in the USA. 
21321 Great deal, easy to use. Product does the job! 
21322 Great deal worth fast shipping. Good company to deal with. Very happy. 
21323 Just the right size for my Fujinon XF 55-200mm lens. 
21324 Did not fit to my Sony cam 
21325 This baby is definitely going to be my go-to handle for the GoPro (especially as more and more places are banning selfie sticks). Love this baby, feels good, floats, and allows me to get the videos I want. 
21326 Great little camera, really like the inline, not offset, lens. Very rugged has now hit the ground in a couple hard crashes while on my 250 FPV quadcopter. A couple dents i the case but, still working! For the money very hard to beat. 
21327 Dany did an outstanding job being patient with me. The camara is very good. 
21328 The cameras are very easy to install. I found that they required about a day to get solid signals and work out the bugs but after that they work flawlessly inside and out. I do wish they had audio because everything else works so well... 
21329 one of the clips fails and for that the right strap of the bag pack works improperly. The product feels cheap. 
21330 The earphone jack is not a tight fit for the gateway S5. I could only get it to work if I held the earphone jack connection in and then what s the point of the stick. 
21331 Contacted them - no reply.. Doesn t work & it is faulty. 
21332 Has a limited range and it did not work with my wireless network. 
21333 great shipper and quality 
21334 This pod has worked great so far. It has always kept its shape and is very flexible. The level on top is a great addition and I like the quick release mount for the gopro, or other camera. It does seem a little bulky though. 
21335 Great camera 
21336 I love this camera; so easy, great pictures and great price!!! Thanks!!! 
21337 This bag is well built and well padded. I could pack D 9 attached with Tokina 11- 17 mm lens, 1 nikon 18- 105 mm , 1 sigma 18- 250 mm macro hsn, and 1 nikon prime lenses. Looks small but with enough room 
21338 Cannot beat the price! Works great. I use three of these for wedding photography 
21339 Not quite so sturdy as expected. No instructions on how to convert to monopod, but after a while figured it out. Well made with minimum plastic parts. 
21340 Great value and great performing product. 
21341 sturdy but a little heavy 
21342 Vincent was the most intelligent, helpful Tech I ve worked with at Foscam. He quickly solved all issues and even suggested and helped me set remote settings, which nobody ever offered to help with before. He s really great! Thanks! 
21343 Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software 
21344 Great deal and it works great. Its so nice to not have to rely on one GoPro battery 
21345 Great 
21346 Great 
21347 I really liked the binoculars. It was a little tough getting them to adjust. Great buy, though. 
21348 Nice travel tripod for the price. Easy to setup, already took sample pictures and movies. Looking forward to Hawaii in less than three weeks. Mahalo! 
21349 Works perfectly and a fraction of the price Canon charges. 
21350 Great lense, fast shipping and love the accessories, except the bag is so small and useless! I can only fit my camera body in it. It looks totally different from the picture 
21351 Love the items. They work wonderful and fit great. Use on our trip to Ireland and was thrilled with all of them. Would order again in a second. Thanks for a great product! 
21352 Bigger than expected holds up great 
21353 Great group of accessories if you have a gopro 
21354 Just ordered and can t use it till I update it on my computer. Such a pain after getting the app and registering my son can t even fly it. 
21355 What can I say, It is a plug, it fit my battery charger. What else can I say about a power cord. 
21356 Present for sson He really likes it. 
21357 Works very well 
21358 That coil is a nice i almost make 15 tattoo and my liner machine run good no heat. 
21359 it is good. 
21360 The camera works fine, but the barrel of one of them will not unscrew, so the memory cannot be added. The replacement and three others work fine. 
21361 Mounted to an older Nikon 300/f2.8 so it can be quickly mounted to an Arca style QR. The anti-rotation flange is ideal for preventing possible movement of the shoe. 
21362 Not super high quality. I got it for watching netflix in bed - so I can lay on my side and put the screen at about a 45-degree angle to match my eyes. It tips over even with an iPhone 5 at that angle. 
21363 Female screw at the end has no thread..... What the.... I had to use my original screws from other adapter to hold the camera onto this grip. 
21364 very good , solid thumbscrew better than the plastic 
21365 Great value for the money and super quick shipment. Buy with confidence! 
21366 Great camera but not upgradeable to this day and age, to slow must be an old model. 
21367 Quality looking blades, but dangerous! These things are very stiff and could take your fingers off no problem! After a tip-over one blade embedded itself in the arm of my quad. And the lifting ability is much less than my original blades. 
21368 :) 
21369 I flew to NYC to photograph a wedding. These got the job done well and worked as carry-on luggage. Very light and easy to carry. 
21370 Very economical camera for the price. But not happy that the waterproof case was scratched up. Not able to have a clear video due to the scratches. Need to sell this accessory separately. 
21371 High quality and good to have extras. 
21372 Out of the package it didn t work 😠 
21373 Utterly underwhelmed. For the price, this camera is uninspired and heavily sand-bagged. Switching to A7Rii 
21374 Lint magnet! 
21375 Nice , cheap backup camera... 
21376 LOOVEEE IT so much! 
21377 Great replacements for the original! 
21378 Great! Works perfectly 
21379 Works great...;love it 
21380 so far so good 
21381 great 
21382 no good, go for phottix pls 
21383 For a starter its a good product and yes the stand is shaky as written by others. Overall its a good product in such a price 
21384 it fits good 
21385 Ok so i bought these because sony charges too much. The batteries work fine for average use. However if you need a battery to last as long as the sony one that the camera came with, I would not buy these. Just pay the extra money. 
21386 excellent telephone service from Walter relatively short wait time - wait time has been better in the past 
21387 Delivered on time and what a great product. All metal light weight body but heavy duty enough to handle the big jobs. It could have been a little taller but hence the 4 stars. 
21388 Works great thank you 
21389 Awesome unit. Great value. Works perfectly as described. Very handy on shoots! 
21390 Henry from customer service was incredible. He resolved my issues with my cameras both at my site and my remote site. Very satisfied with my cameras and Foscam 
21391 Great product easy to use, works as designed. 
21392 glad to find film for a special project 
21393 Great Value! 
21394 I love this camera and would not change it for the world. The customer service provided to me by Walter was professional and unrushed. It was perfect service and support. 
21395 Yhe dogs aren t happy. 
21396 I am an amateur, but I love photography. I now have a lens that gives me the ability to get great Micro shots. I love it, and I got it in 2 days. Bonus!! 
21397 Don t think, just buy. This camera is good enough to pay itself off with the freelance work it can create. 
21398 works great! used it on hard hats and sports caps, not too irritating on the head as well. 
21399 I use these batteries almost everyday. The original set I purchased is still going strong after 2years of continuous use. Added another camera to the setup and came right back to the same spot for batteries. Couldn t be happier. 
21400 functions as described. Additional memory is helpful for larger application. Requires some circuit reconfiguration to accommodate the lower board voltage. 
21401 It works fine. but the button is not soft like the camera of course. 
21402 best for prise!!! 
21403 thank you 
21404 cheap and effective 
21405 Nice, for light (not heavy) work. A little weak in the construction area...but for the price, an OK value. Easy to use and LOVE the portability. 
21406 I use these with my Smart Things system and it works pretty good. I ve noticed it misses quite a few motions. I m not super confident it is ability to pick up motion at the first past but eventually it sounds after a number of passes... 
21407 complicated as hell, instructions in googled english from chinese 
21408 the class was loose in the ring... rattled something horrible 
21409 Easy to setup, phone/pc controllable camera, works as expected 
21410 Great service. Great product 
21411 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21412 I still don t understand my first DSLR, but I ve already made magic with it. I m use to point and shoot cameras and almost DSLRs. I can t wait to learn how to use it properly, but once I learned to focus it, worked like clockwork. 
21413 I like it, but I hardly use this. it is too bulky to use as a transportable piece. It would be nice if I was stationary and left it up. But if that happened I would just build a wall. 
21414 I love the color, and the pictures are great! The product arrived quickly and just as stated. I am very happy with my purchase. 
21415 Good deal!!!! 
21416 What is not to love about instant photographs. All of the kids in 5th grade LOVE my &#34;old fashioned&#34; camera! 
21417 Only one worked ... Oh Well ... both took the charge but camera will not identify one of the batteries. Not the sellers fault. This has happen before so I chalk it up to the camera manuf. being propietary 
21418 Love this product. I have one in my car for my electronics and one in my house. Glad I have this as a safe way to clean my glasses, phone, and tablet. 
21419 Nice case. Phantom 3 and lots of extras fit perfectly. 
21420 Arrived on time with all accessories...everything just as promised. What an amazing drone, this technology has reached a remarkable price point for the capability and this seller will deliver. 
21421 I don t get the positive reviews. These are garbage. They last one week tops in a bark collar. 
21422 Very tough case. Traveled to Maui with no issues. Some of the comments said, that it comes with flash drives, but thats all lies. Its ONLY the case. 
21423 Didn t trust it to hold my expensive dslr, I ended up putting it on a smaller mirrorless instead. Even on this camera it cuts off circulation and is too tight. 
21424 Easy on screen protection 
21425 It broke at the foot right upon opening of package. And I m afraid to open the second package. :( What a disappointment. 
21426 Easy to install and configure the system. Worth the money. 
21427 Really helped alot 
21428 It works great and i love how the price was low but good dvr 
21429 excelente 
21430 Great Price, Fast Shipping 
21431 This Nikon lense does an outstanding job of capturing those long and difficult shots! 
21432 nice adapter and easy to set up 
21433 Fulfilling all expectations, very happy with the choice. 
21434 Got this for my daughter who loves it. Perfect for her Fugi film Instax photos. 
21435 Lights get dangerously hot way too fast. 
21436 Works really well. Accurately charges and doesn t overcharge. I don t have many charging at the same time, but it seems to work brilliantly 
21437 High quality good fit fair price good delivery 
21438 Hello, my only complaint has been that the dvr has stopped working after 7 months. Cannot find out if there is a warranty. 
21439 I used it during couple of my treks, outdoor shoots etc and its a great tool to protect your camera from rain, dust and snow. After some heavy use, some of the joints tore off. But its still usable. 
21440 Great alternative for the Nikon EN-EL4A that costs a lot more. The charge holds well over multiple cycles, which is a concern with aftermarket batteries. The full coding is good for battery metering. 
21441 works in my Lumix. Hope it lasts as long as the Panasonics. Seems to have high rating among many users. Sweet. 
21442 Just like a OEM charger. At a good price. And it charges quick. 
21443 The handle is light and really well made. The strap has a nice buckle which allows you to cinch the strap to minimize the chance of it coming off. Overall great quality and I highly recommend. 
21444 This pack has everything you d need at a really great price. Wish the case was a little bigger to hold everything it comes with but all in all a great package 
21445 Bubbles, bubbles, bubbles. 
21446 Great 
21447 it broke when tightened. 
21448 Great camera in good lighting, not so good at night. Over all not bad for the price. 
21449 very clear & great 
21450 This needs to 0 stars. This cable did not work at all. I have been busy and I need to find out how to return it. It was supposed to fit this camera. 
21451 Camera and accessories are great. But I m still waiting for the original Nikon camera manual. I won t buy from Al s in the future. 
21452 love it! 
21453 love the remote 
21454 This clearly states it s a 2 pack and we only received one! 
21455 Works great!!! This selfie stick is so easy to use. It works great with my iPhone 5 and it holds the phone tightly in place. It is made of good material and looks durable. Love using this selfie stick with family and friends. 
21456 Works like a charm and fits my battery. Exactly what I ordered. 
21457 A+ 
21458 Awesome, awesome, awesome my daughter loves it n takes everywhere, get the back door before going to the beach with it, better safe then sorry 
21459 very disappointed camera not showing cheaper cameras a showing better and as a professional installer i was very shocked not 850 TVL very blurry 
21460 The camera takes good pictures, but i am disappointed it does not have red-eye control, or control for shaky hands. My last Canon had both features 
21461 This is a pretty decent camera actually for the money! Very clear video and easy to use interface... It s not perfect but for the money I can t ask for more. 
21462 I ll never lose my camera lens cap again! 
21463 It s been over two years and still works perfectly even after I peeled it up and repositioned it 5 times. Battery died once. Only sad aspect is you can t change the tone length. Beeps 3 times for probably 4-5 seconds. 
21464 Would buy again 
21465 Ok 
21466 Awesome 
21467 I love this bag! It s light, fits my laptop has room for other stuff and travels great! 
21468 works as advertised. 
21469 I like this tool....glad to see that this cardboard technology is still used.. 
21470 Best sound ive heard after trying a few different mics. 
21471 Love this, and the fact it has multiple uses. I ve used it with my camera, and my microphone. Works great and is really stable and flexible. 
21472 Great accessory. Very strong lamp mount, will not go anywhere. 
21473 I m very proud of these items. These items arrived just in time as expected; I m very proud of them. 
21474 this product is just the right tool to eliminate the hard light on faces, I tried it with my little girl and they were able to handle the brightness. it is difficult to set it up on the LED light, but nothing that some Sticky backs can t handle. 
21475 They would have been nice if the collimation had been correct. I ended up getting the &#34;Nikon 7238 Action Ex Extreme 8 X 40 mm&#34; and I have been happy with them. 
21476 buy for a friend 
21477 Gets used every day at work. Easy point and shoot, or you can take movies. 
21478 Horrible design. Too short (I m 6&#34; feet tall) and the loops kept catching on my shirt everytime I pulled the camera up. 
21479 Works great. It is a little heavy. 
21480 Price was great and batteries are holding charge just fine. 
21481 Its cheap and nothing extraordinary about this. you get what you pay for.. which is mediocre 
21482 great set up in bag with &#34;cleaning&#34; sticker, and protector x2 and a large micro fiber cloth. good value, does the job. 
21483 Woks great with the camera. 
21484 this offers some really interesting perspectives. I use it with my telephoto lens. Tip: great for take large group selfies!!!! 
21485 took horrible pictures when it did work...most the time it wouldn t come on. 
21486 Excellent product. 
21487 I have bought Wasabi batteries for several cameras and I have never had a problem. They work just as well as the name brand, but cost much less. The included charger with international and car adapters is a nice plus too. 
21488 Just got - took about 10 minutes to setup, looks better than pics, good price, smooth operation, easy to use and pic quality is also good. If anything changes - will surely update this review. Thanks [owned it for only an hour] 
21489 A lot stronger than the case that came with it. 
21490 I loved this purchase. Seriously great quality items for a great price! AVAWO is where its going down!! 
21491 Yaaaaaaaaas, blows dust away from my sensor. My images are happy :) 
21492 This was just what I was looking for to replace old DVR. Works great. Had a small issue with viewing on phone but customer service talked me through it in a few minutes. 
21493 Never used it under water, the pictures are blurry on land what would it look like under water.. 
21494 Excellent, good prices and shipping time was quik, 
21495 This is a really great trialed for the price. Very easy to set up. Already enjoying it on my deck. Great company, shipped fast and safe. Would highly recommend. 
21496 product delivered as promised product as explained in description no problem 
21497 Awesome 
21498 I think it has all been said. I know of no downside to this lens. 
21499 Bought this for my dad and he loves it. It was easy to set up and he likes the remote control options. He shows this off whenever he has guests! 
21500 You get what you pay for.. mount secures well but materials are what you would expect for price. Even after securing screw better the hinge still has some play that will wobble on rough terrain. 
21501 Great Camera, good video quality, awesome accessories, exceptional value! 
21502 I love this funky camera. It takes flattering photos of people with its slightly soft focus and vintage tint. 
21503 the tripod works great but was damaged in shipping would buy again but from a different supplier 
21504 Camera came as advertised...like new...with a quick delivery turn around time 
21505 as described 
21506 Nice for the price and simple to set up. 
21507 don t buy it trust me. Waste of time and money!!! 
21508 I just purchased the camera and I can t even get the LED light to turn green so that I can connect it. I will be returning the camera. 
21509 Great camera! 
21510 one of the best N nikon lenses 
21511 good resolution, no space 
21512 holds my gopro securely to tthe tripod i have, and the camera slides easily in and out of the pegs. great product, shipped fast 
21513 looks like the real thing. Quality? Time will tell. 
21514 Fast delivery and a great deal! 
21515 Great value! Works just fine, good picture quality. Overall very satisfied with the purchase, especially with customer service. Received an extra battery when I notified that one of the batteries was not functioning! Overall a great buy! 
21516 Great tripod for I-Phone. Works well with 6 plus 
21517 I love it! Thank you! 
21518 Quality is okay but the bigger cover gets in the way of the lens if fully extended 
21519 Bought for the convenience and after one day at SDCC the strap keeps unhooking and I almost dropped my camera. I honestly would not recommend this strap, try another brand. 
21520 The last pack of 10 didn t come in the box, but it doesn t look like it was messed with! It arrived on time and I m super happy to have more film!! 
21521 good 
21522 perfect for the job I needed it for. 
21523 Haven t tested it under the conditions I plan yet, but setup and test runs worked great. Simple setup and good response; using a Sony A3000 
21524 The only difference between this cap and the one that comes with it is a rubber gasket! What a ripoff. Should have come with the camera in the first place. 
21525 Had trouble port forwarding the F19821P camera on a Netgear/Frontier DSL modem/router and called support. Richard, the tech support remotely accessed my computer and quickly resolved my problem. Great camera. I thank Foscam and Richard for the support. 
21526 The tech was very helpful & solved my problem Thanks 
21527 So far so good. Lots to learn about it yet. 
21528 The best fake camera on the market. It looks far better than the very cheap one being sold under a dozen names on Amazon. This one looks real! 
21529 very happy 
21530 FANTASTIC set! Love this portrait lens and all the goodies that came with it. 
21531 great kit to have for your trip 
21532 This grip fit my new 70D perfectly and shipped very fast. I am interested in extending my shooting time but the added controls on the grip will come in very handy. I m definitely a very happy customer. 
21533 it does seems to loose charge faster than factory battery. Great value for money can t go wrong with price I paid. 
21534 good protection 
21535 This is a wonderful little camera. There have been moments when I missed an eyepiece but outside that it has been very good. It takes excellent pictures, and it feels very well balanced in my hand. 
21536 My son loves this kit. Everything he ever needed for his GoPro, and more! 
21537 ok 
21538 Exactly what I was looking for. Thanks 
21539 I misplaced my orginal charger and this one is a good replacement. It somes with an accesory adaptor, USA and Eoropean power adaptor. Great bargain with two batteries. 
21540 as expected 
21541 good , fast shipping , that s great :) 
21542 They reflect light really well and the addition of 5 colors is really nice. 
21543 Great deal for a great camera! 
21544 Clear protection and great fit... Definitely recommended. 
21545 Quick shipping. Works great 
21546 I think this is pretty nice and although I only have a regular video camera, it is important because I might drop it like I always do to my phone 
21547 I don t have one of these monopods but all of the reviews below that I have read are not even for this item but some tripod!!!!!! This looks great to me especially for the price. 
21548 Best thing to hold both my Garmin AND my NyteRyder 600 headlight! 
21549 It work as advertise, all my old Minolta lenses work great in my Samsung NX500 and NX1100. 
21550 I really like this. Works well. 
21551 Good Product at the right price. They are a little on the lower quality end but they are not expensive either. 
21552 Simply magical difference in sharpness and color of photos now 
21553 bag was nice and very well padded. I didn t like the color as it was not as tan as the picture showed, probably due to flash. The bad is actually a weird brown color 
21554 Fogged up 15-20 minutes when camera was only exposed not submerged. Didnt fit my sony cybershot snug, had to really squeeze camera case to take pictures 
21555 Great lens. 
21556 This is a great lens hood. At first it was a little difficult to figure out how to put it onto my camera, but after I got it I ve been taking great photos. 
21557 Good fit,. Good replacement. Even survived the most horrific, mangled trip through the post office imaginable. 
21558 These were fantastic. Needed them for an impromptu fashion shoot and they worked perfectly. The giant CFL bulbs mimic daylight very well and that s what I used them for, to enhance the natural daylight on an indoors shoot. Easy, light, and flexible. 
21559 Couldnt get it to work. 
21560 Cables working great , been in use for a while. 
21561 Amazingly simple, Will probably get another set. I did swap the disk for a larger one. Mine came with a WD green drive. 
21562 Do not use this adpter with zeiss. It fried my zeiss Otus lens. It had to be sent back and the lens chip had to be replaced. the aperature could no longer be changed. 
21563 needed a small cable to plug into the back of my car radio , this fit the bill perfectly 
21564 Great bag 
21565 Nice protection 
21566 Bad, several of the item came broken, including lens, tripod, etc. 
21567 This is my third shell replacement. Works like a charm every time. The fact that it comes with screws is incredibly helpful, just in case. 
21568 Just got it for my Nikon Coolpix L840 - perfect size. I was going to get another bag for 3x the cost basically just because it was purple - glad I got this. 
21569 I suddenly lose lenses cap while travelling 
21570 This bundle really helped me in protecting my camera lenses. I always keep a spare cap 
21571 It funny that i haven t last the cap since i purchased the bundle! 
21572 Holds out for the entire worship service. We ll see if it will hold out for a nearly two hour cantata. 
21573 Very good glass. 
21574 Very helpful 
21575 Slightly off. 
21576 This allows me to have enough juice to record to the limit of the storage capacity. GREAT! 
21577 Great Value at a great price. I love it! 
21578 Nice case for what I wanted, which was a compact case to carry on occasion my D7000 with an 18 - 200 attached. This fits snugly without any extra room. 
21579 Exactly what I needed 
21580 Not good at all. Don t bother, save your time, energy, and money. 
21581 i like it 
21582 LOVE IT! using it for reviewing training tracks with my dog, works great, easily adjustable to other people also. 
21583 It s ok, I didn t realize that it didn t have a view finder for the eye. I am going to give the camera away to my daughter and try another one. 
21584 Goes with BG-E16 
21585 Works very well for my Application TY 
21586 The control just have approx. 10 ft of range, so I have to open the door to connect and disconnect the sensor. That s really does not work. 
21587 Great Lens, great sharpness and nice to low light and mid-telephoto lens. 
21588 Great 
21589 Does the job at a great price. 
21590 Waterproof camera, nope. First time used, Lid popped open, camera ruined. Lid is impossible to close. Call Coleman, they will not back product. Called elite brands who actually make the camera for a month straight, they will not call back. This camera is a waste of money. Do not buy. 
21591 it is wonderful. I have two. 
21592 Fits just as it s supposed to. Thanks. 
21593 Way too fun and very dangerous too 
21594 It wasn t with complet cable or (USB) I bought additional VGA USB from best buy. It doesn t have full instruction. Poor quality 
21595 Fits nicely on the headstrap. Headstrap with camera mounted doesn t even get close to being able to sink. Don t even notice the float pro attached when wearing the headstrap. 
21596 Good 
21597 Works great for the price. First one didn t fit and I received a new one that did fit the next day. 
21598 I use this to house a Sony CX-900 and it s just right for that size camera with the accessories I use with it. The lock is a bit of a joke but that doesn t matter to me. Excellent protection at a reasonable price. 
21599 Must have for securely holding backdrops. These clamps are durable and reach fully around frame bars. Highly recommend. 
21600 Great backup batteries for your GoPro. Would definitely recommend to anybody looking for spares. 
21601 Love the sleek and stealthy look of this housing. 
21602 I love buying in bulk because technically it s cheaper. still, pretty pricey but IMO it s worth it. 
21603 Nice looking backpack a must have IF you are traveling 
21604 Lots of fun 
21605 Nice 
21606 Haven t spent a great deal of time using it yet. Lots of options and settings so I m reading through the manual. It does a good job in low light. The most impressive thing so far is how fast it auto-focuses. 
21607 Still getting used to the camera and settings, so far it has been a great camera for the money! 
21608 Not a bad set of batteries and had them for about a year and they have been very successful 
21609 Just as advertised. 
21610 AGAIN YOU CAN T BEAT THE PRICE AND IT WORK S GREAT... 
21611 Fits t3i perfectly. So glad i bought this. 
21612 Awesome deal, so much fabric for your money, I am very happy with my purchase. 
21613 I bought it for my 31 yr. old son for his birthday and he liked it. I like making him happy. 
21614 Just developed my pictures from Curaco. Amazing. 
21615 Doesn t really work especially with small lenses. 
21616 works great, great value, price. 
21617 Picture quality and refresh rate could be better, but all in all, quite useful. 
21618 I rec d the product quickly, but it is NOT &#34;plug and play&#34;. I could not make it work so I sent it back. 
21619 Works great 
21620 The quality of the plastic is way below par. I wouldn t recommend this product. 
21621 Very easy to install. Hard screen protector. Highly recommend to anyone who wants to protect there screen. 
21622 Works well 
21623 Love this lens!! 
21624 Works great!! Set up process took less than 10 minutes. Video quality is great. Real time monitoring works well. 
21625 Works great. Nobody comes up my driveway unannounced anymore. 
21626 material and graphics were not as expected 
21627 These are worth every penny. Great for cleaning my laptop screen, cell phone screen and glasses. 
21628 Very handy accessory. I ll also use as a light source in my macro photography. 
21629 Holds a charge for a long time. 
21630 Good price. What more to say 
21631 Great item that is durable and easy to use! 
21632 perfecta 
21633 easy to operate 
21634 Didn t work at all 
21635 This tripod is the nicest tool for your filmmaking I used this were ever I go has good grip and it can hold my a7s with lens with no problems 
21636 So far working as advertised. No complaints 
21637 Very basic, but it does the trick when you want something lightweight and easy to carry. 
21638 Great value!!! 
21639 Works great, surpassed my expectations 
21640 bad 
21641 Works. 
21642 Great! 
21643 Super sick - Came quick! Would Buy again. 
21644 A++++++++++ 
21645 This is the second Altura UV lens filter that I have bought. I m happy with both. Great product for the cost! 
21646 My daughter loved all the accessories and would have been even better if it included the photo paper. 
21647 Awesome & reasonable product. Photoshopping after was a breeze and very clean. My pictures came out great !! 
21648 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
21649 rec d as promised and as advertised 
21650 Love it 
21651 Works great!! 
21652 Love the zoom...wish image was better stabilized at full zoom but still impressive... 
21653 Was not the color shown. This case is black. I really wanted the grey version. Still it s a pelican. 
21654 I dropped my gopro by accident still ok bec of this case. 
21655 The best Adult toy! Been having a blast using it with our children. Strongly recommend adult supervision with young children. 
21656 I had to return the Camera, but leaving a review because getting credited for the Square Trade warranty was quick and painless. Thanks! 
21657 Love it,want to order another one! 
21658 It works 
21659 Terrible, System stopped powering up after 2 months. Out of Amazon return time, and Zmodo is giving me the RMA run around. Get a better brands 
21660 Good product. But field of view is small 
21661 Nice quality for the price! My dad recently dug out his old tripod that was more expensive than this one, and you can tell that this one is cheaper. But even so, it will do the job nicely and feels stable enough. I m happy with it! 
21662 itwas everthing that I hoped for. 
21663 Goid as described 
21664 The charger and battery worked perfectly for my 10 year old camer. 
21665 great value 
21666 Does everything it s supposed to. I clip this on my belt, so I don t use the strap that comes with it. Construction seems good and it fits the camera nicely. So, nothing to fault this on, which qualifies if for 5 stars. 
21667 Works as expected, its a red light to use while you are in darkness using ones Telescope. I saves your night vision. 
21668 Excellent quality, still working great 
21669 Serves it purpose for the price 
21670 Great product for the money more than met my expectations. 
21671 This item does not charge the battery. 
21672 I purchased this item to photo small collectibles. They are easy to handle one handed therefore you can easily adjust the extra light one sometimes needs. 
21673 I could not find this anywhere! I have a Nikon Coolpix, and I lost this cable. It works just as good as the original. Good price for it too! Got here quickly. 
21674 This was a wonderful by die package! My wireless remote was not wireless though... But even with that alteration, you can t go wrong with all the gadgets you get with such a high quality camera for the price! 
21675 Excellent, delivered on time, was as described, great customer service (if contacted) 
21676 Excelente! 
21677 Wish it would mount on the lens backwards for better storage when not in use 
21678 Great product at great price. I have other systems more expensive cost and the same funcion. ZOSI results very easy to instal and friendly in web. The QR code is realy a goog idea to make an easy conection with my movil device. 
21679 Very handy to have while traveling. Was able to have battery life to film/photograph every second of the 4 dives a day for 7 days. These batteries seemed to last (Though I don t know for sure) longer than the GoPro branded one that came with the camera. 
21680 GoPro auto charger is very handy. 
21681 Worked great with IPhone 6 plus. 
21682 Ok cloths but not as high quality as other cloths I got with my new glasses 
21683 Great sound quality and nice and slim/light. 
21684 I got everything I was promised The package arrived on time well worth $19 and change...Jed 
21685 fell apart in a week 
21686 works great with my Sony alpha 3000 , it s water proof .Arrived in a few days, it s exactly what I needed 
21687 This looks completely real. Lights up nicely too giving the impression it is legit 
21688 I m going to keep it because I can make it work, but it is disappointing that the strap won t tighten up enough to stay on my wrist. Service and delivery was excellent. 
21689 Perfect. Reliable and easy to install. 
21690 Decent product for the money 
21691 works great cheap price. 
21692 Good! 
21693 Can anyone tell me how to get ahold of fujifilm? My camera came with no lens nor batteries? 
21694 works great!!!! 
21695 Love my new filter! Great service, thank you! 
21696 Will buy again 
21697 camera is beautiful BUT one setting (the house one) only draws out plain white pictures so just put it on another setting. 
21698 It works well I also going to buy the stunt man harness gives extra positions for the stuff I m into 
21699 They work very well 
21700 Batteries work as expected. And were really cheap! So 5⭐️ I guess. With a product like this, it can really only be either 5⭐️ Or 1⭐️ Either it works or doesn t. And the batteries do last a fairly long time. 
21701 Perfect! I have been looking for something like this FOREVER. Now I don t have to wear pants with pockets when I shoot =P 
21702 Great price, great service, and great quality! 
21703 Pretty good item 
21704 fantastic. used for a few months now, no issues. setup was a breeze if you know a little about technology. IR is WAY better than expected. truly commercial grade 
21705 Great camera to have. 
21706 Item arrived quickly in good condition. Easy to use. The mini tripod that came with it broke after a couple of uses. Overall nice product. 
21707 Standard military issue NVG mount. Hardware fits just right. We ll see how it lasts, but seems pretty sturdy. 
21708 What a great camera this has been. Small in size but it can take some great pictures! Plenty of settings and the video quality is good as well. Didnt think I would use the feature to transfer to/from my phone but it is handy 
21709 Good product, good delivery 
21710 Auto focus does not work on Tamron 150-600. Will be returning, not as advertised. 
21711 It was very good 
21712 Excellent 
21713 It didn t come with the blower, which I was looking forward for 
21714 Bought it as a gift which has brought joy and many thanks. 
21715 battery did not seem to hold its charge. 
21716 These are original props and fit perfectly! 
21717 Not exactly as I wanted but I am using it for past 2 years. Product is working 
21718 It works well :) 
21719 These last quite a long time when used to power a video light. 
21720 Solid construction, so far all ports work. Plugs up via usb. Love that feature since it allows me to charge all via external powerbank! 
21721 It works but is pretty rinky dink. I wouldn t put a really expensive flash on this. 
21722 Great little kit , would recommend ;) 
21723 Are you kidding me??? This is the best camera I ve ever purchased to date!!! 
21724 It s a battery 
21725 A small, fabulous camera with the bells and whistles of a professional s camera 
21726 Very light and easy to use. 
21727 My daughter love it,and I do also we took it to a trip and it s so cool to experience instant pic without been able to edit or repeat it 100 times.LOL 
21728 Thanks 
21729 I don t like typing 
21730 easy to install and use i have 3 cams.One died early but we have had a really wet summer 
21731 This mini tripod has amazing applications for specialized photo situations. 
21732 bought used mint condition pics are sharp couldn t be any happier with it 
21733 Super helpful for photographers like me! 
21734 good 
21735 Good product battery life low 
21736 This is a fun and must have accessory to any GoPro camera 
21737 The FloarPro looks like it is good quality, but I used this about twice and one of the plastic mounts snapped rendering it useless. 
21738 For hiking, catching a quick shot in the mist. This product is THE Best! 
21739 Good products I would like to get two more of them. 
21740 Great replacement battery. No issues, I used it to shoot a wedding and it held charge for the whole event. 
21741 Pretty nice tripod arrived a day early too 
21742 Low quality pictures 
21743 thought this was a bigger case, it won t fit my camcorder but it will be ideal for my camera 
21744 Good quality. Have had this for a few years now. 
21745 They are not a Clear view distributor. none of the product has warranty. Not approved by company. 
21746 I ve got to say, these filters definitely are worth the price! The package came in perfect condition, ad the filters work great, although the cool only works at a certain angle lighting and what not, but overall it is worth five stars!! 
21747 Great addition for the GoPro 
21748 Love it! Works great with my Nikon D3300 I just got. No more running to get in the picture in the allotted seconds! Makes for much more relaxed group photos! 
21749 Foscam cameras work pretty well for me, except I have been worried about hackers logging into my cameras. I just set up my 4th camera however and the customer representative named Walter was knowledgeable and professional. 
21750 Excellent control, does exactly as described. No problems yet! 
21751 Worked as replacement well 
21752 I bought this for my girlfriend and she loves it! She loves cameras and she tells me that the quality of these work perfectly fine! 
21753 It works. Light alum material. Works as advertised. Will buy again. 
21754 Fits perfect for 27 mm lense. Comes with polarzer and UV filters. Only dow fall is lack of compact holding case. 
21755 Amazing!!! Lighting is perfect and very easy to set up! 
21756 Organization, good. 
21757 This is a great little camera for the semi pto or starter. It is versitile, has almost all the same components as higher end cameras, and takes great shots. Money well spent! 
21758 works fine. 
21759 Fits my iPad Mini and is well made. 
21760 Good and fit just right 
21761 Had to modify a bit to fit on my tripod but it works perfectly 
21762 Bought these to replace a stock lens cap holder that no longer sticks. These fit the lens. No issues so far, and with the 10 pack, it s not a big deal if they don t end up being durable. 
21763 A very satisfactory product. worth the money spent on it. The picture clarity is amazing. Captures the minute details with perfection. 
21764 Great quality for this price. Fits perfectly for Canon Rebel T1i. 
21765 Fit my NX1000 stock lense perfectly. 
21766 Didn t work 
21767 This battery was perfect and just what I was looking for. This also shipped promptly and arrived when I was advised it would arrive. Thank you. 
21768 love it! 
21769 Very good! 
21770 I love it! 
21771 I am still learning to use this camera but I have already took some very good quality pictures and the zoom is impressive. I am very happy with this purchase 
21772 Came quick and did the job. 
21773 Great value for the money. 
21774 Extremely Poor Image resolution. We were very glad we tested this before going on our trip. Spend the extra few bucks on the GoPro hero and you will be as thankful for the decision as we were. 
21775 going to use this for a guest book for my grandmothers 90th birthday. got it today and tried it out... took everything for me to not use all the film :) 
21776 Great and fast way to capture moments. It s so fun to take pictures with this camera! The product is exactly as described and adorable! 
21777 Not worth the money 
21778 I have Canon 6D and I couldn t get it to work even after spending 3 hours trying to adjust it. 
21779 No problems, delivered quickly 
21780 got this for my mother in-law who lost hers. it was exactly whatt she needed and she was vary happy with it 
21781 Great product! 
21782 Must have for any go pro user 
21783 I love this camera! I can t say enough good things about it. Handy size. 
21784 Great product 
21785 Love using this reflector in my photography!!! 
21786 Arrived as expected and works well. 
21787 Love my Nikon. Easy to use and great pictures. 
21788 Love this purchase! The camera works lovely, looks nice, and the pictures turn out great. Really brings back memories using this camera, so happy with it! 
21789 Thanks 
21790 ... perfect size for my unit... and not that easy to get anywhere... 
21791 Everything works as described. This is one of my most important toolset to own. Love it. 
21792 Superfast service and superb quality from this company - this is excellent &#34;no news&#34; news, I d say. You will, too. 
21793 http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NBNJZEK?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00 
21794 Perfect, just what I wanted. 
21795 is very good 
21796 work with my hero 3 blk 
21797 Great product. It is everything I need 
21798 This one works great. 
21799 In answer to a posted question, yes. this is a true FX lens and a superb one. It works beautifully with my d810 as well as being an excellent portrait lens with my d7100. 
21800 The case appeared decent but the top clip had chipped so no use. Quality control issue. Returned for refund and getting different brand soon. 
21801 Love this camera. Works really well. Still reading through the owners manual there is a lot to learn. I love the built in wifi though, such a great feature! 
21802 Does its job for website photography for our shop. Quality is on the cheaper side, but it s fully functional and so far its been reliable. I ve had it about 8 months now. No problems. I use it for product shots. 
21803 Its wire for a specific function. What more can I say? 
21804 These cameras are Awesome! Unbelievable clarity, and capability to pan and zoom. They ROCK! 
21805 The protector seems to be of a high standard. I may just have been lucky, but the application process went smoothly. No scratches noted so far, and no bubbles. Overall, very satisfied. 
21806 Great! 
21807 Just recieved my new Drone for my son, he absolutely loves it. Great first Drone for someone starting out flyine one.. 
21808 This product does not support the 5-in-1 diffuser made by the same company.I couldn t get it to stand up with the diffuser attached. the legs didnt open wide enough (they never do, do they?) and didnt offer enough support. It constantly fell over as soon as I let go. 
21809 I tell everyone to buy these as baby monitors because they re much better and cheaper than the average or even top-of-the-line baby monitors. 
21810 good product 
21811 Great props! Aircraft even seems more stable and quiet. 
21812 Received on time and packed very well. I charged both batteries and tested them in my new Sony camera and they worked perfect. I recommend this item. 
21813 Waste of money 
21814 Exactly what I wanted it works with the car charger as well, if you have more then one battery I would highly recommend buying one of these, I have no problems with this product at all 
21815 I tried the X-rite on my Mac Book pro and my colors are still bad. Then I tried with an external monitor, A 27&#34; View-sonic VX2703MH-LED and see no change at all. I created a new user, the profile is just perfect. 
21816 Very useful for road riding for beginners 
21817 This slider is great for the price! It s really helped me grow a lot. It s sturdy too! 
21818 Was smaller than what I needed, but would make a nice office desk decor 
21819 Thanks 
21820 Product was delivered as promised and it was exactly as pictured and described. Will order from Digital Goja again in the future. 
21821 As far as I ve seen this little thing should come with a piece (adapter / marker) to set it properly.. Well!! Good news doesn t come with it, so now I have to invent by myself how assemble it. 
21822 Great piece does what I need it to do. Not sure how the auto focus is because I am using a manual focus lens with it. 
21823 Not expensive, comes with a double side charger. Works well with my Xiaomi YI. 
21824 This frame is great! I haven t had it long so I haven t programmed it for all the things it can do, but I have read the manual and I look forward to taking advantage of all the great features! 
21825 It is perfect!!! so compact and works great. Came just in time to charge for my trip to the Oregon Coast with the family! Can even charge in the car!!!! 
21826 Great product - fast delivery!!!! 
21827 Great company. The security cameras are perfect. Built to last. The picture quality is very nice, night vision is incredible. 5 star 
21828 Excellent 
21829 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. 
21830 Needs styrofoam backing to make it fit GoPro 
21831 Looks good, comfortable to use and my camera can fit nicely into it. 
21832 1 camera worked the second would never turn on. 
21833 Good 
21834 have had limited usage yet but seems great - especially for the price 
21835 it takes a fulls second to catch up when you look left or right. i would not recommend these glasses. 
21836 terrific unit..great quality for the price...range 1,000 ft !!!!! 
21837 Great product! 
21838 very good performance 
21839 bought this for my wife maybe a little more than she can handle but a very nice camera. 
21840 Love the look and no more back pain from my previous slings! My favorite camera harness yet. Great for women with larger bust lines. Only slight issues with loose clothing getting caught and pinching of skin when not wearing sleeves. 
21841 Great 
21842 do not ever use proper cardsthey don t work and you re screwed if you do use them 
21843 I like it. I am excited to use it when my is at college and I can see him and talk with him. 
21844 Replaced my 832 that died. Works great. 
21845 Just what I needed. 
21846 Not happy about how Amazon recommends this with the Meike 910 and it doesn t work with it! When it did light up, I found it didn t make a difference with my flash and now the battery pack won t power up at all. 
21847 The chopper came dysfunctional; two propellers gave out after the 2nd flight. I went to return it, but there return policy expires the day after you received it. BEWARE of the return policy, it s not enough given time to return it. 
21848 Really cool little camera. Great fun to use. Pulls you into the world of creative videography. Fun!, Fun!, Fun! 
21849 I realy like thar it also came with a car charger adapter. 
21850 great for traveling 
21851 I have an issue. I bought these a few months ago and everything worked perfect besides one pack! The last pack is inside the Polaroid but nothing comes out. I am pissed about this. 
21852 Great brace. I use it with a set of very large x56mm objective binoculars. I set the brace up to sit where my abdomen meets my sternum or atop my Alaskian Guide Creations bino pack. 
21853 Alvin Mathhews was very good and a gentlemanvery patient and knowlegeable 
21854 GREAT camera! 
21855 They charge fast and last forever running a 7in HD IPS field monitor. The included 12v adapter provides charging in the field where there is a cig lighter or 12vDC acc plug. 
21856 Works great looks great 
21857 the system works great.. but the Uniden App is totally lost.. Uniden Company needs to fix this ASAP 
21858 For it s size, this is incredibly durable. Most small &#34;travel&#34; tripods are cheap junk. This isn t. I love it. 
21859 nice nice 
21860 item was same as description. The shipping was fast. I would recommend this seller. item not that great 
21861 Waste of your money. Would not recommend buying this product. 
21862 This is quite a nice addition for my portable video shoots of presenters using a curtain backdrop. The bulbs can be replaced with brighter ones if needed. Good quality materials and the videos are greatly improved using the lighting setup. 
21863 The camera is cute and perfect starter camer for my tween daughter. She s learning all the modes and is inspired to take good photos. This will help her be on her way! 
21864 ok 
21865 I recieved this as a gift to replace a very old HEAVY tripod. It is a great replacement, much lighter to carry but holds my Nikon D3300 great! 
21866 I couldn t use the power button or the side button that switched it from vibrate to ringer once the case was on. 
21867 this product is a great replacement item for the one that came with the camera. 
21868 works great with camera 
21869 This is the Fuji flagship ttl flash for the x-series cameras... It s pretty limited in features, the lcd user interface is pretty terrible, has no slave mode (infrared, optical, or otherwise) it s only getting 3 stars because it does get the exposure settings right 
21870 Works good. 
21871 I ended up returning this item ONLY because it was not appropriate for the size of our system. Otherwise, it provided a nice spotlight for our cameras. 
21872 Work as advertised. It s nice to have backup power when making a long hike or bicycling trip. 
21873 good camera for the price, will recommend to friends. 
21874 Tris is a pes of s*** i was flaing around 200m and The drone fail down because a stall motor 
21875 I just need the nuts 
21876 I am loving this monitor right now. Super clear. For the price I am getting exactly what I needed. The refresh rate at times is delayed slightly but other than that I am satisfied with this purchase. Fast shipment as well. 
21877 Quick delivery from Amazon,Drone sucks NO directions,NO parts sheet,NO tec support,High priced junk,China crap BUY AMERICAN 
21878 Kinda cheap. You have to be directly in front of the camera which makes it not that valuable to me. Would not buy again. 
21879 calvin was great help 
21880 I have purchased two of these for my cameras. It was two of the easiest installations I have ever made. It goes on so quickly and before you know it is attached to the screen just as pretty as you please. 
21881 good stuff 
21882 Works great. It charges the battery very quickly. I d purchase again. 
21883 Perfect replacement battery form my older Olympus camera. 
21884 This is the perfect camera for my wife to get into photography with. 
21885 This camera works well, although it s limited as far as it s monitor capability. It s battery life is good and it take excellent high quality shots. I didn t like the menu structure and that is perhaps the biggest challenge. However its great for action 
21886 Worked and fit like original Canon Batteries 
21887 This arrived broken. I realize that it is inexpensive, but I didn t expect it to arrive already broken. It was unusable to me for the project for which I ordered it. 
21888 Haven t had to use it yet, but good to have! 
21889 The software stinks, poorly designed with no real instructions. While it does work, if doe s not my needs. 
21890 Fine 
21891 Ok for the price but NOT 32X. I tested it against my 10x Vortex monocular and it s magnification is less than the Vortex. It appears to be 8x, which is nowhere near 32x. I guess for the money it s not too bad for an 8x monocular. 
21892 amazing bag, tough and well organised 
21893 Easy to set up. Worked good. Shipping slow. 
21894 One battery died in a month or so. 
21895 The cameras are not wireless. So you have to have a plug wherever you place them which means they can not be DISCREET. 
21896 It s an eye cup. Nothing much to say about it. Replacement for one that fell off. 
21897 Excellent!!! Perfect time to arrive sooner than they promise .... Love it !!! 
21898 Great product, worked as described. Just what I needed. 
21899 This filter works great for long exposure photography. I really like the Lee system. You must learn how to use these filters properly, but when you do, you can get some outstanding photos. 
21900 charged the batteries up works great 
21901 For the price I didn t have very high expectations....that was a mistake! it exceeded all my expectations. About 2 seconds after I unpacked it I had it up and running...so simple to use 
21902 Enjoying this lens, I live where there are a lot of wildlife (deer, bobcats, turkeys, foxes etc) and I have gotten some great shots with this lens without spooking the animals. 
21903 The best 3-axis tripod I ve ever used. Very intuitive, strong, durable and functional. Not cheap, but worth the investment. Try buying 3 cheap ones and compare that to the cost of one nice one! 
21904 Excellent 
21905 Just a perfect purchasing experience: item was in stock, treated to timely delivery, and worked as expected lot of the box. No issues atoll; highly recommended. 
21906 Good Product. 
21907 great buy...a few dings but works perfectly !!!! 
21908 Works very well. 
21909 Small compact great product. 
21910 Love it! I also purchased the cell phone mount for my note 4 and it totally fits my needs! 
21911 just what I needed 
21912 They re poor quality and didn t seem to be put together properly, some louder than others, some batteries came dead and had to be replaced. Some people are saying there s a feature to make them ding when the door opens. Mine have 2 options, On/Off that s it. 
21913 Does what it is supposed to do. I don t think it needs extended review... 
21914 Happy with my purchase. 
21915 Great, still works perfectly after about 4 months 
21916 Bought as a replacement for another brand s replacement plastic latch. So far this one has done the trick! It might be a bit heavier but it is both strong and doesn t look loud like other colors of anodized aluminum 
21917 Excellent videos recorded and simple set up. 
21918 It has a great build made of metal only. The screw for the hotshoe unscrews easily so the whole thing swivels often. 
21919 This is a great little camera. Everything I expected. Happy with the purchase! 
21920 Charges as quickly and as well as original in first my two uses. Thicker than Canon original but not as wide; still fits in my bag easily. Haven t tried car adapter yet. 
21921 Works well and good price. 
21922 Honestly, I was super surprised by the quality of this bag. This bag is EXCELLENT for a amateur photographer (like me!) :) and $24.99?! The canon equivalent of this bag at best buy is at least $60! 
21923 I own two of these, great price I ll keep buying them for shure. 
21924 Slips off the strap too easily 
21925 Easy to install in wood as long as you don t hit buried screws or nails. Unobtrusive. 
21926 This stand doesn t hold more then 4 pounds. 
21927 Works great! I used on a 10hr plane ride to make a timelapse (http://andrewferguson.net/2015/08/15/seattle-to-heathrow-time-lapse/) and I had no issues. For $5, you can t go wrong with this. 
21928 Doesn t have a button to take picture 
21929 worth every penny!! plug into your camera and record the future... 
21930 Best accessory investment I have made as an amateur photographer! 
21931 Kenneth was very professional and helpful and knowledgeable in setting up my Foscam camera on my computer and my smart phone. Easy to understand and knows his Foscam products well. Thank you 
21932 super 
21933 every thing ok 
21934 I ve had the system installed a couple of weeks now. For the price this thing is feature loaded. Does what it is supposed to do, easy install, customer support very helpful. 
21935 Works as advertised. Gave me great time lapse photos. 
21936 Very pleased 
21937 Great case when you don t want to carry around a lot of gear. Durable, well made. Stable base - can set it down and it won t topple. Suspension cradles camera and accommodates many lens sizes. 
21938 Very nice item to give as a gift! Thrilling to see &#34;baby&#34; pics with the gift I gave :) Quality materials...very pleased with this product for gift giving! 
21939 Nice Lens 
21940 It works fine--a little cumbersome to program until you get the hang of it. Range to receiver is quite short so positioning it at the end of the drive was difficult. 
21941 Everything works good 
21942 Love it! 
21943 thank you 
21944 It is good and delivery time was great 
21945 Very handy octopus cable (well, quadrapus) for powering multiple low-draw devices from one source. 
21946 The product excellent! Arrived on time! Love it. 
21947 Great batteries last longer than my original cannon battery. 
21948 Amature Photographer....It s a lot of stuff for the price. If you purchase this stuff separately you re going to pay 3x as much the flash is $60+ alone. I m having fun learning about all the different filter and playing with the lens. no problems with any of it 
21949 It does not work. It does not charge the battery. 
21950 I m very pleased with the flash and I feel the seller did a great job..... 
21951 the body camera, lense and other items are very good but I received a wrong usb cable which is from Canon and that cant t fix with my camera!! I need the right brand and fix one. please replace it. 
21952 Thea s blades are fairly balanced and arrived on time. I have used them off and on for a few weeks and have seen them take quite a beating. 
21953 The video and audio is amazing on these glasses I was very amazed how good they work and for a great price. 
21954 These slide were great! We used them for a STEM Day Camp and the youth loved them. 
21955 Fast setup, easy to tote around, perfect for me. 
21956 roduct as described received on schedule. 
21957 FYI.....There s a $200 rebate from Panasonic on this camcorder AG-AC90APJ. The last three letters must be APJ to qualify. http://www.bhphotovideo.com/FrameWork/Rebates_Promos/093015_PANA10_070115.pdf 
21958 The bottom, where the weights are, just slide off. Almost dropped my camera. TERRIBLE, DO NOT BUY THIS! 
21959 great product 
21960 This fit my camera correctly and works very well for the price. 
21961 Feels cheap but works, worried about it breaking 
21962 No instruction. Pass up 
21963 Junk ! the Bluetooth function doesn t work. I guess you get what you pay for. 
21964 This lens is much slower to focus and much louder (on my Sony A6000) than I had anticipated. I returned it and got the 35mm Sony, and I m much happier. 
21965 Perfect! 
21966 The tripod good for non DSLR camera, the bag it is very nice & the wire shutter release good for small DSLR like Nikon D3200 
21967 Excellent Product! 
21968 These items arrived in perfect condition and will be used by teachers in outdoor classroom science! 
21969 Had trouble closing binos enough to fit my eyes. 
21970 this item was delivered very fast and it works perfect. thanks 
21971 camera came promptly and is very helpful. great purchase. 
21972 Great case. Great build. Fits camera perfectly. 
21973 Works great for quick, on-the-go shoots! Easy to carry and set up. Recommend for sure. 
21974 just what I expected 
21975 I bought Two of these cameras to monitor and watch my dogs when I am at work. They are fantastic not only can I see the dogs but I can talk to them through the camera. 
21976 Awesome camera. 
21977 Sturdy and working great! 
21978 Used at water park, in lazy river and down big slides. Easy to hold no matter how many twists and turns. Worked great! 
21979 Love this frame! It helps a great grandmother feel in touch with everyone. Anyone would love this frame! Looks great and is easy to work. 
21980 this good price 
21981 Exactly what I expected to purchase. A little on the thicker side which is great. 
21982 Excellent camera, good security 
21983 Loved my purchase but it was used and the battery only lasted so many times before I packed it away. 
21984 I truly live this and will certainly recommend it to others 
21985 Perfect 
21986 Great accessory for the Go Pro ;) 
21987 If you can get the adjustments just right, this stabilizer is as good as they come for the doe. 
21988 works as expected 
21989 Works on my motorcycle, and fits my off brand GoPro knockoff 
21990 Great buy! 
21991 GREAT DEAL!!!!!!!!!! 
21992 OK - but too light to hold a Canon 5D Mk 3 with macro &#34;65&#34; lens. 
21993 Product did not keep the settings after several attempts to change them. Did not want to order another in event problem still existed with a new one. Looked cool though.. Went with a different dash cam that has worked great. 
21994 It seems like a pretty decent quality light bag. It keeps the light out. I m a little concerned the zipper is going to break, it feels very flimsy. 
21995 Unfortunately, this NVR was not compatible with my existing cameras and I Han to return it. The return process went very smoothly. 
21996 Perfect for the Sony NEX5T! 
21997 Good strong quality, much better than the cheap knockoffs. 
21998 excellent 
21999 Very easy setup, decent picture day and night, pan works well, half the price of others that don t have as good software. 
22000 Have it on my desk in the office. Gets lots of compliments for its clarity. 
22001 Used the camera on a recent 7 day cruise to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island. Took many great pictures. I really like the12x zoom and the camera s small size.It tucks away in a shirt pocket, but has the features of a much larger camera. 
22002 The image is better than my old cameras. 
22003 Definitely worth its money in twofold. sharp,accurate, light, easy to use. A good choice for an amateur I d say 
22004 Plate dose not have a griping strip on its surface causing plate to loosen from the lens ( Tamron 150-600 ) mounting base. Must carry Allen wrench for insurance while on a shoot. 
22005 Thank you. 
22006 Didn t expect much. Got what I paid for. Have used it for a few weeks with no problems. Attaches and removes easily. Just beware that you may pick up some silhouetting when fully extended. 
22007 This fits nicely around the body of my Nikon D5300. The silicon is a little slick, hopefully that won t last, as it is just that little bit slippery to the touch. It looks like all camera functions work perfectly, I m very happy with it. 
22008 Received as described and prompt shipping. Fits my Nikon D3200 perfectly and protects the LCD screen. 
22009 Fits tight on a 35-70 f/3.4 zoom, just like all the pro adapters I have bough from Fotodiox. A little too tight in that it s somewhat hard to remove from that lens, but not really a problem. 
22010 I only had it for a short time. I could not get it to work at all so I sent it back same day. 
22011 Does as advertized. Very sturdy and the length is perfect--though it is adjustable. This is my default, go to GoPro accessory. I have had it soaked in water and flailed around by friends yet no damage to the fabric at all. 
22012 It all went fine 
22013 Excelent for X-E2! forget the lensmate equivalent. 
22014 Perfect background for photos! Great quality. 
22015 Does all I want it to do and more!!!!! Very pleased with this purchase, THANKS AMAZON!!!! 
22016 The door of Fuji film s5000.3.1mp battery not working 
22017 It s thick black aluminum, and it s great! 
22018 Great lens. I use it with a D3100 at the moment. The wide aperture is great, I recommend a protective filter though because it would be very easy to scratch. 
22019 Vinyl is thick enough, but the product is not affixed the the cardboard core. Would also, be nice if the core was a larger size. Fair value product. 
22020 Usage very good can charge canon batterys as well 
22021 😀 
22022 Excellent 
22023 Great case, built really well. Fits my gopro hero4 perfectly. I would definitely buy more of their products. 
22024 I love my GoPro, Great quality, and great price for an awesome camera to last for a very long time! I use mine primarily for motorcycle rides. 
22025 Love it 
22026 this flash is great. 
22027 It protects very well, but you must observe their instructions for installattion re: eliminating all dust....I have a couple of small dust particles underneath that can t be removed... 
22028 A+ recommended to everyone. 
22029 never loss it in the ocean! 
22030 Excellent product. Received as promised schedule. 
22031 Great camera! A few accessories are unnecessary and probably will never be used, but overall I m very happy with the camera! 
22032 Works great! 
22033 Works as expected 
22034 Battery last long, remain full capacity after almost a year of using 
22035 Works great. At first had some issues with tilting to the left, but I contacted the manufacturer and following their detailed instructions was able to fix the tilt and stabilize correctly. Beware you need Windows PC to do that. It does not work with Apple. 
22036 This is ideal to keep from loosing a lens cover. I have been very pleased with it. 
22037 One of the screws that holds the umbrellas is bad, the screw will not move. 
22038 Excellent photo capture in the water, under the water or in the dry. Love it. 
22039 I feel this flash shoe umbrella holder is among the best. All metal construction, it solidly and securely holds my flash equipment. This is a well made product. 
22040 Would easily have given 5 stars if they had one additional feature, zoom. Otherwise an excellent value for the money paid. I purchased the factory reconditioned units, (same warranty as new), and am most pleased with their operation. 
22041 I bought others which don t hold a charge but these do. Higher priced but worth it. 
22042 The softbox very heavy for the the bracket, and the bracket start to bend in some area.!!! abd I could not tilt the softbox because of the weakness of the bracket and the totally wrong design. 
22043 Fits perfectly - excellent condition. 
22044 Just what I have been looking for. I have family photos that span the early 1900 s up to today. 
22045 I LOVE IT. works really well. blue nobs works well. awesome rig. could improve the barn doors for foldability. 
22046 This is the 3rd camera like this I have bought. I keep dropping them! It takes great pics and it s very close to professional for an auto digital. 
22047 Eyepiece would not screw into camera platform. I had to glue it? Not. Good!!!!!! 
22048 These are great. I ve used this brand for several years..all batteries and chargers are working like new 
22049 Works great for my CCTV cameras. 
22050 Great Product ! fit perfectly on my Olympus E-PL6 that mount on any Nikon Ais lenses , no regret purchase it 
22051 Tripod works great! Remote works great! Great deal! 
22052 Protects very well at a cost of making the camera bulkier. Excellent quality 
22053 Very nice, sharp. 
22054 Had an issue with the original hardware and was shipped one out to replace it immediately. Thank You! 
22055 This item is sturdy, strong and definitely worth the price. 
22056 Really nice! Quick shipping also 
22057 Worst tripod I ve ever used. Outside of it being very wobbly, the legs never extended properly. Just cheaply made in my opinion. 
22058 works great 
22059 Really like this speed light 
22060 I really like this camera case! So glad that I bought it! Fits my camera perfectly as described. 
22061 Love this case. Everone compliments it too. Looks very classy in white! I would highly recommend it. 
22062 Good 
22063 Other than the no on/off button or switch, it s great and easy to use. I ve never used a timer before, and I am a new DSLR owner, but I was able to figure it out with a quick glance at the manual (a REAL quick glance lol). 
22064 Fits good. 
22065 Can someone remind me why I bought this. Unless you have used it do not buy it(I would recommend Polarize filter). 
22066 Great film deal. Gift for my granddaughter. 
22067 I don t recommend this product. I think a gel filled strap or a single air cushion feels better than these mini air cushions. I m going to return this product. 
22068 They worked for me. 
22069 Great Product!!! Received promo code for a review!!! 
22070 Good for the price. ... easy to install 
22071 camera perfect 
22072 Performs as advertised. Very Satisfied. 
22073 My daughter loves it. She can share her pictures instantly with her friends. 
22074 works good. but made out of hard plastic. gopro floats 
22075 Nice price 
22076 as good as oem and cheap 
22077 Not good product. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. 
22078 Good lens hood. It makes a difference for my Camera 
22079 Great product 
22080 Broke within first use 
22081 Hi,i received your product.It s perfect and very convenience,thank you./. 
22082 This crap doesn t work! It s a scam! 
22083 Good used 
22084 Compact and fits the Cannon Powershot well. 
22085 Ok 
22086 Fantastic camera. I used it with the Olympus underwater housing and got really good pictures while diving. I also used it as a handy point and shoot while travelling around if I didn t want to pull out my SLR. Nice sharp clear pictures. 
22087 Perfect! 
22088 if went out 
22089 The color is not the best 
22090 Amazing flash for starters and pros. Couldnt be happier with this flash. Well built and amazing features. I wud go with the panasonic enloop battieries black battieries i have confirmed they are the best for this flash. 
22091 Great for my cine lens 
22092 Had it now for quite a while. I also have a bunch of Profoto gear and although its not as good quality wise it is great for the money. 
22093 Good item.Fits well. 
22094 Wish that I had been aware of the vector effect. More than likely, will seldom use 
22095 Worst microscope I ve ever bought. 
22096 If you own a D750, this is a must own. The batteries will last for multiple photo sessions or a long day of wedding shooting. The plus side is also that it helps balance the camera with larger lenses (ie 28-70 2.8). 
22097 This lens is now my new favorite lens. Very sharp and a great price! 
22098 great product. 
22099 Great price for a well built filter. 
22100 The sticky gizmo to adhere to the lens cap didn t stick for very long. 
22101 Love it! 
22102 THEY WORK PERFECT 
22103 There was a minor cosmetic issue with the case. I contacted the seller and they handled it in the best possible way. Thanks! 
22104 Great quality camera! Gives me a piece of mind when I m not at home. Highly recommended! 
22105 Works perfectly with my Hero 4 Silver. A must have GoPro accessory. I scratched the lens on accident and CamKix replaced the whole kit at no cost. 
22106 These batteries are working well. They appear to rival the stock batteries in runtime. The charger can be powered by AC or in a car cigarette lighter, which makes it super convenient. 
22107 Great! 
22108 It s what I needed. 
22109 Perfect case for traveling because of its compact size and brief case like handle. Organizing slots make it ideal to store accessories and extra batteries. 
22110 This is a good quality case, but it s too small to hold all my GoPro accessories. Glad I didn t order the small! 
22111 Many options with this kit! Love it all. 
22112 It doesn t fit the lens even though they had my camera listed. Be wary. 
22113 Great for multiple size lenses and even storing other gadgets and cords. 
22114 Perfect Tripod Ballhead! 
22115 I bought the go pro brand because it was designed specifically for the go pro. Im not a fan of the aftermarket stuff that will melt inside your camera and ruin it. 
22116 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
22117 Was as good as described 
22118 for every 10 shots, you may got 2-3 that don t develope well. doubt it s the lighting as i ve taken it in the same location. 
22119 This was a gift 
22120 Fast shipping, works great, made well! 
22121 Excellent 
22122 make sure you just get good lighting, or it might be fuzzy 
22123 Works! 
22124 Exactly what I want 
22125 Lasted about a year and died in a barely used safe. Prior factory battery lasted 4 years. Find another brand, this stuff is garbage. 
22126 Love love love this set! Tons of fun, and felt like I got my money s worth. 
22127 Excellent case - and very affordable. Best deal I have located for my camera. 
22128 Thank you very much! 
22129 Great buy 
22130 The clamp is as good as the GoPro one. However, the gooseneck is too long and wobbles more than the GoPro one. 
22131 This was my first security camera system purchase after extensive research. This is a great product that works right out of the box. The remote viewing devices connected via internet works perfectly after looking at the video instructions. I m am very impress with the clarity of the night vision. 
22132 Very sturdy and well built. Great buy. The only downside is that it has plastic knobs to crew the flash in. So far so good though. 
22133 Very nice no problem god for price 
22134 completely discontent control does not work ... not to do ... the product without control is completely useless 
22135 One of the packs did not even work. 
22136 Purchased 4 of these, no problems, adds additional indication of security 
22137 Exactly what I needed. Fit perfectly and clicked down. Lives on my camera now. 
22138 Good products 
22139 Works for my panasonic luminx zs21. Snug fit and not the easiest to use controls on camera, but functional and keeps my camera dry. No black ring around lens for this camera. Fits well. 
22140 This doesn t fit with the standard go pro mounts and other accessories. Almost ruined my case attaching it 
22141 Excellent value. Exactly what I wanted. 
22142 Doesn t fit 
22143 Great product. Holds all of my lenses. Fits in my camera bag with ease! 
22144 This is an awesome product specifically for transporting camera equipment. It is well padded with several compartments for lenses etc. 
22145 Worked will with some binoculars that were purchased. Great for a strap replacement. 
22146 Really nice product with amazing customer service, definitely recommend 
22147 Very sturdy. Perfect. 
22148 Junk; only used three times and then it stopped working. Lost receipt so couldn t do anything about it. :(( 
22149 1 battery for the DJI Phanton 2-3 is NEVER enough. You will want to buy a few of these. The are wonderful quality. 
22150 Works great. Thanks. MauistyleAloha.com, Sk8Maui.com TexasStyleSkateboarding.com 
22151 Excellent packaging. Arrived on time. No issues. Product is exactly what I was hoping for. 
22152 Super-Duper. But very spotty so I suggest you use a diffuser like the Micnova Gel Softbox with it, and you can change the color temp with the softbox too with the included gels. Battery lasts a very long time. 
22153 Fast shipping. Product as described 
22154 Quick charging times and also very compact. 
22155 Best camera for the price, pictures are clear and the camera is very easy to use. I do a lot of nature shots with moving animals and have had very good results. 
22156 Fantastic little lens for m4/3. I ve been using it for street photography as well as recording choreography and it s performed flawlessly for me so far. 
22157 good products! 
22158 Easy to set up and takes great quality videos. 
22159 The product is exactly what I was anticipating. 
22160 Best investment I ve made so far aside from my lenses and camera. 
22161 Waterproof case broke after one use. 
22162 It works well, but these Arlo accessories are a bit over priced in my opinion. 
22163 Does the trick and a doesn t break the bank. 
22164 Bought two additional camera s and they work exceptionally well. They are easy to install, great pictures on the unit. Very pleased and if you starting our on home surveillance, this a good starter product. 
22165 books are not lifesize, looks more like it belongs in a childrens playroom. not suitable for theater or adults. 
22166 Honestly, I love this camera so much. Easy to travel with .Burst photo mode, Wi-Fi capabilities is awesome! 
22167 Worked perfectly for the beach and keeping water out off my camera but I was too worried to submerge it under water to really test it. 
22168 Did not work 
22169 I own the plastic waterproof bag for a while, and I just found out there is a float strap that really makes my phone stay. I got one from UP Program as a free review sample. I have tried it, and it works. 
22170 Love this lens on all the different zoom levels. 
22171 Very nice size and easy to adjust the legs for great shots. 
22172 A little more user friendlier than the Sony - Sonys moreso for filmmakers. 
22173 Works perfectly and came a lot sooner than I expected. 
22174 Very good just a wee bit heavy 
22175 Protects my camera so well along with being very fancy. 
22176 I had to research this camera from other websites to get it figured out. the software is cryptic... trial and error Needs a 48 volt supply with a POE injector... Live and learn Still trying to figure out how to change the ip addresses... The manual is totally USELESS. 
22177 The Battery is exactly what I needed. It looked a little different, but it works great. 
22178 The camera and accessories have been great, as I worked for a small, weekly newspaper. I didn t need anything too sophisticated. Overall,it s nothing fancy and the bag s zipper gave out within the first month, but the equipment alone is worth the price. 
22179 Great Quality Product. Make the purchase, You ll be so glad you did:-) Very small unit but it packs a punch. 
22180 nice and it came all in boxes fresh new thing smell nice! recomends 
22181 Awesome Mount, it works perfectly. The build quality is Very good and it will definitely hold up to some wipeouts. 
22182 it works as stated except the Zoom for my Apple iPhone. I download the BT shutter App too but not working. Anyway i am not going to return it, as it is functioning good and also good part is charging last for many days. 
22183 Excellent combination of GoPro supplies. All mounts and screws came in as advertised. My only complaint is the extension pole is very loose and wobbly. I wouldn t feel comfortable jumping off anything with it. 
22184 good quality 
22185 Did not work at all. Cheap plastic not what I expected at all. 
22186 Great camera, and nice size, fits in my purse and takes clear pics. 
22187 These are awesome, they get really hot though, so I wonder if that hurts reliability... 
22188 I m pretty happy with this! Still getting used to focusing! When I look through the lense it s looks clear as I adjust my focus, but then when I look at pictures noticed blurry was (human error) really like it for the money! 
22189 They fitted perfectly to my video camera and are charging fine! Thank you! 
22190 Excellent 
22191 Fit perfectly, Fast shipping!!! Thanks 
22192 Arrived promptly, easy to set up. Just what I needed. 
22193 Objects were hazy and lacked sharp contrast. I compared with Orion Oiii. 
22194 Just right, excellent product. 
22195 OK 
22196 Love this lens. Very versatile and razor sharp. 
22197 works as advertised. 
22198 Even though used, it works well and I like it. Very pleased with supplier. 
22199 I would definitely buy this kit again. Great starter kit for people getting into photography. Only complaint is the tripod is pretty flimsy when fully extended. 
22200 Excellent product price-quality 
22201 Exactly as ordered. Enjoying immensely. Very happy with purchase. Few friends already looking at the same products for purchase. 
22202 these energizer batteries are just what I needed for my camera 
22203 fits great. 
22204 Wish I could actually use the auto focus 
22205 Fell in love with the strap as as soon as I took it out of the box. Build quality is comparable to non. This makes it so easy for me to carry my camera for long durations. Would recommend it to all.... 
22206 Love this 
22207 Does not fit a Sony RX100 but even if it did, I don t think I trust the velcro enough to keep my camera dry. 
22208 Nice pack. 
22209 Great portable device! 
22210 Great bag for a Sony a6000! Holds a camera body with a lens and at least 2-3 more lenses plus batteries, cards, etc. Great for travel! 
22211 All was perfect, 
22212 Exactly what I needed!! 
22213 The drone was as expected, easy to fly, hoping that DJI will be able to send updates that will allow us to program routes 
22214 Excelente 
22215 Looks so cute and love it already thanks 
22216 The lock knob on this head gets stuck to the point where I had to use pliers to get my camera off. Not great. 
22217 Easy install. I hope I won t need! 
22218 works great 
22219 Its an amazing product evryone should have one 
22220 Camera is not what I was looking for 
22221 Everything ok 
22222 Most of this is junk, but the filters and cleaner were usful. 
22223 Works great. However it does not support a 64GB card like the newer camera. Somewhat annoying. 
22224 Too expensive! Bought this and a 4 pack of the generic 52mm cap. Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for the same price as this single cap. 
22225 Wished it was a bit more durable. Didn t see much difference between the shield and the plastic shield the camera came with. 
22226 Quality, yes. Overpriced, YES!!! 
22227 Works, but the straps are difficult to adjust properly. I m a fairly wide chested person, so even at it s max adjustment it is slightly uncomfortable. The camera itself sits at an angle and requires something underneath to align it if you want it level with the horizon. 
22228 exactly what i was shopping for. 
22229 Camera picture was blurry at best. Would not focus or zoom. Install search software provided totally locked up my router. Sent it back for replacement. 
22230 Excelente 
22231 Great Value! 
22232 very good, and very reasonably priced. 
22233 Solid mount, does the job as described. 
22234 Very good product, I really do not like the alarm noise it makes when you arm and disarm, there should be a softer sound at this point. 
22235 Just as described 
22236 Just &#34;installed&#34; them on my lenses...seem to fit and perform as advertised. Lets just see how they hold up. 
22237 Kenneth was extremely helpful in getting my camera set up to use the cloud service. Excellent customer service from the technical support line. 
22238 Taking to Argentina in November. This could be the perfect camera/all purpose bag. 
22239 Fine as expected 
22240 Not great quality 
22241 These are knockoffs and total junk. Avoid this seller. 
22242 It is good but every 3 min i rather keep steady videos without stop when i want to turn off 
22243 Great and good material 
22244 I m only using it for 35mm slides right now but so far so good. My only complaint is that it would be nice to choose a higher resolution. 
22245 This was awesome!!! I have the Handycam, but needed more battery time. This product allows me to charge alternative batteries, while using the batter attached to the Camera at the same time. Good idea, great purchase! 
22246 I needed something to store my sd and micro sd cards in and so i saw this and decided to try it out. I m glad that I did because this was exactly what I needed. I would definitely recommend to anyone 
22247 Good idea but the threads don t hold it steady for some reason. I should have sent it back when I had the chance.... 
22248 Great deal for all these. Now I have backup accessories and they work great! 
22249 Wi-Fi connexion between the camera and my cellphone or tablet is unstable. Not a reliable product, 
22250 5 star 
22251 Very good items. 
22252 Very nice Lens 
22253 Save lots of money buying this instead of Nikon brand and works just fine 
22254 Easy to use, loved the flip down lense cover on the bottom. I wish the eye covers did the same. 
22255 Easy to set up and does its job without a problem. 
22256 Great price. Arrived on time. Durable. 
22257 Fantastic bag! Great quality and delivered quickly! This bag is very roomy with more than enough room for my camera, lenses, batteries and charger! It is just what I needed and the shipping was quick and painless. Highly recommended seller! Don t hesitate if you like this bag! 
22258 Don t doubt on purchase this great camera!! It will surprise you! Excellente quality video, and the seller very effective 
22259 These are invaluable if you are using any stand outdoors. I placed my sand in plastic baggies prior to adding it to these bags and I have had absolutely no issues. 
22260 This is a needed item that is not included with D750 camera. 
22261 The Nikon ML-L3 Wireless remote control is small and very handy, and it works well with my Nikon D7000 as long as you point it straight at the indicator light on the camera. Great for self-portrait taking. No wires to deal with. 
22262 Like it very much takes great quality pic & video light weight and very user friendly 
22263 I m just a novice photographer, but this is exactly what I was looking for, and at the right price! 
22264 Every thing fits in real good 
22265 The filter is fine for protecting the lens but I see some ghosting and more flares when taking photos with the filter on. I believe when it comes to filters, it s a wise investment to get the higher quality glass to ensure you get the best photos possible. 
22266 Works great. As expected. No issues 
22267 I should have read the reviews before I even purchase I would have never gotten it in the first place for adapters like this I ll stick with the vivitar that I have on my 52mm 
22268 Perfect for all locations 
22269 excellent product. fast shipping. good company. will buy again. lisa 
22270 Great camera for the money. We have purchased several for use at our church. Quick shipping and no problems with any of them. 
22271 Work great! 
22272 Good day I received the camera case is very nice and meet my expectation thanks. 
22273 It really suck it doesn t work 
22274 Worked perfectly for my Nikon d3200 
22275 Amazing camera and arrived so fast! 
22276 Worked great for me 
22277 items delivered on time---everything was intact---nice little package items were exactly as shown/described 
22278 Good Deal! 
22279 Never held a charge from day 1. Guess its too late to return this paper-weight now, but trust me - this TRULY is GARBAGE - avoid - do NOT buy. IF the company reads this, YES I d like a REFUND. 
22280 Good 
22281 Very pleased... 
22282 A good product. 
22283 great product i like that it has the rubber not many others do 
22284 Not the best quality but not the worst. I ve had no issues so far with producing great background images in my videos. 
22285 Takes great pics 
22286 Very nice product. Worked like a charm on my Fuji xt1 and my Nikon d750. 
22287 Very nice 
22288 Good quality products at a fair price. It was shipped fast and I found all the products met or exceeded my expectations. I was able to mount my Action Cam to the handle bar of my Harley in just a few minutes. It works great! 
22289 Pelican cases are uniformly excellently made. They are extremely durable, and the latches simply work well. Enough said. 
22290 You won t regret buying. Great quality, perfect fit. 
22291 wonderful camera case even if small 
22292 Great Product 
22293 Doesn t work.. tried a few times. Better to buy the battery from somewhere else. 
22294 seems perfect as expected 
22295 Takes great pictures! We had fun with this in and out of the water on a recent Florida vacation. It is s little tough to see the screen in bright sunlight. 
22296 ok, so it s cool to have a video of 360.... But the image quality is seriously lacking..... Hopefully the next version is better because this one just sits in my drawer. 
22297 Just what I needed to keep my batteries charged. Great Product. 
22298 Works great 
22299 Great 
22300 The cameras worked out great at our wedding. They come with a note asking guests to take pictures. I loved it because I didn t have to create, print, and fold anything myself. 
22301 The best, light way and durable 
22302 good item 
22303 fits great to Leupold VX-3 1.5-5x20mm (30mm) - but honestly, could be less expensive 
22304 I love these glasses they r perfect I use the to drive and on my mini Segway 
22305 Love it! Works great with my selfie stick and my phone. The magnet also works like a charm. 
22306 Great little gadget for my son s GoPro at a very affordable price. 
22307 I m using this to fly FPV on my quadcopter. Had to modify the plug to fit my needs but it works great! 
22308 Perfect fit and perfect outcome! 
22309 Works perfectly I have had it installed and working since purchase and am considered purchasing another. 
22310 Very nice. As described. Quick delivery. 
22311 Great product. It will definitely float your camera. 
22312 Love the night vision recordings.its clear 
22313 This camera takes excellent images in almost all conditions! Even though I am experienced with manual SLR cameras, I just leave this one in automatic mode and the results are generally excellent, even for detailer product closeups. 
22314 At manual (M) setting the screen is smaller. I returned the camera. 
22315 Just what I ordered. The same as my other canisters. 
22316 Gave me a great range of new lenses to use. I started with the 25mm which came with my telescope, and was wishing i had more options. Glad i bought this kit. 
22317 This was a quick buy for my daughter and the product is easy to use. 
22318 Pretty nice but on closer inspection seems to be made out of cheap materials. I ll probably end up replacing this later but for the value it seems like it would be good for a beginner. 
22319 Works perfect and is a must when your traveling!! 
22320 Love the HFR on this camera as well as all the other features. Adobe already supports the RAW format as well which was a pleasant surprise. A powerful camera in many ways no doubt. 
22321 After reading all of the reviews, I bought the camera and it performs as advertised. You can t go wrong. Have people telling me wow what a nice camera and people commenting on how nice the pictures are. 
22322 a-ok 
22323 Love it. Much easier to align our 8&#34; Celestron SCT and more accurate than a red-dot finder. 
22324 Works as expected. No more splicing wires. 
22325 Parts were missing in the order. all I received were the batteries, no charger. I sent it back. 
22326 the camera is great....comes with NO manual! The case they sent does not hold the camera.....just the accessories. 
22327 Well made and very secure. 
22328 Excellent product. Gives me the ability to get very wide angle shots in home interiors. Great quality, certified OE lens from Canon 
22329 Works and fast shipping! 
22330 The clip fell off the first day I got it. Reattached it for a couple weeks then once it failed for good I was out of the return window. 
22331 Great camera 
22332 I am writing this Review regarding the excellent service I received from Dlink Support My Tech Referenced Service # AR004214 was able to help me correct my problem very efficiently and with excellent customer service I will purchase more products from DLink. 
22333 Great product, as described; something happenes with the delivery company, nothing that bad. Will buy again. 
22334 So cool, I take it with me everywhere 
22335 Filled my need nicely. Fast shipping. Reasonable cost! Works good! 
22336 Great product and buyer shipped quickly! Excellent experience! 
22337 I needed this. I have an older 17-35mm 2.8L It fits well, but does not come off too easily. I m fine with that... 
22338 My GOPRO been able to keep more secure. The storage space is also a very good product than many think. 
22339 Met expectations 
22340 work very well for the money 
22341 Great deal, seems like a great product so far. Haven t had a chance to extensively user it yet, but so far it s great! 
22342 Great product. Fits perfect in my hiking pack and very light weight. 
22343 We use these to capiture images of products coming down an assembly line using remote shutter switches. Does an awesome job. 
22344 sharp image. 
22345 All but ruined my camera lens filter - use with caution! I gave 2 stars because it does work well on my computer screen and iPhone. I haven t tried on the television - admittedly I am a bit hesitant to try on the 65&#34; screen. 
22346 This camera is really easy to use. It also take good quality pictures. Perfect for blogging or if you re just a novice photographer. 
22347 Perfect companion for my 3TB external drive. 
22348 One of the best lens filter I have ever used. Hoya is the best. Same with my Canon 24-70 lens too! :) 
22349 must have for go pros 
22350 Works exactly as expected. Simply set your camera to remote shutter setting and that s it. The only thing is that the sensor on my camera (canon T3i) is right in front of the camera. So I can only trigger the shutter when directly in front. 
22351 Nice product, great price and very fast shipping..!! A+ 
22352 Go back in the warehouse make another one Cause them thing no good I bought one about a two week ago When they sent it to me it don t even work. (A-szcxtop(tm) New Mini SPY Hd... A-szcxtop(TM) 
22353 Guardian advanced camera system is really good 
22354 amazing 
22355 Amazing piece of glass. Straight out of the box to a shoot. Impressive delivery time too. 
22356 No horizontal panning. View is a cone area below the device. Limited view. 
22357 Good product. Very reasonable price. I always look at this line when purchasing this type of equipment. Frank DiFalco 
22358 Came exactly as described and looks exactly as pictured. Works great. 
22359 Battery works great. I was told by other Nikon owners that some replacement batteries would not be recognized by the camera. This is not one of them. 
22360 It was a great deal. 
22361 Great 
22362 Strong and inexpensive 
22363 im happy to find that i could get batteries at such a great price. 
22364 Was dissapointed the illustration and text all lead you to belive it is an OEM Sony battery. So I ordered it only to find it is an aftermarket battery. Hope it performs adequately, Need to more transparent that this is not a Sony brand battery, but a non-Sony replacement. 
22365 It good. It was a little too big for my needs so I sewed the ends to make it a smaller diameter. If you need to do that, it s easy to do with these. Heck, you could probably make your own from some old drink koozies. 
22366 Broke 2nd week I used it. It was worthless. 
22367 Love the little pics my daughter takes with this camera. Great buy! 
22368 was good 
22369 It was stiff and would not telescope the way it was suppose to, so I ended up putting it back in the bag and return it. So unhappy, junk do not buy it ever. So mad, hate the product. $119 down the drain. 
22370 For the price very well worth it for my nikon d3000. It didn t hold a long charge for my event like my original battery; but I brought both batteries with me and it lasted all day. Very satisfied! 
22371 Items were as expected and were in excellent condition. Very happy! 
22372 Great product, durable plastic. The screw hole configuration worked with my Lorex LRD2152 Dome Cameras. I think all Lorex dome cameras all have the same whole pattern so they will most likely work with this. 
22373 The product was apparently defective upon arrival. It would never boot from day one although it was getting power. The item was returned for a refund. 
22374 I love it 
22375 great great great.. from the 1st shot I took I knew I loved this lens 
22376 First Post! A buddy of mine bought this Nikon Coolpix P600 and he swears by it so i purchased one. Shoots great. 
22377 Great item at a great price 
22378 Works effectively - as advertized. Battery life is significantly shortened by forcing it to wake up ever 4 to 5 minutes. But this is the only way to poll for current data on a regular basis. Consider a full-power USB connection for frequent polling. Otherwise a good product. 
22379 Excellent. Seems to work perfectly and is exactly as described. I am happy to be able to use my camera again after jamming the original lens. Thanks! 
22380 I had to call for technical support. Kenneth was able to solve my problem almost immediately. I rate both the service and product FOSCAM model FI8918W as five star. [[ASIN:B0046710G6 Foscam FI8918W Wireless/Wired Pan & Tilt IP/Network Camera with 8 Meter Night Vision and 3.6mm Lens (67° Viewing Angle)]] 
22381 Nice cameras 
22382 Great product- Thanks 
22383 Love these binoculars...very bright and easy to locate objects while being of a nice size and weight. 
22384 Love it 
22385 Very good 
22386 the ultimate beginner addon to the camera 
22387 Arrived on time. A sturdy product. 
22388 Works pretty well for the price. The side button has started to become less sensitive over a few months use. 
22389 Good 
22390 Awesome camera. Love the quality of the zoom. It s my 5th Panasonic and I m very impressed with this product. 
22391 Takes a little bit to install properly, but looks very nice and functions fine. 
22392 great item! 
22393 We order these every three months. Great quality and a must have for all of our electronics and glasses. 
22394 Got these for my father in law before a big motorcycle trip out west. They were simple enough for him to use as he is not very good with electronics. The videos and sound were clear. Great purchase! 
22395 works, but a little tricky to figure out 
22396 Expired film do not purchase 
22397 Unusable because it would just float off our wrists. 
22398 Great product. Love the new experience. 
22399 Solved a problem for me GREAT 
22400 Did not fit properly. Not worth dealing with for the price. 
22401 Holds 4 filters and protects them well 
22402 its a great lens sharp good color but for my hand it was to hard toget on and off. would like to have kept it .if I had an extra body I would have made it a real point and shoot. 
22403 Good as expected 
22404 Great camera 
22405 good! 
22406 Do not expect any tech support from this company (FunLux) so purchase at your own risk. 
22407 It looks good, but I have not used it yet. 
22408 Rating: 5 of 5 Product is as described. Works good. Very pleased. 
22409 My niece was so excited to receive this 
22410 love it 
22411 Fit like original. Very Satisfiled. 
22412 The batteries work perfectly with my Nikon camera and the battery charger has been a life saver on trips to charge my batteries on the go. 
22413 Works great! 
22414 Great product 
22415 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
22416 Works as expected and reasonably priced 
22417 It focuses very quickly on my sister s 60D and allows you to get quite close to the subject if necessary. 
22418 It is exactly what I needed at a great price! 
22419 I really like the storage pouches, I wish they came in different configuration options for the 1690 case. 
22420 Fit perfectly and now I don t have to keep losing my lens covers! 
22421 Cut out is perfect. After I put it on and peeled off the &#34;second&#34; layer it was crystal clear and you can t even tell there s a protector on. 
22422 Awesome camera 
22423 Although support and firmware upgrades had to be cautiously followed, customer service with Terry Morgan was great help. Now I can use the camera, view via smart device, and login outside of the home anywhere. 
22424 Cameras started messing up after 6 months. 
22425 Just exactly like the OEM battery. I love how this has three slots to charge. Nothing else to say about this great product! 
22426 The pics and videos are in bad quality, it end up in the trash. save your money and do not pay it 
22427 Excellent product 
22428 Love this filter. It really makes difference in skies and landscape colors. Worth every penny spent!! 
22429 I have had only one opportunity to try out this lens so far. It performed much better than I had hoped it would. It is pretty compact and not very heavy. I look forward to having this lens with me in the future. 
22430 Don t last long short life! 
22431 So many attachments I will never use them all great deal 
22432 This fits my D5100 with Sigma 18-250mm with lens hood which is exactly what I wanted. The only down side is that you can t fit much else in the case, but that s the trade-off for a case this size. 
22433 I can t wait to use them. They will be useful when I can t my cheetah stands. 
22434 Best investment i have made for my business 
22435 They attach. They float the cameras. Not much else to ask of them. 
22436 Excellent 
22437 Very good quality... No instructions manual 
22438 very easy to set up !!!! quality of the camera is a 10 !!!!! 
22439 Great product! I ve used this floaty handle a bunch while swimming and kayaking. I really feel better about not losing my go pro. 
22440 Works great makes flying more enjoyable. 
22441 Yes it works great and it was easy to install 
22442 Excellent lens 
22443 Decent quality camera. Love the feature of ability to move the camera from my iPhone. Great night shot. Sometimes the auto mode does not work and the day and night mode have to be changed manually. Good value for indoor security monitoring. 
22444 The case is large enough for the camera and some accessories 
22445 Yes, it s overpriced but it s small, rugged and very adjustable. I don t mind paying a little more for obvious quality. 
22446 Very good camera 
22447 fits great! makes my d3000 much more comfortable to hold. 
22448 Picture is sharp with good definition. It gives a good screen resolution.Excellent camera for the price. 
22449 I ordered the 50mm and recieved the 52mm, thought it was my mistake until I checked the order. Found out it has happened to others as well. This is not just frustrating it s unprofessional. 
22450 Perfect for occasional use! 
22451 Great battery pack. I use them on my hero 3. I haven t done any testing as to the length of charge time, but they do just as well as my regular gopro battery. 
22452 This is a great product with many useful features! I love it! 
22453 The quality of this tripod is on point. So hard to believe I paid so little for it. 
22454 was really expecting a stand/legs and a light bulb holder as pictured in the product photograph. I did not receive this. sick. 
22455 Nice camera 
22456 excellent 
22457 Works great for what we need it for. 
22458 Purchased these stands a few times. I have been very happy with them. Sturdy and high quality. 
22459 I m still working on learning how to use the camera, but love the photos so far! 
22460 Doesn t work for viewing on a Mac. Also had issues getting this to view under the newest version of Chrome on Windows. Tech support was fantastic but decided to return and purchase one that works with a Mac. 
22461 There is no mirror surface on this mirror - I removed the protective coating and it hardly reflected my face -- a waste 
22462 Yup great 
22463 Awesome!!!! 
22464 This case was very cute, but it was only &#34;okay&#34; when it came to protection. The plastic casing cracked and allowed my phone to constantly fall out, there for it only got used for a couple of weeks. 
22465 Great item price and fast shipping 
22466 Love them 
22467 Great accessories kit for the Go-Pro. My husband absolutely loves it all. 
22468 Excellent product. Bought as a replacement and re-charges battery 3-4 times quicker. 
22469 A must have for time lapse shooting and astrophotography... 
22470 Love it. Superb pictures. 
22471 When putting mk 4 in, a bit of the back snapped off, extremely unhappy. Applied almost no force when putting in and completely snapped. Also the lack of battery access is infuriating. 
22472 Not the best battery life. For someone who does a lot of filming, I need something a little stronger. 
22473 So so it s k would buy again 
22474 great 
22475 As described 
22476 Excellent tech support 
22477 So far, so good. 
22478 worked fine. 
22479 Works well for small cameras 
22480 Great Camera!!!! 
22481 Love the system Works great i instslled it myself I do wish i had an instruction manual I still dont undestand the dvr completely 
22482 Highly Recommended! 
22483 At first it seemed to work well, but it would lose connection randomly causing the camera to power down and causing me to lose my shot many times. Maybe mine was just a lemon, but I returned it and I m getting the Sony version instead. 
22484 On time, and super cute! I m in love! 
22485 Really enjoying this bag. Fits so much of my equipment 
22486 It s a bit difficult to figure out how to use at the beginning but once you figure it out it works perfectly! My Yongnou YN-560 IV and this pair up perfectly! 
22487 I use this all the time. Works very well. 
22488 Works very well. I have only used it for home movies so far. It works better than the mic on my Canon T4i. 
22489 These worked sooo much better than the straps that came w the waterproof cameras! ! 
22490 Only thing mildly confusing is that the LEDs and battery slots aren t oriented in any way you can remember which is which. 
22491 does print pics but some come out with streaks 
22492 Does the job. Love it so far. 
22493 Only one of the 4 cables worked 
22494 i bought camera at flea market with no charger. not knowing it even worked. gave 6 bucks 4 camera. bought kastar battery and charger kit and the camera works like a new one. right on kastar!!!!! 
22495 Great item 
22496 Excellent product! I was imagining something more simple and not so good, turns out that is an amazing camera with all benefits is a semi professional one! Love it! 
22497 Very cool! 
22498 Camera works great, but iPhone software is garbage. Alerts never work properly and their monthly/yearly service plans are wayyyy too expensive, considering what they re providing. This device has become almost useless to me. 
22499 In my opinion, it is just more crap to waste your money on, not to mention all the wasted time and work it takes to install it. 
22500 Love this product! So affordable but great quality. Great service. 
22501 Love it! 
22502 Its really pretty and a great strap, I just wasn t enthused by the rubbery grip on the back side of it. 
22503 This flash is astounding! It zooms the flash when you zoom your lens and has a built in diffuser as well. I highly recommend this product to photographers any photographer that s on a budget or just getting started. 
22504 Convenience and compact 
22505 Works great made money with it ready!!! 
22506 Flimsy 
22507 hot mikes and paranoid. Plus, my work has Skype/Lync and some people have been known to turn on their computer camera and sometimes they are not were they should be or wearing the appropriate attire. LOL! Ooopppsss - 
22508 The battery is not new, exactly like the rest of the reviews say. Don t buy this product. It does not hold a charge for more than half an hour. 
22509 Fit fine. Did the job! 
22510 Very good Camera. 
22511 Great kit and seller 
22512 Great product. 
22513 Actually a very high quality camera, however, the hardware used to attach the camera to equipment is not sturdy at all. I had the camera mounted on my wind surfboard and it came off and I lost it in the ocean. 
22514 I have just begun using it. The back screen scratches very easily and I have not found the wire to download pictures into the computer from the camera. It does not seem to come with the camera. 
22515 Good, however a close lens is much better. 
22516 These are great, but I ll never need them since I never crash! Also all my code compiles first try. 
22517 The mouse never worked ( I had to use an old mouse of mine) The remote works SOMETIMES. Also some remote buttons do NOT work at all So I guess I give it a 7 out of 10 
22518 Great 
22519 Great value. 
22520 Very well designed and built. Definitely improves handling of the camera. 
22521 They last longer than my original Canon lithium battery. 
22522 Excelente 
22523 This works perfectly. 
22524 Excelent product, economizer of energy, sensor of motion! 
22525 Too small..go with a large size one..can t put all your accessories in it 
22526 Wrong battery. Connecting pins were male instead of female. Completely useless to me. Description was incomplete. I gambled and lost. 
22527 excellent product, very good quality, as expected. very responsible seller 
22528 Great Product great price 
22529 Love this handycam. I got the bundle which is definitely benefical with all it contains. Tripod looks flipsy. Having had need to use it. 
22530 works great thanks 
22531 Wonderful, easy solution at an affordable price! I thought my camera was broken! Now it charges up and works perfectly again! 
22532 jiust love it 
22533 Got everything 
22534 Bought this for my orange loving son s first camera. He s dropped it twice (that I know of) and the camera is still perfect. Nice little case! 
22535 The color is nice and uniform. The paper is a decent weight and is reasonably durable. The packaging was very good. The photo qualities of the paper are very good and perform well with flash. 
22536 Great for traveling. Fits in a pocket and has good quality images. 
22537 Great deal 
22538 Works very well, and is so simple to use. You can use it with cable or with remote. 
22539 It holds up the roll of paper I bought it to hold up. I ll be moving it to a new location temporarily next week. 
22540 This camera & bundle is awesome for the price. This camera does not allow a wireless remote, so the bundle didn t include the remote, even though it was listed in the description. 
22541 Great camera 
22542 Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended. 
22543 Product arrived on schedule. Worked perfectly 
22544 Excellent 
22545 Added fun for my daughter and her friends!!! 
22546 Does the job in a pinch and is highly portable. I have used it with point and shoot cameras as well as a DSLR. Just make sure you distribute the weight properly when using a heavier camera. Basic physics! 
22547 Just got a set and tested them out. Seems to work fine. 
22548 This was perfect for a grad party photo booth! 
22549 Good product. Does what it should. 
22550 broke within 2 months junk 
22551 Well great at the beginning. I think i will be buying new. The lens is not working as well. I have to get it sent in for repair. The images are blury past the 100mm range bummer 
22552 Battery was not lasting on our camera and felt time to replace the battery. Well what better was than to get 2 batteries and charger. Can t beat the price. Everythign works great! 
22553 As expected! 
22554 If you are tried of not being able to see the image your trying to photograph, then this is the one for you. Heads-up, the image in the viewfinder will appear a little out of focus but, doesn t effect the shot. 
22555 Smooth transaction. A+++. Thanks you!!! 
22556 i love it!! great fit..i will give 5 stars 
22557 Fine 
22558 Hard to focus and hold steady. 
22559 This is an awesome tripod. Itbis really easy to set up and use. I am going to get a lot of use from it. 
22560 gooddd 
22561 This is a cheap tripod. The head adapter screw broke almost immediately. The panning and tilting of the head is jaggy. Unless you are setting this tripod to a single position for photography, it is pretty useless. 
22562 A little tricky to fold/coil up, but decent. 
22563 Nice carry bag. Use it all the time. Sometimes switch it with the Sony camera holster but for most travels love this bag. 
22564 good product, arrived on time as promised. 
22565 For what this is and what it cost this is the best lens you can buy for the money. It added more fun to photography. 
22566 Better than expected. Perfect gift for the girlfriend. 
22567 The pictures are clear and accurate per the subject being filmed! Only wish the pictures were larger, but I ll still order more. Really like having an &#34;instant&#34; photo in seconds! 
22568 Works great in my Panasonic FZ150. Have used the same one in the FZ150 for a year now and have no issues. It sees the charge level, etc. 
22569 A little flimsy and no markings on the filters, but creates fantastic photos! 
22570 Grate 
22571 Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price 
22572 This is the simplest thing. It straps on very easily. It s easy to put on and take off. It s one of those million dollar ideas, and it comes at a great prices. 
22573 Some of the accessories I didn t need. And the gorilla tripod cracked almost instantly. Other than that, I felt it was a great deal. 
22574 Works just as advertised. Got it quickly and it works great! 
22575 The batteries don t last quite as long as the factory original, but the price sure is right. 
22576 bien 
22577 Live this lens!!! It s perfect for the everyday lens to sporting events. The package was secure and the shopping was fast. I definitely digest this lens. 
22578 As I needed for my project 
22579 Great 
22580 This is my 2nd Syma X5C. This is one tough drone! It has crashed several times and keeps going strong. 
22581 love it 
22582 Awesome quad, have had several weeks and no crashes or flyaways. Really nice product for the cost. Someone forgot to put manual in box before shipping but found everything on line. 
22583 Great on time 
22584 the camera mount is a bit stiff and hard to aim. 
22585 Love it ! Bought it from here at a perfect price I was a little doubtful but it s definitely worth it. Love it perfect for my hands and love the flip screen 
22586 Exactly what I needed to use the ! Most Excellent ! camera as a video tool. Probably got one with the original purchase, but did not know what it was for. 
22587 These are awesome, I love the different designs!! 
22588 I have always wanted a gopro and not that I have one I love it! A great buy! 
22589 I got into collecting old cameras to shoot film in and part of the fun for me is doing some restoration. I have used this lens sucker for picking up tiny lenses out of assemblies and works as it is supposed to. Very handy tool to have. 
22590 Located a Sony digital camera in a flea market. Did not wish to keep camera plugged in all the time to charge the battery. Works great! 
22591 My camera constantly stay off line. I file a complaint to the company and they did sent a replacement cord for free, but I still having problems. I paid too much for this camera for it not to work properly. I brought this camera to watch my property. 
22592 Easy to install compared to other IP cameras I have owned, comes much better software. Very wide angle lens, picture is sharp with excellent color. Excellent night vision. Would definitely buy again or recommend to a friend. 
22593 Excellent product I highly recommend it 
22594 Love the quick release function. High quality 
22595 Important when you need more juice 
22596 Good price and an absolute must have on your camera. 
22597 The film arrived on time. Great price! I am really enjoying my Instax Printer! My family & friends get a kick out of these tiny pictures, also. 
22598 It s a very neat design. A little better instruction would have been nice. But I like the double use of the tripod and converting it to monopod so easily ! 
22599 Item is NOT white as listed in description, the cable is NOT RG59 as listed in the description. It is Siamese and 25 foot as described. 
22600 Setup and use is SUPER simple! Love it! You will too! Anybody can enjoy this camera and you can set it to go on when you leave the house 
22601 Great product and shipped fast. 
22602 Works good 
22603 I always loved this camera. I got another one to replace one that had broken. Despite its small pixel size, it takes great pictures. 
22604 Love it! Perfect tripod for me and my point and shoot camera. 
22605 Not good. The camera appeared to be repacked and it did not perform correctly. The POE feature did not work and had to returned it. 
22606 Really great camera for the price. Fast shipping. 
22607 Excellent unit optically and mechanically, not what you would expect at the price point. Highly recommended! 
22608 Good lens. 
22609 Exactly what I paid for. Love it 
22610 Excellent I love it 
22611 works great 
22612 ok 
22613 Works great. Allows for better sound. Not for use in foul weather or where waterproof case is required. 
22614 Excelent. Like the original battery for my Alpha 77 II !!!! 
22615 took great shots ove them 
22616 I love my selfie stick, I use it all the time,wherever.Same exact quality as the name brand at half the price.Highly and affordable.Very satisfied! 
22617 Great quality and build! I have used it a lot and it feels OEM! Fit and finish are top notch. For the money its a great buy! 
22618 Great Product 
22619 This tripod is very small and lightweight, however, also very flimsy. I tried to fix it in position but it barely holds. The weight of my compact camera makes it shift and slowly collapse, certainly not what I expected. this is not a quality product. 
22620 Fit camera perfect and just like new. Super 
22621 A great price on a great case. Fits a 1911 well. Very strong plastic, just like the whole Pelican line. 
22622 Was great when it worked.... only ever sat in my bag and the light inside blew out after only using it 7 times (if that). Owning it for alittle over a month, Dealer said &#34;nothing he can do...&#34; Buy a 400x scope from someone else... 
22623 :) 
22624 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
22625 I could never peal off the film just broke 
22626 Great props, they are an original DJI product. Exactly the same as the ones that come originally with the phantom 3. Each pair arrived in a black fabric bag same as the one that comes with the phantom. 
22627 Perfect! 
22628 Work perfectly Thanks! 
22629 Good addition to the 800TVL camera installation. 
22630 Not only does it protect my gopro and accessories, but it keeps them organised and ready to go. Its great not only for traveling, but also is a great storage solution in general. 
22631 Great results. Well designed. But the instructions are poor. For example, the black coil that is seen in the view of the receiver. I assume it is the antenna, but no information is included. Can I lift it vertically and extend it? Duh. 
22632 Perfect quality product! 
22633 Great Deal. 
22634 It s okay but not the best.... 
22635 Excellent product 
22636 Nice upgrade to my system 
22637 I m really liking these AmazonBasics items. Very cheap and quality-made. I will continue to buy from Amazon. 
22638 One of the greatest digital camera Sony has to offer. It has good specs and the image quality is good too. 
22639 Great case. Perfect fit. Like the pocket that I can use for a spare battery. 
22640 This is the cord I couldn t find so I got another. It s working great. Love it. 
22641 Great product, great service. Works perfectly. 
22642 The UV lens sometimes shows circle crystals in the picture when its too sunny 
22643 a 
22644 Worked for a couple of months. Then stopped wortking. Company would not honor worrenty 
22645 This camera is very easy to operate and works extremely well. I would recommend it. 
22646 A great piece of gear if you shoot in bright light. Use this on my Nikkor 70-300mm VR zoom lens on the beach and at sporting events and it really eliminates that &#34;washed out&#34; look. 
22647 LOVE this cute little camera & I ve owned several Canons, but they keep adding features & I love the wide-angle on this one!!! 
22648 Good battery that last three times as long as the factory battery, defiantly worth the buy!!! 
22649 Thank you 
22650 Good value. The case does not have a pocket for the extra battery and memory cards. 
22651 Exactly what I have been needing, highly portable, has own case. I love using this product. 
22652 It s not rock solid, and there is a few degrees of play in the head with the large Canon 100-400L lens attached, but it works and for the price it s very much better than the alternatives. Light and compact when folded. 
22653 Not as easy to focus as I thought it would be 
22654 So far this is my favorite lens for the micro four thirds system. 
22655 Excellent!,,Thank you 
22656 This unit if the fundamental starter for anyone who likes video &#34;on the go&#34;. It works well, takes clear images and sound. I haven t tested it underwater yet, but the tightly sealed case seems well built and solid; likely to work fine in wet/underwater conditions. 
22657 good and is very good in travel 
22658 good 
22659 Just right 
22660 Tough as a tank, plenty of space for my gear. 
22661 great 
22662 A wonderful piece of equipment. Still learning how to use it; much to learn. 
22663 very good price 
22664 Love the car adapter as many times we forget to charge the battery before we leave for something. Works perfectly with our cannon battery. No problems with it and it was a good price. 
22665 Excelente 
22666 A++++++++Highly Recommend 
22667 Holds the camera firmly in place 
22668 Very good product 
22669 Very nice to use 
22670 Great Camera! 
22671 Cool thing! 
22672 Works really fine on my Canon 6D love it!!! 
22673 no complaints just wish it had an external mic jack 
22674 Good 
22675 I had a ND filter stuck on my 18-55 for months and this got it off in 5 seconds. Takes a little patience to align properly but it will take the filter right off. 
22676 As expected.. but not real detail on how to use. One of the items came broken. 
22677 Great 
22678 Works great and fits the Canon Camera. 
22679 This product is not worth the time. It came blurry a waste of money and I can t retrieve back because it came from out of the country. Please please please please don t waste your money. Sign Disappointed.!!!!! 
22680 Has lights to indicate power or surge(helpful during installation) 
22681 LEDs started burning up shortly after first use on my Nikon digital camera 
22682 Awesome assortment of tec stuff for the one who is starting! 
22683 Great pics,great packet value 
22684 Good 
22685 ok 
22686 thank you ever so much! 
22687 You can only stream video to your phone if you re on the same wifi. 
22688 NO SOUND ,NO BUY 
22689 Well worth the small investment to protect a large investment in camera and lens equipment. I hope I never need it but it s there when I really do. 
22690 looks great and takes great pictures 
22691 I actually took the foam insert out and use it to store fragile items (eg. Micro 4/3 lens) and it s really great for that. 
22692 Loved the attachments hated the ion air pro. Returned the action cam and kept the kit to use with another action cam. I hope I m making sense, but yeah. Good, really good. 
22693 Charger works good. Only issue I have is that it hardly holds the battery in place which can be a problem if you re charging in the car/on the go. 
22694 Fits like a glove. 
22695 It fits all my stuff. And it I don t carry my laptop then I put other papers in it. The memory card holder is secure. It s comfortable to wear. 
22696 Crashed each time I tried to install my SD cards. Uses a lot of broadband. Requires Flash in browsers. The picture was pretty good, but I couldn t deal with the other problems. Returning. 
22697 Excellent 
22698 Great price for legit equipment. It s amazing how much more you get in a shot with a 10mm versus 18mm. I m loving this lens and all of the extra goodies for not much extra are worth the small investment. 
22699 But this Light meter, Great for perfect flash! 
22700 It is a very profesional look article that helps a lot, for the price, I don t regret it at all, 
22701 Not user friendly, but I love a challenge. All the parts work fine. Hopefully I won t lose them. 
22702 Love this bag! Fits my Manfrotto with pistol grip no problem! Thanks! 
22703 Item arrived without mounting hardware or instructions. 
22704 Love this! So fun! 
22705 It works great with my ADT Safewatch Pro 3000. However setting the thing up with it was an absolute bear. Not the fault of the device. A fault with a ridiculously complex system for pairing it with the ADT equipment. 
22706 Way too much $$$ for this s***. 
22707 they work great!! very easy to work and set up!! Thanks Dan!! 
22708 A nice case but had to return because I returned the camera. 
22709 Love this camera and the telephoto lens. The lighter weight makes it perfect. I had a Canon years ago so the learning curve has been pretty easy. 
22710 This item allows me not only to see pictures on a bigger screen but also make me look like i spent a lot of cash to make my dslr different. 
22711 It was perfect just what I had expected. 
22712 Sony 28-2 is bright and clear for general purpose photography. But the images it produce, is nothing magical like the Leica Q with Summilux 28-1.7. Even at A7R2 s 42 megapixel, the images aren t as detailed as the Leica Q. 
22713 excelente producto recomendado 
22714 Had to place it on a stationary camera, it moves to much when trying to adjust the dim switch. 
22715 The issue is, that some of the screws that come with the prop guard don t fit. They aren t long enough and I can t get them to tighten the guard. So, I left the guard off the Phantom, which is not what I wanted. 
22716 excellent buy 
22717 Pictures did not develope well. Waste of money 
22718 good for what it is 
22719 bought it for my husband; he loves it; he s a bit taller than 6 feet so he prefer a very tall tripod and this is one I found on Amazon and very good price 
22720 Horrible! This is a gray market market (which means it s not from the U.S.) Nikon refuses to fix these camera if anything happens to them. I am very disappointed. 
22721 Good product.... 
22722 Love my GoPro. Made some great YouTube videos at beach and water park. 
22723 ok 
22724 Works and good price 
22725 Bought this for my Nikon 1 J4. It fits everything and then some! My camera, extra lens, battery charger, cables, extra memory cards all fit and I still have more space for other things. 
22726 Henry was very helpful in setting up my camera. I would recommend the Foscam cameras ! 
22727 This product was awful. Directions in English were poorly translated. Had to watch a you tube video and it looks like the guy could only make it work after he took it apart and jerry-rigged it. I threw mine away. 
22728 Cheap for all the pictures I got:) came in fast love them!!:) 
22729 Good carrying case that fits my Olympus SH-2 well. The extra pocket is useful for the tripod shoe, but not much else. Smaller items like spare SD cards or batteries would likely fall out. 
22730 Well-designed product. Fit perfectly and excellent quality 
22731 Horrible item. Broke within 2 weeks of occasional light use. Lost the $70 digital camera I just purchased in the river because this did not hold up at all. Very disappointing! Do not buy. 
22732 Worked well. 
22733 Good item and good price for it. 
22734 A good cheap wireless remote for the DSLRs. I used it for Canon 7D m2 and works very well. 
22735 The selfie stick works great. I even used it in the pool. The straps are great and I never have to worry about losing the camera. 
22736 Horrible. It worked 2 times. I went to use it again today, and it quit working. What a waste of money!!! 
22737 Junk---didn t work very long... 
22738 Great kit and great service :) 
22739 Great tripod! Thanks. 
22740 Yes, this is a great arm to attach my digital recorder to my video tripod, nice and solid. 
22741 This will not work for swann security system like advertised. I bought eight of these and they are junk. 4 didn t work at all. And 4 worked for a couple minutes. So I have 8 cords that I can t use. Do not buy. 
22742 A must for this camera !!! to make it truly bomb prof, not the prettiest thing but does the job. 
22743 Works great, no problems what so ever. Exactly like the battery that came with my camera. 
22744 Works absolutely amazing I have no complaints 
22745 Works very goodl. Delivers one time. 
22746 loved the different colors. so cute 
22747 very pleased! Good price on a great item! 
22748 I use the GoPole almost every time I use my GoPro. It is definitely a great accessory to have if you enjoy traveling and doing action sports. 
22749 Meets my expectations. A perfect size for days when. Don t need all my equipment. 
22750 Good to take along an extra eyecup when traveling since the Olympus eye cup tends to come off and disappear easily. 
22751 Nicely padded. Keeps my lenses safe! 
22752 The Lens was fairly OK but the out of body was more used than indicated. (faded) 
22753 It s a great camera, but the instructions are very básic 
22754 a 
22755 it to cool 
22756 Great camera and great value with the bundle. 
22757 Henry was very professional and gave great tech support. Thank you Henry !!!! 
22758 Works great on my canon 70d. So much better than a neck strap. No issues so far. Does not block the flip out screen. 
22759 Awesome Camera .... We love it. We own 2 other Sony Alpha that we use in our family photography business. The results are superb even with the kit lens. But with the ability to use FE and adapted lenses, you can get some mind blowing results from this camera. 
22760 found it to be too small to be very useful I bought and exclusively use the backpack from amazon: [[ASIN:B002VPE1WK AmazonBasics Backpack for SLR/DSLR Cameras and Accessories - Black]] 
22761 Very happy with this purchase, interesting design 
22762 Worked perfectly! 
22763 Literally fits like a GLOVE, very nice! 
22764 No comments 
22765 works as advertized and cheap 
22766 Literally no complaints. better than I expected! 
22767 dont work 
22768 This worked out great for my cannon. It s wasn t the exact charger I got for my cannon but it does the job. 
22769 Great lens for the money! Takes sharp pics over entire focal length. 
22770 Excellent for carrying my phantom 3 proffesional 
22771 Works great compact size fits on my backpack perfect 
22772 I love my vivitar battery and charger kit for my Sony NEX 5R camera. It works great and I received the items promptly. 
22773 The package arrived in time for my granddaughter s birthday. It was her birthday gift. She loved it.She took photos of her birthday party with it and everyone enjoyed the camera. 
22774 I Love It! Great Camera! 
22775 For the price, it is a very interesting lens. Personally, I don t have a lot of use for it, but it does have a very nice open aperture. 
22776 Very nice, the price was well worth it, in fact if bought separately I would have paid more than triple the price. Everything was nicely packed and I feel it was one of my best purchases I made for myself in awhile. 
22777 It s just what I wanted, pictures are sharp, it s easy to operate and its lightweight! 
22778 Excellent quality recommended seller 
22779 they work great 
22780 Worked on my Eviant 7&#34; TV - very happy. 
22781 it will do but it comes all folded up and looks completely fake. I will see how it photographs but doesn t look real at all. Very digital. 
22782 Love it 
22783 excellent! 
22784 Keeps the full batteries coming I love this tool. 
22785 Amazing item, delivered earlier than expected. The clap and goose neck are ver sturdy and made with good material, worth the buy to any one who wants to get great static vids with their gopro. 
22786 Definitely great for the price and gets the job done. Straps look pretty durable and I am sure with time and being out in the sun they will eventually break, but for the price I d replace them again in a heartbeat.Tested on variable length and prime lenses. 
22787 This is a very nice and comfortable wrist strap for those who do not like to use their neck straps! 
22788 May not be the most expensive glass out there, but this I ve never been disappointed in any HOYA product. True, I m not a professional, but I take care of my stuff ant HOYA works for me! 
22789 FAST DELIVERY&#62;&#62; wow! 
22790 Installed in minutes to replace an old sony system in my Monaco RV. Works good. 
22791 It does exactly what it needs to do. after hours of searching for cameras I found this one. it was very easy to install and the picture is very clear. If your making a decision, MUST BUY THESE CAMERAS. 
22792 resolution is not adjustable. remote didnot work OTB. 
22793 Works great. 
22794 ok 
22795 After several trys I finally found what I wanted. 
22796 Camera bag is very small. Everything else is about what you d expect for the price. 
22797 Love this camera but rather intimidated by all it can do. Not a beginner s camera! Will have to buy a book D3200 dummies book to be able to use it. 
22798 Exactly the same as the one I lost but easier to obtain and cheaper. 
22799 works good 
22800 Good camera. Clear picture. 
22801 Great value. 
22802 Great buy on good film! 
22803 LensPen always delivers! This one is much smaller than the previous model. Although I don t really like new curved design (I am a straight lines guy), but it does the job perfectly, as always! 
22804 Works great. 
22805 Works a treat. 
22806 Excellent, sturdy base. This thing is a rock. All the machining is beautifully precise. The head is very nice for still photography but too stiff for video. I mounted an inexpensive fluid head on the base and I m very happy. 
22807 Have taken some pretty awesome photos with this film it never fails me! 
22808 Works Great. 
22809 Kind of delicate. 
22810 I only needed one of these in my GoPro camera cases on my dive trip for 16 dives. I am careful with my cameras and this was extra insurance. I had no fogging at all. I inserted them just below the camera after i placed the camera in the case. 
22811 I ve been using it for 2 weeks, and i love it. I would buy this again, as well as recomend it to friends. 
22812 not real eos bag,smelling too much and too small to hold dslr 
22813 Great price 
22814 Amazing quality 
22815 Item as described 
22816 Love this camera. I m still trying to figure out the basics of photography. Once I get those down pat, I m going to really love it! 
22817 I ran a mud run with this and it stayed very secure. I think the top strap helps keep the camera from flopping around as much but I wasn t able to tighten it as much as I would have liked. Great product for the price though. 
22818 works great; timely and well padded shipping; would buy again 
22819 it exceeded my expectations. Great light, easy to use and very economical. Already suggested it to few artists friends of mine. 
22820 Lightweight and thus does not hold to the windshield very well. I love the picture and clarity=-colors are terrific. 
22821 Quality is what you d expect from this price point and size, and is acceptable. But the battery lasted for only two short uses before it wouldn t hold a charge. 
22822 High quality and will buy again. This was able to fit all my DSLR and GoPro items in one place. Now I just need to grab the pack and go. 
22823 I love it I use in my strobe lite and my speedlite. 
22824 LOOKS LIKE THE REAL CAMERAS , GOOD VALUE 
22825 A+++++ fast shipping product as described. 
22826 wooks 
22827 Very pleased with this! Would have given 5 stars if it came with instructions on unfolding and refolding tent. 
22828 Not bad for that money. 
22829 The are really high quality accessories for your camera. I have purchased several and am quite happy with them. 
22830 Worked great on our family vacation to Hawaii. My husband recorded our entire trip from start to finish with his fancy usie stick and Go Pro. We ended up with a really cool video of our trip. Great little pole mount. 
22831 I ve lost several microfiber cloths in the past so this 6-pack is great for having extras when needed. I like that they come individually wrapped and it cleans my glasses perfectly. I m very happy with it. 
22832 Great camera case! Lots of storage spaces. 
22833 perfect student camera! 
22834 Very nice gear. Part of the collection of accessories to have if you are a photographer. Loved the price, weight and features, hard to beat for the money. 
22835 No good n o good takes to long 
22836 small footprint and strong love this thing 
22837 Not too big. Everything in one place with easy access. 
22838 I favor Tiffen s quality. 
22839 It s very nice, works really well 
22840 Great product, super cute designs 
22841 You get what you pay for, cheap quality, feels like 
22842 I like it a lot -- great zoom, and easy to work. 
22843 Shipping rather slow, but i am extremely happy with purchase. 
22844 Great product. 
22845 Did its job! 
22846 Me and my husband bought this as our birthday gift to our 11yr old daughter, Our daughter is very happy. This bundle includes everything that you need to make memorable pictures. Worth the price. Awesome product. 
22847 Great 
22848 Recommend!!!!!!!! 
22849 Item as described and arrived quickly. 
22850 The oversize version of the eyecup works exceptionally well with eyeglass wearers. Shuts out distracting light, esp. on sunny days. 
22851 This is the 1st tripod I ve ever bought. I am very happy with it - easy to carry around easy to get the camera on easy to change the height. 
22852 High quality. 
22853 Lost the original cord to my Sony and this came super fast and was exactly what I needed! 
22854 I just bought this bag for my DSLR and initially it looks great, feels comfortable, is light weight etc. The only thing that is missing is the bottom pocket for a monopod and an integrated rain cover. That s why I m giving it 4 stars. 
22855 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
22856 Such great quality picture on this thing. Love it!!! 
22857 Kenneth, my customer service technician was terrific. He got my up and running in 5 minutes and the camera is working great now. 
22858 Like it hope it lasts as long as my last one did 
22859 Zippers are really cheap and 1 out of 2 broke. Still worth using with 1 zipper. 
22860 Not compatible with Genie garage door motor. 
22861 Very satisfied 
22862 Works as it should. 
22863 nice 
22864 Not usable due to its a new product and not recognized by softwear...since only support is in JAPAN it is impossible to get help. Do not buy!! 
22865 This camera is perfect for our young photographer 
22866 It is what it is. Used it for GoPro 4 black and my Shoei RF-1200. Works. 
22867 The camera is a good fit for our need and I like the recording quality of the footage. 
22868 enjoy the way it develops picture 
22869 It is a good product, and not expensive. 
22870 I ordered just the bar mount and it is huge. I don t even know what bar it would go around. It is definitely not what is pictured. 
22871 Excellent range; easy to install and the inside alarm is loud enough to hear over dogs, children and TV! 
22872 My son gets so much use out of it. Makes me wonder how I got by as a kid with the crappy technology we had. 
22873 work great got to me fast! 
22874 Works great and doesn t cost nearly what the Canon branded product did. 
22875 As shown! Met my expectations. An all-around good buy! 
22876 These work great. Have had fun playing with the macro. 
22877 Daughter enjoying this gift! 
22878 My camera case was exactly as described in the ads; arrived on time; makes shopping a lot easier with this kind of service 
22879 Works okay. 
22880 Cheap, the plastic inside that holds the ink so when you turn it it ll come out - came broke. So I cant even use it as a pen. The camera points way high so it doesnt even work if you have it in your shirt pocket. 
22881 Great product. Did what I needed it to do. Just wish the cameras would adjust the zoom. There to close 
22882 very very cool!!! 
22883 Flys and takes video great, but you cant take it over 500 ft. The older ones you could take well over 1k feet. 
22884 My favorite mount now, can be angled just about any direction you will need. Quality is good. 
22885 So disappointed. The pictures weren t high quality. And it was so smart, but I couldn t figure out how to sync everything. I quickly gave up and went back to using my phone for everything. 
22886 Lens works great! For its price it s definitely worth the money. 
22887 Good price. I wouldn t check it on an airline but it s good for taking the drone places. 
22888 Its hard to find anything when not on the plate but overall a great little scope. 
22889 Very nice basic lens hood 
22890 This is the second one of these we bought. Gave our &#34;pro-sumer&#34; camera much better audio capability. Beware! The 1/8th inch audio in is mono. Using this unit you can input two XLR lines into a camera with only 1/8th in stereo input. And you can balance them during operation. 
22891 It is awesome! I love this camera! I use it all the time! 
22892 It s a go light product. The name and product speaks for itself self 
22893 To short creeps down the lens. Needs a rubber type material on inside to grip lens barrel so it will stay put. It is built good but doesn t stay on. 
22894 Henry was very helpful. he not only fixed my issue buy did resolve some issues i was having on my pc aswell. very knowledgeable on the product, very happy with company. thanks Henry 
22895 Great camera. Great price. 
22896 Lights are ok. But the rest of the kit is complete garbage. You get less than what you pay for, you re better off investing in a higher quality built light tent than this kit. 
22897 Very happy with my camera package! The only thing that bummed me was i received the case with the zipper jumped off track and doesn t close in the corners. But that s why the front clips are great! VERY happy. 
22898 After losing lens cap I now know the importance of using one, the lens cap fits perfectly. The sticky thing is supposed to stick to the cap - good luck with that. 
22899 Very flimsy and not supportive 
22900 Poor quality video .Hard to load onto computer. 
22901 Bought for my sisters birthday/moving away present! She loves it! 
22902 Love it! It is sturdy enough for a phone. If extended, fully, i would just take care not to bump it. It is light weight aluminum. Still...a great product, for the price. 
22903 Great buy it looks and feels original and fits my lens perfectly this is a 67mm lens cap I use for my 18-140 nikon lens. 
22904 Very handy to have without carrying extra pieces of equipment. 
22905 Awesome product. i always get great quality when i buy Tiffen 
22906 Very nice as a camera bag and room for a wallet. 
22907 Works great!!! 
22908 Fit perfectly! 
22909 does nothing it says it does 
22910 Ok 
22911 Works as expected 
22912 This package has so many stuff that there are so some accessories that I don t even know what they re for. 
22913 Great product at such a discounted price. Fits snug around my GoPro 4 Black Edition and still provides easy access to ports & SD card. 
22914 Excellent value! 
22915 I Love this camera. It works so nice. This camera video quality amazing. It is perfect camera for video. 
22916 Awesome value for the money. Light, sturdy enough for basic photography. 
22917 Setup was easy (once the wires were run). Great resolution for this price point and the Android app is pretty good. Only negative is that the mouse that came with the DVR requires a lot of force to click the buttons. 
22918 Very comfortable and looks great too! 
22919 Great! Works well and will come in handy for so many situations. 
22920 Had one before - lost it and thought enough of the performance and fun to buy a replacement of the same product 
22921 Great product 
22922 Works perfectly in my video camera. 
22923 They work great. Cons: Not enough range for my application, but they work well. They Need to come with power adapters, they use a LOT of batteries. 
22924 included battery lasted about 3 hours, functions ok with new $7 battery 
22925 Works Great for making porno s 
22926 These fit perfectly, went on easily.. I don t know how well they hold up, but unless they re a total disaster, they re a great buy. 
22927 Works well for CCTV cams 
22928 came home from outing and the package(CAMERA)was sitting outside my door!it was worth the wait. Mahalo for your persistence and tenacity! mahalo nui loa!!!! rty. 
22929 Works great on Canon lenses. The attachment string is also long enough for a zoom lens mounted on the caner. 
22930 I Love my Nikon 810 camera. Clear images..and can handle dark areas with high ISO. I am a photographer and use it everyday. 
22931 Do not buy this item. Did not work as described or at all, in fact. 
22932 Works how it should, high quality! 
22933 Literally perfect 
22934 Good 
22935 The Phantom 3 is awesome! Check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW509QAZH6o&feature=youtu.be 
22936 Good! Easy installation and setup, reasonable price, nice pix. 
22937 i wouldn t trust the reviews of an amazon purchase for a 3K camera, but i love it. 
22938 should have bought OEM unit - name brand...you get what you pay for - if you only look at price then its a good unit 
22939 great products. Thanks 
22940 Fits perfect 
22941 The product arrived on schedule, charged in my Canon charger, fits the camera and appears to be as advertised. I will be using it to have a second battery during an upcoming vacation. 
22942 lots of fun ways to use GoPro 
22943 Fits perfectfly with the GoPro Hero 4 Black. 
22944 Fits well, does what it s supposed to do. 
22945 Better Than Expected 
22946 Very good 
22947 camera will not hold a charge but the film paper is fine 
22948 cool camera. only thing is doesn t come with film. you have to buy it separately 
22949 okay material, but good for the price. 
22950 82-77mm step down adapter does not fit the Tamron 70-200 f/2.8 which is 77mm. 
22951 These cloths are just what I was looking for. They are not thin cloths, there s weight to them. I love how large they are especially when cleaning my eyeglasses. I highly recommend these. 
22952 For the price, a pretty good camera. Surprisingly good night vision for single IR led. 
22953 Great. Arrived as promisef 
22954 I m not going to lie, i was disappointed that the Blue wasn t like the picture! It s a lot darker but haven t had the pleasure in really using the Tripod but so far it seems really sturdy 
22955 This is a pretty great little product here! It is strong and sturdy. I use it with a canon rebel and it works perfectly. 
22956 Nice fit, slim profile 
22957 its perfect, super cute and fits camera nicely, it will surely protect it 
22958 Need to know how to really work it.... 
22959 Pretty well, is what I wanted. Fits perfect in my manfrotto shoulder brace. The chapest and confidence image stabilizer ever 
22960 its better than original canon 
22961 Could not get it to work. 
22962 Vincent was an expert at getting my cameras to show on my phones. He took the time to explain everything perfectly! Thank you! 
22963 This is made very well, and has a quick set up design that is extremely secure... 
22964 Love this tripod. Purchased it to use with my Nikon Camera and Im very content with it. 
22965 eyepiece set is good.. need to add a barlow and some other parts in the case. 
22966 Love this camera. It s great for someone like me who needs to rely on the autofocus feature. The zoom is powerful and takes clear shots. 
22967 They work fine. Very happy with them 
22968 Lags & it sucks. 
22969 I bought this kit for my daughter s Nikon D50 camera. It worked perfectly while she was a way at Photography camp and every time since. 
22970 Waste of money. Will fall off at the slightest movement. Should have purchased the Nikon hood. 
22971 It works for my use, not as a piece of camera parts. 
22972 Great quality product. 
22973 Too short of a chord. REturned 
22974 mediocore 
22975 Everything fits perfect, no complaints. 
22976 Great camera, FOSCAM remote installer, Walter took care of business right away. The whole set up was about 5 minutes. 
22977 worked perfectly 
22978 I think this kit is very good. Has most options that you would use though I tend to use the 18-140mm most of all. I have changed the filters to the better but the one provided are reasonable. 
22979 just as described. 
22980 Sturdy, no issues and has all pieces to easily use with your GoPro. Love it! 
22981 Bought to store my ultra light fishing reels. Works just fine as I expected, no more worries when traveling. 
22982 Love it!!! I also love that it comes with a strap 
22983 Effective. Work great. 
22984 I ve used these for years. Best generic battery out there 
22985 easy to use 
22986 Works as described. Great value. 
22987 I love it 
22988 small but works well 
22989 I am SHOCKED at how well thay work for the money! I have a old canon rebel that gets no respect and they did a great job on a filthy sensor. 
22990 good capacity, good delivery 
22991 works well 
22992 Works great 
22993 Excelent product! 
22994 Does what it s suppose to do... Wish it was easier to install and uninstall without using tools.. but not bad. 
22995 I love this battery!! Easy to understand what s going on, holds charge well, and charges my full size Asus ultrabook to about 100% once with a full charge - all I need. So far, it never got uncomfortably warm either. Now I *never* have to stop working! Oh, wait... 
22996 Great selection for my camera! 
22997 Awesome batteries. I get over 5 hours of recording time on my Canon Vixia HF M41 with one battery. The car charger is a great addition to my kit. Probably a dozen cycles on one of the batteries so far and I m getting full charges quickly. Great package. 
22998 Everything works well. 
22999 Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites! 
23000 Much sturdy than the plastic one I had before. Three level adjusting legs can make it very tall. I haven t figure out how to use the reverse function. But it fits all my needs now. I m happy with it. 
23001 Good price to scare off thief who try to break into your house. 
23002 Just perfect! 
23003 This camera is so cute and so good! 
23004 Perfect condition. 
23005 Got the camera to keep tabs on the animals while we re out and it works fantastic. It was very easy to set up on my Android phone and the video quality is very good. 
23006 Great value for the price. Purchased as a gift so wanted to load some photos onto product before giving. Found the remote a little unresponsive at times. Picture quality and display vary depending on quality of original data loaded onto frame. 
23007 Well almost everything is good, it just the 4 spliter adaptor is not working only if i bend it , i don t know why. Thanks 
23008 I bought this career to remote control my dog when I m not at home. It works perfectly. easy to apply and the quality of pics are great!! highly recommend!! 
23009 these are great for the buck 
23010 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
23011 great 
23012 Can be a little hard to view the screen in bright sunlight even when screen is set to its brightest.. 
23013 So many options! Going to take some time to learn to use it. 
23014 Exactly as advertised!!! Quick shipment+++ 
23015 Love this bag! 
23016 Great product! I have it on my front porch and I have the base hooked up about 100ft away in my shop. Yes, there is the occasional false alarm, but not often. Has lasted 2 winters and 2 summers in the South. 
23017 Good 
23018 Love it! 
23019 terrific 
23020 Great price and product arrive perfectly. 
23021 The sound isn t the best 
23022 It doesn t work for canon, i didn t realize. Trigger should do its job when it s not attached to the camera, but it doesn t. I guess it works for nikon though. 
23023 Great product! Used it for a trip to Costa Rica and it was awesome. I d definitely recommend this product and seller :) 
23024 does not work. Can only get red light after 4 hours of charging and inserting an sd mini card. Could not do any recording and computer does not recognize the glasses as the instruction say. 
23025 I attached it on my Dicapac WP-ONE Point & Shoot Digital Camera Waterproof Case with Canon powershot S95. It was perfect for snorkeling. I love it! 
23026 Had to return it. I bough it for my wedding and all the images came blurry. The quality is appalling. 
23027 It works flawless without network drops. Excellent video Quality 
23028 Cannot be beat for the price. 
23029 I purchased these for my iPad, but can use them for so many things! 
23030 Connected it with my dvr, it has sharp image at day and at night. Good experience. 
23031 After 1 and a half year of use, 5 cameras dont work anymore. They were profesionally wired and indoors. 
23032 Not original 
23033 Being able to handle a picture to each person really made the photo booth a success 
23034 Very good 
23035 works fine 
23036 Perfect sized bag and cush enough for my Nikon D3300 and extras 
23037 Excellent..... and very prompt devilery 
23038 This is awesome. I wanted to be able to take pictures while in New York without having to hand my several hundred dollar camera to a pickpocket or thief. This allowed me to take pictures and remember my trip without having to bring someone else or have my camera stolen. 
23039 Perfect 
23040 Used once and it cant charge anymore.....became trash.. sigh... 
23041 great condition , very clear optics 
23042 I left this case on the back of my truck and when I drove off it fell off onto the highway. It got run over and I went back to check it out and he case did its job. My gopro is perfectly fine 
23043 I now always have a spare. Reasonable price. 
23044 Perfect and just what I needed for my camera!!! 
23045 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
23046 i have worn this pin to work once a week for the past year & I wash it in the laundry. It hasn t lost its color & is still as cute as ever. Highly recommend! 
23047 This camera takes a few pictures and then the lens gets stuck and says lens error, no wonder it was so cheap! 
23048 Battery works fine. I use it as a back up and have not tested the battery life. 
23049 Fit GPS, seems to work properly. 
23050 Perfect item worx great THNX 
23051 Works great, all my fd lens work well with it so far 
23052 I love this flash, helps me take great pics! 
23053 Smart Majic in Photo and Video Technology 
23054 Great film! 
23055 Item delivered on time and as described. 
23056 The pack rocks, I have purchased 2 more and- 2- 360 light units at 72 years old I no longer have a desire to carry heavy light sets and stands. Everything goes into one rolling case stands,lights,boxes, brellas,etc cables, and packs. everything I need 
23057 Looks real enough, but the batteries on the larger cameras wear out quickly! 
23058 I first received the wrong product, was completely disappointed. Immediately, returned it. Received the correct product quickly (in time for my trip) and am VERY happy. Great quality bag! It is awesome for what I need! 
23059 Awesome little cloths! got the for my touch screen laptop to remove finger prints and it works great! started using one for my phone too and it keeps it looking clean 
23060 Works straight out of the box with both my Canon 430EX II and Vivitar s 285V s. 
23061 Pretty decent close up lens and exceptional value. I find it works best by selecting one of the three parts, maybe two, but haven t found a need for all 3 in combination yet, if that s even possible. 
23062 Love love love this tripod. It s light and still sturdy. I use this almost every day. I have a Droid Turbo and it holds it nicely and the remote works perfectly with it. I highly recommend this product. 
23063 Worked perfect it was great using my camera again after so long 
23064 If it had the Wi-Fi camera and longer lasting batteries, I would consider it perfect. 
23065 I was missing the bolt for the micro macro lens could not fit the adapter on 
23066 works good 
23067 The Table Top shooting cube is fine but the four backgrounds were folded into 6&#34; squares that are difficult to impossible to get rid of the folds. The really should roll them up. 
23068 Like others, my only complaint is that you could place the battery in backwards. Not sure if that s an issue, the charger might have reverse polarity protection? Batteries work well, charger works well. 
23069 Cute :) 
23070 Exceeded my expectations. I ve been using everything for several months and.no problems. Glad I saved money and didn t buy the gopro kits for 3x the price. 
23071 Great replacement charger. Works fine and does a fine job. 
23072 Works well and solidly built. 
23073 Henry :did an outstanding job helping me set up my F19821W camera for both wireless operation & remote access. I am very pleased with the customer service and the camera. 
23074 Great alternative to the comparable Nikon lens for a fraction of the cost. It s a bit noisy, but that doesn t bother me. 
23075 dvr does not give signal to LG monitor. cable is good.but does not operate. when turn on zmodo logo appear that says loading, then turn black with wording no signal., cannot get help from support. 
23076 Worked exactly how it is suppose to. I was kind of scared because of such a low price, but it worked like a charm! 
23077 Film wasn t developing properly or not at all. Film may have been too old. 
23078 I hope my gopro never falls off in the ocean, but at least I now know it ll be up on the surface when I go looking for it. 
23079 A+ 
23080 Does what it says on the box 
23081 Works great 
23082 Excellent product! provides great visibility while protecting copter from noob damage. Installation tip, lay thick towel on flat service and flip copter without props. This will keep all your motors in alignment. 
23083 The back protector works great however the top screen protector does not fit perfect since it is flat and the screen on the camera is a little rounded. 
23084 Gets the job done without any hastle. I love being able to use my gopro on a tripod. 
23085 It charges the batteries fine, but have not used the camera enough to need extra batteries yet. 
23086 Absolutely what I wanted! 
23087 nice compact camera with hight Mega pixels 
23088 Met my needs and expectations and the price was really good. 
23089 Camera is fantastic and the package was a great deal. Recommend! 
23090 Great 
23091 Great camera for summer fun! Works well underwater and outdoors. Very durable. ..it has survived many water slides and works perfectly (even after being dropped a few times by my child). 
23092 The little camera that could! Great, crisp picture. The only downside is the talking feature. It is so quiet my dogs can barely hear me when I talk through it! 
23093 It does what it s supposed to do. Installed on Nikon D750. 
23094 Pictures are not big enough, I bought the 300 wide two weeks later 
23095 Great camera, consistent 
23096 Good 
23097 Very blurry and slow. 
23098 The perfect flash backup. I shoot Nikon and use a Nikon SB-910. I needed more flash units for off camera use and this product works great with my Nikon system. Will most likely order more so I have plenty. 
23099 works very well. shipped quick and I am very pleased with the quality and construction. 
23100 Not as easy to program as hope. 
23101 These are just wonderful. With the border s finish, they don t leave any lints hanging. The simili-suede just grabs dust and lint and doesn t smear like tome cheaper cloths. Great value that I highly recommend. 
23102 Quality Nikon product at a good price 
23103 More than I expected. Thanks 
23104 The camera was all that was advertised. Took me a bit to figure out all the gadgets that came with it, but I did. Camera takes very high quality photos. I am very pleased with my purchase. 
23105 Great item, great price, quick delivery. 
23106 Lost my original one so this one will fasten on to the strap., 
23107 works perfect. battery charge status shows up. 
23108 great 
23109 Works great has a great range 
23110 Excellent product. Thanks! 
23111 works as advertised good customer support. 
23112 Can t usually get it to stay straight so the flash actually hits the softbox correctly. 
23113 great fit and finish, no complaints here 
23114 It meets my needs 
23115 I just got into the hobby, and didn t want to spend a lot of money on eyepiece s just yet. This was the right upgrade for me! 
23116 I purchased these cleaning cloths based on previous reviews and I do not regret! Great quality and good value! 
23117 It s okay, but not in love with GoPro style mounts in general. 
23118 Just received the camera. Took just a couple of pictures and I am very pleased. At first I found it a little hard to center the pictures but I think I am getting the hang of it now. Bonnie 
23119 It s great.. and I m sure that it s amazing. 
23120 Thank you for getting it here on time. See you guys soon. 
23121 Purchased the RFN-4s for my Nikon D800 fitting was easy to fit and worked straight from the box. Would thoroughly recommend this product. 
23122 FOR THE PRICE NOT BAD !! 
23123 Yes, I like this camera, its perfect for my real estate work. Good quality, and my 2nd Coolpix. 
23124 Have had the camera for 1 week and am amazed at the quality of the images. Have hand held low light images at 720mm equivalent and gotten clear sharp images, wow! Other low light images have been equally impressive. I suspect that I will never use the flash. 
23125 Great lens 
23126 This is my favorite 2x3 instant camera, only surpassed by the Fuji Instax 300 for the picture size. 
23127 Shipped fast and item works as stated. I like the compact design. Easy to fold up and carry along for a shoot. 
23128 I never got the darn thing to work. I didn t return it either because it was cheaply priced and not worth the hassle. 
23129 Wonderful cleaning cloths. Great company. Would buy again. 
23130 Very good product and good picture quality 
23131 One of the batteries came with defect and it doesn t hold the charge... 
23132 Came in on time. Was able to charge the camera before going see the baby thanks. 
23133 The tripod itself was great but the quick release came broken I can t put the plate back on. Now I have to by a whole new ball head. The price to ship it back is just to much hassle. 
23134 Not good 
23135 Great entry level camera. Decent quality. I love having it for off-road and rally cross races. I wish the battery life was a little better, but since it can record while charging, I just leave it hooked up in the car. 
23136 great product thank you 
23137 Little bit of a tight fit, also don t try to remove it from the case its very hard to get back in. The case fits my Hero 4 Silver great but the rubber with most 3rd party cases is thicker and harder to close. But overall great. 
23138 Pelican quality always. Sold on quality and long lasting. We use about 20 cases with our equipt. 
23139 Fits like a charm. Exactly what I needed when mine fell off my Canon XSi. 
23140 Worked great on my camera very happy 
23141 Great novelty gift. Don t expect clear digital quality pics however. Fun camera to take to parties and gatherings. 
23142 Very nice price. 
23143 Great product...most others have a short range, but I have tried this one at 140 feet and it still works! 
23144 Good 
23145 Fits well and works with the metering system (aperture priority) of the camera. However, I don t understand why the camera (Fuji) side is plastic and the lens side metal. Other adapters have metal on both sides. Can t they match metal to Fuli X mounts? Curious. 
23146 Zmodo makes the best camera system on the market for the money. I ve had several of these models for many years. 
23147 Good for the price. However you can t see pictures outside because of the sun glare on the screen. 
23148 the flash is not Polaroid as in the picture, the filters lens aren t filters, just 4 diferent close-up lens.. everything else was cool.. 
23149 Great 
23150 Was a replacement for one that stopped working. 
23151 seems to work fine...a little tight fitting 
23152 Did not work but it may be a problem with laptop and not the charger purchased. Have not determined yet. Arrived fine and no problem with transaction though 
23153 Worked great 
23154 I m not sure the one I got is a Watson. It doesn t say Watson anywhere and just looks like a cheap fuji ripoff. It seems to work okay and fit for now. 
23155 good yes!!!!!!!!!! 
23156 A very nice, very functional, full featured camera, in a compact package. A keeper! 
23157 It works great to activate shutter and video record but their is no option to adjust shutter, iso or aperture so you still have to touch your camera even when you have this remote. I wish it had all the functionalists. 
23158 Decent cams. Very easy to install. Had to return, one s night vision stopped working after 2.5 wks. You can only view day time. 
23159 Not working @ all..not even 30 days & now I have 2 return it. 
23160 Works great! 
23161 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
23162 The Vivitar Dual Action Lightning and Motion is a great devise for shooting lightning during the night. Needs some practice to figure out the sensitivity adjustments. Thanks Amazon for your awesome service and promptitiude as well as you did many times for me. 
23163 Ordered extra batteries for my new camera. Arrived quickly and work perfect. Thank you. 
23164 good 
23165 Does what it s made for 
23166 You get whet you pay for, so this works fine at this price. 
23167 Finally I can store all my camera stuff in one place!! this is a very nice bag with lots of room for my &#34;stuff&#34;, and it arranges nicely with compartment dividers that are movable. 
23168 Fun for a party. Film was fresh and easy to use. Great picture quality. 
23169 The Rokinon Cine Series are a great value. Perfect for the low to mid-budget filmmaker. 
23170 The first picture got stuck and ruined in both cartridges. 
23171 Great product & service 
23172 Description matched product. Was a perfect fit for our overhead projector. 
23173 Not the item pictured! This is a single pocket wizard for Einstein mono lights only. I should have read the description. 
23174 This is the best camera I ever owned. Makes you wonder why hauling a massive camera makes any sense. Seems stupid now that I have this one. Let s see the death of massive SLR cameras! 
23175 you get what you pay... 
23176 I absolutely love this quadcopter. My main use for it is photography and the turtle mode allows for slow and predictable movement. 
23177 One sided, off centered. Not as described. There are many other sellers selling much better straps for the same price 
23178 not for dslrs rigged or with heavy lenses, may need some fiddling or twiking to make it reliable ! 
23179 Like it and recommend for those who doesn t have a studio flashes 
23180 Great Camera. I have given up on my big DSLR cameras. I make big 16X20 or 16X24 inch prints and they are great. 
23181 Love this viewfinder, just wish it worked with my new GH4. 
23182 Works great with Pisector GS08 console. I lost my original one and was able to connect this one to my system in a matter of minutes. Pisector customer service is always really responsive and helpful if you have questions about compatibility with their systems, sensors, remotes, etc. 
23183 Complete Garbage 
23184 Terrible camera shaky video grainy I bought two and I m sorry threw away the boxes or I would have sent them back not even close to my go pro 
23185 one battery has lasted for a few months already in my dog s bark collar, with no sign of slowing down yet 
23186 I like the quality of this tripod. Not plastic like other moderately priced tripods. I especially like the ease of adjustments and love that it can be close to ground level as I enjoy photographing snowflakes. 
23187 Needed storage for my memory and I have always liked this memory holder. 
23188 very good 
23189 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
23190 Very user friendly. Excellent color. Like it much better than my canon. 
23191 not usefull 
23192 This product is excellent value I am very pleased with it. There are lots of pieces in this kit including several cloths, lens cleaning fluid and tissue, a blower and brushes. Did a nice job cleaning my camera lenses and filters. Best value hands down. 
23193 It fit in the charger but would not power up my camera. 
23194 It s nice quality but I thought it was a longer pole. I should of paid better attention when I ordered it. 
23195 Just what we wanted. 
23196 great product and have bought again based on good performance 
23197 Terrible Product. Not stable at all. 
23198 good 
23199 Excellent product 
23200 I read lots of reviews before ordering this. I hooked it up and took some shots at home right away and it worked great, comes in a nice carrying case also. Will work great for catch light. 
23201 Great viewing and quality for the price. Very happy with the binoculars! Use it for the horse track and watching birds. 
23202 Works great. Even fits over my life jacket when I used it on the water 
23203 Worked as advertised. Took the scare away from those snorkeling trips over deep reefs where I previously worried about losing my $400 camera. Also got some cool video in a lake by letting it float upside down by itself and get visits from the resident fish. 
23204 GREAT CAMERA! 
23205 Just what I needed! 
23206 one of the best gadget so far! thank you for your great customer service! appreciate it 
23207 Love this! 
23208 Awesome product my nephew absolutely loves it! Excellent value and high quality made. 
23209 Good lens 
23210 Doesn t work with Applie PC 
23211 The product good value for money. Although it needs a faster net connection, it works average on standard speed. Image quality fair 
23212 Motion detection alarm a bit complex to set. 
23213 Love this case keep all my essential accessories in one place and super portable very strong 
23214 worked great with D3200, allows you to set interval and or duration. 
23215 They re microfiber cloths, what s there to review? 
23216 These are fantastic. I ve used other microfiber screen cleaning cloths before, but these are amazingly better. 
23217 I love it. 
23218 Used this flash for one shoot--then it died. Was hoping for more out of this product. Usually I don t have issues with this brand. 
23219 It was great 
23220 Great picture quality with this lens. 
23221 The product was received in very good time, I think it was a day early. Packaging was very appropriate and no complaints about the product as it was exactly as expected. 
23222 Perfect to fix stripped tripod mount 
23223 Excellent product!!! AAA fast delivery! 
23224 Everything was perfect! 
23225 Everything I expected it to be! 
23226 Excellent lens, 5 years warranty, great for my Nikon cameras. 
23227 KAZA filters are excellent choices and have a great price. I look forward to using this filter on my Canon lens. 
23228 Très bon 
23229 This is exactly what I needed for a camera that was given to me. I can now use this excellent camera because I now have the right charger. 
23230 Great deal! 
23231 the camera is great shot so fast unlike eny other camera at that price, the bundel is a real added valeu, thogh it wood be nice if there are 2 extra battery because the camera consume the energy quite fast 
23232 Did the trick ..fixed our lens with the help of youtube and a fraction of the cost of taking it in. 
23233 I ve taken some great shots with this, couldn t be happier. 
23234 This is a perfect travel lens. It has a very large range, but is relatively light weight. 
23235 Certainly worth the money, I recommend it! 
23236 I use this a a portable Chromakey system and it works great. With two people, it s easy to lean against the wall. With a little practice, folding goes smoothly. 
23237 Very nice. Might buy another one. Very quick and easy set up. Added a nice soft light to photos. 
23238 It was nice 
23239 Nice group of accessories, don t know if I will use them all, but it will be cheaper in the end than purchasing separately. 
23240 Used this (in my fanny pack) my whole 2 week Disney stay and it was nice and compact and light but hard enough that I knew my camera was safe. 
23241 For $20, this microphone is phenomenal. I can play ukulele while recording my own voice and even sound distribution is given to both. 
23242 Perfect for street photography and to take on vacations. I didn t use any of my other lenses on my last trip to NYC. Very lightweight and portable, it doesn t draw any attention. Silent and fast focus. Very pleased. 
23243 Once I learned to use it I love it. 
23244 Price and quality were both excellent. 
23245 Perfect flash, never failed and doesn t cost an arm and leg like the other named branded flashes 
23246 Works Great 
23247 great battery 
23248 Haven t used this a ton but it seems really good quality and it is nice that the whole camera holding assembly moves on the strap 
23249 Very good 
23250 Held battery life to expectation, isn t too heavy, does the job. It ll do. 
23251 Match the body of my camera! 
23252 No RGB values for color squares. No PDF of manual. 
23253 I toss it into my backpack every time I go hiking and never have to worry about my filters getting scratched or lost. 
23254 Good, inexpensive! 
23255 It works as advertised 
23256 Dropped connection, can t get it back 
23257 Great price, fit s my Manfrotto Heads perfectly. 
23258 Background is very thin, so keep that in mind. 
23259 Nice and durable 
23260 Works perfectly. Great picture transmission. Simple setup. I ve ordered 2 more for other rooms. 
23261 This is a great product. It is small compact easy for travel. The company TrioSports USA is a wonderful company to do business with. Excellent product and customer service I would recommend this product to my friends. Thank you 
23262 Great for the Microscope and great for science kids! 
23263 It came on time only 10 days love my pics😄 
23264 Great camera, now if I can learn all its finer points! Turns out it s the same one my grandsons bought after extensive research, so it must be good! 
23265 Easy setup, quite versitile. Using it to make photos of old family pictures. 
23266 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
23267 Should have read the specs closer. Only takes high resolution pics. Cannot change setting for smaller file sizes. Crazy in the day and age that this feature is not included. I have a 15 year old Sony that does it. Otherwise it s a decent camera. 
23268 This is in use everyday. I put it in my garage because I normally leave the overhead door open. Now I know when a person enters the garage from in the house. 
23269 I bought this for my daughter s 16th birthday and she loves it. It is a great starter camera for the serious young photographer, or anyone starting out for that matter. All the items in this particular package are of good quality, and the Canon products are excellent. 
23270 ehhhh, it s great and has great promise, but ultimately the colors are dull and the user experience leaves a lot to be desired. 
23271 Perfect!!! 
23272 Great case. Just what I expected. The insert holds everything perfectly. 
23273 Exactly the battery I was looking for. Product was shipped and at my house in 2 days. Very pleased. 
23274 Love the size & color. But, it can t hold an additional lens. Only one... 
23275 Very unstable. 
23276 The glasses became loose on the third day... I assume that means the filter is not functioning properly. 
23277 Great, but not perfect. 
23278 Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend! 
23279 Decent picture. WAY over priced for a Chinese camera. Software is confusing if you have little experience. Night vision is good to about 30ft. Does not come with SD card. 
23280 It s a well thought out design and very snug on my Manfrotto sticks. Nobs are big and look like they aren t likely to break easily. We ll see about that. In any case, I think this one will last. 
23281 a necessity for use with cokin filters without having extra equipment 
23282 Love it! 
23283 Great backpack for DJI. Love it. 
23284 Good quality but can t use the protective lens cover on it. 
23285 very good for my a6000 setup 
23286 Have had 2 of these for about 4 months now, and they have never pulled up an error message on my D3300 or my D5300, have worked great, last just as long or longer than my En-El 14a. Will be buying more. Thankyou guys so much!! 
23287 Amazing shipping time. Got it within 3 days if the order. Was exactly what was pictured, well packaged. It is the 70d w. Had the wifi. Just awesome. Better quality accessories than I was even expecting. Thank you. 
23288 After using this cloth, my computer screen looks just like new-- it is crystal clear! 
23289 love these 
23290 very compact and very cushioned for travel. i have Nikon D7000 camera. the case is perfect. all my accessories fit very comfortably. very happy with this purchase 
23291 If you want to read my full review with some photos, I posted it on my blog: https://petecocophotography.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/neewer-vertical-grip-for-canon-6d/ 
23292 It working like Nikon Battery 
23293 Just what I expected 
23294 These stands were as described. 
23295 Cheap construction hence the price but adequately held my Nikon D5200 and Canon Vixia with no fuss. 
23296 The lens caps work great! My only complaint is that the adhesive on the strap didn t work for too long, but otherwise these work great. 
23297 There only need me open the APP and scan, no need the cable, it`s so easy for me 
23298 A part with a tripod hole is an excellent addition. 
23299 Very happy with the battery and the seller 
23300 Video quality very poor. See for yourself before making purchase decision. https://app.box.com/s/nxk36fuhqdkcyn1x3iugq1hklo0rzu3d Recorded at 720p 60fps A family member purchased 1 for me and I was about to place order for another one for bicycle but after viewing few recorded video, due to poor video quality, will be returning it. 
23301 Took it on an overseas trip of several weeks. When I went to use it it would not work. 
23302 Nice one for the price 
23303 Great protection. Bit bulky though... 
23304 Item works well but it took much longer to receive I paid for faster shipping and it was a Strain on my business because item took much longer 
23305 The product came broken and it hás locked into my lens. I have sent my lens to technical assistance to fix. Horrible. Don t buy! 
23306 I use this for my Canon T3 and it works very well and charges in the original charger that came with the camera. I love it. 
23307 I will not buy again, once clipped requires a screwdriver to unclip it from the camera 
23308 Picture quality was ok but the sound was no good at all, I sent it back and would never buy the item ever again Junk. 
23309 Second frame I have owned--seamless setup and great picture quality. 
23310 As expected still experimenting with this lens forbid is totally new for me. 
23311 Sturdy Case, fit s my Hero 4 silver. I m happy with it. 
23312 This was a good surprise 🎁. The camera 📷 was ready to shoot right after taking it out of the box. Easy to operate, and the pictures are clear and sharp. Anazing product. 
23313 This a good battery replacement than paying a crazy amount for the official canon battery. 
23314 Great all around package has everything you need and then some, great product 
23315 Exactly as I expected it to be. Works great. Thank you. 
23316 I was giving the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion. Great product at a great price. Easy to setup and use. Very sturdy and easy to extend. Highly recommended! 
23317 NOT TOO HAPPY.. very complicated to install, not people friendly... I wont recommend this. 
23318 Did not work on arrival. Seller refunded money. 
23319 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
23320 very nice little camera for FPV flying a quadcopter... good clear picture and nice field of view. small and light 
23321 Amazing 
23322 For the price this bag is great. Love the security for travel. 
23323 Always like to have a reserve battery for my camera. This is proving to be very reliable. 
23324 This was so easy to install and has been so fun to use (though we seriously installed it as a security measure). Love it--and will probably buy a second one. 
23325 gopro is very handy. Beware that you do NOT get the micro SD chip with it and you will need to charge it before using it. 
23326 Works as expected Nikon D5200; this is IR not wireless and needs a line of sight. 
23327 Use them often, would buy many more. 
23328 Seemed good at first until the plastic broke. Can t find replacement parts. 
23329 Doesn t even compare to my Olympus - THIS CAMERA IS TOTAL CRAP. The interface is almost the same and I figured that I d give it a shot for $129. GARBAGE. Not waterproof. I repeat - NOT WATERPROOF. Terrible pics. I ll be requesting a refund. 
23330 Work 
23331 Great accessories 
23332 It ll tide me over for a while, but it s soft plastic and is very loose on the lens. Slightest bump and it falls off. 
23333 Works perfectly, just a little expensive. 
23334 It great to have spare batteries and it charges them quickly. I love having the car adapter. 
23335 Excellent product for the price ... and w/ spare batteries. Did the job for me. 
23336 Works great! 
23337 Just what I was looking for! 
23338 Batteries are a tight fit, but all in all, a good product!!! 
23339 Works as advertised. 
23340 Didn t fit my iPhone 5c right 
23341 I have received the product and with no problem. It is always good to have a warranty for expensive items. 
23342 Just as expected, nice quality for cleaning glasses. Didn t need individually wrapped, but its a great idea to keep them clean. 
23343 A good flash, energizer doesn t make camera flashs, another brand. The listing said this would work with my sony a58 dlsr. It doesn t fit the mount. Had to buy an adapter. Works fine now. As good a flash as those costing twice as much. 
23344 Very good attachment to have 
23345 I love it. 
23346 So perfect for the GoPro!! The clear case is Great!! It is working wonderful and with the mic 100% a most get if you want to do more with it 
23347 Not bad. All filters work except the 10x. Decent for price. Good for beginners wanting to learn a little. 
23348 Exactly what I needed. 
23349 It s usable, but the price is too high for a simple plate like this, especially I already bought two Dolica tripods. 
23350 Absolutely love it❤️ 
23351 This has proven to be an essential element in my pocket at all times while photographing. Tee cleaner part (not brush) works extremely well and conveniently. 
23352 It s ok. Smaller than I hoped for but it does the job 
23353 Works great 
23354 Nice filters 
23355 Was super easy to install and readjust. Is resistant to fingerprints, eye smudges, and protects the glass. Very worthwhile getting. 
23356 Terrible! This turns on the GoPro and makes it cycle through menus, takes pictures, etc. It is way too tight and doesn t fit right, caused my battery to die and my gopro to take hundreds of photos. Can t not recommend enough. 
23357 My frame quit functioning within 6 months, however the manufacturer has contacted me to offer a replacement. I will update my review when it is received, but I am very impressed by the customer service at this point. 
23358 Great 
23359 Excellent 3rd person in case something happens. 
23360 I already needed 
23361 Doesn t stay on very long even with a full charge. Kind of crappy, not nearly as close as it it was going to going to be 
23362 Returned them.....really is not way to attach to the sling because its a closed unit...you can not slide these on. I called the company and wondered what the purpose was....because the sling WAS a closed unit 
23363 Henry from Support was knowledgeable, patient and very helpful. The camera is very technical and requires too much maintenance for those who are not IT-inclined. 
23364 Works just as well as the official GoPro chestmount. Adjustable straps; Fits adults perfectly. 
23365 perfect replacement and on time. 
23366 Love this thing! My only wish is that the padded shoulder part covered a bit moreFor more padding, and that the adjustment buckle was in the front for quicker adjustments. 
23367 Was using the neck strap that came with my Fuji XE-1 and it was so bulky. Changed over to this wonderfully crafted little wrist strap and am a happy camper. I got the camera because it is small and light. The strap conforms and enhances those qualities. 
23368 Excellent cloths. Individually wrapped 
23369 Only has a hdmi out put dosent have the bnc out, or the rca out 
23370 A gift for my daughter ! It looks more expensive than it is .and she loves it!! 
23371 Works well for using a one or two sets of filters to cover the from element of your lens. 
23372 Great deal 
23373 Great!!! 
23374 Great 
23375 Very sturdy plate. I m using it on a flycam nano to make it easier to remove my Canon 70D. Works great. 
23376 I ve been using these batteries in a VIXIA HF R600, and they are performing perfectly. The camera displays the remaining battery life, exactly like the Canon battery. The charger works with these batteries and the original Canon battery. 
23377 Great 
23378 Always good product from STK. 
23379 Very helpful. Calvin was able to help me with my problem very easily. 
23380 Good picture quality for the price 
23381 Works great, fast charging 
23382 put it on my o ring for my water housing of my Sony action Cam and worked great! No leaks and kept the ring nice and lubed! 
23383 So far the batteries have performed as expected. Battery life is good. I haven t time it to determine how long it last. 
23384 Good quality for the price. 
23385 Just what I needed for a spider man car. 
23386 NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE I CAN URGE ANYONE TO BUY THIS. Digital and cell phone images are great, but this!!! Is a must!!! 
23387 Cannot be used with a Sony genuine hard lens protector, which I didn t know before. 
23388 This is very comfortable to use especially when using a long telephoto lens while hiking. 
23389 Nice 
23390 excellent product. does what it says. 
23391 Maybe I need to go trough some learning but the pictures have odd colors and are blurry. 
23392 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
23393 This is a great LCD protector, and the only type (GGS) that I would even consider for my camera s. 
23394 Great photos 
23395 It s nice having extra batteries and the car charger. 
23396 Not as Advertised Wrong Item&#62;sent it back. 
23397 Excellent first timer s camera, great quality, video, and accessories are a nice added touch. The price deal was great too! I like it a lot! 
23398 Really happy with this accessory. I really like that as well as a pistol grip, it can be used as a small tripod. It has helped keeping my shots steady as opposed to using the handle on a traditional handy cam. 
23399 Works great. Could have made the knock out holes easier to punch out. 
23400 Fits camera well in both directions. Costs a little more but it works! 
23401 If you give a good description you ll always have a satisfied customer. 
23402 they are all useful product with reasonable price. 
23403 Fine so far. 
23404 These do an awesome job of cleaning!!! 
23405 Perfect. On time. 5/5 
23406 This camera mount works excellent for my bicycle. It is a very simple design, but sometime the simplest designs are the best, which is the case with this product. It attaches securely on my handlebars. Once secure it stays that way. My camera takes excellent pictures/video as I ride. 
23407 The quality is very good for the price. The ball is smooth, hardware are build to high quality. It is quite big and heavy, not a travel ball head. For stationary use, it is perfect. 
23408 It was nice A+ in my book 
23409 nice easy to use takes great photos 
23410 Great and handy ....easy to setup 
23411 ZERO STARS, this P.O.S. came with users guide written by some one with no working use of English and it never worked after we worked out the coded messages it came with. the old saying is true : you get what you pay for. 
23412 Terrible. Used one piece and it broke putting it on. The suction cup dose not work at all. 
23413 the straps don t handle the weight of all the glass and the camera. I am frequently adjusting the straps. the front pocket is awkward. 
23414 Worked as advertised 
23415 Nicely constructed and great fit for GX7 camera. I am quite happy with this purchase. 
23416 Really helpful to keep your gopro safe on your boards, bikes, and even wrists. Definitely recommend if you do not want to lose your gopro. 
23417 Very well made, it s comfortable and durable. It feels more secure in your hand than any handle. 
23418 Excellent product works as expected. 
23419 awesome. these batteries are great, came in quick, charged up pretty quickly and lasted for longer than they should on a charge. 
23420 Love it!!!! Excellent zoom! Going to take it on my cery first cruise with my girlfriend. I plan on taking some pictures and videos. 
23421 Wonderful lens 
23422 okey 
23423 This says that it will fit Sony Alpha cameras, but it did not fit my Alpha A6000. Not sure who gets the credit for the description, whether it s the manufacturer or Amazon. Big caveat emptor. I returned it of course, and have to look for another product. 
23424 Not bad, for more effect I added some wires 
23425 Works exactly as expected! 
23426 My daughter loves this camera fun for teens but pictures are pretty expensive about $1.00 each. 
23427 every thing ok 
23428 IT WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!! PRICING WAS EXCELLENT 
23429 Great! 
23430 Excellent product. Thanks! 
23431 Great cam for recreation use. YES...It is Water Proof. We submerged it for 5 minutes or more and we continue to enjoy the benefits of this camera. Little heavy but durable. SPLASH 
23432 Used this case while white water rafting. I was able to fit two DSLR cameras into it and they remained dry and protected. Able to stand on the case too without impacting its contents. 
23433 I thought it was bigger but it works well with accessories. 
23434 These cameras are junk. Extremely poor video if you can get them to work at all. 
23435 Work well 
23436 This product met my expectations. 
23437 Kenneth was very helpful and figured out the problem. Everything working now. Foscam is a nice camera. It s great to be able to check on things when we are not at home. Thanks for the great service. 
23438 I bought this as a spare. I use it with my Sony A72 and it works well. Great price and I recommend it highly 
23439 Pretty decent product but a little tricky to install. Overall, I m fairly satisfied that it will protect that fragile screen on my G16. 
23440 Works perfectly fine in my E-M1. 
23441 The battery is broken 
23442 Great high quality product at a good price. From a company that stands behind thier product and are aiming for not just the highest of quality product, but top knotch customer service for any of your needs! Highly recommend this ND filter lack of color/ image distortion is suburb. 
23443 Fits perfect 
23444 Easy set up. We needed a barn camera to monitor our animals. The barn was well within our router range and this worked well for our needs. 
23445 Very pleased 
23446 Had some problems with recording button, sent it back to replay to fix and they changed it for a new one, working perfectly! Sellers experience was quite good and I can only recommend them. 
23447 Wish it had instructions 
23448 Recommend 
23449 Really great tripod. Stable and quick to setup. I have used this at weddings, events, portraits and filming. 
23450 Excelent product 
23451 filters - are ok but - the wipes had a cloud of dust on them 
23452 Love the product. Very easy to set up. Pictures are very clear. If putting outside I would suggest buying the adjustable mounts. 
23453 Quality of this tripod is excellent compared to my old one. Easy to use & transport. Really nice flexible piece of equipment for shooting from various angles. 
23454 nice 
23455 it s not working as expected it would work and I can t return it anymore 
23456 love this lens for landscape and astro photography. 
23457 When using a timer just won t cut it - remote control! 
23458 Awesome, thank you so much looks amazing! 
23459 Nice cable, armored from sharp edges. 
23460 Everything about this camera is great! Size and weight is so much better than my old camera. Fits easily in my pocket for on-the-go use. Mine was refurbished, but it looks new. Not a single problem with it so far. 
23461 Worked out great. 
23462 Easy to use. Practical size. Nick 
23463 I like the black over the silver. The bayonet action is smooth. 
23464 Good 
23465 Did not fit, did not respond to my inquiry. 
23466 Fit my Canon 28-135 IS just like the Canon version, makes me regret buying these overpriced Canon branded ones for all these years. 
23467 Thank you 
23468 Nice compact size for a good price. 
23469 Expensive but works and worth it! 
23470 Was worth the purchase it s very easy to use 
23471 Great! 
23472 I was disappointed that it doesn t come with a full instructional guide.I had to play with it to figure what most of the buttons do. 
23473 Fits perfect to the Coolpix AW130 Great stuff! 
23474 worked well enough for my purposes so far. I still have some more experimentation to do before I can give it my full approval 
23475 Easy to set up and excellent support available. First one was a breeze, second one ran into a small issue but Ed from customer support walked me through it easily! Would recommend and will purchase more dlink products in the future. 
23476 Regular 
23477 Good charger for my IS-200X sONY 
23478 This is a perfectly acceptable inexpensive camera bag. It s just not great. I am storing my 1950 s Voghtlander in it so OK for that since it sits in my closet most of the time. 
23479 Works well easy to use 
23480 It fits the Nikon P7800 perfectly. Not much room for anything else 
23481 Works very good.. Pic s are great. Not at nite... 
23482 great works love it , great price 
23483 Worth it for the price. The tripod is not that sturdy but you ll get use to it. 
23484 Soft rubber means good protecting, easy to pack and carry, and it s lightweight. 
23485 Really nice set. Has all you need for the camera. Seems to be well made. 
23486 Night vision works great still not hd but the regular video is so bad when played on a regular sized monitor its super grainy... didnt like this camera at all 
23487 Terrible..just terrible... I bought three camera s and could not even get one to hook up to the WiFi. Even the tech support (unfortunately one over worked person in California) could not even fix. Sending back. 
23488 unit was bad / ok day light but not at night / ir was bad (oversaturated). sent it back. 
23489 Although I had a cleaning set, I didn t have anything like this one. I gave my DSLR and good cleaning after I cleaned the CMOS. Now I use this set as my first cleaning attack before each major usage and am really happy, 
23490 The case the lenses comes in broke immediately upon opening it. 
23491 Just adding my five stars to the rest of the reviewers, the ring s threads are fine and attach to the camera and filter smoothly. The price is fair and the cloth is an added plus. 
23492 Got the product on time. Loved it, it took very good pictures and was very happy. Thanks 
23493 I bought this case for my boyfriend to use for his SJCAM. The SJCAM and his accessories all fit nicely in it. I was drawn to this case because it was one of the few I found that was big enough to accommodate his suction cup. 
23494 The item works great. Thank you. 
23495 Great product and price. Fast shipping! 
23496 Does what I need. Nice design and accessories. Glad I got it. 
23497 More than I expected for the money. Great deal and more gadgets than I could ever use. 
23498 Worked just as advertised. It better 
23499 Pretty cool stick, but beware, the clip that holds the remote is a little wonky-- I bumped it and the clip and my remote dropped to the bottom of the lake-- reinforcing it w duct tape would ve probably been the thing to do. 
23500 It work as intended, the price is good, waiting to see how long the battery last. 
23501 Handy! 
23502 Worked perfectly, including the couple of times I needed both hands and wanted to let the camera just bob on the surface. 
23503 Its very easy to scratch and it give blue tones to long exposure images- can be easily fix in lightroom, still trying to figure out white balance for different filters. 
23504 Have not used it yet but it looks nice 
23505 Doesn t fit the hero 2. Is there another piece I need? 
23506 I was learing about buying one of these on amazon, but it was a nice pleasant surprise! It worked absolutely wonderuland the quality is great, especially for the price! 
23507 Great 
23508 Excellent product and arrived on time. 
23509 Does not plug directly into the wall. Comes with chord (not pictured) 
23510 As promised, the picture keeper was very easy to use. However, the 16000 photo capacity picture keeper only held 6000 pictures, so be smart and buy one that is 3 times what you think you need. 
23511 Horrible. Upon attempting to remove it from my flash trigger, the end of the cord snipped off. ULTRA delicate junk. 
23512 These vibrating motors are great to make robots and vibrate a lot and effectively. The wires are a little short though (1cm) 
23513 Nice. I carry the camera in my purse, great protection. 
23514 exactly what I expected. good quality 
23515 I love it and recommend this product. 
23516 A right disaster. Not only are there no instructions in English, the flash gun stopped working after 2 sessions. It simply stopped coming on. Really disappointing. 
23517 Worst product ever! Its all plastic, its weak, the wind doesn t let it spin, even when there where no wind still doesn t spin. None of my timelapses ended up right. Not recommended 
23518 Works well but somewhat oversized. Fast delivery. 
23519 Doesn t really do high end FD lenses justice. Also could never figure out how to take out the optional element. 
23520 works well..no problems so far 
23521 Greate equipment, we re using it for a mine site and it gets really dirty and have no issues at all. Previous camera was lost and we had no doubt on getting the same as a replacement. 
23522 This bag is very spacious and secure. I travel often for filming projects and so far I m pleased with how this bag protects camera gear and additional items. 
23523 Love this bag, very comfortable to wear. Very durable. 
23524 I ordered this product, totally excited to get the fabulous DSC WX350 plus accessories for this amazing price. When it arrived, it was NOT the DSC WX350 at all! Instead, it was a DSX W830, a substantially less expensive camera with limited capabilities. 
23525 Did not work out sent back still waiting for credit. Should have paid more attention I had to send back to China cost me more in shipping then I was ever willing to pay it is not a good product I would not recommend it does not deserve to stars 
23526 Work well last a long time. 
23527 Worked great, bought 5 more for friends that I showed 
23528 I lost my charger some time ago and couldn t use my palmcorder until now. I was glad to find it. 
23529 Received the wrong size batteries. the description suggested this type for the camera, but they were not the right ones. 
23530 Love the products from cowboys studio 
23531 Good product 
23532 These lens caps and cords work as well as original equipment. Price was right. Arrived quickly. 
23533 Only able to use once went to use it again the red lights pop up on the back showing I have full battery life but the light doesn t come on anymore. Waste of money guess you get what you pay for ! 
23534 These offer a great value and super clear image. I would order these for friends! 
23535 Extremely unreliable when connecting over wifi. After two months it stopped connecting to my network at al, wifi or wired. 
23536 Just the perfect size for my Coolpix S9700!! 
23537 Great item for the price! 
23538 As advertised 
23539 Great scope. Get your scope level and its on the money locating objects. Doesn t view nebula really well at all. Grey spots in space. 
23540 Perfecto 
23541 Very satisfied and excellent multi-platform charger. Charges LifePO4. 
23542 good deal 
23543 Works as advertised; holds battery, looks nice 
23544 This works perfectly on my monopod in conjunction with the DP-50 QR Camera Plate. 
23545 Very well made, just like all their cases. Would recommend. 
23546 Daughter loved the border on the photos. Even at high school age all of her friends thought the product was great. 
23547 Takes great pictures. 
23548 working just wish it came with better instruction 
23549 Very good product 
23550 Great product, solid, and good price, I sold my old plastic clamp stands for thisones and im glad i did. 
23551 Just what we need 
23552 This summer I have coverted hundreds of slides to my computer, where I can edit them, make copies, or post them on Facebook. 
23553 Fits my Hero and all of the accessories 
23554 Working nice 
23555 Nice starter scope. It would be nicer if it came with a sky watching guide. 
23556 I m SO satisfied with this camera. I fell in love with it instantly. It s small and comfortable in my hand, the quality is great and all of the added accessories help as well. 
23557 it s an ok point and shoot getting all the extras were good the optical zoom just was not good enough to suit me. I ended up getting a canon SX50 refurbished from canon website for $179 
23558 Great product 
23559 Well made, very fast lens and a great deal. Very wide angle without much if any distortion in the edges. Really like this lens! 
23560 Great camera for the price! ! 
23561 State of the art Have had it for a month still learning what it can do 
23562 Take the time to acquaint yourself well worth it! 
23563 As described. 
23564 i like 
23565 Mine appeared to be used and had a tear in the flash wrap. Had to return. Nice very soft, even light comes from this thing. I used it sometimes for macro shots. You can pack this in the same slot for you laptop. 
23566 My niece loves it. takes awesome pictures. Color was cute and modern 
23567 Henry was very good could figure out remote view he login to my computer show and voila toke 5 minute very guy 
23568 Meet my Gitzo and Really right stuff head perfect.Some extra pouch for small tool and my Gimbal kit. 
23569 Quality isn t what I would expect for a samsung. The casing is cheap plastic and the actual video quality is on the poorer side. I think my samsung phone (note 4) takes better quality video. I was surprised and disappointed. 
23570 Great investment and I love it so much And here are some pic that I took for my Sony a6000. 
23571 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
23572 Excelent product 
23573 Camera exploded when power was applied. I don t think the specs were correct saying 7-27v input. Looks like one of the resister fried. 
23574 use these to protect my lens 
23575 Good quality! Fits my Fujifilm X100 perfectly! 
23576 piece of trash, not even good enough to use once 
23577 [[VIDEOID:2159cfd3aadee35e75e247a07f4f2ce4]] A quick demonstration of the pros and cons of the Fastfire camera strap. 
23578 Cheap. Toy looking. 
23579 Returned 
23580 WORKS FINE, no complaint so far 
23581 Delivered on time with great packaging. Item was as described and completely met my expectations. I absolutely love this lens! 
23582 Great lens. Does exactly what I wanted. Take pictures of my kiddos outside for sports and fantastic landscape shots when on vacation. 
23583 excellent product, but no information or use recommendations included, would have been nice. Well made. Quick delivery, no issues. Did not need to contact company, used Go Pro, as described. No complaints. instructions. 
23584 Best baby monitor/security cam on the market. I sent the others brands back after seeing how easy to use and powerful the nest was. We ll be buying more for each room in the house. 
23585 Don t waste your money on this one. Parts falling off as I pulled it out of the box. Pieces cracked as I tried to put together. Didn t hold reflector. Total garbage. 
23586 Excellent 
23587 Perfect size, great zipper quality and material and has side bag for equipment. My carbide tripod for telephoto lens fits perfectly. 
23588 This was poorly and cheaply made. Don t waste your time or money. Big disappointment. Better to hide the camera among some books. I returned it at once. EW 
23589 Great product 
23590 Very good! 
23591 Works great. I already have it hooked up to my body board. Got some dope footy. 
23592 Smells like bad rubber for a while. But does the job fine 
23593 Great add-on camera, this is actually replacing one that failed to work upon installing. 
23594 as shown 
23595 Once you get the hang of it, it s easy to use and an overall awesome product. 
23596 Good, inexpensive! 
23597 Excellent buy!! 
23598 Great price 
23599 Excellent product. Excellent company. The BX-2 gives my gear extra protection and I feel confident nothing short of an elephant sitting on any of by BX-2 gear will cause any damage. I am extremely happy and highly recommend this product and the Brenthaven. 
23600 I purchased a a back up battery for my camera. This battery holds a charge, for a long time. 
23601 love it. 
23602 It is ok to make home pictures 
23603 Almost cant look at the moon without it. Works great! 
23604 Best full frame ever!! Nikon has done it again!! 
23605 good 
23606 Fit my SJ4000 good a snug. On mine though one of the legs for the clamping area was bent badly and barely works. But it does work. 
23607 I don t see any play, a good product for the price 
23608 bad product 
23609 Very nice kit! Planning on using it on vacation out west. I love Canon products and so far so good. 
23610 Still working in my Olypus. 
23611 Fantastic FPV camera. So much better than using a Mobius for FPV. 
23612 Not an east fit! 
23613 does exactly what it needs to do... i little scary to try it, but it really works 
23614 Thank you 
23615 difficulty using. My fingers are too big!! 
23616 ok 
23617 weird little robotic guy I guess it works great for scaring people 
23618 Great product 
23619 Good quality pictures, compact design, and easy to use. 
23620 The best action cam. None compare. 
23621 I bought h t these for a trip. They are an excellent buy and I have confidence in this brand. 
23622 I have received it well. 
23623 It works just as I expected for the price I paid. I love that I can take photos that don t look as selfies... 
23624 My son likes it a lot. 
23625 Just what I needed for my new SX60 and a spare battery 
23626 This worked really well - comfy and easy to locate! 
23627 It works but did not come with a memory card 
23628 Great value, wish that camera was more wide angle. 
23629 letters of &#34;celestron&#34; logo are cheap stickers, and got lost rapidly 
23630 More difficult to collapse in comparison to other brands. 
23631 Very cheap casing but it will do the job. 
23632 So cute i love it , and some people say it has a nasty smell but really imine doesnt smell funky 
23633 So happy my birthday is saturday now i have a baggie to wear with my outfit to carry my camera 
23634 Best money I have spent. Love this product 
23635 Very nice lens, tack-sharp 
23636 Great product 
23637 Sweet produce. Better than expected build quality and fit. 
23638 Works well easy quick app install and remote view. Haven t done the port forwarding yet. Although major issue with speaker and mic very close on camera you get a lot of echo and feedback 
23639 Put in a new micro card, can t get product to work at this time. Been trouble shooting for a week now and I ve tried everything (yes, including the reset button.) Don t see any way to reach out to the company for customer service. Wishful thinking I know. 
23640 The title says this item has two hot shoes. Not so! A &#34;hot&#34; shoe is electrically connected to the camera, which controls the flash triggering. This item merely holds the flash in a bracket. It s up to you to connect it to the camera somehow. 
23641 I highly recommend Celestron lenses in general and this kit is tops and worth it when purchased with the scope. 
23642 This is one of my favorite purchases I ve made in a while. The quality is great and fits my 30 pound dog perfectly. Get ready for some of the most hilarious GoPro video you will ever shoot. 
23643 Bought it for my Mom. It s her first digital camera, and she was a reluctant convert from film. She loves it. 
23644 This is a terrible case. Do not buy this product! I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it. My camera was ruined in only 35 feet of water. 
23645 wrong lens 
23646 Great product! 
23647 Super fast delivery. Great value. Very good product. 
23648 If the pockets were a bit deeper and a bit tighter to prevent the memory SD and Micro SD cards from coming loose in the case I would have given it a five star rating. 
23649 Good quality and great price. 
23650 As described. Good value. 
23651 The best camera I have bought so far. In great condition and delivery was fast. Thanks. 
23652 decent case 
23653 It does what it s supposed to do. It works great 
23654 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Very high quality. 
23655 The device works the same as the 4 port system, With a few additional settings and options. Had it setup and running in less than 10 minutes. 
23656 Works as advertised. Will allow having filters mounted. 
23657 Bought as a gift for my son. He loves it -- fit perfectly. 
23658 love it! 
23659 will not hold a charge. do not buy 
23660 Unbelievable photo backpack. Took it to Europe for two weeks and it was so easy to carry my Canon 70D with 18-135 and 24-70 lenses. Lightweight and sturdy. Best camera bag for traveling. 
23661 I would not recommend it I do not like it 
23662 Excellent camera rolling backpack, it is everything I expected, liads of room for camera bodies and various lenses. 
23663 I got this camera and it got stuck trying to turn on, I got a replacement and it also won t even power up. 
23664 Does exactly what it s supposed to do at half the price of Manfrotto s version. 
23665 Perfect, exactly as described. 
23666 I got this tripod and it fell apart but the customer service reps were responsive to my needs and sent me one that is very study and awesome. Thanks guys! 
23667 Great point and shoot with some more customizable options. Large to fit in a pocket 
23668 Two excellent working batteries for a Very reasonable price. \m/ 
23669 I have a Sony HX9V. It says it´s good for the camera, but I´m afraid it will break my lens. When turned on, it fits to tight, and the case pushes the lens to it´s sides. 
23670 they worked well 
23671 Very good product,best you can get for an instant camera! 
23672 It s my personal &#34;photography assistant&#34; that holds the reflectors, and the flowers, too. 
23673 All metal, well made. It does not think down too small though. 
23674 Easy to install. Does what it should. Delivered new, in perfect condition and on time. Priced right. 
23675 This is incredibly flimsy, with weak clips that hold the hood on the lens. I honestly can t figure out why people are writing positive reviews for this item. 
23676 great camera 
23677 Well made and as compact as can be for a mirror less camera. Fits my NX500 with kit lens and flash as well as two batteries in the pocket. Much nicer than carrying a bag everywhere and worrying about putting the bag down 
23678 I returned this product. It did not fit my Sony NEX-5T as advertised. 
23679 Haven t used it yet but came as advertised and fits fine. 
23680 Fits my Canon S120 perfectly. Zips up both side making quick and easy to remove. Sturdy build. 
23681 Product as described, and function at least as well as Sony batteries. I haven t measured the capacity claims, but they do seem plausible. 
23682 This is the coolest camera. Takes pictures with easy and a clear shot. New to it but it has a lot of features I have to try yet.\JIM 
23683 Great camera 
23684 great item. I have not been disappointed by any of the Vortex optics and here again they did great. It is a bit heavy, but compared to binos this are way lighter unless money is no object. 
23685 Great item for a great price! and awesome service from eco-Fused to boot! Will definitely buy again! 
23686 good 
23687 Works great no complaints. 
23688 Best bang for the buck speedlight. Sync @ 1/8000! Rivals if not surpasses other pro models priced more than double of this. Plus it is a master flash to control other speedlights. 
23689 awtnu47533tutrerytutreyu nyteyrste5y 
23690 Worth the $$ as an alternate to Macro lens.. 
23691 Doze not respond well on the PTZ controls. Long delay. Keeps show up ofg line in my dlink. I try two different units and both have the same problems 
23692 Let s you control multiple GoPro cameras remotely. Great for controlling that camera on your head, selfie stick, tripod or other equipment. 
23693 I really like it 
23694 It is better than nothing. 
23695 Does the job. 
23696 Thank you Very much 
23697 Great camera, I have purchased 3 of these already to record our Church services. They are great in low light and have a quality image. 
23698 The DVR needs to be reset after a week of two. Eventually replaced the dvr 
23699 Nice, cheap, and works well. 
23700 great camera, has very nice video quality, very compact. easy to do vlogs and whatever else. 
23701 Short version: There are some definite quality control issues with this product, but on the whole it does what it says on the tin at an unbeatable price. Definitely a buy if you have Prime and so can return your first one if that particular unit is of poor quality. 
23702 This camera is really an awesome camera for the money. Yes it is mirror less but still works very very well. I am extremely satisfied with it. 
23703 its pretty good but smaller than expected I thought i was getting a larger bag than I already have to hold all my stuff , this bag barely fits nikon d7000 
23704 The pen will not take a charge and cannot be recognized by the computer. When i press the record button, it stops in 5 to 7 seconds. 
23705 Excellent productos, very responsable the seller upon delivery recommend 
23706 These work great and last longer then the one that came with the Camera. 
23707 My second GoPro remote and it s better than my first one (GoPro 3). This one works well with my GoPro Silver and also works well within the App. Comes with a wrist strap unlike my first remote! 
23708 Amazing lens good deal 
23709 I had this battery overnighted to me to record my sons 9th birthday. It wouldn t take a charge. Very disappointing and very bad business. Get your S#%T together or close the doors!! 
23710 Just one word.......awesome! 
23711 Good stand. 
23712 Good fit:) 
23713 I really like my Canon battery grip. It does a great job. 
23714 We purchased this as a gift and it was perfect! My husband loaded a memory card to make it easy for the recipient. It is a smaller frame which makes it easy to transfer to any room you like. Affordable and it was well received by the recipient. 
23715 don t work camera. Please if you change this one. 
23716 Very nice item, Exactly what I expected to receive. 
23717 Works perfect with my 1D Mark IV, charges quick, hols a charge and is recognized by my camera. This is a perfect replacement for the OEM battery. I just purchased a spare battery for a fraction of the cost of a Canon battery.. 
23718 I used this on my new sony a7rm2, a great way to protect LCD from scratches. 
23719 Its a snug fit which is reassuring however the access panel is not accessible unless it is take off prior to placing the camera in the mount but as I m typing this I m realizing its an intentional design and I ll change this to 5 stars. 
23720 Getting amazing full zoom shots! The mega OIS got me hand held shots at full zoom that I would have needed a trip-pod for previously. Appreciated the lens accessories that came with it. Taking it with me to Yellowstone & Grand Teton NP s next week! 
23721 My first purchase on amazon and very very happy with it. I am an amateur photographer. The photos attached were taken with the 36mm extension tube on my sony a58... 
23722 good 
23723 I love this lens! Great quality/value. 
23724 Great camera. Excellent condition. Everything arrived as expected. 
23725 Great camera. Can t beat for waterproof shooting. 
23726 Not a bad deal for a starter. 
23727 Purchased this camera for my husband. He loves it. 
23728 Works great, easy to install, had a previous D-Link which was very erratic and difficult to install. I returned the D-Link. 
23729 TERRIBLE. Two of these snapped and flew apart within two hours of clamping a backdrop to a stand. Almost injured crew. Do not buy. Potentially dangerous. 
23730 We like our first NIX digital frame so well that we purchased a second. This model has a 15&#34; screen versus our previous 12&#34;, making it easier to see photo details from across the room. Easy to setup, great image clarity, Very pleased with the frame. 
23731 Strap BROKE with my Panasonic Lumix FZ1000 on it,after only a few weeks.I’d give it a negative 10 star rating if possible. 
23732 Great!! 
23733 I have two CAMERAS not working i need to send back. I have 6 cameae install and they are work find 
23734 Not excellent 
23735 it broke within 3 weeks.... 
23736 great 
23737 Fits in a bag, easy to store or carry, perfect for large cameras with zoom lenses or flash attachments. Works on anything flat, take Maine every where, fits in the bottom of my camera bag 
23738 Bought it for my husband, he loves it!!! 
23739 This camera is a point and shoot that tries really hard to be more than that. Too many options. In addition, the battery life is super short. I would not recommend this camera. Buy a SLR digital or a cheaper point and shoot. Not worth the extra $$. 
23740 not as good as i expected should have got the 70-300mm 
23741 Decent stick not too stiff at full extention but good for the price. You wont be jumping off cliffs with this guy but i m sure i will have uses for it 
23742 This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it. 
23743 easy to install and great picture. 
23744 Worked good but needed some info on controls and no Customer support available! 
23745 So much brighter pictures inoors 
23746 It has a good handle and the tip is sturdy but gentle enough 
23747 Fast delivery. Use it once and works. 
23748 I needed these canisters for an experiment in my class, and a lot of the lids didn t snap on tightly. 
23749 Works great! This was originally a gag gift for my husband s birthday, but he really likes it. 
23750 Works just like advertised. Cannot expect more. 
23751 came with bundle don t use head strap 
23752 amazing, arrived within a couple of day,s 
23753 great product 
23754 Wow! This light is very bright and exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to get a very specific light style for products and people shots and this light was perfect. 
23755 good value,too bad the camera is broken, but it did charge the battery... 
23756 I received mine in the time that said it would arrive. Very happy with my new drone. Great power. 
23757 Product was broken, the phone holder to be exact. Managed to glue it my self. I guess you get what you pay for. 
23758 Fast and reliable. Overnight shipping a success! 
23759 Great! 
23760 This pan, in my opinion, was very poorly constructed - it broke on me after two hours of use. On the bright side, my ability to understand Chinese translated to English is getting much better. :-) 
23761 This is really really good and I recommend it. However, I am 66 inches tall, and this is only 50 inches tall. 
23762 Love it 
23763 Easy to set up and it works perfectly 
23764 Work great. 
23765 Cheap and totally does the job 
23766 Fairly easy to install. Seems like a fair price for this good product 
23767 Everything works fine. Battery capacity is about the same as the original Olympus battery. 
23768 It was an excellent item delivered on time and intact. Thank you. 
23769 A little too small. 
23770 This is a real 808 #16 v3. Arrived in 7 days of purchase. Everything worked as advertised. 
23771 Great budget flash with plenty of features and solid construction for the price. 
23772 I ordered. They sent promptly. Product good. I am happy. 
23773 Such an awesome camera love it 
23774 No instructions included 
23775 It was exactly what I was looking for in this price range. 
23776 I love it,, the price was very reasonable 
23777 the camera works as expected,, picture is clear and I do not have any complaint 
23778 This is a super easy to use digital frame. I love the video option. I previously had a Kodak pulse frame and loved it, but this one is equally as good and a much larger size! 
23779 Had no idea GoPros were even bordering on affordable. Between the camera itself, the items that come in the starter pack, and even GoPro s own FREE software you get to edit videos... this thing is simply amazing!! 
23780 Love the features of this camera. However, the battery life leaves much to be desired. 
23781 My daughter had enjoyed it so much. She was completely satisfied and extatic with the case. 
23782 camera takes great photo s, not overly heavy. camera has worked really well for taking photo s as just an enthusiast. 
23783 I use these batteries in a Nikon 1 V3. The battery life is degrading significantly with each use. If you have a Nikon battery, these are good back-up batteries. I would not use one of these batteries as your main camera battery. 
23784 Great batteries, exceeded my expectations... 
23785 great invention 
23786 Just as described..works well with a steady hand. Does not feel cheaply made. 
23787 good basic point and shoot camera. in some lightings, the pictures get an odd orange glow. if the light does not work well, i just switch to black and white and that fixes the problem. zoom works well. over all, i am very happy with this camera 
23788 Five out of five stars 
23789 It s ok for it s price easy to use 
23790 Sony recommended website product for a6000. Fits and protects hot shoe. 
23791 I use this mini tripod all the time. It holds my webcam and my cameras. This is the perfect size for small spaces. 
23792 Package met all expectations. Wifi works great. Good quality pictures. 
23793 make static noise but good images. 
23794 good replacement for a broken one I had 
23795 We are very happy with the product and the excellent service. 
23796 Works fine on my Sigma 150-600 S lens. Fits in my two RRS ball heads and clamps. Price is right, no flexing. 
23797 Works like a charm! 
23798 Very useful when you need a backup battery. I highly recommend! 
23799 More shots with the Nikon that with the less-expensive after-market batteries. 
23800 good product 
23801 Have used it with sunrise and sunset to enhance the color, works fine. 
23802 Best camera I ever had. Pictures and movies are crystal clear. Great battery life. Used it on charger to record memorable motorcycle rides in all kinds of weather. Sound is great too. 
23803 Loved this product! Was perfect for making personal postcards and was super durable and easy! 
23804 Temperature sensors on the unit don t seem to be working right. 
23805 ok 
23806 Good 
23807 the chroma key green screen is a great item. Its working for me and I am having fun with it. Thank you for the great item. 
23808 Takes awesome photos 
23809 Very easy to install and fits PERFECTLY. 
23810 A lot of things I will not use but the price is great. The case does not fit everthing so well but it works. 
23811 Great camera for the price. Easy to use and produces quality pictures. 
23812 Nice camera, good price but the accessories are very modest 
23813 Good for sealife...all tipe 
23814 Bought three of these, two worked and connected well, one was a bit tricky and I had to move it closer to the controller to get it to work. A bit pricey for what it is, I am now building my own with mysensors. 
23815 Works great, but wish it fit my head. A tad to big big. Would it be to late to send back for my size with measurements? 
23816 Work great to clean sunglasses camera ect. Awesome product 
23817 Fast shipping and charger works great! Thanks 
23818 This camera is cheap , its ok to use 9 years old 
23819 Nice camera system 
23820 ALL WENT WELL 
23821 This rig is just what I was hoping for ... compact ... easy to use and store ... puts me right on the hitch ball with ease. 
23822 It s great for webcams or cameras! 
23823 Worked fine, the price was good, but too long to get here. As a back up its what I needed would buy again. 
23824 Just what my GoPro needed! Strong!!! 
23825 Awesome product 
23826 Overall The Best Video Camera I Have Used. Amazing 1080p Video Quality 
23827 worked. serves its purpose 
23828 Really wish this had more area for my extras. I will need a bigger bag, but this does secure my camera well. 
23829 One of the plastic clips broke the first time I opened it. 
23830 I love it! Lightweight, sturdy, and so easy to set up and change placements. Would recommend! -Canon Rebel T5i user 
23831 It was a present for my teen son, he really like it. 
23832 Awesome camera Such an improvement over my old t2i. I never realized how much better my pictures could get. Works great in lower light even without a flash. Accessories are a nice add on 
23833 Great case!!.... My Canon fit into it nicely....... 
23834 I like it very much. It is pretty discrete too. However if you use the two camera feature the video quality drops. 
23835 Almost impossible to get on....you have to remove the hood, put it on and then reattach the hood. 
23836 Full featured controller for your Canon. 
23837 Great Thank you 
23838 Used this mount to record videos for my soon-to-be Youtube Channel. 
23839 Terrific for a DIY security system. 
23840 I should have done a little more research before buying. I found picture hangers that are almost exactly the same for only $2. Otherwise it does okay. 
23841 I m really enjoying this scope so far. Very easy to assemble. Saturn and the moon look amazing. If you re new to amateur astronomy and you don t want to spend a lot initially but you want nice optics, you should get this scope! 
23842 9/3 update: Used for a week on photo sessions on Appledore Island, ME. The strap was GREAT! Easy to carry camera with this attached (Nikon D5300 with Tamron 18-300). Looking for neck relief on upcoming trip to Italy. 
23843 I love this compact camera 
23844 Definitely wasn t new like it stated so I returned it and went to my local Best Buy to get a NEW one. Love the camera. 
23845 Perfect! 
23846 Looks great on my strobes, Works great, Priced great~ 
23847 Very nice flash. Works very well on my d3300 Very quick on the recharge between shots 
23848 Resolution so poor that it was virtually useless. Horrid video and photo quality. Get the 12mp and save yourself a headache. 
23849 Very pleased with this purchase 
23850 Arrived on time, so far the functionality of the product works good as described in the mfg spec 
23851 Outstanding!!!! They are super clear and bright. Unless you like to throw money out the window, there is NO need to buy the German brands at double the price. These are VERY VERY GOOD. 
23852 works well for the picture but finding a way to feed it not so easy finnally taped it to an electrical tape so i could run it in the pipe 
23853 Great case. Fits the Nikon Coolpix S9900 camera well. However, it doesn t leave a lot of space for an additional battery and cables. 
23854 It was used -- scratches on display and buttons. Clearly previously owned. 
23855 ok 
23856 Cable came quickly and works great! 
23857 Everything you need and more. 
23858 Trash !!! Terrible !!! Bad image !!! 
23859 Great camera. 
23860 This kit is a good all purpose kit and will fit most needs when used with a camera that has the standard screw posts such as the contour. Everything worked as advertised and meets the required needs. I would recommend this. 
23861 As Expected 
23862 I thought this would be good to hold my thumb drive but the strap is too stiff. 
23863 This kit contains all that you ll need. 
23864 it s a great little camera. A bit difficult to get the exact settings you want. 
23865 Great piece. Fit my non-Nikon MBD-10-Like battery grip as well. Great with the ENEL-4A with the D700 for faster frame rate. 
23866 awesome! 
23867 Awesome I like how it locks so it won t just keep turning. 
23868 Manufacture has delivered as promise on both product and specification. One camera crack; but, was immediately resolved by manufacture. Great service!! Replied all inquires and questions. Keep up the good work!!! 
23869 I didn t receive exactly as what shown and described, The dual battery charger replaced with a single battery charger. The wall charger which has 2 usb slots is not included. The usb cable not included. More description about what I received can be shown in the attached photo. 
23870 Product received as expected 
23871 I was so excited to find this product! I have a Sony NEX-C3 and needed some better lighting for my pictures. I ordered this and the Chromo 216 LED CI-216 light and they paired perfectly together. 
23872 too complicated. software glitchy or not working. useless piece of crap. 
23873 Fit great 
23874 Works great! 
23875 Excellent light meter. I use it mostly for landscape and wildlife photography and it dies everything I expected, and more. 
23876 Quite easy to use and was a present.... 
23877 Sturdy and nice 
23878 Do not work 
23879 Here is a shot from the camera on my last trip! 
23880 its not what i was looking for but it will have to do. :( 
23881 very bright LED light, works great when natural light is less then desirable. 
23882 work like my oem canon ones in my 5dmkiii. no issues 
23883 very poor quality, the picture is not clean, wasted my money !!!!!!!!!!!! 
23884 This is a good starter pack of all different accessories for the GoPro. All good condition 
23885 As noted in previous reviews, this setup is great for the money. There isn t much for instructions, but enough to puzzle it out, The stands are a bit shaky, so be careful. 
23886 Great item, delivered on time. 
23887 This makes using the camera outside in bright sun soooo much easier. I can actually see the viewfinder screen. It fits on the screen just fine and stays on. I folds up to fit in my bag nicely. Recommended for anyone who shoots outside a lot. 
23888 This works great on my monopod and was so inexpensive. 
23889 Very accurate delivery time 👍🏼 Thank you! 
23890 Great fit. Customise interior to suit. Holds 5 batteries, spare props, ipad, prop guards. Feel confident my P3P could arrive safely in spite of the best efforts of airline baggage handlers. Will put it to the test this winter. Similar quality to Pelican. 
23891 I love it! Material and appearance was just as expected, and I like that I can double it as a purse :) 
23892 perfect 
23893 Fits well you need to cut to fit 
23894 Works as stated. 
23895 Screen was a perfect replacement. A little assistance from a YouTube video and fixed my camera in 15 minutes and at a fraction of the cost of taking it to a repair centre. 
23896 Only fair. 
23897 expectations were met for this order. 
23898 Great product! 
23899 Not hi tech 
23900 Great camera; easy to use. 
23901 Appears to be good quality, easy to apply. I m not very good at applying stickers however it still looks great 
23902 Amazing.. I loved it!!! 
23903 nice 
23904 This is a terrific cord. I especially appreciate te short length of it which helps with the camera to flash on a bracket problem without havig so much extra cord that it gets in the way. All functions on the flash work perfectly. 
23905 Nice camera and good pictures/video. Needs more accessories. Camera does not fit into clip 1 so the only way to hold the camera is with the waterproof case. That makes it inconvenient for using it as a dash cam or such. 
23906 Great price for what I was looking for. Fast shipping. 
23907 Just the right size for my camera and travel gear. Very well made and sturdy enough for expeditions and such. Case Logic is a company whose quality has always been top notch in my opinion and this camera case is no exception. 
23908 Not quite as pictuerd, There is no drain on the one I got and there is a folding center handle and also the lable that was on the lid was very dificult to remove and left glue residue 
23909 Steppers functioned properly and included specifications were helpful. Included PC board makes mating with Arduino quite easy. 
23910 Excellent batteries 
23911 This camera is so easy to use. I purchased it mostly to take pictures of my children, but I have since expanded. Ive had a canon t4 rebel, and this is definitely better and more convenient. 
23912 charges my camera up right 
23913 great 
23914 Mine leaked as well. Still floated, but worried about future use. Free diving in 15-30 deep water. Great tool and easy to point and shoot, but again worried about the seal and it filling with water and sinking :( 
23915 Not disappointed 
23916 great case for a camera and your essentials. great quality. Just a tad on the small side. Still not sure if I m going to keep or return it. 
23917 Does the job. 
23918 This was a gift to go with the phantom great combo... 
23919 I am happy with the drone. it works great 
23920 cheap / should have brought the real thing 
23921 No good 
23922 These are great lens cloths, you can t beat them for the price. I keep them all over the place to make sure I never find myself without one. Plus, they rep the best Nikon users forum on the internet, how could you possibly go wrong? 
23923 Fits in place very easily, blocks out most of the unwanted light and made of soft rubber so very comfortable. 
23924 Worked as expected. I passed this one on to my Grandson. 
23925 Works just as expected, charges my camera batteries quickly. Great deal for so many accessories, and now I won t get caught with a dead battery all the time. 
23926 Nice system for the cost. 
23927 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23928 Good battery, good fit for canon camera and battery life is on par with factory OEM battery. 
23929 good product 
23930 Great product, Thanks. 
23931 this camra does a great job. I love it 
23932 Camera stream is awesome! The only issue so far is getting the video to record on motion. 
23933 Fit good 
23934 Not much to say.. Does its job, seems to have a comparable life span to the Nikon counter part. :) 
23935 Perfect 
23936 Works fine. Took off a point for lack of clear instructions. I had to find video instructions from Orion on YouTube. I was able to figure it out from that. Well made. 
23937 I film a lot of events, and this lens helps me get those emotional close up / shallow focus shots without having to move my gear all over the place. 
23938 Received all ordered items promptly; everything works well. 
23939 Shipped quickly. Seem to be just a tad wider that the originals. Still work though. 
23940 Works perfectly. Haven t had any issues with this adapter 
23941 Not as expected, but great to learn on. 
23942 Works well, good suction to smooth surfaces as long as they re clean. 
23943 No web interface for configuration or viewing. Realize solely on mobile Android or iOS app. Camera goes offline several times a day and you must power cycle the camera to bring it back online. When the camera does operate, it works well with good image quality and speedy PTZ. 
23944 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
23945 The battery was exactly what I needed 
23946 This item was returned as it did not support continuous streaming. I also found their customer support to be subpar. I returned it and paid the extra money for a nest camera. 
23947 Excellent 
23948 battery consumer and sucks the flash doesnt turn on at all times 
23949 Good Back Up Camera or for indoor. 
23950 Perfect. 
23951 Works great #GFGENT 
23952 Very clear in quiet areas. However when there is a fan near by or loud ac, it causes interfence and you will hear static throughout the entire recording, or sometimes not even record sound. 
23953 great purchase 
23954 this is my fourth manfrotto bag they are just grate lots of customizable things and great weight balance when you have your laptop + camera overall a great product 
23955 Works great! 
23956 Perfect replacement for original D750 Eyecup. 
23957 Perfect if you want to pack in your suitcase. 
23958 I love this camera. I wanted one that takes batteries and this is the one. I m still learning all the possibilities with this camera. It s very nice. 
23959 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23960 Works great! 
23961 looking forward to using in belize. 
23962 Inability to set shutter speed below 1 second makes it less useful for my application. 
23963 Love it Way to go with go pro 
23964 It s not very stable but thankfully it worked for what I needed to do. 
23965 Great mount got to 100 mile per hour on my motorcycle it the camera didn t flinch a bit Is great to take great shot and can be used on almost any helmet. Go pro outdid themselves 
23966 All sorts of FUN crafty items to dress up the photographs. Bright colors and designs. My granddaughter just loves this. I gave this pack of accessories as a birthday present along with the Mini 8 instant camera. (Everything old is new again! Remember the old Polaroids?) 
23967 Does what it said it would. 
23968 I love this hand grip, it was so much easier to carry my camera around with this grip. I am not a big fan of having my camera dangle around my neck. 
23969 Works great! Love the attachments...it is a lot easier than the 3..not as dramatic for the counter balancing 
23970 Awesome camera and great customer service from Calvin 
23971 I used the RFN-4s kit for the first time last week and it worked flawlessly on every shot. Set up and installation was easy, I am very satisfied 
23972 ok 
23973 NIce quality 
23974 Work great d5300 in vello battery grip. No errors. 
23975 Tricky to power on. Hold the power button for more than 4 sec. 
23976 When I got his camera it looked like the package had been opened and when I turned on the camera it had 3 photo saved to the camera of a person and his house. It sketched me out so I am taking it back and getting a new one. 
23977 The first time I used it, one of the prongs stayed in the wall socket when I unplugged it. 
23978 What I like 1) distributes weight well 2) camera always at the ready 3) camera is in a comfortable position for walking 4) strap attaches to the cameras strap lug securely and does not obstruct use of my tripod - great strap 
23979 Camera is great good working condition, actually its like brand new 
23980 Excellent. 
23981 Exceeded our expectations. Work great and I got these 4 for the same price of just ONE at Best buy. More like &#34;Worst buy&#34; if you ask me. Thanks CamKix! 
23982 Resolution is good if the camera does not move - takes a while to fill in detail. Wifi is very difficult to set up. I use DHCP reservation but the IP does not renew properly without multiple power cycles. 
23983 I like them alot 
23984 perfect replacement for the original 
23985 Fits great, functions as advertised. I love it and I m happy that I saved so much money. 
23986 If there is a product deserving on 0 stars then this is it! It does not even do basic magnification let alone night vision! The material looks deceptively metallic when in fact its only a very cheap plastic. 
23987 I was so impressed at the quality of these batteries. They are as good if not better than my Canon and Wasabi Power batteries. Well worth the price! 
23988 excellent 
23989 Cheaper and quicker than ordering from china 
23990 compact sized yet versatile. i can use it on my portable cameras and accessorizing with some attachments, also with cell phones. 
23991 It was larger then I was looking for .....had to return....but looked like a great camera. 
23992 This NVR is perfect, comes with 4 x 100ft Ethernet cables and the cameras are very nice. Hate the software interface, hence 4 stars. The software for viewing and replaying recording could be more user friendly. 
23993 best idea ever... 
23994 Battery is slightly smaller than my original, causing it to fit uneasily into the battery charger provided with the Camera, but it did charge OK and does fit into the phone without difficulty and seems to work OK. 
23995 The battery fits, and worked right away. 
23996 the only down side to the kit was the selfie stick...it spins upside down under the go pro s weight, otherwise excellent. 
23997 Met requirements 
23998 I was amazed by all the extras I got with the camera. The pictures are outstanding. 
23999 Dresses up the GoPro 3. Need a wrench to tighten thumb screws. Can t get a grip on them with fingers to tighten the GoPro so it won t move. 
24000 Camera is great for the first time DSLR user! In my case that happens to be a 13 year old - and she is now taking incredible photos and having fun. 
24001 At the price point this works great for off-camera flash power! I m a wedding photographer and can use it almost all day with rechargeable batteries before I need to swap in new batteries. 
24002 It is a little slow with regards to synchronizing with the phone/app. 
24003 Very easy to use....not great quality picture 
24004 Nice looking leather case. Good colour. Seems sturdy enough. 
24005 Love this camera.. Easy to set up and easy to use.. It notifies me right on my iphone and I just click on the app and I see everything. I love the fact that I can look back and see stuff.. 
24006 Its geniune Pelican Case. Very duriable. Been every where with it since I bought it and it is still good as new.... inside. 
24007 i love it...as expected 
24008 Pretty sturdy for the price, nice direct lighting, although to need all four up to get a well lit scene, and it s almost impossible to iron the wrinkles out of the supplied back drops. 
24009 Seem to work just as well as the one that came with my camera 
24010 Got these in perfect condition. Great for off camera flash and works just as good as Pocketwizard but a fraction of the price. You can use them for fill flash outside or to help compensate low light at wedding receptions. added bonus- was here 2 days after I ordered them! 
24011 My granddaughter enjoyed using the stickers on her photos. 
24012 Cheap and plentiful microfiber cloths. I wear glasses, so I like to have access to these things in various locations throughout my apartment. They re also good for cleaning laptops, computer screens, and phones. They re useful and effective. 
24013 Super Sweet! 
24014 It s simply fit and well. I don t know how good the one made by Fuji, but this one just works no problem at all. And the price is something that you don t even need to have a second thought. 
24015 Looks very good! Fits my canon g7x just fine. No space for anything else! 
24016 The product, packaging and supplies are all wonderful. The camera is easy to use and light weight, highly recommended. 
24017 Definitely too expensive but it s never let me down 
24018 amazing camera! 
24019 Leo was very knowledgeable and able to set it up very quickly for me via remote setup! 
24020 Excellent value for backup power. 
24021 Doesn t fit - and was returned 
24022 Works just like expensive version 
24023 Haven t used it yet, but sure it will do the trick 
24024 Fabulous for the price. The moslins are a little thin, but what do you expect for the price. Also, ironing them was a bit of a pain, but that s the nature of the beast. 
24025 Love the it😀 
24026 Good Film that s all. 
24027 Had to make a few alterations for horseback riding but overall not a bad little system. Only bad point is that I had to get a locking washer for the screw for the camera, it would back out very easily before hand 
24028 Good fit on 70 to 200 f 2.8 zoom lens 
24029 Very convenient and light to carry around 
24030 awesome and very compact 
24031 just the best 
24032 Great Backpack! Plenty of room for everything. Deep pockets and tons of padding to protect your valuable equipment. Protects my laptop as well in a separate compartment. 
24033 excellent extremely good; outstanding. 
24034 A bit heavy but sturdy. 
24035 I don t like the legs because the bottoms always falls off. However, when I tried to return, it charges almost $7, so I guess I will keep it. :( 
24036 My favorite camera. This is the third one I m buying in a row. 
24037 Fab 
24038 Great photos, waterproof. Tough casing. Get it. 
24039 Light and comfortable against the eye. Fit s well but doesn t &#34;click&#34; on and can come off easily. 
24040 Nice set, affordable price! 
24041 Good 
24042 thank u 
24043 All Good A++ 
24044 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
24045 I bought these as replacement batteries. The work perfect and now I don t have to worry if my battery goes dead when I am taking pictures because I have a backup. 
24046 Very cool little frame, it doesn t have the quality of a computer monitor but it is pretty good. 
24047 Camera was in great shape.instructions were easy to read. 
24048 Fits everything for my camera. The parts do not fit perfectly, but they are all in there and safe. 
24049 I am very happy with this camera. Looks like new. Came with a carry bag and two 16 GB memory cards. Those memory cards are good for pictures but too slow for video with XAVC S format. 
24050 Can t use my camera without this... 
24051 Great bundle, all components work well and very much with the money! In the down side the backpack was not as big as it looks in the picture and the. Inserts are very thin, it took some maneuvering to get my cameras to fit. Still a great kit 
24052 I was having a problem getting my new F19828P camera to work on my laptop, even though it worked on my desktop. I called Foscam and spoke to Calvin and he made some adjustments to the laptop and now everything is operating fine. Foscam tech support is great. 
24053 Battery grip Arrived as promised, best 3rd party battery grip out there. I would recommend this company and grip as excellent. 
24054 on time and well packaged .Still playing with it but so far works great .I may get an extra battery for convience 
24055 Suprising picture quality 
24056 Didnt even last a week the product was so poorly made out of cheap plastic 
24057 I love my new camera 
24058 It did exactly what I wanted it to do. Did not need recharging very frequently. 
24059 A real good add on camera with night vision. Great price too. 
24060 this is a great camera for the average photographer. my wife takes thousands of pictures a year of our grand kids and she then puts them in a shutterfly book. great camera. 
24061 Its ok and could hold all my accessories, but after two few months, the stitching at the zippers came apart. I guess this camera bag insert should not be used without its backpack - [[ASIN:B00J3YFW16 Jill-E Digital 15&#34; Jack Laptop Backpack Case (Brown) with Camera Insert Bag + Cleaning Kit]]. 
24062 didn t work 
24063 They were good and I ll make it so you can reach out and get your camera 
24064 Great product-delivery and service. Very happy with the charger and it arrived hours earlier than expected. Thank you. 
24065 nice 
24066 Good 
24067 perfect!!!!!! 
24068 I love the design and compactness 
24069 great 
24070 It s all ok! 
24071 I used it once and it appears to have charged the batteries that I ordered along with the product. 
24072 love it - 2nd one 
24073 Nice device and yes, it does have an internal single AA battery that can be changed. 
24074 Works as advertised.. 
24075 Handy 
24076 Very satisfied 
24077 I got it 
24078 Excelente 
24079 good 
24080 Battery is working good, but du not have capacity of original ones. 
24081 they work but some of them were already dried out 
24082 The software doesen t recognise the camera and after an hour of capturing videos a transistor exploded and the camera stopped working. 80$ burned out. 
24083 had to return it it didn t have a way to secure the battery for charging 
24084 Love the camera, takes great pictures, and easy to download to print up pictures too. Thank you, 
24085 Is a great camera and does the job very nice. Would absolutely recommend it. 
24086 It really works well, a lot of stuff to figure out but who needs to know everything. 
24087 Perfect fit! 
24088 Camera still doesn t work 
24089 This &#34;small&#34; harness is almost too large for my 60 lb pit bull. Fits my barrel chested boxer pretty well though. 
24090 Works Perfect ! 
24091 Love it !!! Works great !!! 
24092 I m very happy with this item I will buy more 
24093 Very good product at low cost. 
24094 ok 
24095 The Huge grip and feel of this Grip makes me partial to Kupo C-Stands. 
24096 Excellent 
24097 Pelican - what more can one say. Used for a GoPro. Still fitting in accessories. Allows custom fit cut outs. The foam is notched so you have some cutting guide lines. Use a long slender knife to cut the foam along the perforations. 
24098 This product is terrible. It says the product is new strait out of the box but it must have came broken. wouldn t turn on even with a full charge. really upsetting and a waste of money. confusing to use and cheaply made. 
24099 Great camera love it! 
24100 Awesome! 
24101 Well my review is it just don t work well, no instructions, no video, very little sound. For the price it is headed to the trash can. Sorry 
24102 Great price, battery works......I m very pleased with this company s services and I highly recommend 
24103 Thanks, Annemarie C. 
24104 They work great....until they stop working. Slow recycling time on 1/128 power and when fired by the 560 TX is fires full power then shuts down. 
24105 It is very orange. I love it. 
24106 These strobes work great. I am happy with purchase. 
24107 good 
24108 Battery would not charge from the get-go, I have been unable to access the warranty policy, or a phone number for help..... 
24109 This pouch set is well made, protective and stylish. Small size is adequate for pancake lenses and, medium size is good enough for Canon 18-55 STM kit lens. I m still not using the large one but it s nice to have it already for a future lens. 
24110 Works perfectly, shipped promptly, good priçe, 
24111 For the price the product is not bad. 
24112 Great 
24113 Horrible. Does not work well. 
24114 Haven t had to use it but it s there if something goes wrong with my Samsung camera. 
24115 Perfect! Bought these for my sis s wedding and the ones leftover I took with me on a Europe tour! 
24116 wasn t listed that a gender changer was needed 
24117 excellent 
24118 Very Happy 
24119 The camera is great. It s very easy to use and is wonderfully compact. The pictures I took are superb. I highly recommend it. 
24120 im head over heels in love with this camera. And the whole kit for the price is just amazing! Everything is of good quality even thought they re &#34;extras&#34;. I m so happy I made the leap and bought this kit! 
24121 Good product over all. Feels very sturdy on my monopod. 
24122 Does the job for a low price. 
24123 Great camera 
24124 would have been better if i didnt have to buy a hard drive for it... 
24125 great product 
24126 difficult to handle, it is not functional 
24127 Told I needed these for my camera. Seems to help. 
24128 Perfect fit. 
24129 I am totally impressed with this camera. Even the battery lasts indefinitely when it sits without being used. I HIGHLY recommend this camera! 
24130 Great product! 
24131 Cute camera but veery small view finder. Got as a gift for 11 years old. 
24132 Perfect. As promised, but I was surprised at how small the velvet bag was. Didn t know what it was for anyway, so it is still perfect for me. 
24133 Good flash for the price. Plan to use as a second flash when shooting portraits. My only negative is that the user manual is written very poorly. It s difficult to read and sometimes misleading.This flash has 8 custom function settings of which 3 are not mentioned in the manual. 
24134 THIS LENS IS AMAZING. If you were only to have one lens, have this one. The shallow depth of field and low light capability can t be beaten. 
24135 Ok+ 
24136 Thank I used it as soon I get it works very good, thank you! 
24137 DO NOT BUY FROM BESTPRICEAM, PIECES MISSING, NOT WORTH THE TIME TO SEND BACK. 
24138 great one but doenst snap it will keep on turning 
24139 Doesn t work so well in shady areas. Maybe it is the IR blocking filter. So if you re going to be flying through the woods, this isn t the way to go. 
24140 Works like a champ! 
24141 I am very impressed with the results. The product has a great price. and just the Tripod alone was worth the price. Big bang for the buck. 
24142 Fantastic Camera for Construction sites. Easily programmable and takes great time lapse videos 
24143 Extremely fast shipping. Quick and easy installation and programming into my existing 2gig system; all at a fraction of the purchase/installation offered by a security systems installer. 
24144 I ordered a dark brown frame and received a black frame 
24145 Looks very realistic. Cheaply made, but once they are mounted, that should not be an issue. 
24146 Great Product 
24147 Actually my wife loves it. I just carry the camera bag. 
24148 Great drone. Yes its an older model but I have already captured some amazing vids and pics with it and will be using it for my upcoming school project. 
24149 didn t work with any of my speedlites. 
24150 very good material 
24151 Wonderful bag very nice to have a large compartment that doesn t collapse. 
24152 Easy to direct ligh, hold shapes 
24153 This product is great hooked it to my go pro and love it! 
24154 Very good experience! Would recommend this seller always! 
24155 Works well, makes for a solid base and is easy to get on-off. 
24156 Great product. Fast shipping. 
24157 Bought this to pair with my Sony a6000 and it works well! I ve been taking pictures of plants and insects and you ve got to get realllllly close, but the detail is fantastic. The only drawback:The aluminum casing scratches VERY easily. 
24158 This camera was ok but does not do well in low light conditions. 
24159 Love it 
24160 Awesome. Great price. Fit my sons camera perfectly. Durable and long lasting. 
24161 This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Fits everything in for the drone and a few extras so I don t have to lug another bag along. 
24162 Very loud and light weight ! I ll take it on all my runs and everywhere I go. I won t leave home without it... 
24163 excellent 
24164 I ordered the expert shield and it was delivered in three days, that was with standard shipping, great service. the shield fits perfectly, couldn t ask for a better fit. the price is very reasonable for this kind of quality. racinsailor 
24165 the trade name was not neewer. 
24166 The product arrived on time and it was just what I needed. Would buy again. 
24167 On time. As described. 
24168 Works fantastic! I love controlling all my speedlights from one place. 
24169 My dropcam pro stopped working and the Nest company replaced it for me free. Very supportive and reliable company and the new cam works brilliantly. The company was very responsive and quick with their service. Thanks Nest! So I have bought another cam. 
24170 good camera for its purpose 
24171 Very satisfied 
24172 I m unimpressed with the feel of this. It doesn t hold he phone straight for a larger phone. It s very expensive for what it is and doesn t seem it will last. 
24173 Purchased to go with the Uniden system I purchase from Costco that only had two cameras. This synced perfectly with it and works really well. Good night vision too. 
24174 So far so good. GoPro Hero black consumes batteries to fast so it is good for moments where you cant find any other ellectrical source. 
24175 I bought a total of 4, I like them! 
24176 It really is an awful piece. The camera itself is OK tough the stand is bizarre and difficult to use as is the focus on the camer. The Software is junk 
24177 Great lens, amazing for landscape and night time photography 
24178 terrible quality cloth 
24179 This camera is great for action shots and has a lot of extras for enhancing pictures. The extra battery pack and SD cards were a bonus that was great to have. 
24180 I love this, I basically wanna take it everywhere. READ HOW TO ADJUST YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING BEFORE TAKING YOUR PICTURES. If they come out horrible, it s cause you did it wrong. 
24181 expected better resolution. 
24182 Works perfectly and came on time. 
24183 Ok 
24184 Nothing is broken so far, havent set it up yet but will whenever i have time 
24185 Cool 
24186 This camera has a very nice option you can select, I think it s called the &#34;beauty or beautiful&#34; mode, basically a soft version of portrait photo shop. People always say before your ready to take their, &#34;make me look young and beautiful&#34; this camera does that. Very nice. 
24187 Piece of junk. Does not work. Do not buy. 
24188 Just replaced one failed WANSVIEW CAM after two years with this one. Image is much better. I have not tested memory card yet. Hope it will work and last longer. 
24189 Great bag, fits a lot of equipment. Handy for water environments. 
24190 Great I will buy more 
24191 Well made. Would buy again. 
24192 hard to figure out how to use for the average person 
24193 As advertised 
24194 To start with, the canvas boxes in which they come are the poorest quality posible. The packege i got, did not include the bateríes. 
24195 works well for good price, sellers contacted me immediately after to let me know there is a warranty and to make sure there were no problems. 
24196 Excelente... 
24197 fits perfectly, as to be expected from OEM items 
24198 Keeps the GoPro clipped in and the mount is tight. It is not going anywhere. 
24199 Brought this to use w/JOTO 6-inch Waterproof Case pouch, for family & everyone LOVED THIS GIFT!!! 
24200 Very good item! I will purchase another soon...it s worth the money. Pictures are clear, I added a ring light to increase lighting and it help too. 
24201 We ll see. I purchased this to replace a unit that fail from a different manufacturer. So far, so good. I will update in time if needed. 
24202 This has been a great camera which is very easy to use and takes great pictures. Larger than the ones that slip in a pocket but that s not a problem for me. 
24203 Great tool for converting slides to digital images. Get one and pass it around your family. You ll probably only use it once but the time it saves and the memories you recover are worth it. 
24204 Much of the film either didn t develop or developed very, very slowly (we re talking hours). Kind of a bummer for the high price. 
24205 Fits all the standard GoPro Accessories. Worth the money. Good construction an good foam. 
24206 This item is a excellent piece of equipment,the size was perfect to fit my camera and cellphone. 
24207 love it 
24208 Very good picture quality, just a little overheat when u transfer picture to smartphone 
24209 What can one expect for so little money. Recommend spending the extra cash to purchase a higher quality tube kit. 
24210 It did not work. 
24211 These microprism screens are wonderful -- I put them in my EOS 1N/1V, and I love working with them. 
24212 A good solid camera for our son (11). He has used it at home and at camp and it s lasted through it all! Great pictures and lots of memories. 
24213 I lost the center column of my 190 tripod on a shoot and needed to replace it and this was the perfect solution. Works great. 
24214 Very easy to install, great video quality, strong wifi connection, love that it zooms in and out and pans smoothly, totally worth the price. Been through two other wifi monitors and I was so upset with those but now I m happy with this! 
24215 LOVE IT!!! 
24216 Seems as though it will work well though no real trial use of product yet. 
24217 Good concert binoculars. Some might find them a little heavy after awhile but I paired them with a Monopod and there perfect. 
24218 Worked and fit great for my camera. Best underwater photos taken...No filmy look on the images from the case. 
24219 Foam doesn t seem to fit the drone perfectly, but good enough. 
24220 Terrible terrible menu. Borderline retarded. Very expensive prime lenses. Fast. Hunts for focus while doing video though... 
24221 This is a Great Tripod! I put my Leica T62 Spotting scope on it and at the range or in the field it is great. I have killed many Coyotes and Rabbits using it to spot or as a rest. It is Killin Machine! Get one!! 
24222 Works just like the Nikon battery. 
24223 thanks 
24224 Image and construction quality are great! 
24225 Patrick Good service from Patrick and 5 stars rating for this service good quality of camera 
24226 Great for the price. 
24227 arrived and didnt work. 
24228 Bought a new camera with two lenses. For one I had a bunch of filters from my old 35mm, but the other was incompatible, so I ordered this pack to help in the field. So far, great results. 
24229 This is an excellent addition to the pro 40 - 150 and given the price and weight, makes for a 420mm f4 in a small package compared with anything else available. Optical quality is also excellent. 
24230 Great 
24231 Versatile, but not intuitive. Tendency to not be able to fully capture batteries. I have to secure then to the charger with a rubber band. 
24232 Worked for two years, then zippers ripped out. 
24233 Great when I m shooting concerts. Two thumbs up. 
24234 I m enjoying my new charger for my camera. No more dead batteries. 
24235 Good quality, great value. We ve been having difficulty charging the batteries and have to keep them plugged in almost constantly. We will likely be contacting the seller for assistance in the near future. 
24236 All hail the D-76, King of the developers. 
24237 The tripod doesn t fit in the camera case, that why it comes with its own carrying case. I like the whole kit. No complaints. 
24238 Fast service great product 
24239 Very good camera, fast shooting in any luminosity, easy to configure, small and confortable to handle. The only problem is the lack of a lens cap. For this we have to be always careful not to touch or let the lens touch anything. 
24240 love it. husband wears glasses and can bird watch from his chair, 
24241 Great Product 
24242 Excellent product and excellent service. 
24243 Does the trick. Protects the lens. A must-have for a nice lens. 
24244 It s awesome 
24245 Great for action videos such as bike riding skateboarding, etc 
24246 Sharp broad field of view. A little pricy but better than the cheap zoom models. 
24247 The cap works great. I would buy again. 
24248 broke after 3 months 
24249 Great product, has never scratched any lens I have used them on. 
24250 I have enjoyed using my Canary and watching it evolve. Customer satisfaction is paramount to these guys, so it is not done evolving. I am thouroughly satisfied and can t wait to see some of the up and coming features! 
24251 Does not come with clip accessory to put gopro on, need to buy that separate. 
24252 I wanted something I could strap my gorpo too that would float so when I brought it to the beach it wouldn t sink. So far in the pool it does just that and the added wrist strap is awesome so it doesn t float away. 
24253 Did the job, the price was right. 
24254 I needed a sports wifi cam asap for a trip and I got this camera on time for my trip. The camera works great, no issues. Will order again from this seller!!!! Great job :) 
24255 Very useful. 
24256 Pretty awesome product. Lenses fit perfectly. Couldn t be happier. 
24257 Since I live in a more urban area, these come in handy as I m always trying to sneak in a small or regular. They are very water proof, so the logs will stay dry without a baggie. Overall, really great product, I would buy it again! 
24258 High end feel. Protects well. Never loosens, much easier to keep clean than other UV filters that I own. 
24259 great tripod 
24260 Great 
24261 Horrible video quality not practical 
24262 Works as expected! 
24263 Tested it right away in water for an extended period before using it with camera. I hope to take it snorkeling this fall. 
24264 Spy camera. Looks pretty nice. The output is alright, not that great but I am not choosy 
24265 Good ++++ 
24266 Fast service. Satisfied. 
24267 I love it 
24268 4 years later and I still love this camera 
24269 Very good versatile lens. 
24270 Item delivered on time, was as described 
24271 Love my camera except for the fact it came with instructions in Japanese, or chineses, or Korean..... they were everything but English 
24272 Fast service, quality items 
24273 very pleased with both the charger and the batteries 
24274 Love! So adorable. 
24275 Photographs great, doesn t wrinkle. Wish I was a little bigger 
24276 Have not used much other than the batteries and chargers. Others have said hard to get out of charger. I found it quite ready. Love having the extra chargers while away from outlets. Great luxury to have! 
24277 Strong and versatile. A must! You can, of course, combine it with various camera, tablet or smartphone holder. My regret about this one: not getting one or two sooner. Seriously! 
24278 Three of the items were NOT what was pictured, and were of significantly lower quality. I returned it. 
24279 Great lens for the money buy now before the price increases. 
24280 blast 
24281 Works just as good as the original. 
24282 Great. 
24283 This works well for my son s Sony camera. 
24284 terrible. I do not recommend. the flash is late and doesn t supply a clear image 
24285 Perfect camera replacement cord 
24286 Great, 
24287 Works as advertised. For long exposure photos, you would want to use in lower light conditions. But the colors come out good and it works as it should. 
24288 It was as expected. Worked fine. 
24289 Won t keep the right setting very hard to get programmed very disappointed with this item. 
24290 The cameras offer a very poor picture during daylight hours. The cameras also get hot for some odd reason. I removed them from my system to prevent any issues. I have other HD-CVI cameras that offer a better picture. Do not spend you money on these. 
24291 Great camera - replacement for ZS40 on which we shot about 40,000 photos! 
24292 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
24293 I bought for my daughter for Christmas and she seems to love it. 
24294 Good value for cheap price, works fine, but while the flattening is space efficient, the assembly is fussy. 
24295 Very cool product. 
24296 I have both the small and medium bag and love them both. 
24297 Don t waste your money on this one unless you can live with terrible video quality. There is no way this is a 720P camera. Spend the extra money and get a 9805P that has excellent video 
24298 Good 
24299 Great macro for my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Awesome quality and comes with a little tether and Amazing bag for it. Perfect 
24300 thanks 
24301 Was very shocked at first that it held very well to my windshield, just have other problems with various suction mounts. Will buy another one soon to mount in the back of my cab. 
24302 I love this bag! Fits my camera and accessories perfectly!! And it is bigger than I expected, bonus!! 
24303 I Found my own ways to Hook the gopro onto my bike comfortably and stable. They seemed like a solid idea. 
24304 Its a great tool but has to be treated with great care as the top rotating part can easily break off. 
24305 I used this for my g3 wireless mics. It s an affordable case that adds protection and professionalism. 
24306 Camera was easy to operate and waterproof. Picture quality was good, but not great. 
24307 works great! 
24308 Very great batteries! They last for 6 hours each on my Sony CX900 
24309 I have not had the opportunity to use much yet, but happy with what I ve done so far. 
24310 good thank you 
24311 got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. if she s happy with it, i m happy with it. 
24312 Very good for price. 
24313 When it is finally set up it works great. But Foscam had to screen share my computer to get it set up. Way too complicated! 
24314 Excellent! 
24315 Case was as advertised,strong,roomy,except for the prop guards,but I m satisfied! 
24316 Very nice monocular , I like it and clear and a lot better than the other one I have which is a 10 power and 42 mm 
24317 Thanks 
24318 Works great! 
24319 You can carry a bunch of stuff not related to the camera. Passport, money and other documents. I see it as kind of a man s purse. 
24320 Works like a camera lens should 😏 
24321 The strap is short, wish it was longer. 
24322 good deal 
24323 Shipped and arrived quickly. The product is exactly as explained and fits my lense perfectly. Thanks for the great buy at an affordable price! 
24324 So far so good! We ll see how the quality is and how it functions underwater when we take our upcoming trip. 
24325 It s cheap, it works. Doesn t have the non-reflective felt lining that the genuine Canon hood has, but I can t complain for the price. 
24326 The best camera addition I have purchased. The grip holds two batteries. I love it 
24327 very tight first few uses, but improves to sturdy fit as flexed to the shape of your speedlight. super cheap and effective - thumbs up. 
24328 This is great 400 speed film and very reasonably priced. I like it in TMax developer. 
24329 There s not much to say about this battery that hasn t already been said. It works as a great replacement for the more expensive batteries and I can t tell the difference. 
24330 Power 2000 ACD-235 Replacement for Casio NP-40. This product rocks!!! I take a lot of pictures with my camera and now no matter what I have a charged battery ready to go. The charge stay longer and it is easy!Thanks 
24331 This kit is AWESOME! I can t believe how well everything works. Everything fits into the pouch and it slips onto the strap of my camera bag. 
24332 Lost the little black piece to cover the SD card... the rest helped too 
24333 Was exactly what I expected 
24334 The camera looks amazingly real, with red flashing light and the wires coming from back. 
24335 Very prompt fulfillment. Tremendous deal vs. normal retail. Very satisfied 
24336 exelent 
24337 This backpack has changed my level of orginization, and comfertablity with my equipment. All around best bagg out in the market. Its a must have. 
24338 Very good deal for all these items... Everything works great! 
24339 Arrived earlier than expected and product is as advertised. 
24340 This is awesome product 
24341 The really is a great starter kit. Using the tripod/monopod with my intro Canon DSLR worked great. I never worried about the tripod falling over or anything. But it is definitely for beginners. 
24342 We bought this for a gift and pre-loaded pictures of the kids on it. We liked it so much that we re ordering one for ourselves. 
24343 Good solid bag, got it on sale so it was a good buy... 
24344 I have 3 of them since 2013. They re all still working. On 2 of my car and 1 of my motorcycle. 
24345 Limited field of view. Past event vowing very cumbersome. Night vision useless. Merely just a webcam if that 
24346 Very nicely made case. We have not put it to use yet, but will soon. 
24347 clarity is great 
24348 the hood can be a problem ,it can go on crooked which show up in the photo 
24349 Great 
24350 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. Brightness is adjustable. 
24351 Works perfect on my Nikon DSLR 5100. 
24352 They didn t provide how to sync the device. I called the manufacturer and they wanted to charge me $50 for the answer. 
24353 I love this pack. It does all I wanted it to do. 
24354 Recommended 100 % excellent product 
24355 Perfect. 
24356 great but instructions were in chinesse 
24357 Cheap and good quality 
24358 so far so good 
24359 QUICK SERVICE ,GOOD QUALITY 
24360 Ordered the camera on Tuesday and received it today. Very fast shipping. Took some pics with it and works awesome and take great pics so far. 
24361 Excellent product. 
24362 Very good. Easy to unpack and easy to install. 
24363 Great security system doing the job that we need it for 
24364 The CMS software too complicated,I don`t know how to use,can you updated more easily and simply version? 
24365 I like GGS products, so I m fully satisfied wit this one too. It fits my camera s screen perfectly. Easy installation and great look. 
24366 Don t buy it! Waste of money!!!!! 
24367 It works good but broke after 3 events. Good temporary solution though. 
24368 The product was amazing everything works perfectly nice and intact shipping was almost immediate ! 
24369 Sturdy clips. 
24370 I have a Kodak Pixpro and lost my original case. Tight inside but it works. This is definitely for small cameras. The zippered pockets are also tight and cannot hold much but it worked for the charger cord during my recent vacation. The price was also very good. 
24371 I was a little wary at first buying this for my Sony nex 3n but it works fine! I use it for my 18-55mm lens and it s great! 
24372 For the price I paid, it s excellent. I like it and have no regrets. I recommend it 
24373 At this price point this is a great filter. I have severals B+W filters and I think this one has the same quality. 
24374 Outstanding!! 
24375 I have purchased several accessories this year for my new Nikkon d3200 camera this year. Each item s quality has been excellent and functions as described. Also, each item included a lens cloth. Would not be concerned at all about purchasing items from this seller. 
24376 500 slides in 4 hours and works as advertised, now its a paper weight. I will sell it for 80 bucks! 
24377 I bought this to use as a baby monitor and could not be happier. An underrated feature of the Nest Cam is the night vision. It s amazing and the set up is incredibly easy. 
24378 Perfect for theatre, clear and easy to focus. 
24379 Excellent item, poor internal Memory, but all good. 
24380 Great case. Pelican or nothing. 
24381 This unit was bad from the start, would not hover, always moves down or up and to the side 
24382 good kit 
24383 Didn t have the correct parts with this product 
24384 Great, affordable, professional variable filter. The slider ring is a bit wonky, but for the price a great buy. Use it on my Sigma 18 - 35 f/1.8. Helps me stay wide open when I need it. 
24385 Excellent 
24386 Just what we needed! 
24387 Perfect.... Easy to fit everything needed... And keep everything protected! 
24388 Worked perfectly. I recommend it. Top craftsmanship. Bought several rolls, All rolls performed at 100%. Quality Control at 100% too. I will buy again from this vendor for sure. Happy customer = repeat business!!!!!!!! 
24389 charge doesn t seem to last very long. 
24390 Excellent kit has all advertised items and seem to be very good quality. The case is perfect, all items fit in it and looks to be excellent quality. The kit has just about everything a person needs to keep camera and lens clean which will provide very high qualtiy photos. 
24391 Excellent, works like a champ, fits my camera (Thank you to all the other buyers who answered all my questions) and I received it so fast I was able to take it on vacation! 
24392 This is a great item to have on hand 
24393 so so 
24394 Freaking awesome! Love this product! 
24395 Good 
24396 I have ordered a new one. But the box was opened, display was dirty and user manual was missing. I have returned it on the same day. 
24397 It works perfectly! I am very happy with it!! 
24398 my daughter loves this camera 
24399 Works in my old Kodak C743. I am thrilled. It arrived quickly and as described. 
24400 looks exaclty as it is pictured here. havent used it yet but cant wait to. looks very heavy duty. 
24401 Excellent and excellent customer service. Highly recommended. 
24402 I know FLIR makes some amazing products but a thermal imaging unit for an iPhone??? Who would believe it? Well this actually works - and quite well. Software easy to load. Easy to set up and use. You can change the image coloration for different situations. I am truly amazed. 
24403 Haven t been able to use it yet but for the price you can t go wrong. 
24404 Just got these for my Nikkor 55-300 Lense and they are a great value and were quickly shipped. 
24405 Well made, I took my ripped neewer sandbags that came with the boom are and just stuffed them right inside. No complaints. 
24406 This is awesome for indoor photography. I can take photos indoors without using flash. What else would you want? 
24407 Really love d it! Something in what you can really make an investment. 
24408 Breathed new life into my Canon 1D Classics! unbeatable price and quality! 
24409 Worked as expected 
24410 I love it. 
24411 covers the lens just fine. 
24412 Shut the camera on and off and starts and stops the recording well. Zooming starts at one speed than goes super fast for the second half of the zoom. Why? Cheap electronics. Spend little money and you get cheap crap. Look for another. 
24413 Very fun to play with 
24414 My iPhone took better pics. Not kidding 
24415 Price is right, and it works fine. 
24416 Was too large and bulky for my purposes - it was a nice bag and well done but not for my situation. Returned with Amazon no hassle return. 
24417 lovely 
24418 I bought this for my 17 year old for her birthday. She loves it! It s retro, but easy to use. The Fugifilm Instax Accessory Bundle Set is a Must Have ! It s also easy to get film for. 
24419 Does what it s supposed to do! 
24420 Case is a little big for my camera, but it is well protected and has compartments for the charger and anything else you might need. 
24421 tried to get in touch with company know one answer the telephone. tried 3 times. my uniden wireless video surveillance will not record just brought it in MAY THIS YEARhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GID61XwkL._SS300_.jpg 
24422 Love this light, works great, well built! 
24423 This little thing will change my videography experience completely. 
24424 Good Fast service and as advertised. 
24425 Beware the firmware updates... mine fell out of the sky after the most recent update... moral of the story is if you have a firmware that works just stick with it and don t update. Worked amazing before that though... 
24426 Best purchase I have ever made :) I ve used it in so many vacations already! Perfect underwater pics! 
24427 item is as described by seller, reach on time. no problem so far...recommended seller and product 
24428 Works well, however if you zoom into scene, this doesn t show you your new &#34;frame&#34;. 
24429 Everything fits perfect in the bag. 
24430 Very comfort, very good size if you have children and need to carry their stuff and your slrs. 
24431 love love love my green screen! 
24432 Very high quality product. It has a cover for the LCD screen AND the control panel. Difficult to tell that it is even installed! 
24433 A great buy! 
24434 Good size for all you spare parts and gear. My 2 go pro fit great and plenty of cut out. 
24435 Great clarity and viewing anglle. Works wonderfully at night as well. IR have even assisted an older camera I have as a backup to this one. 
24436 So far this has been a great replacement battery. I will probably buy another one. It charged up just fine and so far has been flawless. 
24437 Just getting to know this wonderful camera. So far it is flawless. 
24438 We use these to watch birds at our feeder. My wife just loves them. They are easy to focus, use, and store. I am glad we made the purchase.. 
24439 Red light never stops blinking, but works as intended - A deterrent. 
24440 The battery was exhausted after using it two times. Learned this while on vacation. 
24441 No memory stick was included though it is listed!! Very bad 
24442 Excellent product! Very satisfied with the quality and prompt delivery. 
24443 Great filter, exactly as I expected. Most likely will buy a couple more.... 
24444 Great Service! Great Price on a very good camera! Arrived ahead of time 
24445 Great bag! wish the top was big enough to hold a laptop though 
24446 I like the design of the camera. The packing is very safety, without any damage to the camera. 
24447 Good Product 
24448 nice product, quick delivered, good description 
24449 Works excellent keeps my cam from fogging up. Fits well without messing up the case. 
24450 I like it because you can fly inside without hurting the house, kids, pets, or quad copter itself, too badly. 
24451 Batteries work really well. :-) received products timely. Thanks 
24452 All is well. I am happy with with the items purchased from this seller. However, I didn t catch the writing that said that it only extends 8&#34;.... I was under the impression that it was 18&#34;....guess there was a smudge on my eye glasses!! 
24453 nice bag for camera 
24454 Excellent beginner camera! 
24455 works great, but hard to close cover and can t see display on GoPro 4 Silver.... small block should be moved to other end of line than it would be perfect 
24456 Excellent product. Excellent transaction. 
24457 This camera is in perfect condition and works great. 
24458 I bought 3 pairs. I have tried to use 2 so far. Each box had a faulty locking mechanism on one of the stands. It would not support the Arlo in a fixed position. I am going to have to epoxy the ball in order to make it work properly. 
24459 Received a day early, thanks. I know where I will shop for my security needs in the future. 
24460 Works great. Auto open feature is nice. It fit my NX Mini very well. It is perfect for protecting the lens when not in use, and you don t have to take it off to take photo s. 
24461 I brought this on a road trip out west and it performed beautifully. It s funny how close you have to get to the subject to &#34;zoom&#34; in on them. I adore this lens! 
24462 I really like the trigger I have a Canon 600ex and a Yongnuo 600ex flash. It works great with both and has a added a new dimension to my flash photography. 
24463 I love the camera. It does everything they promised. Very clear picture and set up was very easy!! Loved it!! 
24464 I used this for one day,then this thing broke 
24465 The price couldn t be better for this all-manual flash, especially if you re new to using off-camera flash equipment. Being forced to use manual settings will teach you more in 10 minutes than anything. I love this guy and ll be buying more! 
24466 Product did not connect wirelessly at all. Worked with hardwire but free web viewing was primitive. I expected a whole lot more from Samsung 
24467 Excellent does what it says. 
24468 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24469 Very helpful to tighten and loosen the camera mount. Recommended! 
24470 Really enjoying the camera. Optical zoom is incredible. 
24471 Smooth as butter once you learn how to handle it. There will be some delay in response when the spinning wheels have to change direction, but once you get used to it, the smoothest tracking shots will be yours! 
24472 Very good bundle. 
24473 Great telescope&#34; 
24474 They work perfectly fine for my cam. Needed a charger and extra batteries and nice that the bill for the price they are awesome. 
24475 Waste of money. The ink does not disappear, it just loses color, from blue to light grey, but everything can be read. 
24476 No trouble, its working, every thing its OK. 
24477 works well and has nice features 
24478 great! help a lot 
24479 I asked if this battery would fit the Geekpro cameras and received 2 responses, one person did not know and the other stated that it would NOT. Well, it fits perfectly, works great and came about 90% charged! I would (and probably will) buy more! 
24480 This flash is equivalent to the canon alternative at a fraction of the cost. I have used it for events and weddings and may never bu Canon flashes again. 
24481 So much fun to share these pictures w/ friends and family! 
24482 It s great in the sunshine. it can t perform well under low light situation... I can t even take photo in a japanese sushi bar with this lens.. I use my f4 lens instead in such situation. 
24483 I bought it together with Eye-fi mobi 8GB SD card for my Nikon D300. It works and I am happy with it. 
24484 Did fine under water 
24485 Buy genuine always if you want it to last for 3 years with no worries. 
24486 Incredible camera, prints very good quality photos. Doesn t come with an SD card so can only store about 16 photos at a time, but fantastic besides that. Ability to change exposure / etc really makes this a step up from an instax 
24487 Both batteries hold charge and were delivered quickly. 
24488 Great binos. I ve used for both for general and bird watching. These are very good for lower light situations. 
24489 a 
24490 It s a battery. It works. Charge seems just as good as the Canon batteries 
24491 Very cute print, doesn t look cheap. Very trustworthy on my canon rebel 
24492 Works as advertised. 
24493 These plastic &#34;filters&#34; I knew would be on the margins of uselessness, and I was not disappointed. They attach poorly to the camera, increase distortion and reduce light transmission, and don t really filter out the wavelengths that they are intended to filter. Don t waste your money. 
24494 An amazing lens that every camera owner should have. A great value because the price includes lots of extras. Speedy delivery, nicely packed. Thanks! 
24495 Great film, but I wish it was a bit cheaper for returning customers. 
24496 No issues does the job. 
24497 An excellent companion to the FZ-1000 
24498 Super light you can throw it on your shoulder and forget its even there. Not the most comfortable but is the most convenient. Would not recommend for sitting a long time. 
24499 Love it! This lightening has changed my professional look to the too of the list. My videos want be the same without it! Thanks :) 
24500 Very nice and comfortable sling bag. As described. Improvements could be a rain cover and a large pocket at the back to fit my iPod mini. I use my mini to review my pictures so it s always with me. 
24501 Closes tighter than my original gopro case. Works great with the cut out for my mic. 
24502 Great Great 
24503 just as described,,thanks 
24504 it works 
24505 Excellent oversize MagicFiber screen pack. Perfect for my huge laptop screen, multiple desktop monitors and also for our HD TV screen. Would gladly buy again from this seller! 
24506 Love this product. The camera and cable fits perfect. The directions were simple and installation was a breeze. I was concerned about the sound quality, but much to my surprise, it was outstanding. I love it so much I just ordered a second case. 
24507 I think that these batteries might be better than the Pentax originals. 
24508 Worked great for reversing the polarization of the lcd display on my motorcycle. Now it s black with white numbers. Looks awesome! 
24509 Excellent product with great service response from the vendor. 
24510 I used the head strap while climbing a mountain. I really got some great shots, allowing me capture the entire event seemlessly. 
24511 nice camera great price 
24512 Great camera especially for the price. Had lots of accessories with it too. Have been using for a few weeks and have not had any issues. Not sure why people would spend 10x s as much for the name brand version. 
24513 Quick response, product quality is excellent. 
24514 Good product. 
24515 I love this camera. very easy to operate. 
24516 This is awesome for teenagers and super simple to connect. I wish it would come with more paper. I have not priced how much it is to get extras but my teens loved this!!! 
24517 Fit was perfect and a great replacement to the original. 
24518 2 bulbs and 1 stand did not work. Very cheaply made. 
24519 Great and quality product. I have been using it for years now. 
24520 Item worked perfectly! Great pictures and video. 
24521 I dive very often and this filter system is extremely handy. The photo/videos are much more vibrant and having the option to switch to a different filter ensures your photos come out amazing. Two thumbs up and a 5 star from me. 
24522 Just wished there was an updated version of this with VR. Other than that it works fine. 
24523 Very smooth operation. For the price it is as good as it gets 
24524 This combination of two batteries and a charger was less than half the cost of one battery from a conventional store. 
24525 Very good products, but the floating handle is not completely sealed. On the last trip some water has entered inside it. 
24526 Not bad for the price 
24527 I have not flown it yet but all put together it feels very solid. I would rate five stars but there was no instructions and I had a little bit of difficulties putting g it together mostly my fault also there is no Allen wrench included which sucked. 
24528 VERY happy with this camcorder! The video and the stills come out clear. Amazing package for the price. Will recommend it to my entire Video class at school. 
24529 This bag fits everything I need it to fit. Very durable! 
24530 I had them for couple of month and started to fade. Not a good buy 
24531 Handy camera. Great Zoom ability. Its easy to switch from still to video. 
24532 i love my fuji camera and the film is easy enough to just drop in and shoot. 
24533 Arrived on time and worked well 
24534 Just as described - arrived on time and works perfectly. 
24535 more POWER MOAR POWUR 
24536 The carrier is well made, it holds the film flat with little loss of the image. 
24537 Works great! 
24538 Love, love, love! Cute and easy to use. Took a bit of practice to get used to the settings but I love the surprise on how the picture turns out. 
24539 It s a great solution to recharge Sony 7R batteries. 
24540 Love this for gopro....always have a batt ready! 
24541 I m so pleased with the camera and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
24542 i spoke with Danny today he was very helpful in explaining and setting up my camera i give hi 2 thumbs up tanks Danny 
24543 Good quality but don t stays in place, I bought this one for my iPad and I can t make that Stick on, poor quality adhesive. Disappointed!!! 
24544 i thebitems on time and was pleased. 
24545 Great camera! Excellent underwater photos. 
24546 Charged up great and have been using them with no difficulties! 
24547 The hood works great. Awesome lens hood, fits perfect and tight on the lens. I would recommend this hood. 
24548 Fits well! That s all you need really. 
24549 This is a decent remote. It just is really really small and feels kind of chintzy. But the price was right, so it ll do! 
24550 best half-case ever! grippy, lightweight, well-crafted! J.B. is the best...just when I thought the bamboo & walnut grips were great! 
24551 beautiful made and great results 
24552 Didn t love the results I had with this, but to be fair, I didn t test it out for very long before deciding I didn t want to keep it. 
24553 A+++++ 
24554 Not worth it. Daughter was excited to get it but after a few hours lost interest. 
24555 Perfect for our news show!!!! 
24556 does not fit! 
24557 Good quality and value. 
24558 So nice. All the items made the gift even bettwr 
24559 Batteries work great and saved a ot of money over the Canon brand. I am hoping the maintain their current change ability in the future too. 
24560 I have had issues with the stand in this set. The rest seems to be ok, but the stand keeps falling apart. Not high quality 
24561 Excellent APS-C sensor paired with a beautifully crafted 28mm (equiv) lens results in fantastic images. It s compact and unobtrusive. Perfect for street photography but it performed well on a cityscape sunset photoshoot. I d certainly recommend this product. 
24562 Very cheap. Broke on first use 
24563 Lasted about a year. Worked great in the meantime! 
24564 Excellent for sending power + video to remote cameras using cheap cat5e cable I got cheaply at a thrift store. 
24565 Perfect 
24566 Very good!!! 
24567 For a photography maniac comes in super handy. Charges fast. Has been in use for about 3 months now, and i charge them about once or twice a week. So far have not observed reduced battery lifetime. 
24568 GREAT PRODUCT 
24569 Excelentttttttttt 
24570 Use for protect my NX500 camera, looks amazing, pretty vintage and always at hand. Remember my grandpa s camera. 
24571 Great product 
24572 Have a Nikon D3300. Only received one of the two lens cap keepers, but even if I received the second one, probably wouldn t use it. Fell off rather quickly. Need better adhesive. Lens cap fit perfectly, and the HeroFiber cloths are amazing. 
24573 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24574 doesnt hurt my neck at all 
24575 Great! 
24576 very hard to adjust 
24577 Gift for husband, he loves it! 
24578 Held like iron. Pleased. 
24579 These are great, hold two light stands, and other bits inside. The only thing I don t like about them is they take a couple I weeks to get them, but I have ordered them twice now. I think they are worth the wait. 
24580 Perfect 
24581 I bought this camera for vacation, I went threw 3 sets of batteries within 75 pics. The camera will not power off unless the batteries are removed. Not the best picture quality either. Keep shopping. 
24582 Had them now for two and half years and they are working great, they keep the charge capacity very good. 
24583 Sun shade is visible when not zoomed. 
24584 Sticky tape doesnt last. Otherwise the picture quality is great. Using it for USPSA shooting matches. Works awesome. 
24585 very happy with product 
24586 I like these cameras, they are doing their job. I already had 2 so I bought 2 more from amazon 
24587 Exactly like the one that came with our camera. Now we have a spare. 
24588 This only worked briefly before it just quit working. It was a cheap option I went with and ended up having to spend more money on another one. I should have not skimp on quality just to save money 
24589 It s great for nigh macro photography. 
24590 Nice cheap replacement to old camcorder had laying around 
24591 I didn t like not like this product very much. The material felt in-considerably cheap for the cost of the item., the album is very hard and stiff which makes it difficult to flip through the pages. Additionally, the pages after regular use start to detach. 
24592 Great batteries for the price 
24593 Just perfect! Thank you! Works great! 
24594 Fits and chatges perfectly 
24595 Used this for a wedding guest book alternative and the guests loved it! 
24596 Understanding the manual is not easy. 
24597 Works perfectly 
24598 Listed as a micro 4/3 adapter but when I revived the item, its for T2 adapter. 
24599 Can t be beat for the price, this is a professional grade monopod for the videographer on a budget with a very smooth pan & tilt...great product!!! 
24600 this works surprisingly well with my P520 camera. I m just mad i didn t buy it sooner. 
24601 Excellent quality, fast charger, they fit snugly but perfectly. 
24602 Quite expensive but works really well. 
24603 Awesome !!! 
24604 Small, but mighty. I carry it in my pocket when on excursions. 
24605 Really works well can t tell the difference 
24606 Excellent little camera but a bit difficult to program. Went online for help and found different opinions mostly negative to the programing. After many atemps, finally got it to work and I am happy with it. 
24607 Great service and product. 
24608 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
24609 Works very well & I would purchase again from this company. 
24610 don t try to recharge these with an auto charger cord or adapter plug! it will actually drain the battery. 
24611 After two years, still can t access remotely. One of the cameras went from color to black and white after a year. 
24612 I used it in the Caribbean and I m totally happy that I bought it... 
24613 Wasn t happy with the camera at all 
24614 Great! 
24615 Will return to seller. 
24616 Free charger and battery, what a deal, why buy &#34;GoPro&#34; when you can get same product for a fraction of the cost. 
24617 Quick delivery and excellent products 
24618 Simple design, easy to use, and saves me money. I had two different people ask me to look at it because both had lost their GoPro s in the surf and had to buy new cameras. 
24619 Not what you expect.....very cheap and honestly should have a recall!!!! How do I return this? 
24620 It s a good charger everything came in great. The car charger is awesome as well. Overall great product. I was a bit skeptical buying it but it met all my expectations 
24621 This lens hood fits perfectly on two lenses and seems to good provide good protection from stray light, preventing flare. Works great! 
24622 loved it.....specially the sensor....my guests enjoy it very much! 
24623 works great when you remember to take it with you. LOL 
24624 Works fine. 
24625 Works great for what it is. 
24626 I was excited to get but I was a little disappointed when I got it 
24627 When I put my phone and hold it, it doesn t feel sturdy. It feels like it is missing something to hold it together. 
24628 Only got one like everyone else s review... and my roommate purchased these through my recommendation and she only got two.. But they sent me the 4 pack right away! 
24629 There are alternate option available for lesser price when you compare the quality of this product 
24630 My son s a photographer and he loved this product! 
24631 Awesome, better than what I could have imagined!!!! 
24632 Didn t work with my d3200 
24633 Thanks 
24634 Fits the camera all right, comfortable to use. 
24635 Love it 
24636 It was perfect ,arrived extremely late lol but product was new and I m happy with it. 
24637 Nice product, all is well 
24638 Bought for my little cousin. She loves it. Film can get expensive though. 
24639 It did not work at all 
24640 Smaller than I expected. Work great for a variety of projects. 
24641 great transaction. Product as described 
24642 Very hood 
24643 Bright, floaty, and easy to use. 
24644 For the price it is a great little camera. 
24645 Nice 
24646 This was a great price. Want to add more shooting time? This is a must have. This also adds stability when handling the camera. 
24647 Wearing glasses can be a curse, especially when dealing with the eye piece on a camera. The Hoodman has proven extremely useful in easing that issue and now that I have it, I m not sure how I did without it before. 
24648 Camera fits. Not much room for anything else. 
24649 Good 
24650 I really like this camera very much, shoots good pictures! 
24651 Easy to use for my first digital camera. Pictures I have taken are very nice with the effects I wanted. 
24652 It malfunctioned and I m actually trying to return it and get a refund 
24653 Good basic wifi ip camera, The down side, are the installation instructions, i had to use a third party IP Camera viewer to use. Not in English, 
24654 Took very good underwater pictures and videos! 
24655 ok 
24656 great 
24657 Awesome 
24658 Works well just tough if you don t have the proper TV. 
24659 Just have received this and it works just as advertised. Blue tooth connected quickly and my iPhone6 fit just right. 
24660 Have a Canon EOS T5. Fits pefectly. Holds all accessories plus some. 
24661 Made a fire in 15 seconds, first try right out of the box! The magnifying lens works great too! 
24662 This camera is fantastic, quick and small enough to carry all day casually, yet it has plenty of features for when you really want to dial in those amazing shots to remember. Works great for everything I ve thrown at it and has good battery life. 
24663 Bulkier than expected. Difficult to get focused. Researching the YouTube tricks to adjust the internal stuff adjusted 
24664 good 
24665 Excellent system. My husband bought it for a client, and he says it has excellent resolution! Unfortunately he couldn t test the remote viewing feature as the location where it was placed does not have internet option. But other than that, a very good system. 
24666 Works perfectly with my set up. Great deal! 
24667 Best small camera I ve used. And, it has an interchangeable lens!! 
24668 Good camera, be aware of sellers, some send Chinese version and there is no way to change OS 
24669 I bought 2. Nice resolution when working. My unit failed within 8 months. This is not an outdoor camera. 8 months later it failed due to water inside the camera. The one mounted indoor is still working. 
24670 Simple, works well, and nicely priced. 
24671 I purchased as a gift. Please don;t bug me again for a review. 
24672 very confortable and useful 
24673 I wanted a frame for my GoPro and saw this. For the price I thought it was a great deal. I wanted the frame for better sound quality as well. I am pleased with this frame and it holds my GoPro very well. A great product. 
24674 Bought this for my husband--he loves it-stilling learning with it-something new each nite. Very happy with it ! 
24675 Thanks so much all products are in good conditions 
24676 Had lights with pull string and what an improvement this has made, no more trying to find the string in the dark. Walk in and the light turns on and can adjust the time the light stays on with no motion. 
24677 Plastic d ring that the strap attaches to broke after a week when the bag dropped from my shoulder to the crook of my elbow...now I have no strap, and I drop my camera :( 
24678 Very good. Great price and value. Will Recommend. 
24679 Not super ultra precise and perfectly accurate, but they do the job and they are certainly affordable. 
24680 Great little camera for the dough, great video. Batteries do not last very long, however bought some spare. The case cracked at the hinges with very little stress, so I only give it 3 stars. The accessories are great. Not bad for the price. 
24681 Works great. car charger adapter a real plus!! 
24682 Good for any water goer! 
24683 The lenses are very snug and require a bit of force to get into the holder. Otherwise, they are really nice and I love the &#34;wallet&#34; holder. 
24684 INCREDIBLE Camera... best I have ever owned... exceptional in every way... as advertised... arrived on time... NO surprises... THANKS, J 
24685 Works fine! Great price! 
24686 I love it!! It is most definitely the best camera I ve ever owned. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. 
24687 They fit perfectly, work great, and don t take too long to charge. 
24688 Overall great material made. I don t have the original one but happy with this one. WORTH! 
24689 Vast improvement over the other ones I have tries. The eye shield stayed attached the whole day out in the field shooting. 
24690 I m looking for the same bag just a little bigger, it works well made very well. 
24691 Works Great! I highly recommend it if you need so see how the colors will will look in print before you print. 
24692 GIFT FOR MY 12 YEAR OLD. OF COURSE SHE LOVED IT...LOL 
24693 I use this as a kitty cam when I am traveling and it is by far the best investment I ve made. I love being able to check in on my babies when I am away. 
24694 very good 
24695 This is my son s first real camera and he loves it. He has taken some really fantastic shots. 
24696 Works good. A little loose on the swivel but it does the trick. 
24697 For the GP4, the back cover is useless, but everything else works excellently and fits perfectly. Don t even but a GP4 without this kit to protect the housing and lens glass elements - it s just not smart. 
24698 As expected which is nice 
24699 Great product for the money. The kit got me off to a good start and the lens works perfectly. The more I learn the more use I have for each of the items in the kit so it was a wise purchase. 
24700 Excellent! Thank you!! 
24701 Heavy, difficult to open but worst of all. the micro SD cards do not stay in the cut outs and fall out when the case is opened. The foam that should hold the cards is too hard and the cards &#34;wiggle&#34; out 
24702 Came with batteries, worked inside through the walls & outside from a distance. Simple on/off buttons. Great product, highly recommend. 
24703 Charged up quickly, lights stayed on for 6 hours which is what the maker of the lights specified. I m happy. 
24704 Stable as stable gets, but heavy as hell. Seriously it is extremely heavy. 
24705 great battery for go pro last long and has pretty affordable price 
24706 For the price I think it works great!!! 
24707 should be in everyones bag 
24708 This replacement for my camera worked just fine. 
24709 It s ok for the price I paid for. 
24710 Delivery and product were excellent! 
24711 The viewer needs to be on a direct 90 degree/ perpendicular angle to see the true image and color. From an angle the image appears washed out 
24712 Awesome addition to my boyfriends warehouse where he shoots and is constantly moving around!!! 
24713 gets stuck when trying to remove the lens from the body of my camera but does the job otherwise. 
24714 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
24715 Got this without looking closely. It s made from soft low quality plastic... was expecting fabric. Worried it will get brittle over time and crack. The Gels very in quality and thickness. Honestly it feels pretty cheap. 
24716 I love looking at clusters and this eyepiece is awesome. I use Celestron X-Cels and this eyepiece is a great addition for the money. Very good optics for the budget astronomer like me. 
24717 Did not fit our camera. 
24718 Met expectations. 
24719 Love it but the velrco is AGGRESSIVE. Protect your curly headed kids and poodles from it s grasp. 
24720 Fast and easy transaction. Camera set up very simple. Happy with purchase. 
24721 Says wireless but won t connect to it. 
24722 Dangerous design. Cam weight causes it to tangle in lines causing kite to lose control. 
24723 Was useful in looking at some old slides. 
24724 Have to take &#34;innards&#34; of eyepiece out if you want to maintain the original view in the viewfinder - not difficult to do 
24725 Very good optical properties, perfect fit. 
24726 Legs won t stay extended. Ball head works well, but there is really no point to the extendable legs if they can t be locked in place. I will return this product. 
24727 Cant even record in daylight. Need I say more... 
24728 Really great asset if you are attempting to use available light and the light isn t cooperating. re-direct and use for fill or to enhance exisiting light 
24729 good quality 
24730 I like that the cord has an adjustment button. Other camera floats are sort of one size. Works well for it s purpose. 
24731 Little disappointed in the frame the picture it s self is smaller than I realized it would be. Also didn t get the remote, only good thing the company refunded me because of that & let me keep the frame so I guess I did come out ahead. 
24732 The on button is hard to push to get it turned on, video is fine, thank god for its remote. 
24733 It does the job. enough said. 
24734 Good items! 
24735 Good product but too big for my needs. 
24736 Works better than the original battery and the charger is great 
24737 After having my IRIS a month I really needed it. This is a perfect with. You do need to remove the props. But probably a good idea anyway. 
24738 This lease is a macro lens, but it lacks vibration reduction, so clarity suffers for close ups unless you use a tripod. 
24739 Fits the Nikon very well 
24740 We bought this for our wedding for a our photo booth. Works great. Takes nice pictures. I love that you can save the photos to an SD card. Very impressed. Would recommend. 
24741 Excellent...! 
24742 So far, i ve only used it a couple of times, and it s very user friendly. Great product for me! 
24743 Excellent product, I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
24744 My son likes this for his camera. 
24745 case#c6725292 Agent AR004611 Excellent Customer Service and very helpfull. Nice product, nice quality and easy to use. 
24746 nice light case 
24747 Works better than I ve expected. 
24748 Amazing Stand. It s very strong. 
24749 Exceeded my expectations, perfect lighting for streaming online. 
24750 Perfect for my camera! 
24751 I have only used them 2 times. And 1 transmitter doesn t work. And 1 receiver the connector piece broke off and my flash fell off into my softbox luckily that caught it. 
24752 Good Bag! 
24753 Worked great thanks. 
24754 Excellent camera, great shots, crisp and beautiful...worth the purchase 
24755 Works well world wide or at least in Europe. 
24756 Excellent, couldn t be more satisfied... 
24757 if you are beginner with filter I would recommend it, because is cheap. it gives cause glare and you see the rim of the plastic holder. 
24758 Good case 
24759 Works fine. A little cumbersome to take on and off, but this is minor. Be careful not to over-tighten. 
24760 Works great. 
24761 It could hold a charge longer but it s good enough. 
24762 Perfectly fits Nex5-R 
24763 This was for my daughter and she really enjoyed it. Shipped right away so I enjoyed that. 
24764 Fits my new Canon 50mm lens. Works great, Price was great. 
24765 I love this lens. The optical capability is phenomenal for the price. I use ti with my K-x. Its great for potraits, and just street photography. Even some scenery. I love Pentax! Thank you!!! 
24766 I love this. Easy to use and light weight 
24767 Its okay. Fun to fly once you get the proper trim because otherwise it has a mind of its own. Also, the camera SUCKS! its worse than stand definition so if i keep it, I absolutely must find a higher def (real HD) camera for this thing. 
24768 Very good 
24769 Great batteries for Fujifilm camera.... They last long... 
24770 The best! 
24771 Did not met my expectations... 
24772 Great and reliable strap 
24773 This is a replica it does not work, I ve downgraded over 300 ps3s amd this clip is giving errors no matter what. Do not buy it s is not authentic 
24774 Fit perfectly on my hd ghost. 
24775 It s a total piece of crap but it works as a minimal travel tripod to throw into a bag and jump on an airplane for a shoot. 
24776 Awesome product. Works great in wet, hot, dry, or cold climates. Would recommend this to anyone that has a Gopro. 
24777 Fit great, last longer than the original! 
24778 DISSAPOINTED!!!! Only after a few shots, the battery went dead. I had it replaced but then I was greeted only with a blank screen. A total waste of time and money !!!! DO NOT PURCHASE !!! I gave this a 1 star only because NO STARS is not an option. 
24779 Great product, great price. Shipping was quick and everything was as described, very high Quality. I bought them for my Anart and they are perfect! I would buy them again and certainly recommend them to anyone looking for a back up or replacement battery. 
24780 Great filter. It is larger than 82mm(the threads to lens are 82mm) on the top half which makes it impossible to use with lens hood. 
24781 Great Tripod--Can collapse or extend to a good lenth. 
24782 great 
24783 Unfortunately it was DOA, display didn t work and it would not program. The process for obtaining a replacement is smooth as silk. I hope that it works so I can rave about it. 
24784 Very good camera. Works great! 
24785 easy to install 
24786 The bag was perfect for my equipment. Plenty of room for my lenses and camera bodies. I even managed to squeeze in a Metz CL-1 flash and various other accessories. The strap for the tripod is a must for bike riders. Good quality bag with plenty of padding. 
24787 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
24788 I couldn t stop reading. Loved the characters. This prompted a lot of discussion with friends. Totally recommend it. 
24789 Best thing ever i got for my flash. It work very good. Makes a difference!!!! Good material, you cant go wrong with this. 
24790 Great product and they perform exactly as expected. Much better than the permanently attached prop guards for ease of use with a carrying case. Comes with all the tools/parts needed to fit a variety of Phantom quadcopters as well. 
24791 Great value. Lens worked perfectly and nice extras 
24792 Great I didn t expect this kind tripod but I love it 
24793 The product description says that this is a &#34;Pre-made 125 foot RG59 and power cable&#34; Received and installed these only to find that is not RG59 as required by my security cameras. Laview says these are RG58 and they will not work. Buyer beware. 
24794 The battery has worked as advertised. 
24795 excelent 
24796 You cannot beat this lens as an end in itself, but if you attempt to stitch a pan at close range, you will discover some interesting distortion realities. Even long range shots will give interestingly distorted cloud formations without attempting any stitching. 
24797 Everything was as promised and the batteries are a life saver when traveling. I love the tripod it works better that trying to take selfies. 
24798 awesome. like this battery it s nice to have a spare 
24799 Decent quality for the price. Works well. Case fit perfectly onto my S4 (T-mobile). 
24800 Fit my A58 perfectly level comes in handy when not using tripod which has 2 levels. 
24801 Fits perfect on the new third generation 50mm STM 1.8 lens. Only difference is the price as this was about 25% the cost of the real Canon Lens hood. Camer neatly boxed with lens cleaning cloth. What a Deal!!!! 
24802 Light and durable 
24803 A must have for any lens! This keep me for loosing my lens cap. It was easy to stick it on the cap, no additional glue need. 
24804 Great price for a double item which solved me not having to find each one by its self. works great for what it was designed for. 
24805 good 
24806 Works well 
24807 Great price and perfect fit. 
24808 We love it! And we are ordering 2 more cameras. Night vision is perfect. 
24809 Wonderful keeps everything together. 
24810 great! 
24811 great products. Thanks 
24812 A good product. 
24813 Love this strap it was more of a blue than a green but still great 
24814 Love it! Takes beautiful pictures and is very easy to use. Small and lightweight. 
24815 I did order 2 of them..one for me and the other one as a gift..for my surprise my friend told me he got an empty box..with no pen inside..and was not able to replace it because it was after one month..and the box was outside US... 
24816 My original charger broke and I was luck to find this charger. It worked every bit as good as the original. I was very pleased in every way. 
24817 Works great with the app. The sound cuts in and out sometimes so it s hard to hear on the camera side. It might be when two people are watching it at the same time though. Pretty good quality to 
24818 This is a great camera. Could make due with a few advanced features, but I love it anyway :) 
24819 great product. helped immensely with my old slides. 
24820 Even brighter than I thought. Great deal. Thanks! 
24821 Not very good, it is loud and obnacious and it isn t very good quality. I DIDN T LIKE IT!! 
24822 Very nice lens. Used at sons baseball game standing at outfield fence 200 to 220 feet away. 
24823 Works GREAT 
24824 Works well 
24825 It s great thanks 
24826 Works great and easy to install. 
24827 Keeping my Nikon cameras powered on all my adventures! 
24828 I haven t got much use for it yet but I can see how it adds extra protection and would make it more visible if I were to ever drop the camera in the water, snow, etc. Good quality product. 
24829 great little camera, comes with all you need to use it. 
24830 Terrible. DO NOT BUY. Most do not even work. Pretty sure most of these reviews are not real. 
24831 The battery was exactly as described and arrived on-time in appropriate packaging. 
24832 Great strap for half the price of the black rabbit. I have used this on numbers of shoot and not have any issue with this strap. Stays in place all day even with a long lens on the camera. Again, can t beat the price. 
24833 The first really thin filter that lives up to expections. Recommended. 
24834 Actually used to give my pinhole USB webcam a wider field of view since clip held lens over it good. It also worked on my cell phone so I plan to get another. 
24835 Great product 
24836 These are too big for a back pocket but if I move lighting equipment I have them with me and they help a lot. 
24837 We ve had this product for 1 week. The charger and batteries work well. Only think that was a bit challenging was I really had to push to get the batteries to fit into the charger the first time. 
24838 Perfectly cute for a party or for photography props! They came with popsicle sticks to stick on to them which is way better than the small sticks that come with other paper photo props! Even came with chalk! 
24839 Battery inserts are a bit fumbly, but so far this device has performed great. As advertised. 
24840 Very good pictures and video quality. Price right for the product, very happy with the purchase. 
24841 So far so good.It took me less than 15minutes to get the camera up and streaming to my IPhone. The picture was crisp and colors were true. 
24842 I wish this was more robust, the top keep coming off when I use it.... 
24843 I have noticed no difference as far as I can tell at this point. I received them a week ago and have used them all this week shooting. Time will tell if they hold up. But the price is right! I have to say that. 
24844 Good batteries. I think they lose charge just a teensy bit faster than I d prefer, but they re good, solid products. 
24845 Perfect airline case for tripods, light stands, chargers, clothes, and umbrellas. Never gotten charged oversized either! 
24846 As advertised. 
24847 network browsing not possable due to ie 8 not supported unless you mak your computer less secure no updates avlaable 
24848 Perfect replacement for our dead mic at a great price. 
24849 This is the second on and still very happy, have purchased more to add to system. Good clarity and color. 
24850 Omg this lens is awesome I love taking nature pictures. I got it today couldn t wait to get it out of the box 
24851 I have used them for a year now & like it! 
24852 Excellent item for the cost 
24853 Works great 
24854 AS expected 
24855 Super versatile! Great product! 
24856 Came in the mail quickly and did not disappoint. 
24857 Fast service, product as described. Would do biz, again. 
24858 was a gift for a family member 
24859 Excellent product. Received the product faster than expected and the video and picture quality are great especially for the price. 
24860 Holds the GoPro just right 
24861 The bag is nice, but the top strap broke a few days after I started using it while on vacation. 
24862 They are what they are but the video quality isn t that great compared to my shorter cords. I thought my camera was going so I swapped it and same thing. 
24863 Very happy with it! Charges my nikon d3100 like a dream. 
24864 After 1 month of use, the anchor loop that the shoulder strap attaches to tore from the bag causing it to drop. Luckily none of my brand new gear was damaged. 5 starts to Amazon for processing my return and refund. 
24865 Can be difficult to use but definitely a great buy for the money. just takes some getting used to 
24866 loved the package deal 
24867 Compact lens and a must have addition for EOS M owners....makes the camera really portable. 
24868 Great set has everthing you need to keep your camera clean 
24869 The top is slightly crooked but maybe that s just me. Other than that it s really good. Especially for $15 
24870 Works as advertised. I installed most of them outdoors under my eaves and more than one year later all work just like new! 
24871 Great! Thank you very much....... 
24872 return 
24873 Quadcopter mount-- a bit heavey for flying--great photos--just under Mobius quality. 
24874 Gift for my granddaughter. She loved it! 
24875 It works well! 
24876 Neat idea, but this camera kept shutting itself off. That makes it useless. I contacted Polaroid, and they said that the problem was with the brand of SD card. That may be, but the camera should work with any card, especially a top name brand. 
24877 Liking this camera.... For the price I am impressed... 
24878 Getting shadow from this so still on the fence. maybe ill actually learn how to use it some day. lol 
24879 The picture quality is excellent, even with the night vision, FTP on wireless works very well too, love the camera and would like to recommend this to anyone. 
24880 Absolutely fell in love with the 6D the moment I had it in my hands. Just what I needed to enter into full frame. A great upgrade from the Canon Rebel Series. 
24881 Given as gift, recipient loved it. 
24882 Its a nice little lens, great under dark light but does not extend as far as I want that is why my 18-50 is probably what I will stick with. 
24883 I like it 
24884 It was the wrong charger. 
24885 NICE CAMERA WITH VERY CLEAR PICTURE. INSTALLED EASILY. GOOD LENSE FOR GENERAL &#34;AROUND THE HOUSE&#34; PLACEMENT. 
24886 Works great. 
24887 This kit has everything I need to have many options when using my go pro Hero 3 Silver 
24888 This set brought everything I need to introduce my students to electronics. 
24889 A birthday gift for my husband. He really enjoys the camera. Shipping was on time and in good shape. It was a very successful purchase. 
24890 Poor quality product, was broken when received. 
24891 Great product, it worked great! I recommend it highly! 
24892 It would be nice if the instructions made any sense. 
24893 Sensitive as it should be 
24894 Works great with my canon video camera 
24895 The bag was not the same as in the picture nor the ones previous buyers had. Besides that and the bag being a bit snug for my Canon, it is a good case. 
24896 Works great and shipped in a timely fashion! 
24897 We love the bag it is able to carry all the things for our camera. Shipping was awesome. 
24898 excellent 
24899 Much more durable than other third party eye cups! 
24900 Very efficient and they charge fast. Definitely a great comparison to the name brand of Canon. 
24901 I got to use it ONCE and it completely stopped working. Needless to say, I m a bit pissed about that. 
24902 The strap is neoprene. I have no confidence in it not wearing and breaking suddenly. I replaced it. 
24903 Cameras are useless without extra light at night. 
24904 Great little tripod. Even supports the weight of my Canon T5i with a large macro lens attached. Very handy for those quick shots that don t work well hand-held. 
24905 Battery came in fast and it works great. Ordered another one and that one works great. Would recommend the seller and the batteries. 
24906 Works well with the most Acra-Swiss mounts... nice compact design doesn t block battery door on most of my cameras. 
24907 This is an amazing camera bag. Its thick and durable. It has lots of compartments for your camera and lens. Great space for extra batteries and accessories. My fiancé loves it. well worth the extra few dollars. 
24908 Fits my camera perfectly. Very compact and high quality. I love the gray color! 
24909 Nice set 
24910 Can t get it to work. Long hours on the phone with D-link. It functions, but not as Dliink advertises. 
24911 Great replacement 
24912 Great lens! Takes nice sharp photos. It s a heavier lens so it takes some time to get used to. Using a tripod or upping the shutter speed will eliminate any camera shake. I use this lens more than I thought I would. Very happy with this purchase. 
24913 Worked awesome great extinsion for my rgbw led light strip. It s supposed to be for cameras but this power extinsion works like a charm for what I needed for great purchase 
24914 My old cord was giving me trouble this one seems real nice no trouble 
24915 Everything I wanted and more! Very good deal for the price. 
24916 I ve played with it a bit and I honestly can t say i notice a difference between my internal and external on my Mark II. I heard the Rode Video Mic Pro is the way to go if you want an honest good sound. 
24917 Did not work, gave my money away :( 
24918 Excellet 
24919 Great deal on this system. Very easy to set up and use. Very easy to set up the mobile app on iPhones. Just download the app and scan the QR code.... It instantly connects! Very helpful support forum on the Amcrest website. 
24920 Works perfect 
24921 A gift for my wife and she loves it. 
24922 ar004214 Great customer service, they walked me thru the set up and got everything working like it should. 
24923 Sick!!! 
24924 So happy with my new hard to find battery for my Nikon Cool Pix Camera! 
24925 If you have a gopro you need spare batteries. I ve used Wasabi for a hero3 and now for my hero4. I don t really notice any amazingly longer runtime, but they work and are dependable. Best part is the charger that comes with, very convenient 
24926 For the price they are fine, but they don t really fit exactly. If you are easy on them the work fairly ok 
24927 Super well made item. Great price! 
24928 just okay some lenses are usless 
24929 work great 
24930 Just as expected 
24931 Perfect! 
24932 Great Product will buy again. 
24933 All work perfectly with my new go pro hero 4. Every bit of kit feels nice and solid and well made. This would certainly meet the needs of most thrill seekers. 
24934 The bag holds my camera equipment but just did not expected to be so big 
24935 Good price fast delivery 
24936 Great piece of equipment, well built and filters as it should. 
24937 Nice product! Great for hiking. Just attach to bag while you hike and charge your batteries. I would recommend it to anyone. 
24938 NEEDED SUPPLIES 
24939 Got this camera for my son who is studying photojournalism. He loves this camera. 
24940 Seems way less than 52. 
24941 I am always pleased with the Sigma filters. 
24942 Worked as expected, easy to install. 
24943 Perfect! Hold flash, diffusion dome, spare batteries and has a belt loop. Nice, solid, sturdy durable fabric. Expect to use it for years to come 
24944 bgs. 
24945 very convenient in certain situations. 
24946 I purchased two of these and bought a third one today! Great product. 
24947 Good product, delivery on times, I like it ! 
24948 broke after 3 months and i can t find a warranty 
24949 This was my first reflector purchase and it looks just like the picture. I don t think the material is flimsy, but I am not hard on equipment either. 
24950 This is a very nice storage case. I would repurchase again. 
24951 Came rapidly and on-time. Exactly as advertised. I am impressed with the instruction material that came with it. There is little else that you might want to head out prospecting. 
24952 Perfect as shown, thank you. 
24953 tks 
24954 A+ great doing business with you. Great product. 
24955 worked great on raining days in canada 
24956 Advertised as wireless, but only works when hard wired to the other speaker....useless. I returned it. 
24957 as expected 
24958 Not very good quality batteries. Don t hold near as good a charge as name brand batteries. 
24959 For the a7rII. Fits perfectly. No compatibility errors with the battery. Both battery icons appear on top right corner. Looks and feels like the camera body and grip. All custom buttons, wheel, and AF/MF buttons function correctly. Meike Battery Pack. $340 cheaper than original. 
24960 Service was great, arrived on time but after a day of use it broke, it could ve been that I was over using it but my advice is just be careful with it 
24961 These little pieces make a big difference, great experience from seller! 
24962 Great product and good price 
24963 i can t get the thing to record. some how when i got it to work it won t play on my computer. i find it junk. 
24964 Thank you 
24965 Easy to install. Easy to use. Great pics! Will buy another. 
24966 It works so well, I love this. 
24967 I LOVE this lens! Not great in low light without a tripod because there s no stabilizer for shake but if you re outside, it s great for the price! 
24968 Great stand sets up quickly, and supports large modifiers well. If weight is a consideration, this beast is heavy. 
24969 Great price and fast shipping. Works fine with my Nikon D3200. 
24970 Great for party use you don t have to be a professional to use. Takes excellent pics with little effort. 
24971 Very NICE 
24972 This film is beautiful and I could not be happier with it! 
24973 Loves that it doesn t twist once the gopro is attached 
24974 A++++++++ 
24975 Good 
24976 probably just wasted money on this. 
24977 Had to tighten spring clip to hold wire in! 
24978 Very easy to use and clear. 
24979 Perfect was what i need 
24980 Love the camera works great outdoors. Love the WFI to send pictures to my tablet or computer. 
24981 Works great but sometimes freezes and has to be restarted - great value for money! 
24982 works great ,fast shipping 
24983 Didn t even work... WTF 
24984 Not as useful as I thought it was going to be. 
24985 It s good to have these for Cloud functionality. However, I thought this can be used as a NAS. It s basically a personal cloud storage if you re trying to find one. 
24986 Good battery at a good price 
24987 Holds up just like the one that came with my D5300! 
24988 turn nob past first click to switch on, but the light only comes on when turn 1/3 of the way on. so the range is only 2/3. 
24989 Got for my Canon Rebel T3i. Works great!! Great price as well! 
24990 Even when moving the lens around to optimal placing over the camera, the photo quality is terrible. 
24991 I bought a 7mm one and find myself using my 32mm omni much more, go figure. Eye relief is better than regular omni plossl eps at the shorter focal lengths.but it is quite large and heavy, be ready to rescue and rebalance your rig if needed. 
24992 Perfect, exactly as described. 
24993 Good. Does the job 
24994 POS, will not even show up when plugged into computer. Garbage 
24995 Super incroyable 
24996 Nice one I use it for birding to get easier focus in which part in suspect i want 
24997 Gives me the extra battery life I need when using my GoPro while traveling. I also love all the adapters and the car charger. I travel internationally frequently and this gives me the ability to take my GoPro anywhere. Thanks, Wasabi! 
24998 Works great and Good price 
24999 Mine worked fine for two years and then out of the blue they both quit. Will not reset or connect to wifi anymore. Philips tech support couldn t do a thing. 
25000 Excellent quality and super fast shipping! 
25001 one of teh best thing i ever got!! 
25002 Very Good 
25003 It se a grate camera!! 
25004 The lens lid barely fits with the filter on, so I have to be really careful not to lose the lid. 
25005 Great replacement and very affordable 
25006 Love the camera! 
25007 Like the frame picture display and thickness (so thin). Still work OK except once a while it shutdown by itself and I cannot turn it on except unplug and plug in again. Like the motion sensor and USB flash drive support. 
25008 This is not made of leather! 
25009 Good product for the $$ 
25010 as advertised 
25011 convenient product for system setup 
25012 Love this purchase! heavy duty tripod, is perfect 
25013 The housing feels weak and I have to constantly adjust specially on roller coasters. 
25014 These batteries seem to last about 2/3 s of the time the original camera battery does. 
25015 good stuff saves lots of time 
25016 Very Nice piece of equipment. Although refurbished it works as new. 
25017 very nice telescope but if you are not gonna leave it put together somewhere, setting up can be a pain. 
25018 Nice camera. Did need some Tech Support to get my remote set up. Vincent at Foscam Tech Support is AWESOME! He definitely knows what he is doing! 
25019 Good range, good picture. For the price the was a pretty good setup 
25020 It s a good protector for the lens, I use the camara for motocycle ride ando for car racing, so it is indispensable to protect your lens.it s crystal clear. 
25021 This is amazing I love the one of the best purchases I have made in a while! 
25022 Just as shown 
25023 Camera was very easy to set up. The image is clear. Features operate great. I now have 5 of there. The only drawback is that my computer slows down to a crawl when I have all 5 cameras up and running. Otherwise they nice and give me peace of mind. 
25024 This one is OK 
25025 As advertised. 
25026 Love this case. I bought it to carry my Panasonic Lumix FZ200. It fits perfectly, and I love the side compartment s. They fit an extra battery and memory card. 
25027 It s awesome. 
25028 Great quality quick shipping! 
25029 It s not so steady. Head strap and chest belt both. 
25030 Received it and works so far 
25031 Awesome. I use with BlueIris via wireless connection and get perfect video with no packet loss. (4000K, CBR, 20fps, 2048x1536, audio) Lot s of features for the money. These can hidden fairly easily into various nick-nacks around the home. 
25032 good 
25033 arrived before shipping estimate. good product 
25034 Nice lens! 
25035 Great 
25036 exactly what I needed. 
25037 I love this camera so much. I was a little worried when I ordered it cause there isn t any reviews but im glade I did cause its an amazing camera! you can take action pictures and they turn out great I love it! 
25038 Camera do not match photo. IR leds are not black like they are in photo. they are white. quality was bad. cheap joints and felt very poorly made. 
25039 I ve only used several of the accessories but they seem to perform reasonably well. 
25040 Got this thing for my hero3+ and was not disappointed. I really love the locking feature and the color makes it pop. Pretty sturdy for a gopole. Price is reasonable too 
25041 Product arrived promptly and exactly as described. 
25042 Works great 
25043 The batteries last as long as the original battery. I have found that having 3 batteries is plenty for most recordings. This gives you 3 hours of recording time with the Go Pro Hero Silver. 
25044 The stick itself is ok, but after a few uses during diving, appropriately cleaning it of saltwater and letting it dry, it s so rusted at the pole extension points and the screw that it leaves rust all over my hands, and is almost impossible to extend out now. 
25045 They work great with the Canon EOS Rebel camera 
25046 best idea ever 
25047 Not good, lens didn t focus well, most times it will go back and forth without focusing. When it did focus the pictures where ok, not great. The motor is slow and left me not impressed. 
25048 Purchased as a gift for a talented young photographer. No complaints from recipient. Request for IS lens important to him for taking video captures with unit. Canon or Nikon. Lexus or Infinity. Same argument. I have been a Canon user since 1972. 
25049 WORKED GOOD FOR 2 WEEKS 
25050 GREAT PRICE, GOT IT FAST! 
25051 Worked as advertised. Saved $. 
25052 Pros: Roomy, room to fit mroe than 1 tripod. Cons: Zipper broke after a year. Rating of 1 star because with a broken zipper its basically useless Would NOT recommend based on my experience.. 
25053 poorly made, first 2 broke when putting on lens 
25054 Fast Shipping but Zmodo is bad quality :( 
25055 Good in low light conditions. Nikon still needs to improve the lense covers. 
25056 Wonderful!Great quality! 
25057 THE best camera for vlogging. The wide angle (although fisheye) is very good quality and has many options when it comes to filming. The best part about this though is the AUDIO. Perfect sound 100% of the time, it is crazy how well the microphones work. 
25058 very nice way to view your photos.but the adaptor needs to be replace.it will stop the photo slide,the clock will also stop running.,the frame is very nice with a nice matting. 
25059 The RX 100 CAMERA is excellent. Some of the items that would come with the camera were missing (tripod), I have received 3 batteries instead of one, and a kit for cleaning the lenses that was not listed in the package I have bought. 
25060 good 
25061 great for photography back up. 
25062 This didn t work for me. The corners of the photo was shaded. Destroyed use of pictures. Be forewarned. 
25063 Glare... useless! 
25064 The battery can be overcharged? If you charge longer than 1 hour at 15 minutes, it seems to burn up the battery. 
25065 great gift! 
25066 I really like the timer and the resolution was so good, I ordered an extra pair. 
25067 a bit thin .. 
25068 great 
25069 First time out of the box...lines through the screen. SO disappointed with this product. 
25070 does the intended job, however would have been better if came with the actual bolt/screw so not having to swap out everything when needing to swap out 
25071 Flimsy. Can t hold my camera. 
25072 No problems 
25073 fits my camaer and woks as expected 
25074 A gift- but much appreciated. 
25075 Does what it s supposed to go, however if you take your Micro SD card and plug it straight to your laptop it makes transferring photos a lot quicker than just plugin the camera to your PC via usb. 
25076 i received with good condition and I m surprised because I find extra flash with it .....thank you 
25077 for a bearing slider at this price you can t complain. holds well, little bit of a drag on heavier cameras but overall great buy! 
25078 Works well, easy to install, kept track of home and horses while on vacation. Great to have peace of mind while not at home!! 
25079 Readout of battery levels different from camera screen indication. 2nd battery stop charging and become unrecognised after a while. 
25080 This is about the 4th or 5th one I have purchased. I love the price and it s the only camera I can find with an actual view finder for those sunny days when you can t see diddly on the screen. 
25081 Camera looked NIB but would not power on. I have ordered this twice and had the same problem with both. The first one worked for 10 minutes and then never again. Not the camera for me. 
25082 Its has little pouches on the inside for extra SD cards or at least 50$ in singles with out bothering the camera or making it difficult to close 
25083 Good product!!! It is working good, I m going to continue using it for a few weeks, so I ll can do an interensting review 
25084 These worked great 
25085 Great camera. Lots of features. One thing to remember: You only use the provided hardwired Ethernet cable to hook to your modem in order to setup the camera and then you disconnect it for wireless capability. Can be placed anywhere. Needs electrical outlet. Works great with android Samsung S5. 
25086 Nice tight fit. 
25087 Wish you could take off the strap. Otherwise works great. 
25088 Exactly a replacement for my old one. Delivered in 4 days, Excellent 5 Star 
25089 Easy to install, an happy with this purchase 
25090 I DO NOT KNOW WHO TO USE THAT ITEM meca1456@netzero.com THANK 
25091 Bought this to full my 8 ch Sannce DVR and work great 
25092 great product 
25093 AAA 
25094 Works well 
25095 This product is pure garbage. Would not work for me on android app or windows desktop app. Instructions are in broken English and the windows desktop app set off Korean language warnings from my firewall. I recommend not purchasing this. 
25096 Junk item! Didn t work, had to get Amazon involved before anything was done about it 
25097 Used them several times on the standard camera tripod mounting screw. Works well and I expect they will last a lifetime. 
25098 Very useful. 
25099 Works great, with the A6000 
25100 This is great! I found a YouTube video to show me how to set it up because it doesn t come with clear instructions, but it s a great product. 
25101 good value 
25102 Would have preferred a slightly larger interior. only holds one lens. But does hold all other gear - extra memory cards and batteries. 
25103 Great quality, mounts on tripod with tripod adaptor for ease of viewing distant objects or the stars and planets. 
25104 So far only 2 of the batteries hold a charge. Will update later. 
25105 worked great 
25106 Holds up well , good usage 
25107 Fits the camera well. Not much room for extras. Maybe an extra battery and memory card. Should pack well and protect camera. 
25108 Not a L series that s for sure... 
25109 Really great little mount for 3m roku projector. Durable and flexible, I only wish it were slightly longer legged. 
25110 I bought this remote for my GoPro Hero4 and it works great! Lost connectivity under water if you are more than a foot or so away from the camera but otherwise it was awesome! 
25111 Item start up the first time and would not start since. Have to return for repair/replacement. For the price, it should have this kind of of problems. Does not recommend until problem is solved. 
25112 The only problem I ve had is you can t get everything back in the case. Everything else has been great. 
25113 great tripod!! I highly recommend it!! 
25114 Both tripods broke, remote does not work, HDMI cord would not work, camera bag is big enough for the camera itself (no lens included) and batteries each lasted a good 45 minutes. 
25115 good 
25116 Awesome Attachment to my DSLR 
25117 This item is exactly what I wanted. 
25118 Took them to Yellowstone and loved them. Looking forward to using them this fall in the woods. 
25119 Everything you need is in this pack 
25120 Im ok with perfomance not as clear as I would exspect but they do work good. 
25121 This item was just what I was looking for. 
25122 Construction is a bit flimsy but for the price...WELL WORTH IT! 
25123 superb product. as described and perfect fit. 
25124 installed without a hitch. video segments for each system part is clear. appears to be a great system for the price. 
25125 As expected and loving it! Due to the padding you may run out of room if your using it as a camera/laptop bag. 
25126 works great 
25127 This is GREAT! Great Battery and I LOVE it has 12v USA Household Plug and has a Car Charger Built-In Option too! High Quality! 
25128 Fantastic! I love that this is mechanical and I don t have to worry about yet another battery running out. 
25129 good, 
25130 Everything I wanted. Great product for the price. 
25131 Worked as well as original Canon battery. Holds charge for a shorter time, but was expected and was long enough to not cause any problem. Worth the price. 
25132 More faded looking in person Top picture was taken without flash on an overcast day Book was taken with flash inside. Also was my first picture taken. Would like to know if I m doing anything wrong A real waste of money. was not happy with this product 
25133 Really well made and charges my batteries very fast. Had to have a second charger for the road when taking a lot of pictures and need batteries fully charged over a short time. 
25134 No complaints. 
25135 Kenneth at Foscam was very helpful in setting up my camera. He set it up via remote access in just a few minutes. very pleased with their support. 
25136 Perfect replacements for the battery that came with my camcorder. Could not ask for better. 
25137 So good 
25138 It was perfect, I did 3 weeks in Europe and I loved this bag every minute I used it. It held everything I could carry from passports to wallet to cameras and there was plenty of space for extra things. 
25139 They seem to work fine. They come in a nice box. Great Buy 
25140 Wonderful flash for the money. Serves my purposes perfectly. 
25141 Excellent but you may need a fitting/bushing so check the specs 
25142 LOVE this lnes! Amazing effects, wonderful quality & clarity, such a great range and extremely affordable compared to the Nikon 300MM 
25143 Love the strap. Comfortable and much longer than one that comes with the camera. 
25144 Works great with my copper river cleaning swabs! 
25145 ordered it august 10th and received it 3 days later. the shipping was obviously very fast. i love this camera so so much. i bought the used one and it is in amazing. the camera looks like its new. i just love this camera! 
25146 Nice package, needed battery for a camera. Ordered it since cheaper than batteries alone, happily surprised to find a charger that runs on 110v and 12v 
25147 Even freebie minitripod and kens cleaning kit. All very practical and welcome. Batteries work as well as factory batteries. 
25148 Works great! 
25149 Received the filter as described and promptly. Fits perfectly and is good quality. 
25150 Delivered on time. Perfect fit for camera and lens. 
25151 It s sturdy, good quality and how it floats in both fresh and salt water makes all the difference. 
25152 Great light for the price! Super bright! 
25153 small, can not fit 2 full frame camera with L lens 
25154 Got these as spares. Can t be happier! 
25155 Works well, great price. I m pleased. 
25156 I like it very much. 
25157 Can t beat it for the price. It works and setup is quick and easy. 
25158 Works good! 
25159 delivered as promised. great condition 
25160 This strap helps carrying the weight of my camera. Having it hang as a cross body is much more comfortable. Great idea!! 
25161 This camera is for my granddaughter & she loves it. It arrived promptly & it is just as advertised. The picture quality is great under water &. Well worth the price. 
25162 Hate it...threw it in the trash, actually. It kept falling off and I was gonna lose it anyways. Save your bucks for one made by Cannon. 
25163 Works like a charm!!!! 
25164 Met my expectations fro protection of the camera body. The flash rail protection flap doesn t seem to stay on but other than that it fit well. 
25165 didn t fit my camera! 
25166 Great fit 
25167 For working on a studio, it make sense to have it connected. However, when working on portraits, it would turn cumbersome. I would recommend it for product photo. 
25168 I ordered a T-ring to Micro 4/3 adapter. One side is T-ring, but the other side is NOT Micro 4/3. It s for some other lens mount but it isn t labeled so I don t know what mount it actually is for. Definitely not Micro 4/3 though. 
25169 Very good 
25170 This lens cap was attached by a stick on button which can easily be dislodged. 
25171 The case is nice but it arrived smelling terrible, like it had been in a damp basement for many years. I was able to watch some of the smell out but I will probably just throw it out at this point. 
25172 Not nothing like you say it was. 
25173 The case is not a convenient way to store the GoPro and all its accessories. It is not versatile enough to allow everything to fit in an easily accessible fashion. 
25174 Good item 
25175 This product is perfectly suitable for a GoPro HERO 3+ Silver Edition which I own. It fits all of my accessories which include: a selfie stick, chest mount, head mount, charging cable, teather, surfing mounts, and other small accessories. 
25176 Great, no lag, you can see what you are capturing. 
25177 Took it with me on vacation and it was very easy to handle ....light weight....and kept my camera in good condition 
25178 Works well as aa standby battery.. 
25179 Have not figured out all the buttons yet but seems to be working well. My photos are very nice. 
25180 The picture is crystal clear and couldn t have asked for more. Great quality. 
25181 This is cool little camera 
25182 Great system for the price. I wish the zoom function was better. The over all picture is not the greatest but it will do. 
25183 Works once in a while 
25184 One of the camera is out of service 
25185 It wasn t as easy to set up as I thought. But, seems to take good pictures in the Easy Mode. 
25186 too complicated, it is a 2 piece lens hood 
25187 I was so excited that this was the exact cable I needed to download my pictures. It came quickly and was very reasonable. 
25188 Cameras work great. Would have been 5 stars but one of the power cords was defective. Had to contact company through Amazon. They did mail a new power cord so now all three cameras operational. Been using for about three weeks, no problems, very pleased with picture quality. 
25189 I got one of these ! It s only lasted one year before the DVR stopped working 
25190 So I m going to return it and see if they will replace it ! I will change my review if they replace it! 
25191 No charger and no battery came with the item I order. 
25192 Not happy that I got it and it s broken - seriously needed it for holiday and I m leaving the next day !!!! 
25193 Makes the grip on the X100s far more secure and comfortable. I feel like I am using a Leica again! Stays permanently mounted on my camera as I don t use an external flash or other things in the hotshoe. For me it is a must-have for this style camera. 
25194 Ok not very practical 
25195 Not a good product. I sent it back 
25196 Very well price for the unit. Thanks. 
25197 Great set at good price 
25198 Somewhat difficult to access software, and difficult to find setting to NOT automatically &#34;share&#34; your pictures with all online applications upon download. Still have not figured out how to find the auto-focus setting. 
25199 This is a great camera for the price. Almost endless possibilities. 
25200 Just like the Orig. canon cap 
25201 Works great. 
25202 This is my go-to strap! The clip that came with it ended up breaking but I purchased a swivel to attach to my body and it works great. Have used this one for years. Highly recommend. 
25203 This hard case is well protected my Instax printer. Like it. 
25204 So far so good after a couple charges 
25205 Thoroughly pleased with the binoculars. Equally happy that I got them at a great price! 
25206 Very good item. 
25207 Fits our new little camera perfectly! My husband carries it on his belt. Very convenient! 
25208 Must have! Great addition and easy to install. 
25209 Battery works great with my Lumix G6. Similar performance to original branded battery. Fast charging also. Great Product so far. 
25210 Very good product. Had to wait a couple weeks and they came from So. Ca. I m just upstate. 
25211 captures motion only occasionally. 
25212 Adorable well packed great books included to give advice can t wait to use it 
25213 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jha2Vzh7oU Have a look see These pages are so inspirational they have motivated me to write so many new songs and create many new videos which I post on Youtube I m only sorry you don t have a larger selection. 
25214 It is what it is 
25215 works ok but too much surface area for wearing on top of motorcycle helmet. It pushes the head back at anything over 65 mph. 
25216 Old school - solid made, great price. Worked on my Novation kit perfectly. 
25217 Its almost two weeks and I still do not have it working..directions are terrible 
25218 It works, so I can keep using my old nikon. 
25219 Very well designed and durable construction. 
25220 Easy to use wth lossless image quality. Trying to adjust features is difficult so I d recommend shooting in AV or Shutter priority. I d recommend for those that are looking to shoot underwater without breaking the bank. 
25221 The digital photos look great. Initially I had a remote control that did not work. I notified Aluratek and they sent a replacement remote control right away and now it works great. Not a bad photo frame for the money. Looking forward to adding more recent vacation photos. 
25222 WORKS LIKE A CHARM. When on vacation, I keep an extra battery in my bag and has come in handy. 
25223 Great thanks 
25224 Exactly what was needed - thank you 
25225 Fits perfectly at a reasonable price, recommended. 
25226 great replacement 
25227 Works as advertised. May not be quite the quality of the real thing, but for the $$$ it works good. 
25228 Haven t used yet, but looking forward to it. Makes setup a lot easier. 
25229 I would give 5 stars if it had blue tooth. Very nice camera for the price. 
25230 Works well. No problems. 
25231 I needed this for a baby monitor. It seems to stay put on the crib well and is easy to use. My only complaint is the top part with the screw moves around, making it hard to stay in place. It works fine overall for my use. 
25232 fits exactly on my canon s110 makes a good job 
25233 I Like it. 
25234 Works greeat 
25235 They are all great. 
25236 I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! SEND ME MORE HOLY CRAP IT WORKS GREAT! I STARTED MAKING VLOGS AND THIS CAMERA WORKS GREAT FOR IT 
25237 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
25238 i just received this is in the mail, so far testing it and playing with the camera it looks to be in good condition. it looks nice and neat. i haven t tested with film yet. when i do, I ll edit this review. 
25239 great quality! 
25240 I got my camera super fast. It s in awesome shape and does take nice pics. I haven t really used it very much yet. I just ordered an sd card so I ll be using it more and I m sure will have great things to say. 
25241 We love the picture. The only thing which is different from what I read from the reviews was that the flash needs be manually instead of manually activated. 
25242 My camera arrived without a sad card. Your product information did not specify that I had to supply one. Stephen K. 
25243 I have been purchasing Lexerd screen protectors for my various cameras over the years and did so again recently for my new Canon PowerShot G16. Once again, the screen protector applied easily and served me well. I highly recommend Lexerd. 
25244 exactly what i needed. very happy with the purchase. thank you! 
25245 Very nice LED variable intensity light for tabletop, video and many other uses-runs very cool. If brand name would cost much more. 
25246 Ordered this for a birthday gift and it was perfect!!! Fun to be able to take pictures and share them too!!! My granddaughter loved it!!!! 
25247 Works great with the Manfrotto MK055XPRO3-3W! 
25248 Well built. 
25249 Awesome! however It would be better if I could host the images on my own website rather than having to share through facebook that then links to Ricoh website. 
25250 Very expensive, the material is fragil and one leg was stuck. I really expected more for this price. 
25251 Simple, but roomy and usable, especially for the price. 
25252 Had trouble with Motion Detection setup. Quick call and with remote connect, Walter had me going in no time..GREAT product and support.! 
25253 Don t trust this on the outside of a moving vehicle. I had it set up on the inside of my windshield and the suction cup falls off even during normal driving conditions. 
25254 Great deal. I ll never run out of batteries. 
25255 wish I had researched a little more and got the next level up. no user friendly when it comes to moving videos to computer. 
25256 It gives you a web site that throws you off you CAN NOT connect. The instructions a joke. you pull the company up on the web everything is in Chinese, I will never order from ELEC again. 
25257 Works awesome, charges fast and the best part is I can charge my batteries in the truck and in my camper when we area camping. Love it! 
25258 Used tis to mount my KK2 board on. Works great for ante-vibe 
25259 Tripod I received is not the one pictured 
25260 Nice little point and shoot. Some buttons on the small side but once you find them it takes great pics! 
25261 Was broken when i got it. Cannot control setting. Wheel was missing 
25262 wrong size 
25263 Great product. Worked exactly as described. The video is very good, also tech support is very good and helpful. Picture quality is great even at night. I can view the live screen on my iPhone/iPad with 4G network when I m away from home where no WiFi is available. 
25264 The PZ0420M camera is lighter and smaller than the more prevelant 32mm board cameras. Quality is excellent and RunCam/SecurityCamera2000 supports it well. Camera is very durable used on a 250 racing quad that crashes frequently. 
25265 I LOVE IT 
25266 Item does not work at all. Came with no directions. Complete junk 
25267 Item came as promised and contains a number of useful items. I would buy from seller again. 
25268 Camera will not work for more than 24 hours without needing a power cycle 
25269 Love it!!, really big props!! 
25270 Perfect for my needs as a wedding cinematographer, it s a shame Sigma company don t make them anymore for Nikon. I was very lucky to find it here on Amazon. 
25271 I love this product very easy to use. I reached out to tech support and spoke to Walter who was very helpful setting up the camera 
25272 Great product! Light weight and durable. Love the water proof carrying bag! 
25273 Works great with real Gopro however it is advertised to fit the DBPOWER camera and the batteries are not the same. No sweat off of my back as I returned that piece of junk and got the real thing! 
25274 Favorite camera 
25275 Could not program the alarm had no instructions to program it 
25276 This lens is a beast. Plus it came two days before expected. 
25277 It performs as advertised and as expected. 
25278 WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME, YOU CAN SEE BETTER WITH THE MOON LIGHT ALONE ! 
25279 Great lens. 
25280 great value and excellent product 
25281 Love it. 
25282 Seems to be overpriced for what you get, but it works quite well. However, it will not remove some stubborn dust particles. Also, you may need to use it a number of times before the sensor is clear of dust. 
25283 Great add to my lighting setup 
25284 Great buy for the money. 
25285 These are excellent devices. I mounted my cameras and now I feel quite secure because I can see 180 degrees around the place. 
25286 exactly what i needed 
25287 not 2000w and terrible to put together and put away. 
25288 Small for sony alpha a6000 + lens 
25289 PERFECT, just what the parents wanted….bought for a baby shower 
25290 This does not work. It was an unfortunate buy, and I was too lazy to return it. Bye-bye money. 
25291 great price. Primary batter ran low at the OC Fair.... could have been a nightmare but having two addition battery let me enjoy the cutting. 
25292 Worked well should ve gone bigger 
25293 LOVE LOVE LOVE they work great!!!!!!!!!!! 
25294 After ordering it I found my original charger and the new one is of the same quality if not better! I now have a spare! ( always good to have on hand...) 
25295 Didn t work the minute it was plugged in... crap product. 
25296 works great i will be getting more for my other cases 
25297 haven t use it yet but yes, its a good buy 
25298 It works well, the image quality is good, and the night vision is super.I love this camera. 
25299 Worked intermittingly. 
25300 It is a nice carry case but I have no use for it now. 
25301 Excelente. 
25302 Shoots very great images, no problem thus far. 
25303 Perfect size to fit spare batteries, charger, cables and a few small accessories for a quick on the go shoot. Good quality, will buy more of these products when needed. Highly recommended for the great price. 
25304 It never worked. 
25305 Poor quality pictures most were blurry and didn t come anywhere close to the beautiful ocean life colors 
25306 Item works perfect, but Amazons idea of Guaranteed delivery dates really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 
25307 Works well with Canon Camera. 
25308 batteries to large for camera kept popping out couldn t close case 
25309 Used the batteries and charger on recent cruise and everything functioned very well! Delivery was fast as advertised, thanks. 
25310 awesome camera!! my kids love it :) they really love getting the picture immediately and so do I. the picture quality is great for an instant camera! 
25311 very good.... but the shipping is very slow...... 
25312 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
25313 It came folded not rolled could not get creases out very nice quality other than that. 
25314 holds my cannon and the charger. great! 
25315 Just perfect replacemment. 
25316 Highly visible and cares weight of camera. 
25317 Useful. Produces a low hiss. Watch out for the battery, if it becomes low, the mic will make these small pops during your recording. You have to change out your battery if this is the case. Low battery indicator won t help because it doesn t meet the threshold. 
25318 Product worked for about two months and then refused to work even after new batteries were installed. I m not sure if its the receiver or the transmitter. Never the less nothing works after a very short period of time. 
25319 Sturdy way to hold my flash!! 
25320 very pleased with the batteries. shipped on time. 
25321 Great fit... 
25322 Great price for what it can do. Works great as a back up to original charger. But it does get a bit hot. The added bonous is the ability to charge my battery in the car. I do not know how I lived without this feature before. 
25323 This is a good bag. I m using it for a Nikon camera. Everything fits in perfectly. 
25324 excelent 
25325 good quality 
25326 I love it... 
25327 Great product and great delivery. 
25328 Works just fine! 
25329 Works great with the battery from our camera. Delivered on time 
25330 Very satisfied with this tripod for the price. Quality is good, I m not sure if the bubble levels are accurate. Easy loading mount, ball head moves well - doesn t seem too cheap. Definitely recommended. 
25331 Great value, very pleased 
25332 very good 
25333 needs an adaptor 
25334 I have a canon t3i which I use with a 150-600mm lens. Was looking for a tripod that would handle the weight of the combination of camera and lens. This tripod can handle the weight. Very happy with it. 
25335 great seller - delivered as promised! 
25336 These batteries last forever! I like these better than Sonys rip off batteries at $80 a piece, seriously what were they thinking. 
25337 Works well so far, plastic camera mount could be a little more robust, but the quality does match the price-point. With careful intermittent use it shouldn t be a problem. You get what you pay for with this one. 
25338 Nice 
25339 s***!!!!! doesnt slide smooth. 
25340 the best ever! 
25341 Can t beat this price. Recharges the Wasabi and the GoPro branded batteries with no issues so I always have two available. 
25342 fit perfect on my canon EOS 70D! 
25343 Good price for peace of mind. Glad I haven t had to use it. 
25344 In combination with a recently purchased pistol grip tripod, it has provided excellent viewing / stargazing. 
25345 Very happy with the camera. Only problem I have is that it did not come with the memory chip. Other than that I was very satisfied with the purchase. 
25346 a little overprized but still love it! 
25347 Perfect....was exactly the device I needed. Like finding an old friend. Thanks. 
25348 Clearly a winner. Heliopan was my first, but seeing the quality, this is now my choice 
25349 These are useful! Happy! 
25350 An Excellent replacement for the one I lost. Rating: 5 of 5 The item was well packaged and came quickly. Arrived on time and was as described. Very good quality and excellent value for the money. 
25351 Hands down best little strap I ve used. Construction is flawless and materials are top quality. I ve used them for a year now in my wedding work and the have not left my fuji s side! 
25352 Nice reflector, it s me first one, but it was of a great use on the wedding day , can cover at least 4 people if used to diffuse the harsh light on a sunny day. The quality seems good. 
25353 Works fine, arrived in plenty of time for a vacation trip. 
25354 I mainly bought this kit for the UV filter, but I will use the other filters also. I keep a UV filter on my lenses all the time, mainly to protect them. The filter is cheaper to replace if damaged that your lenses! 
25355 It s not very high quality when handling, but once installed you can t tell it s fake or that it is cheaply made. I would buy again. 
25356 So far so good, working well. 
25357 Just happy to have a backup battery for my camera.. 
25358 Everything good! 
25359 Nice but a bit pricey, only gripe is the case only fits the iPad mini. Should have a cutout for iPad or iPad Air. 
25360 Wonderful works with my Sony Hdr-mv1 
25361 Poor quality. Adhesive last maybe a month. I took my camera on trip to Alaska. Some days were misty and protector will not stay on in that weather. 
25362 I use this light with my ENG Camera and Film Camera. It is a great tool for handheld cameras, especially in field production. I enjoy the product. 
25363 Works great. Lasts for 3 lacrosse games (on & off) no problem. No issues with the camera not recognizing it. Useful review? Let me know! 
25364 Very nice camera. Works as advertised 
25365 Great price super easy to locate controls. Only downside is there is no external power input. 
25366 bought it for a Nikon D90 that I use as a backup. actually wanted an SB-600 but Nikon no longer makes it. works great. 
25367 Like orig. 
25368 Perfect mate for the one I had in the battery expansion. 
25369 This item stopped working soon after we got it, and kodak has stopped making this product. Now I have a product that is broken and I cant get a replacement. 
25370 BAD picture, bad sound, cant go far...I would NOT recommend this product. 
25371 Super sturdy and we love it! 
25372 It sucks. I try instslling them but right after i turned then on they would start going off after like 3 seconds withought separating them 
25373 We installed this at the door in the garage, and it s motion-sensitive, so when we come home after dark, we can always see the keyhole for our deadbolt! 
25374 Met expectations. Nice. 
25375 I like this strap very well. It is of a very good quality. I highly recommend this! 
25376 Nice light case. 
25377 Solid product. Several adapters to attach things. And the legs are made well. 
25378 works as needed 
25379 Did not work as specified. WiFi from device to station would only work when within 20 feet. Would not work with Verizon FIOS landline. Returned it and purchased an alternate system which worked fine. 
25380 Set up was a breeze - it took about ten minutes. Picture quality and features are amazing. User manual needs to be shipped with the camera. GREAT VALUE$$$ 
25381 I have owned several Samsung cameras and thought this one would be work just as well. It does not. It is much slower and the flash acts like it takes a while to &#34;warm up&#34; and snap the picture. Would not order this particular model camera again. 
25382 Great! 
25383 Perfect for those long trips 
25384 Excellent bag for traveling with my Canon T3i along with two lenses and charger. 
25385 Compact Sony kit lens for the NEX series that works very well - sharp enough. 
25386 Great. 
25387 I used this with a Stellarvue eyepiece that comes with their 13x80 finder. I liked that it had a broad range of brightness down to the point where the red crosshairs were extremely faint. 
25388 REALLY WORKS 
25389 Got these on time. It looks exactly as it is in the photo. 
25390 This is AWFUL!! Live Video Failed after 2 days worked. Any Model 
25391 All models of this brand camera I bought failed. 
25392 A very good lens fro macro photography 
25393 Although it serves my needs I was misled in the description of the product where it said it was an aluminum case it is really made of plastic 
25394 It hasn t worked since the day I took it out of the box. 
25395 kinda cheap. but so is the price. 
25396 Solidly made, threads work smoothly. Good craftsmanship. 
25397 not as expected 
25398 very good 
25399 Works well 
25400 never did work 
25401 Everything came as expected and in time too...looking forward to buying more of your products. 
25402 Nice little pouch! Lens slips inn nicely. Plenty of padding too. 
25403 Was not sure about this speedlight but I took a chance and I am glad I could. Works in manual only but the output is easily adjustable, and has good powder. Will purchase another. 
25404 THIS CAMERA BUNDLE IS A GREAT VALUE 
25405 IT LOOKS LIKE AND HAS THE FEATURES OF MORE EXPENSIVE CAMERAS. PLUS THE BONUS OF AN EXTRA BATTERY AND ANOTHER CHARGER AND CORDS. VERY GOOD BUY!!!!!! 
25406 Not that good. Barely holds the camera in place. 
25407 best duster ever 
25408 excellent product , work good , easy install , good sound 
25409 didn t work with any of my speedlites 
25410 Fits all my go pro items in one little pouch 
25411 works very good for my cannon 10d 
25412 a great Little security camera loaded with exceptional features 
25413 Use it to carry .223 shells on my sling. 
25414 Having a really hard time understanding how to work it, the manual is way to small to read. 
25415 Great on time! 
25416 After the first week night vision stopped working. Now it connects when it wants to. Zero customers service!!! 
25417 Works good - but switches from color to black and white for some reason. 
25418 Batteries are good but they dont last as long as the one I got with my camera 
25419 The best quality fish eye equivalent for the price. Highly recommended. 
25420 Nice camera. I m still learning how to use it. 
25421 fast shipping. i love the design and very fit. if you are looking for a protector for your camera, this one is recommended. 
25422 This item works well so far but it is NOT the US version. Based on other feedback I m afraid to do the firmware update. No problems so far but beware. 
25423 freezes up sometimes and i have to unplug it 
25424 Keeps the camera dry and is great to keep sticky fingerprints away. 
25425 Money s worth. 
25426 Good images but a little on the weighty side for off hand viewing. Defiantly need a tripod. Good buy. 
25427 Not the sharpest lens I have, but it works very well for what it is. 
25428 They fit perfectly and work great. Definitely worth the money to have a few extra or to replace any in need. Shipping did take a while but that s expected when coming from another country. 
25429 Great protection for your investment. 
25430 Really Good mini backpack for beginners! I love it! 
25431 NOW I CAN VIDEO AT PARTIES LONGER LOVE IT 
25432 The Vivitar batteries I ordered work perfectly in my Sony a58 camera, for a fraction of the price I would have paid for Sony brand batteries. The cleaning kit was a great bonus. I was especially impressed and delighted by the size and power of the dust blower. 
25433 Macro is crazy detailed get an exernal light source and you re good 
25434 Fun for grad nite prizes... 
25435 Great lens! 
25436 Great lens filter kit 
25437 Admirable piece of engineering. Almost everything perfect, but a proper quick release should be fantastic 
25438 Too wide for my neck. 
25439 Excellent hdtvi dvr system. No complaints what so ever. Easy to setup. Has the best free ddns service available (hiddns). Video quality is amazing. My customers love it. Shipping was a bit slow but worth it. 
25440 So far so good Used a couple of times. 
25441 Love it 
25442 No complaints 
25443 My mother wanted me to search for something for my brother-in-law s birthday. He s really into astronomy. She got him the same model binoculars for Christmas. My sister said that he loved both of the products. 
25444 Used these on a construction site to mount a time lapse camera. Solid. Stable. Works well. The screws are showing signs of rust, but it was outside for months. The mfgr could use stainless steel screws if they wanted to improve the design... 
25445 The package is too simple, for UV lens 
25446 Great product. This case fits our Nikon Coolpix S33 camera just right. There is a pocket inside for an extra battery and or memory card. Heavyweight construction. Comes with a long strap. Double zippers, and a Velcro belt loop. Not much else to be said. It s a great case. 
25447 Just what I was looking for. Excellent lens bag, sturdy, lightweight, looks amazing! Highly recommend! 
25448 Great product- works better than expected 
25449 Much smaller than pictured, it looks like the sticker wraps around, but it doesn t. 
25450 One of the sharpest prime lenses on the market. 
25451 Great battery, easy to install fixed my problem. Came super quick, easy to install, at a great price!! Will use this seller again!! thanks td 
25452 They were very nice and strong but they didn t work with my vision. I could see black on the sides interfering with my vision. I tried to adjust but I have a wide bridge and my eyes just wouldn t focus enough. For someone else, I highly recommend. 
25453 Too large for the camera styles listed in the description. I never use this carry case. 
25454 Purchased this camera for our honeymoon in Tahiti. We banged it around on the paddle boards, took it snorkeling, and on our 1st diving trip ( which was only 5 or 6 meters). It took great pictures and video! Definitely TOUGH as well. 
25455 A++++++ 
25456 Perfect grip when using this as a handheld mount but an excellent desk mount for your cameras. 
25457 I can buy real glass protectors for this price 
25458 Great batteries and great for back up batteries 
25459 Works well for connecting mic 
25460 I have several really good tripods but I found myself in a place without one. I ordered this just to get me through a simple photo shoot. I was really pleased at the quality and compactness of this tripod. 
25461 Love it. I use it for insurance inspections. It has an amazing zoom! 
25462 Great to be able to charge a second battery not in the camera. 
25463 Easy to load and shoot. The picture develops quickly and it is nice to have a &#34;physical&#34; picture to place into an album. 
25464 Terrible, came with a bolt that was too short, do completely unusable. More importantly, it wasted my time because I had to find an alternative + return this poorly kitted product. 
25465 Works well! 
25466 Happy with items!! 
25467 This fit my Tamron lens just as described. Great price and exactly what I needed after losing my lens cap. Very satisfied and the seller was very fast with shipping. 
25468 Perfect addition to the Canon Rebel package I received. 
25469 could not make it work, sent it back 
25470 Wish it would start recording when power was applied to the micro usb. Originally wanted it for dash cam but keep forgetting to start or stop it. Pic quality good kids had it in pool still works. 
25471 One of the screws for the attachment is already stripped out 
25472 Works pretty good. Few of the buttons are labled wrong 
25473 This bag is amazing. The color is a little uninspiring, but not at all bad. It s very well built. I have been using mine every single day for over a year and it is still showing no wear whatsoever, and I m not a great owner. 
25474 Worked 
25475 Nice basic mount. Does the job. 
25476 the item was exactly as pictured and described. it works perfectly on my camera. I am happy to have a charger so that I am able to use my camera once again. thank you for this listing 
25477 Just what was needed. 
25478 Great kit for the price, more than I will ever use. Some pieces are cheaply made though. 
25479 not bad it really works quite well.. even my 5 yr old grandson can operate this..!! The record button is really easy to use !! 
25480 Awesome camera great pictures and features 
25481 THE WIRELESS VIDEO SURVEILLANCE HAS STOPPED RECORDING 
25482 Works well, better than expected. 
25483 Very well made!! Great product!! 
25484 ok 
25485 Got the propellers within a few days. They are great 
25486 A low cost solution to start your photography hobby. Many position options and adjustments. Great for any beginner. 
25487 Great! 
25488 Let s see what this amounts to when the time comes. 
25489 great transaction. Product as described 
25490 We used the Sony HDR-CX3800 to make a product review video of this pet fountain. [[ASIN:B00YDFMQ8M Five Star Pet Fountain for Improved Pet Health. Cats & Dogs Drink More Water When It s Oxygenated & Filtered. Easy to Clean, Quiet Operation, One Gallon Waterer. Simple Solution for a Healthier Pet.]] 
25491 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
25492 When the backdrop arrived it was as pictured but NOT as described 
25493 It should have been green/black according to the description. Also, because of the design, it is difficult to create/maintain a flat background. 
25494 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works on camera as described. 
25495 Great first microscope. 
25496 Works well. 
25497 Great! Just what I needed for this lens 
25498 Just as good as the name brand batteries. No problems at all. 
25499 Worked for about 2 seconds and with new batteries !! 
25500 the platform is plastic and will not hold any camera inline enough to get a decent image. you have to make changes to have it work. 
25501 Works very well, good quality pictures 
25502 good 
25503 Works well indoor and outdoor. I have not tried the Shutter release but the GPS works well on my Nikon D7100 
25504 I really like it...very versatile to carry laptop and camera 
25505 great 
25506 Great product. 
25507 this is the best and most stable tripod I have ever bought. 
25508 Not my best buy. 
25509 wayyyy to small , i thought it would be wider - can barely put the lens cap on 
25510 Good Price, great value should give me enough pwr for some long recording 
25511 I experienced quite a but if distortion around the edges with this on. 
25512 This bag is exactly what I was looking for. It has room inside for my laptop, camera, and all associated gear without being overly big. Great travel carry-on bag for all your electronics. It comes in different sizes so get the right size for your laptop. 
25513 I like this case,well padded, room for extra stuff, etc. 
25514 Love, love, love it. 
25515 Goes on great and protects a plastic (ugh!) screen. Much better than others I have used. A must have. 
25516 Works great. A nice and better replacer fid the original battery. The position of the battery on the charger can be confusing though since not all three prongs connect. 
25517 Got this for my son s GeekPro and everything in it worked great! We had a lot of fun with all the attachments on our vacation. Great product! 
25518 So far so good. Great service 
25519 For the money it is a very good deal! 
25520 Great can b used for number of things.Thx very much. 
25521 Takes great pictures, but i wish it wouldn t run out of battery so quickly. 
25522 A nice size card that fits in my gadget bag nicely. 
25523 There shouldn t be any functionality problem since it is just air blower but I couldn t stand the strong odor from the rubber pump. I can t use or store it because of the smell. 
25524 The protector works great, after 8 months it is still on the camera! Great service would use seller again! 
25525 Good 
25526 Love it 
25527 The video quality is poor, otherwise it is a great system. I use it for home security and I am impressed with it thus far. Just wish that the video quality was better. 
25528 Great camera case used with high quality fabrics. 
25529 Quality product. I love it. 
25530 Good quality cables, great price. 
25531 Love the tripod and blue tooth clicker. It made family beach pictures so much easier until the screw got crossthreaded, or something, in the plastic hold to hold the camera at a tilt. I m not sure how that happened b/c I hadn t messed with it. 
25532 Flimsy and falls off too often. 
25533 Great buy works perfect very happy 
25534 Fantastic!!! 
25535 Works as described I recommend.Be sure to have it plugged into your router with an Ethernet cable when you first configure it. Once configured it works fine over Wi-Fi. It just can t be initially configured over Wi-Fi. 
25536 Received on time.. Product quality is good for the price.. Thanks.. 
25537 Did what it was supposed to; arrived in a timely manner. 
25538 Very Nice & well made & Really like the way it Works ! Great ! ! 
25539 Great package. Great product 
25540 good not great 
25541 Great bargain. Quality product. 
25542 i got the shots i wanted with this filter. no problems. 
25543 too much on this thing, but an idiot like me can take goods pics it must be ok 
25544 Might be a little to petite for a professional that relies on many mounts and casings, but for a single case and knowing what mount you were to use this is practical. Hard casing helps to protect but hard to pack into a backpack if limited space. 
25545 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! 
25546 Interface could be better, but it works well enough 
25547 This bag has replaced all of my bags. I literally take this everywhere I go now. Trust me, it is worth it. 
25548 Very happy with items. 5 STARS AND great product. 
25549 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
25550 I lost my spare battery somewhere between a session, an event and home. Thankfully I was able to find the exact battery and have it delivered quickly. 
25551 This kit was everything I expected. It fits my camera great. I ve used most of the body gear parts and selfie stick already. I m having a blast putting together my videos. The case makes it easy to keep things together. 
25552 My granddaughter loves it. 
25553 Nice price 
25554 Henry was a great help with the wifi connection! Not having access to the router definitely made things difficult, but not impossible. Happy to be able to watch the pups from home and not having to worry. Glad its connected finally. Thanks to Henry! case id# c6721161henry AR004273 
25555 Not compatable to a mac 
25556 The battery worked just as expected, and you CANNOT beat the price! I did not notice any degradation in quality compared to the one I have that came with my camera. 
25557 I recommend. 
25558 This camera works great and the picture is clear. This is a great product and hopefully i get my moneys worth out of it, if it has any problems. I highly recommend this camera 
25559 great price holds charge like dream 
25560 VERY HANDY LOVE IT AND THESSE ARE ALLOWED ON ANY DISNEY RIDE 
25561 Decent protector. I have used this brand before and have been happy 
25562 Nice and sturdy 
25563 Works great! 
25564 Case Number: C6725987 Tech ID: AR004273 Description about my service experience with the technician was extremely helpful in setting up both of my Dlink cameras. He was the best technician I have ever worked with over the phone. 
25565 Not the greatest design but adequate 
25566 Wow! Great printer and great color! I take lots of pictures on my phone and DSLR and having a portable printer is super convenient and fun! People are amazed at the quality of the prints and Ive had a lot of questions about where I bought them! 
25567 thank you for this order 
25568 Works great! 
25569 I replaced a Sony A350 with this camera. I am very happy with the Sony A58 camera. I am more about taking photos than using the video that it has... I guess one day I will try that out, but for now, it s all about good photos. 
25570 Everything is in excelent condition, it came with 32 gb sd card and sony bag. One of the best deals ever! 
25571 it is a great one specially for quick and easy shots. video is great except battery life is too short in that case. I used it during my vacation to London and i had a great like processional photos 
25572 Arrived promptly, in quality pkging. All worked, no issues. 
25573 so far great price and performance. 
25574 I highly recommend this item. 
25575 Product arrived quickly. Batteries work great in my Samsung camera. The charger & 2 spare batteries give me more options than just plugging in my camera and waiting for a recharge. Order from this company. You will be pleased and amused. :) 
25576 did exactly what it was supposed to do 
25577 Works very nicely with my my scope. 
25578 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
25579 Brief comment is really all that s necessary. I bought the product, and it works perfectly. Furthermore, it s way cheaper than buying the branded battery from Canon. Definitely recommended. 
25580 Exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy construction, fast setup/take-down and I get the results I expect with it. And love the ball head mount - much better than I expected for this price. Couldn t be happier. 
25581 Everything was there and in good shape. Very happy with order. 
25582 Not sure I understood utilizing this product with my 85 Carl Zeis lens would leave it in manual. Frustrating sometimes. I will prob just use my Sony body. 
25583 Works awsome 
25584 Just what I needed for a short notice event. All the basics for low drama preparation. 
25585 Good Buy 
25586 works very well just what i wanted 
25587 works well, delivered quickly. no complaints. 
25588 ok 
25589 Very versatile works as expected. 
25590 High quality video, audio is very good. Had a few times where the video/audio cut out, but that was most likely due to a dodgy internet connection. Just make sure you ve got a WiFi extender and you shouldn t have any streaming interruptions. 
25591 Product was as described. Transaction was smooth. 
25592 Love it!! 
25593 Love, Love, Love, Love, Love!!!! Really nothing else to say...I have NO regrets about purchasing this camera!!! It s a blast to use and footage is amazing in and out of water, on moving vehicles, on moving pets, for stills, and anything you can imagine. 
25594 Came as promised. A lot of great accessories! 
25595 Love taking pictures with it for the first time. For an amateur, I like the speed for taking pictures. I still have to explore the many features of this camera. 
25596 Coool 50mm prime... use it all the time to create unique perspectives 
25597 Broke after 4 uses 
25598 Bought for my friends trip to Africa & didn t even work, Says needed Battery or something:( 
25599 Horrible product. I haven t even had this bag for 3 months and the zippers already broke off. Also to inforce that I have not used it often. The worst bag I ve had. 
25600 Great camera....love the Jpegs right out of the camera. The film simulations are spectacular! Use this camera and a Pentax Kiis....combo give me full photo flexibility.. 
25601 I can focus it at trees leaves and random daylight 
25602 rec d as promised and as advertised 
25603 Work OK little low on life of battery 
25604 A little smaller than expection. 
25605 metal and good fit for filters 
25606 Great unit for the money, easy to operate 
25607 Soft and girlie, loved this neck strap for our honeymoon in Ireland. Much better than that Nikon strap! Held my Nikon 3200 perfectly in place for the entire trip. 
25608 use it for the fujifilm xp70 
25609 Great lens cap, great value. 
25610 Love the colors and the price. Fits around neck comfortably. I got a compliment on the color while taking pictures on the street. 
25611 Great 
25612 I bought this cap for a Fujifilm Finepix S9200. It s well made and very nice, and I received it quickly. However it does not fit the lens. I need to send it back. 
25613 very good quality. love the carrying case! 
25614 so fun and cute! 
25615 Did what it needed too. 
25616 Richard Excellent support setting up the camera for remote viewing. Thank you. Camera is great. Doing exactly what I wanted. 
25617 It s an excellent product that beyond I expect. 
25618 Good size bag. Pretty comfortable to carry around. Not too obvious that it is a camera bag. 
25619 works well 
25620 It prevents good sound recording but keeps the water from getting into the device 
25621 Great on planets but blurs more distant objects 
25622 These are so nice and easy to take off and put on. 
25623 admitible 
25624 love it all. No problems. 
25625 Arrived quickly. Good illumination control from the dial. Little heavy with the batteries. Good product. 
25626 Saw double not in adjustment 
25627 Easy to fly. Would like to see longer range. 
25628 works well. 
25629 Bought this GoPro Travel and Carrying Case for my son s new GoPro4 and he loves it. 
25630 Works as expected batteries seem to work good so far as well. This charger is nice because you get a charger and two batteries. If you tried to get canon original batteries and charger this same deal would be over 150 dollars, so this is a no brainer. 
25631 I was very pleased with my purchase. I bought it for my nephew for his 18th bday and he loved it. Very well made and has plenty of padding and straps for carrying. Would recommend. 
25632 You can t beat the price,not bad video. 
25633 It provides good IQ and it reduces the size of the whole set so it fits into my pocket now!! 
25634 So far so good. 
25635 Works great! Just the right size, too. 
25636 I tried to use these according to the instructions and I still can t seem to get the quality out of them that I was hoping to get. They are made well so I ll give it two stars, but I really don t like how they work. 
25637 Thanks 
25638 NOTE: NO LEGS It would be unfair to mark it 4 stars. It is exactly what it claims to be, but it really needs some fold out legs for indoor usage. 2 stands and clamps work for a quick setup. 
25639 Wide viewing angle. Night vision is good but can be better ( compared to the camera I have from ADT). Overall, it is a good camera and worth the price paid for. 
25640 A OK..... 
25641 works well 
25642 Great price fast survive 
25643 Takes a long time to &#34;charge&#34; for each flash. 
25644 It came deformed... Not very helpful when it shows up in the frame due to its deformation. I would not recommend this. 
25645 richard helped me with setting everything up. its soooo simple and easy and now i can watch my apartment from my latop or my phone for free! i love this camera. the quality is amazing 
25646 Excellent 
25647 This item was better than what I thought it would be and I am very please. This looks very elegant and made of a thick cloth not like the thin ones that I have seen. 
25648 fits perfectly 
25649 Very easy to set up , only thing is that it only records at 960 not hd , so no need to buy hd cameras 
25650 Amazing price. Good camera fit with a couple of extra pockets. Sharp looking with Nikon emblem. 
25651 Perfect! Exactly as described! Thank you! 
25652 Given as a gift, recipient was extremely happy 
25653 Awesome product! Everything is perfect! 
25654 Perfect fit for my new Panasonic FZ-70. Charged perfectly and have tried both batteries, everything is good. The lens cloth and brush are nice bonuses too! 
25655 Don t buy 
25656 Great camera will buy again 
25657 Remote release cord functions perfectly; replicates the shutter release button on my D7100 in every way. 
25658 I have to change my review....I just returned the frame....when I was sitting right by it, the pics were great....once I moved it across the room and at a different level....it was hard to see ....a lot of black spots. Our original nix was not like that..... 
25659 Works fine but still need a stand. 
25660 Great product, prompt delivery. Love the clear pouches for storing the cleaning cloths! 
25661 So much better than changing batteries. Motor runs faster than with battery power 
25662 Good little pack here, but the mono pod stick isn t all that great. I ve seen better ones, no control button on the handle end. But you get what you pay for 
25663 Good materials and exactly the right size I needed, for a nikon d3200 + battery grip + 55-200mm lens. 
25664 Very easy to use. Great video quality, in a very small package. Would definitely recommended to anyone looking for a camera that is easy to conceal. 
25665 This case adds protection and a nice look of refinement. The con is that it makes it a little harder to get the SD card out. 
25666 only they used, and they are broke or not working where I can send it to the fix, since it has a one year warranty I am looking forward to your response Thank you nelson 
25667 arrived as expected. Works well. Good product. 
25668 Pretty good. Works as described. I wish there was a way to reverse it 
25669 easy to use and great quality. 
25670 Does a great job when used with the zeiss lense care cleaner 
25671 This is an excellent &#34;bean bag&#34; for photograhy use. Is made to last and the Neoprene surface prevents slippage. Filled mine with one bag 32oz (907grams) of Fairfield Poly-Pellets Stuffing Beads which are sold by Amazon. The bag s maker LensCoat has a line of first-rate products. 
25672 Perfect Replacement on my Canon Rebel. 
25673 Poor product! When I play back my videos it glitches hard. Over heats too 
25674 Works great- all functions very compatible and highly recommend 
25675 I installed the update from their web site and the unit does not work now. I have tried to contact them about the problem and have not received a reply. Sent them another email today I hope to hear soon. 
25676 Very cheaply built. This tripod is very flimsy and barely supports the weight of my camera. The level feature doesn t even have any liquid in it. Please do not buy this tripod. You will only end up disappointed. 
25677 Nicely fitting case. 
25678 Doesn t charge 
25679 Impressed with Value, Quality and quickness of shipping. 
25680 This is a great rolling camera case. Holds everything I need for photographing weddings. 
25681 awesome, sure took a lot of pics under water 
25682 Perfect 
25683 I returned mine. The rain bag is HUGE. Not usable for a mirrorless ILC camera. The quality feels cheap and would ve been cumbersome to use even if it did fit. 
25684 Fits perfect, and works great. 
25685 Vincent Did a wonderful job on getting the camera working properly in a short time!! Wish I could get him again if/when I need help!! 
25686 Excellent product at a great price. Plugs into the wall, has a car charger, cheaper than the Nikon branded charger. I don t see why you would opt for anything else! 
25687 Very nice well padded camera bag but to large for my point and shoot camera. 
25688 Perfect 
25689 it floats - easy to see in water, pool, lake and ocean! must go with bright orange colors! 
25690 Yes it is what it is. 
25691 Great camera! 
25692 Terrible product. They do not fir American cassette players 
25693 As advertised 
25694 They do not fit the camera at all. 
25695 it is okay for the price. Accomplishes the purpose of keeping an eye on my dog outside. After four months I ve had some wifi connectivity issues where i have to reboot the camera. 
25696 works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life 
25697 Product Arrived on time and intact.Thank you........Mike 
25698 excelete 
25699 A really great buy! So reliable, reasonably priced. Really keeps everything organized and protected. Wonderful for having a lot of equipment and yet wonderfully simple. My only downside is that I wish it came in different colors or designs. 
25700 it was perfect 
25701 like the size but doesn t always stay in one place.. 
25702 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
25703 El19 charger adapter does Not even come close to fitting el19 battery!! Who built this a three year old? Worthless device!! 
25704 Wasn t able to get it to work with my Canon 5D at all. Tried all the troubleshooting tips I could find online, YouTube videos, etc. Finally ended up returning it. 
25705 This prime makes you work for the shot. The bokeh is crazy and depth of field is very narrow. Perfect for dreamy, ethereal work made from afar. Minimum focal distance is about 6 .... 
25706 Works great!!! 
25707 Good as described 
25708 great it was well worth the purchase, the camera is now outdated needs to be replaced 
25709 Gift - recipient loved it! 
25710 Excellent 
25711 5 stars for the price 
25712 I have not used all the lenses yet so really can t give a fair review, however, I love the kit and carry it with me in my camera bag, I especially like the microfiber cloth for cleaning my camera and the lenses. It does a great job! 
25713 good clear picture. will use as a security camera when I go on vacation. 
25714 fukky The plastic ring that is attached to the hand string on the extension pole broke and my go pro fell 35 feet down. Thankfully one of the catamaran workers was a crazy free diver and went and got it. 
25715 Whenever you use this lens for Indore shooting with standards flash you get this lens shadow on pictures captured at below 35mm focal length. You have to use external flash light or capture without flash. Useful only for outdoor shooting without using standard flash. 
25716 A well made quality camera sling. At first, it can be a little tricky in using the optional armpit strap, but once you become familiar with it, you are good to go, without slippage that you get from other camera slings. 
25717 I got these in the mail and all of the Capacitors were bent over. after Testing I carefully moved the capacitors back into place and tested again and they all still worked. Rating would be higher if packaged a little differently but for the price I couldn t complain. 
25718 Always buy this products do is good , for some reason this time picture where no good, we waist half pack, picture never look good :( 
25719 Love it. Takes great pictures at a portable size. I love being out door, hiking, boating, jet skis, four wheeling, etc and this camera is great for travel. I can slip it in my pocket and go go go and get awesome pics too. :) 
25720 Perfect 
25721 perfecto 
25722 It is what it is. I m still learning how and where and when I will use it , but it serves my originally intended purpose very well and is fairly sturdy. 
25723 great item and fast shipping 
25724 GOOD BIRD 
25725 This is the best slider I ever had. It s short to carry, extends on a tripod, super smooth ride for awesome shots. Wide rails can hold heavier load. Inexpensive, well built, and it s pleasure to work with it. I rate it A+++. 
25726 This will make it so much easier to take pics. works great 
25727 Thank You 
25728 Fits great` 
25729 Excellent value. I have a GoPro but this excellent value allows me to place a camera in more dangerous locations with less concern. Mask works great also. 
25730 It worked so well that I bought two more. 
25731 excelent 
25732 Wow! I am really impressed with the quality! It is very sturdy and solid. The tripod is heavy, so I don t see myself lugging this thing around on a nature walk, but I knew that from the other reviews. 
25733 Exceptional quality, performance, and guarantees. The filters from this great company are now the best ones I m using. 
25734 Great purchase! Just remember you need to manual focus...no big deal for me. 
25735 worked grate 
25736 Awesome camera & bundle! 
25737 A unique solution that was very much needed. Been using it for months now and it hasn t broke. Very surprising given what this thing is 
25738 Works great 
25739 Excellent bulbs. Very bright, doesn t get very hot & no buzzing. 
25740 Solid case. Tight seal. Fits Gopro, battery charger, plug and two batteries easily. Carabiner is cheap, but I swapped it out for an s-biner. Clear lid is nice if you have multiple boxes that are the same color. 
25741 Good product and fit at an affordable price. Only negative is it took over a month to ship from China. 
25742 Doesn t hold a charge as well as the battery that came with the drone. 
25743 Didn t fit the Canon Mark II as advertised (requires an adapter). Misleading BS and it s overpriced. 
25744 Does its job 
25745 Wow great item for great price 
25746 I received a tripod that has been used and has scratches all over. I didn t return it yet because I feel lazy of going through the return process. 
25747 There is a big problem to installing it without a detailed English instruction manual; for example: the function and connecting the J1,J2 and J3 terminals. 
25748 Hooked it up prior to installing and everything looks good 
25749 10 points. everything was as expected 
25750 Good camera, especially you don t need remember about battery charging. Just keep extra 4 AA with you. Quality is great for this price, well you are not buying a $1000 camera, so don’t expect more for this money. 
25751 Exactly what I need for pictures 
25752 cheap and good 
25753 In case your camera lenses are vampires like mine. 
25754 Nice addition to the camera bag. This along with the STK aftermarket batteries have been extremely reliable (just as good as the factory units). 
25755 This is such a cute camera!! 
25756 A good product. 
25757 It s so small so it s kind of hard to focus in on an object. Not very pleased with it. 
25758 I ordered this because I ve always wanted a polaroid. Best purchase I ve ever made! It came very quickly, and is so cute! Definitely worth the money I payed for it! 
25759 as advertised 
25760 Does the job, but very hard to find the right focus. 
25761 It s perfect 
25762 Bought this for my Pentax k-50 with 18-55mm lens. Fits snugly and works just fine. Note: This is for the weather resistant form of the lens, from what I understand this will not fit the non-WR lens. 
25763 As advertised. Works great for sunsets. 
25764 I absolutely love these little lenses... I have had fun playing around. My favorite is the macro lens and here is an image where it was used. My phone is iPhone 6 plus... 
25765 it does not fucus well, bought it for fy son s 8th grade promotion... and ended it taking pictures with my phone, they came out better with my phone :( 
25766 I love it.!!! 
25767 My Daughter love this, I gave it to her for her 11th birthday 
25768 fake leather.screw not work on tripod 
25769 I received my camera today and was very pleased with it. It arrived earlier than anticipated, it was the best priced camera and had the most accessories included. I can t wait to try it out this weekend with the family! 
25770 Lights up the area I wanted it to 
25771 Plenty of room for my scope and camera with several lenses 
25772 Shows black and white and no wireless. 
25773 Really happy with this case. It holds my Samsung point-and-shoot. Has a small pocket for cords or cards. Just perfect. 
25774 I ve had this for a few years now and it has never given me a bit of trouble. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a feature to reorient an individual picture. 
25775 the best choice for pro photo shoot 
25776 Works good in my Canon VIXIA HFR20. Gives battery time remaining on the screen. So camera thinks it s a Canon battery. 
25777 Good price-good product-fast delivery. 
25778 My videos and images are of poor contrast and lots of noises even in good light, don t know if this the case with others or not. 
25779 Great selfie stick, I love it 
25780 well after using this the first time I needed to order a new Panasonic ZS40 to replace my ZS20 Youz can guess the rest anyway hate to upgrade that way 
25781 If you re gonna drop the money for the T5, get this bundle. The extras are good quality, and the extra lens makes this an awesome deal. 
25782 a gift 
25783 Pictures were nice and functioned under water. However some of the pictures look blurry. 
25784 Works perfectly. Helps get the best shot and is super sturdy! 
25785 Works great! 
25786 I did plenty of research and this was a great deal. I was also happy the bag was Canon brand. Although the 16 gig memory card was corrupted after just 4 uses??!! 
25787 The real deal! 
25788 very happy good product 
25789 Everything Ok! Thanks 
25790 Great little package, easy to mount and install...Thanks 
25791 Workout great 
25792 Exactly what I needed for my Tamron 70-200 mm 2.8. Fits with lens hood and collar. Nice quality and protects lens well. 
25793 not bad for the price, not the best quality. 
25794 did not fit 
25795 Amazing! My husband love stargazing but doesn t like to pull out our big telescope all the time this has been perfect for him. I would definitely reccomend a good tripod with this to get the clearist view. 
25796 This tripod is great for a point and shoot. I used it in a pinch to set my dslr on, but don t trust it. 
25797 Good 
25798 Leg support came apart after a few weeks and the little handle broke. 
25799 Good veiw 
25800 5 stars because you can t beat the value for price. I filmed a time lapse first chance I got and loved the results. Using the wifi mode a huge plus. 
25801 Very nice product.....! 
25802 First of all, don t advertise a specific color when it isn t available. If I wanted a pink one, I would have ordered a pink one. I didn t even bother checking quality because I m so disappointed with the color. 
25803 I got this so I can be able to load up my photos on my computer. 
25804 Works great on my t3i. Love how the photos turn out with this lens. It s a lot heavier than I expected to be. Not really a problem though. 
25805 Our family loves hiking and this makes even the younger one to go on one 
25806 Very comfortable on delicate skin of younger kids too 
25807 The memory card that it comes with is not a micro card. 
25808 great Quality and great Service it fit my Camera perfect give it a try. 
25809 This is the gift for my mom and she loves it. But the automatically turn on/off function is not working. 
25810 This was everything I needed it to be. It is a great small Tripod good for webcam or still digital camera. It holds the camera steady and is easy to adjust. 
25811 Does the job. Takes quick photos and prints them out. So glad I have this camera. :) 
25812 Great value!!!! 
25813 love it It makes my camera larger and easy to hold... 
25814 waste of money 
25815 Got exactly what was advertised. Fit like a glove. Now I have a replacement!! Great deal! 
25816 Great item! The set is definitely worth the cost. 
25817 I give this product 3 stars because the tripod broke after 2 days I had the tripod, I read the reviews about it and they were true. The other reason why is that the quality of the camera isn t too good but I still like it. 
25818 Works as intended. Fast delivery. If you need a portable light, you can not go wrong with this one. 
25819 Very nice case. Only reason it didn t get a &#34;5&#34; was it needed to be a little bigger for me. Fine quality case though. 
25820 Perfect gift, daughter loved it 
25821 Perfect fit. 
25822 It s very very good, buy it !!!! 
25823 I am going to send the product back. It will not do what I bought it for. I wanted to use it for surveillance looking through a window to the outside and the picture quality just is not there. 
25824 Product is as advertised. 
25825 Fine! It s just a charger! 
25826 BE CAREFUL! It is good, if you have little camera and you need it just sometimes at family meetings and don´t want to spend money for expensife stuff, but for middle-sized cameras it´s absolutely terrible. For active photographing it´s too weak! 
25827 The product arrived right on time. I used the charger to charge the old battrey, and it worked great. The &#34;charging light&#34; and &#34;fully changed light&#34; worked as they should. Good product so far. 
25828 Product broke as soon as I opened it. The part the camera sits on comes off now and I can t seem to fix it.. 
25829 I ordered several lenses from Digital Goja. Everything was great. I wouldn t hesitate to order more from them in the future. 
25830 Awesome product 
25831 What can be said about a mobius that hasn t been said already? Great picture, light, and easy to mount in a variety of locations. Wish I hadn t waited so long to buy one. 
25832 it works o.k. thank you dan 
25833 This is a must buy for observing the moon. The moon is incredibly bright. Good quality filter fits right on any 1.25&#34; EP. 
25834 Awesome camera for the price! I snorkel with it twice a week. Underwater shots are amazing! 
25835 I love this camera, exactly what im looking for. I used so much for street photography, my travels and partys, everything in one camera. I just I love t. 
25836 It is perfect for my camera! Great and fast service! 
25837 Good for the price - works well 
25838 Seem very durable. Wish you could pick the color. I got the white ones. 
25839 Excellent. Works great for my camera! 
25840 the light doesnt work 
25841 Arrived quickly and fits my Sony @6000 perfectly. 
25842 This is great for a day trip and if you don t want to carry a lot of lenses. very comfortable to wear. 
25843 Everithing was as I expected 
25844 Fits tight, but that s how I like it. Case comes with a shoulder strap, main pocket for the camera, and outer pocket for memory cards and batteries. Works great at a great price 
25845 Very happy with my product and fast shipping 
25846 I really love this filter. It is so much better then stacking filters. All you have to do is dial in the darkness you want and shoot 
25847 GOOD! 
25848 Dont have batteries 
25849 Kit was ok, but bag was smaller than I expected. 
25850 Works great! Easily charges my GoPro battery. 
25851 Received shattered screen twice. Amazon/seller was quick to refund my purchases, but it suffices to say, I will not be ordering another one. I wouldn t classify this item as &#34;ultra durable.&#34; 
25852 This is a great camera. I take it everywhere with me. It takes great pictures and has an easy to understand layout for us novices. 
25853 Does what it s supposed to. 
25854 If you re 3 inches away from the &#34;camera&#34;, the motion detector works great. You get what you pay for. I bought 2 and only one works. 
25855 nice 
25856 Saw comment from someone else that charger was cheap plastic....so big deal. It works great and the batteries charge fine. I am absolutely satisfied for this battery pack and charger. 
25857 Fits my Pentax K50 perfectly. No issues. 
25858 The product arrived quickly and works very well. I have a three-story town home, and it keeps me from having to climb up and down the stairs to talk. 
25859 I think this might be the best lens money can buy, if you only have $50 to spend on a lens. 
25860 This gopole is lightweight and durable. Has held up from many high impact falls. Collapses small enough to pack in a backpack. 
25861 Nice LITTLE LED light for cell phone, good value and good price. It was made for iPhone 4s, included a 4s case. You will probably use the lights only and throw away the case. 
25862 Perfect 
25863 great value 
25864 It s ok. 
25865 Excellent quality, feels very solid excellent picture. Easy to set up. A word of caution: make sure you restart your router and camera after making changes to your router and camera settings. It will make your life easier. 
25866 Absolutely love this lens. Got it for a Canon Rebel T3i and it is amazing! LOVE it. Would definitely recommend. 
25867 Works with Piper system... took a while to get connected but it finally got up and running and works great! 
25868 This is a great buy but if you haven t got your Phantom yet buy the Phantom kit with 2 batteries and save some money. 
25869 Compact size, perfect. 
25870 So far so good. it really need a powerful memory card tho. 
25871 Works well! 
25872 Excelent 
25873 Great for weddings 
25874 Works fine. Like most products it could use a better manual. 
25875 Seems to successfully charge the Ricoh GR also, for those that may be wondering. Your mileage may vary but it seems compatible with the otherwise difficult to find proprietary in-camera charging cable. 
25876 Coolpix indeed. Great 20mp pix with Nikon simple (if you read instructions) focusing. 
25877 Does what I expect a tiny tripod to do. Holds my T3i well, but usually it sits under my GoPro or Contour+2. Feels like pretty solid construction. 
25878 Great 
25879 its good for what it is but I should have bought a longer zoom 
25880 My husband and I are professional photographers and we both love these. They leave camera lenses (and eyeglasses!) lint free and the price is awesome. Great product. Excellent service. 
25881 Drone is fantastic! The seller did a great job in shipping it quickly. This being a 4K camera you ll have to put it in JPEG or some other format for others to view your video. 
25882 Extremely impressed by the quality of the drone and the images we have been able to capture. HIGHLY recommended! 
25883 Works good so far. 
25884 good 
25885 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found that it fits fine. One star off because it s not quite Canon quality, but then again it s not Canon Price either. Good looking and works, for a reasonable price. 
25886 Amazing for the money! 
25887 Love it! 
25888 Nice camera and its construction looks and feels solid. I like its features and although I am an amateur photographer it helps me to take nice pictures. 
25889 good coverage. user friendly. good quality video. 
25890 Great piece of equipment, got it for my wife. 
25891 Great camera. Comes with lens cap and neck strap. Great photos. This really takes great pictures and really looks and works like a brand new camera. Would definitely recommend. 
25892 great modifier, good quality 
25893 Worst kit ever!! Because of those accessories I lost my gopro! 
25894 If you don t want to spend the big bucks for name brand batteries, these are definitely for you. Great price, great packaging, and no problems at all with either of the batteries. 
25895 Cut to the chase, you pretty much get what you pay for here, the quick release plate lever is very weak and flimsy... 
25896 Good one 
25897 I had previously purchased a T5 from The Imaging World and was very pleased with the service and fast shipping. I am still breaking in my new 70D and the purchase experience was once again excellent. 
25898 Great for a low cost alternative. Most useful in the sun. 
25899 Bought to keep as a spare. Arrived just before I broke a bulb. 
25900 I am really enjoying my camera but the best part is the service in setting it up. 
25901 very happy with this, nice upgrade from my Spyder 2 
25902 Greatt 
25903 Does what it s supposed to do and does it at a cheap price. Can t go wrong. I use this on my Nikon D3300 
25904 Exactly what we needed and works great! 
25905 Images are faded not sharp and clear. I should have bought a spotting scope with a camera attachment. 
25906 everything was great!! 
25907 These are worth every penny, I also shoot with alien bees and Einstein. These will perform perfect for anyone starting out that does not want to spend a lot of money right away. 
25908 Works great, no fuss. Standard 2-flat-prone connector for the US as well as car charger and EU adaptor as stated. 
25909 The grip does not match the photo. It does not have the &#34;thumb joystick toggle&#34; or the other button. It feels poorly made and is clearly not a quality clone of the Canon vertical grip for the 7d mkII 
25910 I would have given it 5 stars if I wasn t missing the thread adapter I have to now go get one from Home Depot myself :/ other than that the build quality is superb for this price 
25911 Takes good pictures 
25912 Flimsy, tons of bubbles (and i applied correctly), not very strong adhesive 
25913 Not bad. Does the job. The pin hole for the video is more obvious than I would like but no one has noticed it yet. 
25914 They are the best comparing to any price point. The 15X50 are ideal all the way to as close as 15 feet. Not heavy as some have said. You can read reviews all day long as I did, you will not find a better pair anywhere! 
25915 Complete package deal! 
25916 Works and fits very well. Wayyyyy cheaper than really right stuff brand that is similar. Fits all really right stuff ball heads and mefoto heads 
25917 Works great! Thank you! 
25918 Everything was good but it did not contain the yellow float, so we had to go buy one for another twenty dollars. 
25919 Works good, but is flimsy and bends easily, if your camera is over a pound or so the tripod becomes unstable. 
25920 The cameras are great. They do exactly what I needed. 
25921 This is a great bag,just what I was looking for! 
25922 Good 
25923 A great purchase. If I bought it again, though, I would purchase the larger one. It is difficult to fold up, though. Look for a tutorial on youtube and plan to take a few times before you figure it out. 
25924 I ve used this lens with a d3200 and it makes the pictures look stunning. This lens produces sharp and detailed images. This is a bang for your buck because you can t beat the price. 
25925 Highly Recommended !! 
25926 Very good camera 
25927 Works great. Only drawback is that it is a large heavy piece of equipment. 
25928 Great camera, great pictures, easy to use. 
25929 Excellent 
25930 Awesome unit. The technology this has is amazing! Should cost thousands more! Does everything it says it doeas and more. Pics are beyond belief! Don t be scared, my 5 year old grandson can fly it! 
25931 Better pictures with this. Should have had one long ago 
25932 thicker walls than original. fits great. 
25933 The waterproof housing is foolproof. The picture quality is excellent. And, it s easy to use. 
25934 Excelent product 
25935 The glasses are awesome. The video and audio are exactly what I was hoping for, and the simplicity of using the glasses a huge bonus. 
25936 I was recording a video of me plowing my driveway and this microphone recorded even when I was inside the truck and more than 60 feet away! 
25937 Excellent lens! 
25938 These are just as good as the original GoPro batteries and seem to last just as long if not a little longer. I ve been using these for about 2 months now with no problems to date. 
25939 Panhead broke in just one use. VERY weak. I can t purchase the panhead alone. But what do you expect for $16. 
25940 Worked great. Needed for a speech class in college and worked without a hiccup. 
25941 I love this pack. Its very well built, fits my Phantom 3, Canon 7D, 24-700, 70-200, 50 1.2, and all needed accessories. So nice to have everything in one bag. Great product! 
25942 Batteries arrived on time and fit into my D90 perfectly and are just what I needed 
25943 ITS JUST A a bigger version of a micro usb 
25944 Love this little album. It will be perfect for a guest book at my daughter s Jamaica wedding.!!! 
25945 Great bundle! Especially awesome considering I was headed to Europe with it and it already had a converter! 
25946 Somewhat usable, constantly have to make adjustments and re tighten parts of the rig that easily become loose. Rig is very front heavy when assembled with any serious camera set up. I need at least 10 pounds on my shoulder to balance it. 
25947 Very Powerful, but heavy 
25948 Great lines. The low light performance isn t the best but that s not really what it is for. The zoom range is excellent. 
25949 For the price its a decent value. Only wish O could afford better glass 
25950 Used these for a DIY Photobooth we put together for our wedding. Everyone loved them! Really easy to put together, but I recommend using a glue gun versus the glue tabs that it comes with. 
25951 Works great. For all the reviewers that complain about it only facing one direction: try turning the pole..... 
25952 Very smooth and solid !!! The slider is very smooth, didn’t need any adjustment. You can use the screw(package included) to connect your dslr camera, but i recommend you to connect with a ball head. Cause it will be more flexiable to operate. 
25953 Replaced the pick and pluck after a month. Went with the padded dividers for on set use. I can put the pick and pluck back in when I fly. 
25954 Great cable 
25955 Gave this one as a gift and it was well received. 
25956 These are not bad but the fit with the clips is very very tight. I have had to grind off a few high points to get them to work. My next order I ll spend the extra money for the gopro clips. 
25957 Did not work!!!!!! 
25958 Works, awesome for it s price, if you zoom out completely u will have dark edges,and I don t bother made a lead many great picd 
25959 cheap for what it is 
25960 I have shot some of the most amazing videos with this camera. Excellent quality, and very, very durable. 
25961 Got it on time. Has everything I need. Looks and works great on my bike. Great value for the price. Very happy! 
25962 Best 50mm lense ive used so far. Its really quite. Takes very sharp pictures, great addition to my Canon 70D! 
25963 This is a present to the world. 
25964 thanks!) 
25965 my nephew live it! thanx 
25966 Quality product, just as described. 
25967 Works great for small things to photograph. 
25968 I wanted something very minimal for a very small camera (Fujifilm X100 series), and this fits the bill perfectly. The swivels work as advertised - no more tangles! 
25969 love it! 
25970 Everything went ok with it ! 
25971 Works find for my 72 lens. for the price can t beat it. T 
25972 The 3 prongs are too tight, so it s really hard to get the camera in there. Also the plastic around the ball is really cheap and looks like it can break at any time. Overall not good. 
25973 A+ 
25974 Excellent backup to the provided fastener that came with my black rapid camera strap. Now I have a fastener for both if my camera bodies 
25975 Works great in my old 35mm cameras! 
25976 Love the colors 
25977 Good buy. Very happy with this. 
25978 Very sturdy and light weight. Easy to carry around 
25979 The glue was not sticking 
25980 A lot shorter and narrower than I expected 
25981 Great value for the money. Wonderful views of the skies. 
25982 i CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE PICTURES ARE COMING OUT FOR A VERY MODERATE PRICE. 
25983 Great case for the price. Camera is a little loose in the case but the case will serve my purpose 
25984 Useful, really water resistant, not so good underwater color photos 
25985 It s good for the money. Wouldn t say it s 720. Also only 30fps, not 60. 
25986 Quickest shopping ever! Best camera ever! 
25987 These clips worked well when attacking the camera to them, but when clipping them to actual mounts (like gopros adhesive mounts, or a chesty) the clips were to tight and impossible to remove without breaking them. 
25988 Great tripod with smart phone mount! Good construction, easy to use, nice storage bag and lens cleaning cloth included. The low price and convenience of front door delivery makes this the deal of the year! I love it! 
25989 Great camera good clarity, never seen software with so many issues. Different results in different browser. Worked only on windows 7 
25990 This is my third case and I m more than happy with them. There is no better way to keep my photo gear protected, perfect for storage and travel, can t go wrong with this case, highly recommended! 
25991 LOVE LOVE LOVE! If you re still doubting, STOP and JUST PURCHASE! You won t regret it! 
25992 It s not exactly what I ve expected but it s ok for other uses. A little to much of a toy instead of a pro kit. 
25993 Works great. 
25994 Love-Love-Love this camera. It makes me feel like a real pro! This package deal was definitely unbeatable. 
25995 Great 
25996 Always buy factory batteries. The other brands are pretty poor. Great quality battery. 
25997 Nice product, quick delivery. This backpack does a great job of storing and protecting my Phantom 3. 
25998 This fit my hero 3+ underwater housing very well. 
25999 I don t really find the gorilla pod useful for my DSLR, it s not able to handle the weight. Note.. make sure your camera supports infrared snapshots unlike me. 
26000 Could be a hair larger, but does job for me...I stuff it with filters, and two to three old med format folders... 
26001 Rarely works. Sometimes I need to click continuously for two minutes until it works 
26002 For an older camera this one fits the bill nicely. great pictures and still has tons of attachments available. 
26003 I was displeased with the photo quality of GoPro cameras, and decided to try out a waterproof camera for snorkeling and shallow dives instead. I couldn t be happier - it takes phenomenal photos above and below water, and I have had no problems with leaking or humidity. 
26004 Son loves his case. 
26005 Great Lens! Beautiful pictures! Not a bad price for an L glass. 
26006 The camera runs down batteries really fast when doing any video. Tried using 2300 mah rechargeables worked a little better but still ran them down quickly 
26007 I am so in love with my new lense. It fits my camera and I can t wait to start shooting! Very excited ! Thank you! 
26008 Love this! Beautiful. Can t wait to get some awesome photos! 
26009 Pretty cheap and flimsy. Will do the job in a pinch, but I would not recommend buying it for a full camera. Maybe if you only wanted to use it for a small digital camera. 
26010 Broke on day 1 when used with a ful bag. Perhaps it s the bags fault (2nd strap to break off of this bag) but its now attached with carabiners. 
26011 tried it out, was as expected. a bit on the heavy, you ll need a good tripod. mine was a bit light. the tripod was great for heavy camera, but tripped over when I attached the Celestron. so now Im buying a tripod, enjoyed the Celestron view 
26012 It served as a replacement unit. 
26013 Works good. had to download 2cu app, but instructions suck. can it be viewed from a computer web browser using windows? No port information in manual. 
26014 Perfect fit for my Gopro hero 4, it is amazing that you don t need to carry your camera to capture the picture or video while your hand busy with other stuffs. I m definitely looking to buy other accessories for my Gopro. 
26015 this is a great kit at a great price...exactly what I was looking for. 
26016 Product was as advertised. 
26017 Depth 
26018 Downside is the screen is very small picture qulity prfect i like it. 
26019 I love that I can check in with my pups anytime. Also love that I get alerts to when there is motion and noise in certian areas. 
26020 Worked well. Held up to the salt water snorkeling and jumping into the water. 
26021 very good batteries. 
26022 Not one of these thing I ever cared to buy but I got tired of loading my ad cards or forgetting them in my pockets and sending them in the laundry. Case works great and is pretty solid. 
26023 Very nice, you can use it as a table cloth, curtain or camo cloth...I just don t use it much i have wall paper that looks similar and i dont need a stand or have to iron it but its good to have 
26024 Stronger material and stitching than I expected. 
26025 Just what I needed for my new camera........ 
26026 Great product. Exactly as described. Thanks. 
26027 The quality is adequate for the price. 
26028 This lenses everything I wanted. Clean and Chrix 
26029 So so so happy with the entire kit especially the camera. Was exactly what I needed and I m having to much fun with it! 
26030 Works well. Very happy with purchase. 
26031 Love the quality of light but wish it was more powerful. The charge is pretty poor too. I paid too much for this item but having said that I do use it regularly..... Just wish I had waited for the new one. 
26032 Good product good quality Very good seller 
26033 Easy to use, fit directly into d7100. The cons I see is that it can easily pop out of place. Good product 
26034 works fine 
26035 eh 
26036 My 17 year old daughter loves the features & smaller size of this camera. Great gift! 
26037 WORKS I THINK BETTER THAN THE GOPRO ONE 
26038 THIS IS MY SECOND ONE-----THE OLD ONE ( 4 YEARS OLD ), STILL WORKS GREAT, BUT I WANTED ANOTHER BEFORE IT BECOMES UNAVAILABLE. I HOOKED BOTH THE RECIEVER AND THE SENDER TO REMOTE X-FORMER SO I DON T NEED TO DEAL WITH REPLACEMENT BATTERIES. 
26039 Works great 
26040 Very easy to hook up brought 2 both took a total of 10 minutes to get working, finding place to plug in Cameras took the longest. Not a bad video image 
26041 Perfect ! 
26042 Grate 
26043 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
26044 Very Good Product 
26045 The moment I plugged the charger + battery in, the circuits were tripped. I don t trust this product. I asked for a refund. 
26046 this POE NVR system is good constructed,nice package,NVR is real 1080P,cameras with nice image and POE function, real plug&play,no need more setting, when my monitor is on with this NVR, all the 4 channels are on also.very nice and price is also very good. 
26047 could be brighter 
26048 It drains the batteries to fast. 
26049 perfect 
26050 Perfect battery for my camera! 
26051 Works great! 
26052 In the ad they said it fit Leoca Q models however it is not 
26053 Great product 
26054 Everything was as I expected and works great. 
26055 Very nice case 
26056 Amazing product!! Very precisely cut glass for that perfect fit!! I was about to buy the screen protector that is much more expensive but I m glad I found this one. It s great value and fully protects my NEX-6 no problem. You won t regret it!! 
26057 Relatively easy to install the software which allows use, and the image generated is of reasonable quality (I am using to confirm authenticity of signatures and vintage documents). I would recommend this product. 
26058 Canon is great 
26059 This is a fabulous budget buy for umbrella s. Setup is minimal, and since they are used mostly indoor, I have no issues with wind, pets, children, etc. If you are just starting out with flash photography, you cannot go wrong with this setup. Highly recommend it. 
26060 good i like it 
26061 but in night view it is not clear 
26062 Hard to install 
26063 This is a nice entry level tripod. The carrying case is a great touch. Perfect for the price! 
26064 It is too small for a regular camera -- probably works best with a smart phone. 
26065 works like a charm. I was having trouble hearing anyone at the door, and often found notes that someone had assumed no one was home. I get a lot of merchandise deliveries, and now know when someone just leaves a package without knocking. 
26066 Needed charger that works car. Works.as.advertised. 
26067 The product is crap. Don t buy it. Waste the $25 some place else.The tripod plate came apart the first time I touched it and is always loose. 
26068 It does the job, but honestly, I got better results as a point-and-shoot from my iPhone 4s. This camera is better for video, so there s that. 
26069 The spare battery and charger will likely never get much use, but it is reassuring to know that I have a spare battery, and the ability to recharge anytime independently of the camera. 
26070 cloths work very well 
26071 I absolutely love it! However, the instructions are entirely in Japanese. Wish me luck! 
26072 Awesome little camera! 
26073 Great product 
26074 excelente producto 
26075 A great variety of accessories for the money, including a solid carrying case. Great purchase for anyone with a GoPro. 
26076 I like it but I must return because I already was given a new system that I can use. 
26077 LOVE it... strong and strudy, durable, fits my 18-135 (with cam), and 50 mm and still have LOT of room with my canon D70 
26078 Very handy lights. I bought several, and I love the feature where you can attach them to one another to make a bigger,brighter light source! 
26079 While my Nikon CLS system will operate a remote flash with the pop up on camera flash in bright sunlight the cable is reliable. Works well and a very good price. 
26080 great product, but missing the camera strap in the packaging 
26081 Great battery arrived on time. 
26082 nothing special just basic low end lens 
26083 Insanely good image quality and bokeh. I was on the fence if I needed an 85mm for portrait work on my DX-format Nikon, but I m so glad I bought this. 
26084 We are happy with the system. 
26085 Fits the camera as expected. Reasonably priced and comfortable. All in all a good replacement for the 7D. I am considering ordering a spare as I live abroad and cannot get these delivered fast. 
26086 Wife loves it. She uses it at work for her evidence. Thanks. 
26087 Great camera! Clear photos and easy to use! 
26088 As advertised. Good quality and shipped quickly. 
26089 great 
26090 I received thisis a very timely manner. It works great! 
26091 After owning this for 3 months I can say the hours of tech support are not worth it. It is unreliable and finicky. If you are an advance tech person then buy it and enjoy your time troubleshooting. 
26092 Good camera for the quality and price. This IP camera is full of features and can become a real toy if you are a good player and try to get into all the functionality. 
26093 Case Logic 
26094 nice 
26095 Wife loves her new gift. Brings those far away shots right up where you want them in a nice clear display. Very nice. 
26096 Thank you 
26097 just have to manually positon this unit to the desire position. the plastic housing feels that it will break if not handle with care 
26098 Fits Mobius with no issues, just like one that came with camera. Bubble level good idea but nice if a bit thinner. 
26099 Great fit!! Perfect length. Not flimsy. Great buy. 
26100 For the price you can t go wrong. Takes a little bit of time to set up as it s universal but for the price it works pretty good. All the reflectors you ll need for any kind of ambient lighting on your outdoor portrait shoot. 
26101 👍👌 
26102 thanks 
26103 Perfect fit. Good feel. Can t even tell it s there. 
26104 Good investment, although be warned, the filters don t really do anything. Save your money for an Orion telescope. 
26105 Terrible product - cheap - couldn t get it off my lens after I installed it! 
26106 I was expecting a little more quality food on the camera (comes out grainy with no flash indoors even when well lit). But for the price this is a good camera. 
26107 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
26108 First carry-on case that s big enough to handle all I want to pack. I especially like the removable insert section that fits even in commuter jet overhead storage. That allows me to carry on the most fragile components, even when the outer shell has to be gate checked. 
26109 Nice at first but fell apart at the plastic joints after a year. pay a little more and get a better quality tripod. 
26110 Arrived quickly and complete. The converter for Europe will come in handy! 
26111 Very good value. A lot of bang for your buck. Very well made. Images are very clear. 
26112 I love the way it look and small enough to carry around 
26113 Great product. Fits just right, protects the screen and you don t even know it s there. 
26114 was ok just smaller than we imagined. It was true to advertisement. 
26115 it was ok 
26116 It had light leaks though 
26117 I have a lot of wrist issues and this really helps with support. I don t worry about dropping my camera now! Shoot with a Nikon D600 
26118 as expected 
26119 Inexpensive, fits well and secure, gives you some room for grip. It clears the battery trap but because of the extra 1/2 inch, you ll need to pinch the battery out. 
26120 Very happy with these lights. Powerful, they display the color temp in Kelvin, they don t get hot, and they can run off batteries. Excellent. 
26121 I use it at the shooting range and it holds pretty steady. The focal length adjuster is a little too tight for my liking but this monocle does it s job pretty well. I can easily see my shots at 25 yards. 
26122 Sorry not good, returned item 
26123 This works beautifully for supplementing natural light with more natural light. It is large and very efficient. 
26124 I bought the kit to use with my new GoPro on a trip to Florida and was very happy with performance and the quality of the items in the kit. It was a great alternative to the higher price accessories I am completely happy with kit and with the seller. 
26125 It fits g7x screen perfectly. 
26126 great buy 
26127 Good 
26128 Its great camera float to the top, Very pleased with it 
26129 Cute throw at least that is the purpose I used it for and this does the job. I put it on the back of my daughter s mod chair and she loves it. 
26130 The camera is wonderful and the company is amazing! 
26131 Exactly what I was looking for. 
26132 adequate 
26133 It works OK. 
26134 Lasts longer than generic 
26135 Bought for a friend and he likes it. 
26136 Great value, better than my expectations. These last as long as the originals. 
26137 Great quality and Great Price. 
26138 excelente 
26139 Show 
26140 Very lightweight and easy to grip. Just what I needed. 
26141 Great camera 
26142 The product met expectations. 
26143 Love the driveway alert doorbell, we actually use it for our apartment to know when someone is coming down our steps because we live in the rear of the building. 
26144 Can t tell yet. Camera arrived defective and had to be returned. 
26145 not easy to operate 
26146 This helps when I m playing paintball so I don t have a shiny camera on my helmet 
26147 Very heavy, clumsy. A sturdy base/light stand is needed--not a folding stand. 
26148 A great inexpensive filter. 
26149 Typical DJI quality. 
26150 Great product. Fits like a glove - almost too tight. Definitely protects the camera. Just a little work to get the camera in and out. 
26151 Fast shipping, great price! 
26152 It fits in very nicely with my new Hero 4 Silver. 
26153 Daughter loves it and takes her selfie stick everywhere. Everybody comments on how pretty the crystals are. Came fast and was a pleasure to buy from this seller. 
26154 If you want HD quality, don t get this. Sound wasn t great. Bought for a wedding and then a rock show, and was not impressed. Returning ASAP. 
26155 Pole grip moves and ended up ripping after about 6 months of use. GoPro s are suppose to withstand a any type of activity and weather and this did not. 
26156 It was what I expected. 
26157 Received in good time however the screen contrast is poor and quality not great. Price was good though so at least I can see the controls again! 
26158 Nice - works well - foam insert just a hair too small so it comes out easily. 
26159 Good stuff!! Quality aftermarket product. Pretty happy with my purchase. 
26160 good product. The format is AVI and doesn t work with I-Mac s unless you download a third party program that reads the AVI format 
26161 Good 
26162 great camera. read the instriuctions 
26163 heavy 
26164 Extremely bad picture quality. Not sure if it is just this particular camera but its pretty bad. I ll send it back 
26165 Only used this once. No start up instructions, finally figured it out. 
26166 Really like the clarity and features of the image and frame. Would recommend this brand to anyone! 
26167 Good as the OEM. No complaints. 
26168 Took this camera with me on recent trip. Great videos and photos. Easy to use. 
26169 batteries discharge VERY rapidly!! Nowhere as good as my orginal Sony batteries. 
26170 As described. Fast shipping. 
26171 Love it - use it everyday to monitor activities of my pets. 
26172 Excellent fit! No messing around with loose fitting connectors. 
26173 I fell in love with the quality and all of the tiny pockets. Such an awesome bag!!!!!! 
26174 I bought it to offer some protection for the lens on a Sony HDR-CX430V video camera. It s wide angle so the hood never shows in my video, which was a concern. 
26175 Thank you! 
26176 It is so cute and so well made. I love it! 
26177 This does not fit the a6000 properly. It is missing a lip at the front end to slide in, which causes it to protrude from the back. 
26178 love the product it fitted my xa20... 
26179 Ordered this for a friend after they saw the one I bought earlier for my home. Easy to setup and use. 
26180 Looks good but could not find 8gb sd card at all 
26181 Didn t sink that s forsure! thanks! haha 
26182 Camera is quite realistic. 
26183 Works great. Plug & play like an original cable release 
26184 The Canon brand batteries seem to last longer than the cheap copies. The only reason I didn t give it five stars is because of the price. 
26185 Nice case at a great price. Genuine Samsung product. 
26186 Cane right on tiem for my trip with my new waterproof camera ! I was concerned the thin string would pop and it didnt n it went through alot lol. Thanks again. 
26187 Used the mount on my mountain bike. After a few uses the tightening screw cracked. 
26188 Great product and super shipping. Thanks so much. 
26189 didn t work with my Alpha 77 / Alpha 65 camera i dont know what s wrong , maybe it s defective or maybe it s a battery issue , i have no idea 
26190 that wasn t working 
26191 Works great and the price was less than what we found locally 
26192 Does not have the extended end tabs that help you align it perfectly before touching it down. I missed badly when trying to position it. Wound up throwing it away. 
26193 Well made nice padding 
26194 A great upgrade to the f/1.8 version 
26195 Very Manual - It s fun to play around with, but I feel like you have to use a tripod because any movement you make will cause blur. It s very manual, but fun if you are just killing time and taking photos of birds. 
26196 Fine product, great service. 
26197 This came with zero information or instructions on how to use. I m trying to decide if I want to send it back. 
26198 Great kit! Fast shipping! And you can t beat the price! Nothing has broken yet! :) 
26199 Fast delivery and product is exactly as advertised. 
26200 I expected much better quality photos with 20.1 MP resolution. It could be that I relied too much on the &#34;Intelligent Auto Mode&#34;. Unfortunately my pictures turned out grainy and out of focus even when I used a prop to hold the camera still when shooting. 
26201 Works as advertised. Nice to get everything together, especially one charging block that can be plugged into the car charger or into a 110V outlet. 
26202 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
26203 Excellent 
26204 Great we love it! 
26205 Good,but not reliable,it works but not what I was expected 
26206 Great value. Good for someone without smartphone or tablet. 
26207 It s cool camera and amazing performance! I could take beautiful pictures and movies 25m depth under water. 
26208 Overall the product is very good for the price. I would definitely recommend this alarm. 
26209 Works fine. But the black len will be in the picture. 
26210 As advertised 
26211 Great camera for the price. Im using it more than my 18-55mm. 
26212 As advertised! Not a lot of experienced yet as how will it behave, but looks great and charged well so far. 
26213 No issues. 
26214 I was very happy with my X1 UV MRC4 77mm that I bought 67mm for another lens. 
26215 Great product. Extremely satisfied with it for the price. 
26216 Just what we needed when our other battery kept dying on vacay. Now we ll have a spare fully charged. 
26217 Too Much Stuff and not enough time to use it. 
26218 I got 2 of these for my girl and myself. They both worked great we had no issues. Thanks for the product! 
26219 Worked great until..... The ring that holds the lens in one of the pieces (macro) fell out, thus allowing the lens to come out of the mount :( 
26220 Exactly what I was looking for to replace my original Olympus C7AU that I lost in a move. Works perfectly. Great for when the camera is on a tripod because the battery compartment gets covered by the tripod attachment, which makes it annoying when batteries need changing. 
26221 We are using this as a baby monitor and it has been great. Only problem is that it used to send me notifications of movement, but it doesn t anymore, and I can t figure out why...but I still love it! 
26222 Sick case 
26223 Great product, thank you. 
26224 An inexpensive way to soften off-camera strobe. Does what it s supposed to do. Appears to be made well, especially for the price. 
26225 The mouth mount from Ho Stevie is an extremely comfortable mount!!! It is great for surfing. I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys hands free videoing!!! 
26226 Works perfectly with my Canon EOS Rebel T3i, was easy to set up, and it s very easy to use. No complaints at all for this product, it s a pretty straightforward wireless remote control. I use it to start and stop recording for video wireless and it works great! 
26227 Items came in a good package. All items fit my Gopro very well. I will be buying another one with for the touch bacpac in the future 
26228 Just as described. I use this for shooting over babies as to not lose my grip. 
26229 I will keep this as a spare. 
26230 I love this case. It keeps anything smelly (cigars and the like) from stinking up my purse. I spray painted the lid white before using it so the contents wouldn t be easily visible. 
26231 I use them for the lake and football games. They are a excellent value a little long but they are manageable without the use of a tripod. Wish I had bought these sooner 
26232 Quick shipment and good value! 
26233 Cool price. It s republished but good work. I can access easily by internet & my smart phone. 
26234 Fits on the Nikon 7100d camera 
26235 Stopped working after 3 months. 
26236 fits perfect, very easy to use. I plan to purchase one for every lens I have. 
26237 Speedy delivery, chest strap holds camera in place when shooting video on motorcycle. Happy with product. 
26238 received the pen in only 2 days. looks very simple to use. charging now and going to use it right away. does not look cheaply made. and the pen even writes. 
26239 This was a present for my wife to replace the Cannon she has had for many years. She loves it and the great pictures she takes. 
26240 As its suppose to, it fits my lens. John 
26241 Only work once 
26242 Perfect love it 
26243 It scraped by lens body, leaving a permanent mark of scratch. 
26244 Just what i needed an extra charging cord. 
26245 Great surveillance system. Cheap but does the job perfectly. 
26246 It s well made and my service dog enjoys it 
26247 It is 1600mAh vs 1060 in the original battery, but the original battery is heavier and lasts longer. 
26248 Thanks, it was on time delivery and the pro woks well 
26249 the top part of the tripod where the go pro screws on broke off the first time i used it. the plastic just stright up broke. if it hadn t borken so easily the concept of the wraparound legs is great. 
26250 Fits camera great. No room for nothing else. 
26251 good color with light, good night vision with IR enabled. Never thought my families are so closer with me and it 
26252 hard to get on the computer 
26253 Hoya makes good filters for reasonable prices. This one is great for making longer exposures of outdoor subjects such as waterfalls. 
26254 Was an outstanding birthday gift at a fraction of the price you would find at a big box retailer store such as best buy 
26255 A little small 
26256 Just what I needed great 
26257 Awesome little bag especially for use around the house and short trips with cannon camera 
26258 good product 
26259 everything works great except WI-FI, luckily at my business it was easy to connect to modem by cable, which works better with no pause for movement,need better instructions and problem solving, still worth it. 
26260 Very crappy material. Won t last long. Poor Poor quality! It s also very light and the slightest bit of wind will have it down the street. 
26261 Perfect for football season. I m going to pick up some extras. 
26262 Works grest 
26263 Great price on this great lens for getting that long shot of birds. Plus the super fast next day delivery was amazing. Thanks big mikes great service and products. I m sure I will buy more products from you. 
26264 Excellent product!!! 
26265 This camera is great. Telephoto shots are amazing. Love everything about this camera and cannot beat the great price! It is everything I need for London. You need the extra battery. 
26266 Used this with my Action Cam 200 and was very impressed with it. Very versatile as well. 
26267 This Camera was a used replacement for an identical camera I already had and it is great. My favorite when it comes to picture taking, so much so that I will be ordering another before this one wears out like my old one did. 
26268 They work, but it took a buncha effort to make the lighting and everything work, and even after that I needed to Photoshop it. 
26269 Works just fine. No frills, just does exactly what it says on the tin. 
26270 as a battery grip its great. but after 1 month the connection port for the grips shutter button broke. 
26271 I love this selfie stick good quality pretty sturdy 
26272 My favorite camera bag thus far. IT has plenty of space for my sony alpha 600 and go pro 4 gear. It is stylish and rugged. I am extremely happy with this purchase :) 
26273 decent but not great 
26274 I love this camera, works great for business and personal use 
26275 Does the trick for the price. Bottom plastic pieces are weak. 
26276 Arrived ahead of schedule. Great price. Works well. 
26277 Piece of crap 
26278 Excellent cameras and buyer was also available for a question. 
26279 Fit exact to AW130 givin aditional scratch protection and a waterproof toy look 
26280 Cameras need a small magnet and if u lose it and the camera loses power u have no way to reset the camera leaving it worthless wouldn t recommend this product 
26281 Just one word...Excellent!!! 
26282 Excelent 
26283 I though can be pair with any smart phones,android including Nokia Lumia that s why I bought it. But won t be able to used it the Bluetooth doesn t work with my phone otherwise have to used the timer. Little bit Disappointed! 
26284 The item was better than i expected. The fact that it had 50mm objective lens, the &#34;resolution&#34; is awesome! Easier to work with than binoculars i.e focusing on the object, looking through the eye piece, etc. definitely recommend! 
26285 It seems OK, I have not as yet used it myself, but my son said it seems OK 
26286 Amazing 
26287 i was expecting at least the cd driver for it 
26288 Functions exactly as intended 
26289 excellent service and product 
26290 Over all so so product. You get what you pay for. For this price it is a good bag for normal rough usage. Plenty of pockets and space. I dont like the strap but you can always attach a better one. It arrived on time actually same day. 
26291 I love the flexibility. It s better than the tripods that don t bend. 
26292 great transaction. Product as described 
26293 It is incredible, also amazon has packed me very well the lens, in an excellent State lleog and besides having excellent optics lens. 
26294 Honestly, I wasn t expecting much. But the picture quality is not good. I am very disappointed. Battery life is horrible. Slow to respond. Flash has to charge and it takes a few seconds. Just all around not much bang for your buck. 
26295 Lov 
26296 Great value. Individually wrapped for convenience. 
26297 Meets all my expectations for my digital images!!! 
26298 Very good 
26299 Came as advertised. Sharp focus and easy to handle. 
26300 good for bikes but wont fit on bigger pipes, railings 
26301 Love Moose Peterson s polarizer - works & warms as it s supposed to- hoya has been around forever 
26302 Yet to use this bag but my Canon SX-520 and accessories fit in well. 
26303 It s great to have backup batteries for the camera. 
26304 They work great and they are a fantastic price. 
26305 Worked like a charm! 
26306 Finally got a deal on it. I had a 102 before and loved it. Gave it to my in law and get this one. It is big for sure. But same high quality as 102. 
26307 5 star, bigger than advertised- it is 9.5 x 6.5 x 3 inches- well padded, and easily holds my canon SX110 Is camera and a charger. 
26308 Just as described, on time delivery= happy customer! 
26309 I absolutely love this camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
26310 Bought this for my husbands birthday. He loves it. Light. Easy to carry. Stable. 
26311 works great 
26312 I love this lens! Thanks so very much! 
26313 plastic feels okay not the best 
26314 Be nice if this actually fit. P3 s need a lot of cutting. Still does not fit correctly. Phantom sits way to high which is now prone to damage and controller does not fit. Not impresses. 
26315 False advertising as it said 1000tvl on the description. Never buy anything under 1000tvl! Huge picture difference from my experience. 
26316 Very nice lens for my Nikon Dd3100 
26317 Works great 
26318 The product is way more then I expected. 
26319 Fit very nicely and did what it was suppose to do. For the price, I def recommend this product! 
26320 SUCKS Sucks sucks sucks Don t waste your money. Can t even get it to work!!! Waste of time! 
26321 Shipping great. Perfect gift 
26322 Left our charger at home on our trip. Was able to order this and get it shipped to where we were staying. Werks perfets and was just what we needed with great shipping. 
26323 Did not meet expectation and returned for a refund 
26324 Very Good product , not bad at all , the hand grip is very short , that s the only down side for me thus far , it s not suited for huge Cameras , of course , other than that , works very Good for me :) 
26325 slow in charging. My Nikon chargers are twice as fast. With the power supply I still have two pieces except with this charger only one plug is needed 
26326 Bought this on a whim. There are many products. Would advise getting something which gives more control over white balance. The filters are not ideal The color tones on face is variable. Price is okay. 
26327 Item failed to work properly! 
26328 It mounts the nvd on the head. No need to give it the hose again. 
26329 I did devolution of this product... 
26330 Very nice. 
26331 I researched many types of home security solutions and Canary ended up being my choice. I m happy with what I ve received for my investment. 
26332 I love this camera!! Underwater and not even in water it gives really good HD quality. I really enjoy using it on all the adventures I have with my family! 
26333 I added an electronic dead bolt to my alarm system. This key fob turns off the alarm and unlocks my front door. Very handy when coming home with an arm load of grocery etc. 
26334 Worked as hoped for. Prompt delivery. Good price. Thanks a million. 
26335 I m very pleased with my product. I traveled for 15 days and not failed. I m very happy with my Selfie Bluetooth Shutter Wireless Remote Control. Thanks Noot. 
26336 Easy to install and the iPhone app is Fantastic. Been very happy for the last two months. 
26337 Little on the heavy side But good camera 
26338 So I ve been walking with this every morning and it makes me feel a bit safer. It s small enough I can hold it in my hand and love the chain I can wear on my neck when needed. Hopefully I will never have to use it! 
26339 works great. 
26340 No complaints with the product. FYI - it does not come with a memory card, you have to purchase one separately. I wish I had know ahead of time since this was a gift, and I could have purchased one at the same time of my original order. 
26341 I take it to water parks and rivers. It s taken a beating yet looks great and functions as expected. 
26342 Love this bag. It fit my camera perfectly, I love how it has so many different compartments and pockets to store all the accessories or gadgets I want to bring along with me. 
26343 Great way to go OTA and still be able to record favorite programs etc. 
26344 So far works for my needs. The apps need improvement. Four stars is due to long wait time for customer support 20min to an hour on average. Danny was very helpful in assisting me with the product set up. 
26345 good and cute camera. Very good quality photos, and pretty easy to use 
26346 This battery works like a charm. My first impressions were that it had a nice fit, very good power capacity, and works exactly like the OEM. I can t really tell the difference between this and my Canon battery. Good buy for a budget professional! 
26347 Works well and we used it underwater with no problem. 
26348 Poor quality. Not worth the money. 
26349 Camera works well.. in and out of the water. Was very pleased with this item 
26350 works very well with our GoPro Hero2 
26351 Fantastic, works great 
26352 it s alright 
26353 Very good 
26354 I ve been looking for this waterprrof action cam. This is very great! 
26355 Excellent product delivered on time. 
26356 It doesn t fit what it says it fits very clearly, did not fit my lenses and according to the info, it should have fit them. 
26357 Does the job 
26358 Ok little setup grief. Quality decent. Worth the $$$$ 
26359 The attachment strap unraveled after two uses. Don t count on it as a sole means of attaching anything to your wrist. 
26360 Smaller than I anticipated but I like that it can fold up easily for my camera bag. I was a little surprised it said that it expires in two years seeing as it costs a lot for a small item. I look forward to using it. 
26361 Quaity product as expected. 
26362 It does the job well. 
26363 My wife needed the hoods and lens cover, this kit provided all and more! Timely shipping, too. Thanks! 
26364 Love the props! 
26365 Cut and dry it s a great case, and is well made..does the job nicely... 
26366 Good so far for the price! 
26367 Great product, great value 
26368 Just ok but nothing great. Fisheye can be better. 
26369 These batteries seem to last slightly longer than the stock battery that came with my gopro hero 4. 
26370 I do a lot of kayak fishing and this works perfectly to keep my gopro safe and in view if I ever lose it. Definitely helps ease the mind in case I m clumsy or if it takes a dive. 
26371 This won t completely get rid of wind noise, but it will cut down on it considerably. 
26372 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
26373 DOA 
26374 Functional but wish there is a LCD screen to see what is being recorded. 
26375 It fits the camera and is basically like putting sunglasses on your lens. 
26376 Paired easily with SmartThings and works great. My only problem is you can t control the timeout reset. It s default is 4 minutes to reset as other reviewers have stated. You can change the jumpers to test mode and this allows it to reset as soon as motion stops. 
26377 It is not Hero but ;-))) 
26378 Great 
26379 Amazing manual focus wide angle. Super sharp and great color rendition. I use it on my D810 for long exposures. Would definitely recommend it if you don t need the autofocus. 
26380 User manual was the size of a stamp. Too much complicated for the user. 
26381 The bar looks great and sturdy with rollers inside to glide and slide. Unfortunately, it came today with a broken screw necessary for adjusting the tension for sliding. Pretty much an important piece... 
26382 Great price, very fast shipping. 
26383 What s not to like? A solid performer at a great price, you can t go wrong. 
26384 Received a Chinese PAL version of this camera, yeah, like THAT should even be sold to a US customer... Contacted Dahua support for assistance, they told me to go to the supplier for firmware.. First and last Dahua product I ll buy... 
26385 Works just as described, great option to buying OEM 
26386 This pair of binoculars performed adequately but the family much preferred the Pentax Marine Boat 8 x 25. The strap never functioned properly. 
26387 no as good as they said the wood be 
26388 This is my second DLink. And EVEN BETTER than the last one. I love the tilt and pan features. I highly recommend. But remember- if you are on a VPN from your company- turn it off to set this up. Speeds up the process! 
26389 they work 
26390 Works as described. The pinhole gives a very narrow view for playback. While recording one of the lights continues to flash, no car remote does that and its something that will bring attention to your undercover work. Putting your finger over it works 
26391 excellent quality and size, perfect for mirrorless camera! Looks so cute too. 
26392 My son asked for this along with a gorilla pod for Christmas for his Fuji camera and he loved it. 
26393 legs are no as stable.. ok for the cost range 
26394 Nice camera! 
26395 Awesome Flash at such a budget price. Features and controls are easy to access and ETTL worked just fine. 
26396 Film took too long to expose and pictures were not as clear as compared to old pack of real Polaroid Film. Would not buy again 
26397 If you need the size, you can t beat this case. Expensive, but well worth it when needing to protect something. 
26398 Great batteries, hopefully I wont need them anytime soon. These will be backups for one of my rifle optics. 
26399 Excellent quality and price point compared to other similar multi-mounts bars. The two end threads are 3/8&#34; only and not interchangeable, so just be aware. The two TOP threads are 1/4&#34; and 3/8&#34; interchangeable. 
26400 Fulfills all of my FPV needs. Highly recommend a Shade also... 
26401 Purchased for my wife as an extra safety when she has to walk to her car in the dark after she gets off work. A quick test showed it is good and loud - and will be one more thing to make here feel safer. 
26402 it doesn t show battery amount in a flip 
26403 Pack is amazing, Camera it self a good gadget 
26404 It s very roomy and versatile. 
26405 Ridiculously easy to set up. Everything works. I love it. 
26406 Good in all sense. 
26407 Very satisfied with the quality of the camera and zoom 
26408 Works well as expected! 
26409 Only sharp with ideal lighting. Other wise not so sharp. Save your money and buy a carl zeiss or l lens or 50mm f1.4 by canon. 
26410 Disappointed with the video quality but for the money what would you expect? It has now become my dash cam. 
26411 There is a lot of confusion regarding which props should be used on a P3. This listing, the information and shipping speed made all the problems go away. Just what I needed with a minimum of hassles. 
26412 Lot of softbox for the money...why complain about anything with value like this...I use a manfrotto umbrella adaptor to attach it with led panel...led sits up high but it works...the diffusion is fairly strong, but it s soft--clean light 
26413 This camera is perfect for capturing memories in picture and video form. We love it! 
26414 Very satisfied! Product as described! Charged my Nikon P330 camera battery completely. No complaints. 
26415 Great buy and it works very well. Recommend this product. 
26416 Worked great with my Foscam indoor to angle it out a window. 
26417 I mean... I THINK I ll love it as much as my mindshift 180 back-pack.... I m just waiting for some rain to test it out!? 
26418 This is my second pair.. bought them for my wife..excellent binoculars! 
26419 Perfect with the Celestron Skymaster 25X70 
26420 Great product Will be purchasing this again 
26421 works ok, it s a battery 
26422 Great bag. Have had it for years and it hardly shows any wear. Very versatile. 
26423 Outstanding image quality, excellent low light capabilities producing minimum noise, compact but powerful. Incorporates many features normally found in mid to high level DSLRs, three video formats producing high quality 1080 HD video. However, due in large part to the camera s extensive functionality, it is somewhat complex and complicated. 
26424 Great product and less cost than Nikon. 
26425 This works well. 
26426 Great 
26427 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
26428 Not sturdy. Just OK for a very light camera! 
26429 Worked great for about a month until it randomly broke. Very upset about this product. It would have been a great product had it actually been reliable and not easily breakable. 
26430 Perfect 
26431 Great Kit, lots of extra items that I don t have to purchase separately. 
26432 I love the camera Lafavre camera in the world 
26433 SD Memory card slot not working had to send it back. Got a new one that worked 
26434 Eccellent 
26435 Great Product 
26436 Excellent use on motorcycle. Good quality already dropped them and it didn t even phase them and the recording ability...tough and durable 
26437 Extremely poor quality, Lens covered with scratches, would not recommend. 
26438 Works good 
26439 Works 
26440 This is a neat little gadget - surprisingly effective and dirt simple to use. A lot of bang for the buck. Should be fun for you kids or grandkids, but also useful for an adult as well. Provides detail well beyond that visible with a magnifying glass. 
26441 I find that is diffuses the flash more than it softens it. for the price it is great, but does not produce soft box quality 
26442 VERY Nice Product and Shipped even Faster that Promised! Thank you! Its a Plus that this cable has fittings attached..Great Quality Product! 
26443 Creates a great curve for close objects but back up a few steps and you just get the world around your subject.. 
26444 nice priced small camera 
26445 Clear pictures and great value. Night vision mode reflects the IR light off the window pane and washes out the picture. I m sure there is a solution to remedy this issue, but haven t had the time to look. 
26446 Super fun! Take it every where! 
26447 great light 
26448 I get compliments on this case all the time. I m glad I purchased it. It looks so classy. 
26449 Fantastic case. Fits the camera perfectly and very nicely made. I highly recommend it!! 
26450 Less expensive allowed me to buy two for the price of one gopro battery. 
26451 Not sure if it s a knock off, came in a package labeled gopro, took about 5 min to change and it s like the damage never happened 
26452 as described, no issues 
26453 The camera not only has the good quality,but also offer the best services,besides the price of the product is reasonable. 
26454 This little camera is so much fun and my daughter has absolutely loved using it. It takes decent pictures, is quick, and easy to operate. Lots of fun to have with this! 
26455 Great product. Easy to insert and takes great photo s! 
26456 Perfect for use 
26457 This does not work with my T3i, they said that T3i and 600D are the same... this is not correct. this does not turn on my camera with the batteries or even the Li-po batteries 
26458 Very pleased. Great price, quick shipping. 
26459 Is exactly what I need. It fits perfectly on my fuji x-t1. Highly recommend it to fuji x-t1 owner. Great product! 
26460 Works great, now my youngest son thinks it s his camera and gets greatly offended when we try to take it back. Bobber does exactly as intended, let the big kids go down slides holding it and taking fun videos and don t have to worry about the camera disappearing. 
26461 It didn t work so i returned it. refund was back on card before it even made it back to rma site. Thank you 
26462 Golf product 
26463 Very good,I likes it..... 
26464 A total Waste of $money$ for anyone who cares to not get ripped off. They are playing with your imagination by marketing this product as worth the savings. Flat out lies. Cant say you weren t warned here first. Good Luck 
26465 All of the accessories are great. I tried all of them on the day the camera was received. Great! 
26466 Great mirrorless digital canera 
26467 works good 
26468 we use these in our beach condo. perfect for dolphin watching 
26469 This tripod is exactly what I wanted. The legs can be moved but securely hold their position. Besides that, it is very stylish looking:) 
26470 Works great 
26471 nice, even have a you-tube video to tell you how to use it 
26472 Does not fit pictinnay rail as it should but nothing a few zip ties couldn t fix. 
26473 THESE ARE REAL CHEEP , BATTERY SWITCH DOES NOT WORK , THEY DO LOOK REAL 
26474 I carry it with me as a spare in case the one I usually use meets with misfortune. It has a lot of useful features. 
26475 Quality is good and quick delivery. 
26476 It s a nice little protector of the elements. 
26477 Just as described. Received very timely. 
26478 Great strap. Very happy with this purchase. Now I can wear my camera across my body, so my neck does not get sore. 
26479 I received this device free-of-charge for the purpose of testing and publishing this review (Netgear s Friends and Family program). It s a beautiful product and very easy to setup and config. I like it! 
26480 Bought the camera and it seems like its well made. Called customer service; they are a joke. 44 minutes on hold. overseas &quot;specialist&quot; had the nerve to tell me that it was past their closing time and told me to call back tomorrow. Unbelievable. Their customer service is a joke....... 
26481 Excellent both in value and quick delivery. The six pack is perfect for purse and traveling. I use for my readers, IPad, IPhone and flat screen TV s. Washable as well with just water. 
26482 Quality is Meh, but it works well. This particular one is extremely difficult to attach to the pelican lid, as your screwdriver must reach the screw THROUGH the mesh pockets. If that sounds dumb, it is. I wouldn t have a pelican without this, but the design is lacking. 
26483 Ready to use straight from the box 
26484 Photos and description of the product led me to believe this timer had connectors for multiple camera types. It does not. The pictures show an interchangeable connector. The model I received does not. It will only work with one of my cameras. Very disappointed! 
26485 The tripod holds my Nikon camera pretty well. It s not as sturdy as I imagined it would be but if you re on a budget it ll do the job! 
26486 Seems to be of very high quality and screwed into my 18-135mm Canon lens without fuss. Clarity is perfect, and, protects the front lens as well as reducing UV light. 
26487 I couldn t get them to work. 
26488 Great price!!! 
26489 Excellent product 
26490 Cheap in price and in quality. The cameras did not last even a year. It is better to pay a bit more and get a quality product. SHould have known when the warranty is only for 3 months. 
26491 is so nice... good quality 
26492 Really nice camera for the price. I did not need the WiFi feature of the GoPro so this was a great alternative. 
26493 Good fit and made especially for my lens 
26494 Very good! 
26495 Good Deal! 
26496 These brackets are poorly made! The swivel mechanism does not hold the camera securely in place. Therefore the camera will just hang loosely! Save your money and buy better quality brackets from Netgear! 
26497 Use it to mount 80X spotting scope at the shooting range. Very stable with sturdy legs. Would recommend for spotting scopes and cameras. Well built tripod. 
26498 All I can say that this is the best filter case I have ever came across....It s padded well, and made well....I highly recommend this case to everyone... 
26499 Great! I use this often, it comes in handy when I need to bring only some of my equipment. 
26500 Henry assisted me in installing my app for foscam,the cameras are easy to set up and customer service was great. 
26501 Excellent higher quality selfie-stick - it s worth paying a few extra dollars. It clamps your cell phone firmly in place and is fully adjustable for length, camera angle, etc. I have only used it with my phone but it also has an attachment to secure a digital camera. 
26502 Great for Mid Size Camera and Enough storage Great Protection Just What I needed 
26503 Bien 
26504 I m still a novice, so I don t really know what this is used for. The product is ok, but, I ordered the wrong size. 
26505 I have used this so far in my pool. and it works fine 
26506 Has a nive grip on on it , that doesn t hold water .. Feels like this will hold up for a long time 
26507 I love them! 
26508 So far they are working good. Holds a charge well 
26509 Glass was warped so it wouldn t seal about 3/4&#34; edge on one side. 
26510 This little camera fits in a shirt pocket so it is easy to take on a hike in the woods or anywhere else. 
26511 This case works great. It has pockets and compartments useful for all my gear. it even came with a cleaning cloth. 
26512 Customer service is great, and the product really sucks (to the thing you want it to.) Comes with a tether too for piece of mind for all those times you mount it to a moving vehicle (the entire reason I bought it) 
26513 The only Camara I have ever bought, over 20, that didn t come with a lense cap?!? Camera does NOT shoot RAW even though the listing says it does. 
26514 The tripod is flimsy, and the bag has an ugly logo affixed to it. But for the price I got what I paid for; the little SD card transfer thingie is definitely nice to have. 
26515 Fujifilm manufactured battery that is identical in appearance to the one supplied with the camera. Expensive (as are all OEM batteries) but expect it to last the course unlike a lot of the third party cheaper substitutes. 
26516 Very good 
26517 Came quickly and appear to be good quality. Will see as I use them 
26518 Good optics but heavy to hold long and hard to hold steady enough to prevent visual blurring. Should stick with the seven power. 
26519 These are just handy to have 
26520 Easy to use. Can attach to stands or hand hold. 
26521 resolution has alittle to be desired but functioned as descibed 
26522 A great bag to protect our Canon, with extra pockets for misc. 
26523 Perfect product! Nice price! Fast delivery! 
26524 Sturdy and works as advertised. Definitely not something to get though if you re looking for portability. 
26525 prefect size for a work desk! 
26526 The idea for this product is great, but the rotating peg comes off its base pretty easily. 
26527 I love the case. It came on time and it is perfect for my Fuji mini 8 camera! 
26528 working well as expected for 960h 
26529 Bought this item TWICE. First time one of the light fixtures would not work. Second time, was shorted the 2nd LED light bulb. Purchased to take pictures of product to sell online. Workspace is a little small, but takes up a LOT of room to set up. 
26530 Great product, great price and delivered on time. What is not to like. Highly recommended. This got here before the camera so I had the batteries all charged up ready for my camera which arrived the next day. 
26531 as described 
26532 Quality is good. It is tough to steam the wrinkles out of the fabric, but when used with good lighting and wrinkle free chromakey works perfectly. 
26533 Great product for the pric 
26534 Ipurchased this camera for my 10 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It takes good quality pictures and is easy to use. 
26535 Love this lens! 
26536 Outstanding!! 
26537 I love that little camera. It is amazing, and would ve been so at twice the price! 
26538 The boom is great, the clamp is great, the height of the stand sucks if I plan to use it to hold my hair light. It just doesn t go high enough. Until I find a taller stand, I m relegating this setup to who knows what. 
26539 Excelente. 
26540 Doesn t record when plugged in. It only recorded in 20-minute segments and the battery doesn t past long even after it has been fully charged. Don t waste your time and money on this. 
26541 Great!! 
26542 awesome slider, would ve gotten the full 5 stars if it was able to mount up to a tripod. but for this price you cant beat it! awesome for the type of shooting that i m doing which is car meets! 
26543 Not bad but not that good.... =) 
26544 very difficult to be used. I bought it for my father and he dosn t use it at all, because is very tricky. I will I can return. Not a good product. 
26545 I love this camera, I had it for a few months now and I keep discovering new things. The pictures this takes are beautiful! This is my first DSLR and I couldn t be more pleased. 
26546 It s a Canon. 
26547 Very good baby cam/security cam! Setup is a breeze, and picture quality is awesome 
26548 Super tough strength holding my cabinet in place. Easy to install but remember the two white wires coming from the front of the unit are not needed unless you are using an alarm system and want to be notified when the door is open. 
26549 works great 
26550 This is for Canon new FD mount. Old Canon mount with breech lock can mount, but it cannot lock properly. As a result, the aperture control does not work for breech lock lenses. 
26551 Does the job. Package arrived quickly. 
26552 works as expected. The chromium finish fades/scratches after some use though. 
26553 Bought this to use as decor for a friend s apartment (she s a film student) For anyone using it for actual productions, you ll probably have to superglue the magnets on the inside of the clapper, mine came falling out. 
26554 This product does not work with nikon d3300. After I plugged it into the camera, the camera will not power up. I checked the nikon battery EN-EL14a states 7.2 V, 1230mAh. This charger states 9V, 5A. You have been warned. 
26555 Excellent product. A must for anyone who owns a BMPCC! 
26556 Works great!!!! 
26557 Great feeling grip, batteries do their thing...but after a few days of shooting, the shutter button on the grip stopped working. It will work half-shutter, but not full. Will have to return for a fix... UPDATE: I just slapped it, and it started working again 
26558 great system 
26559 Fits perfect no problems at all. 
26560 Great product and arrived on time 
26561 Loved it and would recommend it. 
26562 Cheap and not at all like the photo. Looks like a sheet that someone tried to clean a paintbrush on with blue paint on it. Sucks, 
26563 This item arrived exactly as it was suppose to ! The lenses are great! Takes creativity to a new level ! 
26564 Thanks for the items, very fast delivery. 
26565 So hard to find 35MM film now, however, I still appreciate the quality of film. Digital is great, but I believe there is still a place for film - particularly with fine art. 
26566 I did not like we can use to many problem with installation 
26567 I think it is excellent for the price. Not super duty but will get the job done. For balance it is best to align the lights with one of the legs. I plan to lengthen the legs 5 or 6 inches with 1/2 inch aluminum rod for better stability. 
26568 The two batteries simply doesn t work! My Lumix 5 doesn t recognise it. Charger is fine. 
26569 Very Good. 
26570 never worked! 
26571 Makes everyone look beautiful 
26572 what do you say about batteries and a charger other than they work? 
26573 it s ok 
26574 Film was great! 
26575 USELESS! 
26576 So far its decent. No leaks. The remote function (connect to phone app) doesnt work. Color is lacking. But not bad for the price. 
26577 Nice case and set up for camera. Its a bit pricey is why I only have it 4 stars 
26578 Been in use for years with 0 issues whatsoever. Even beating the hell out of it on ATVs, swimming at the beach with it, etc. 
26579 Tons of parts all work great! Broke a bolt trying to fit it through some pieces are tight and case is floppy. Not as sturdy as i expected 
26580 Not excelent quality but very useful. 
26581 😀 
26582 Crooked, won t seat straight. I have another soft release that will. So, yeah. Not great. 
26583 Excellent 
26584 too small and broke immediately 
26585 The resolution is good; sometimes I connected it with my pc. It can be mounted on a wall, or dash or wherever too, and it has a screw to tighten it at that angle for good viewing. 
26586 Very useful. Thx. 
26587 Works great thank goodness it s all metal unlike some other items I ve ordered 
26588 Perfect 
26589 Nice Product 
26590 No memory card , no reader, used battery, mismatched case, No instructions, no tripod, Camera seems used also 
26591 Works as advertised, I love it 
26592 Perfect size and quality product!! 
26593 Tried this as a replacement for my broken latch, this one broke within a week. 
26594 Can t get it smooth. It s like cardboard 
26595 The charger supplied with my new Fuji X-T1 uses a full size power cord, taking up way too much space in my camera bag. This one is much smaller and can be plugged into A USB Charger. Works great at a very good price. Recommended. 
26596 Quality and Good Price! 
26597 Works great! I use this for my Canon 5D Mark II all the time for film production. Doesn t last as long as a Canon battery of course, but does the job perfectly! 
26598 Fun Item, but GPS is not working properly 
26599 I loved that I bought this combo in less than a week I already finished the pack but I had some amazing pics instantly 
26600 works great with my 67mm lens. 
26601 Price was very good. 
26602 book needs a lot of work. We are not all professionals. 
26603 Excellent picture on the two I purchased, but one of them stopped working after two days 
26604 A gift and she truly loves it. 
26605 Jest what I wanted 
26606 They are so awesome! I will order as soon as they are gone, Great value and great items! 
26607 Hands free, comfortable, well made. I fits me well- 5-11, 195 lbs. I just hiked half dome and wish I had this, I couldn t film the cable climb because I needed both hands and didn t trust my head mount. I highly recommend. 
26608 It seems hard plastic , but glue use to keep the pole falls apart out of the box, i needed to use epoxy to put it back together again in the first try 
26609 Good price 
26610 Fits well but scratches easily! Better products out there! 
26611 Battery does not last.never used but no power after 1 month.original gossen pro meter battery lasted many years. 
26612 the up/down swivel does not work on the product i received. The product also does not come with instructions. So you have to guess which knobs to tighten and which latches do what. 
26613 Lets me use 77mm filters on my A6000 s kit lens. Thanks for making this in this odd size! 
26614 For the price you pay for this it s an awesome product. Here s a link to my personal test. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xbO0BYp2qk&sns=em 
26615 Easy to use, Not big for travel, good quality picture 
26616 thank you 
26617 Its ok for the price 
26618 This works great. Glad I got it for my NexStar 4 
26619 I Love it.. cant wait to start taking pictures!! Thanks 
26620 Excellent, as described in the publication I received, the delivery was fast without mishap, satisfied 100% 
26621 Just as described and quick shipping. 
26622 Works like a charm. Lost the charger this fits and works 
26623 Quality is great! 
26624 Good Value for the price. i like the texture of the bag. 
26625 It was fast I received my pen before Sept 10th I love this thank you 
26626 like the cameras alot, did need the tech support it was very helpful.thank you terry morgan 
26627 Works well! 
26628 No good doesn t work 
26629 did not detect motion outside, even if it did the sound was to low 
26630 I don t like typing 
26631 This item was replacement for a damaged screen. 
26632 Attached to my selfie stick for my gopro. Floats work great, easy to attach, and when tested, didn t even get close to letting the stick sink. 
26633 i love it! perfect size and everything! and the film doesnt cost too much either. i chose the free standard shipping and it took like a week and a few days to come but other than that it is great! 
26634 very nice i like it ! 
26635 powers the equipment I bought it for 
26636 Had to return product - did not work. 
26637 Worked out. 
26638 It is kinda expensive for only 10 but it came really fast 
26639 Great camera takes great pictures. I have to say I was influenced by all those Ashton Kutcher commercials. A really great value ! 
26640 Didn t hold a charge 
26641 No where in the description does it say refurbished. Guess what I received? A refurb. No paperwork. No instructions. Nothing. Its going right back out today. 
26642 Works great. 
26643 Reliable mount at an affordable price! 
26644 Durable. The middle insert that raises will sway if not held, so u need a shutter release to use it that high. Other than that, I m happy with the tripod. 
26645 perfect. 
26646 Very happy with this item. Would recommend to friends. And to the people who gave it a negative review, if you re looking for thousand dollar results,,,,buy a thousand dollar system! I am extremely happy with all functions of this system! Arrived before scheduled delivery date, works great! 
26647 I connected this camera to my phone and Wifi very easily. Very clear picture. 
26648 yup 
26649 works ok, but you can not use it with a tripod unless you anchor the bottom with a rubberband. That is what I did and it works pretty good. 
26650 I bought this for my husband who had all his go-pro stuff strung out all over the house to try to get it in one place. I was very impressed with the quality and it really does hold a lot of go-pro accessories. 
26651 It purchased for a friend and he is really enjoying the quality of the pictures this lens takes. 
26652 Nice glass! I m happy with my purchase. 
26653 This little camera is lightweight, takes great pictures and is very reliable. 
26654 Hi- Haven t used mine yet, but bought on the strong recommendation of my Marine Science major / scuba diver son and West Marine in Santa Barbara Harbor, who sells them but did not have the color I wanted. 
26655 What a scam plz read the fine print before buying 
26656 Excellent lens. Works well with my Nikon d3200. 
26657 perfect 
26658 The cost is great. 
26659 The seller sent out the camera really fast. My two kids took no time to put it together and learned how to take the videos and photos. The camera looks nice, compact, and well made. Look forward to using it in our upcoming trip. Thanks. 
26660 exactly what i purchased 
26661 Perfect 
26662 I love this lense. I am not a pro but I think this is a great lense. 
26663 What i expected 
26664 The product arrived quickly and within the time frame that was given. Everything was in clean working order and worked great for the shoot I needed them for. Thank you! 
26665 Fantastic,easy to install 
26666 Item is as described. Works great. 
26667 This is a great entry level camera. I received it sooner than I was told (a big plus) and with everything listed. As a newbie to DSLR cameras, I m really glad it came with the book. I d recommend getting an extra battery. 
26668 Thin and light but appear very strong - easy setup with just about any standard camera strap from thin to wide. 
26669 Very nice camera for my daughter 
26670 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
26671 Does the job. 
26672 Great security item for my yard 
26673 Just got back from a vacation that included Yosemitie National Park and Sanfrancisco. Great Photos, and still learning how to take advantage of this great lens. Make sure your tripod can handle this glass lens. 
26674 It s ok. I m looking into getting another battery with a larger mAh capacity. The trick is to make sure all batteries are fully powered before leaving for an event. 
26675 Loved this backpack and the color. I took it on my month long trip to Europe and now Puerto Rico. Great quality! 
26676 Great purchase! Perfect for anyone that does outdoor activities! Good to have the lcd screen to playback footage! 
26677 Excellent quality for this size camera! I use it in my classroom...the students enjoy capturing important moments. Bought one for my grandson with the camera case, and he loves using it as well. Great camera for the price. 
26678 Absolutely love this background. 
26679 Awesome product and gives much needed rigidity to the cameras frame. Would highly recommend this to anyone shooting with the sony A7 line. 
26680 Perfect fit 
26681 great locking holder 
26682 excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
26683 Just as good as the factory original. 
26684 Great price on a multicoated filter to protect my lens. 
26685 I bought 2 batteries. 1 battery holds average charge for 1600 mAh for about 1.5 hours, another just half of that. 
26686 I use it as binoculars for which it is ok, not enough power for star gazing 
26687 I installed this system very quickly. The setup instructions could be a little clearer to understand but what s there is adequate. the system performs as advertised. I would have liked the master unit support wireless between it and modem. Other than that the system performs very nicely. 
26688 The products are awsome. The cases are very nice and protect a lot the filter and close-up lenses. 
26689 Couldn t get it to work with my system. Don t know if it was a problem with the product or just compatibility issues. 
26690 Was very impressed with this case. It will definitely protect the camera. The slinged holder also will absorb any bumps if it should happen. The light weight also is a great plus. Would definitely recommend to a friend. 
26691 Flawless. 
26692 good fit for camera. 
26693 Awesome POV! Camera is easy to access and out of the way! 
26694 Henry, he is Professional tech, he help me to set up the camera. 
26695 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
26696 So much good and fun footage... check it out on youtube as 5280sky Enjoy!! 
26697 Love this camdera and love the price. Still learning all the features. Happy so far. 
26698 I got my case quickly and it was exactly what I wanted. 
26699 great quality. works well with screen cleaners/sprays. 
26700 Looks pretty, but it comes folded in a small envelope. It is basically the material of a thick shower curtain and I was not able to get rid of the fold creases. 
26701 Extra duration and less dollars is an excellent combination. This battery is more fragile than sony so I recommend you be careful when carrying it and keeping stored. Also works fine with neewer and yongnuo led lights 
26702 Applicator would not release from the film making it impossible to apply without creating air bubbles. Product arrived much sooner than predicted and was properly packaged. 
26703 One easy to use camera, great size, the zoom is more than great. Try it you won t be disappointed 
26704 Battery arrived promptly and works as expected. 
26705 Bad apps. Two way sound is poor quality. 
26706 Better than the ones with rubber band 
26707 Great product 
26708 Love Wasabi Power. They just know how to get it done. Works perfectly for my GoPro Hero 4 Black just like the OEM from GoPro but half the price. Get this, it s a no brainer. 
26709 Arrived on time, great film 
26710 Excellent quality as expected. Used to view archery competition and needed to be able to see fine detail. Bright and clear with little to no eye fatigue with long periods of continuous viewing. Used bi-pod support which I highly recommend with this power level. 
26711 Great! 
26712 This product is very good for those who are amateurs in Gopro film 
26713 great bundle! great compact camera! can t put it down. 
26714 Great grip for vertical photos without adding a lot of weight. 
26715 it works 
26716 I like it 
26717 instructions are microscopic and in very poor english. its being used as a real clothes hook because i dont want to throw it out 
26718 the charger worked great but the batteries do not work at all 
26719 So far so good! The burned smell really kills it though... 
26720 the best 
26721 Best deal online, was well packaged. Fast delivery, so far all of the pictures came out great, have not had any blanks or problems with the film. 
26722 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
26723 Quality camera at a nice price. I bought the wide-angle for my quadcopter. Will get another Mobius soon with the original lens for everyday use. Very easy to use and quality video! 
26724 As others have noted, slides keep getting stuck inside and have to be removed with tweezers. Since that is the only moving part, I had hoped that they would have solved the problem. They have not. 
26725 Piece of junk. Shifts on it own. Lenses loose. Rattles. 
26726 Picture is OK. I would spend the little more and get the 1000tvl. That s what I did and I m very happy with the higher quality picture. 
26727 works just as stated 
26728 still trying to install 
26729 instructions are useless. not very happy. may return 
26730 The kit has really everything I need to capture a video in any situation, very useful and complete. Excellent product. 
26731 Used this for a macro lens conversion and it worked perfectly. 
26732 Love it! awesome camera with awesome quality of video and also can make awesome stills! 
26733 It came with an old leaking battery, I had to buy a battery in order to start using it. 
26734 Very good to see camera screen clearly on daylight. 
26735 Very satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product. 
26736 Works great with the kit lens for my Nikon D7000. Highly recommended! 
26737 Works great. A real time saver. But as others have mentioned, it s loose so a little masking tape to shim it out is necessary 
26738 Great product for a great price. Thanks again. 
26739 Works well, not really great for dark objects though. 
26740 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AX12XTC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 
26741 The case itself is very nice. But the interior foam does not last long. it falls apart, fragments. If you re going to be using it frequently, consider getting hard foam for this case. 
26742 Awesome awesome awesome charger for my digital camera, absolutely love it and the replacement batteries work just as good as the originals!!! 
26743 c6722085 tech ar004273 Henry Thank you, my tech was great in helping me set up my new camera! 
26744 All good. 
26745 It works but not very easy to use. 
26746 Fits perfectly. 
26747 bad bad bad product , do not buy , is of very poor quality , lost my money , see the photo. 
26748 good 
26749 Don t buy this battery, it s a waste of money, loses battery life very quickly, It is a fake battery, so don t bother buying from this user. 
26750 ok 
26751 Took a minute to get used to......love the old school! 
26752 Prompt delivery. Work great. 
26753 These work very well. You can get a tone when door or window is opened, set them to alarm when away and even get the temperature graphed out for a day, week, month or year. Cool. These are only $15.00 at Lowes though. 
26754 Lens itself works like a charm and pictures are sharp and nice, but mount does not lock to my 400D. 
26755 Very good 
26756 works good 
26757 It was a good buy for my GoPro Hero4 
26758 These Wasabi batteries hold power just like the original Olympus battery and the charger has an integrated plug unlike the one Olympus provides (i.e. no need to carry a power cord). After 6 months of use I have nothing to complain about. 
26759 great camera with a really good zoom 
26760 Great product water tight, but WIFI button can t turn off or turn on while camera is in case 
26761 Bought this as a starter camera for a teenage film student. He s able to use all the functions easily. Takes great footage indoors and out. Also got him the Ultimate Accessory Kit to go with it and he s loving it all. 
26762 main connector to the camera broke in 10 seconds. do not buy this poorly built device 
26763 Sometimes a generic battery works, but I prefer to buy the Nikon battery for more assurance of durability and lasting power. I always carry an extra for extended photo shoots. 
26764 They are not as clear as my other D-Link set and the sound is terrible. 
26765 great product- smart design! 
26766 Excellent glasses for birding. Light weight, easy to hold on image without shake.... Can t imagine spending any more for good field glasses. 
26767 Great case and great service! 
26768 Got here in a day and and a half, great shipping, and... it s a battery..? Lol. Going on a trip in September so I ll test it s limitations then. 
26769 These batteries are, so far, performing every bit as good as the &#34;brand&#34; batteries that I have bought in the past at 4 times the cost. They are definitely a good deal. 
26770 We live in a zone where there are gangs that love to graffiti in our alley and on our house and inside the carport. Since I have installed these and sings, there has not been any graffiti. Very happy. 
26771 Wonderful product!!! they give you a lot of product for a cheap price. It worked instantly for all of my lens s. I recommend these! 
26772 Nice and good for gopro. Is very easy to fit all the accessories and the camera 
26773 It works as it should! 
26774 The camera image is blurry and is very slow in capturing motion, a sometimes I am not able to look at image because camera image was all black 
26775 Works as advertised. Great for vacations where the camera battery might run out & need two to get thru day 
26776 Slides on with a friction fit. Fits nicely. Very light weight. Glossy finish so will reflect light into lens, so I will use some steel wool to roughen up the surface. 
26777 My son has a lot of Camera s .I didn t think I could fine a bag big enough buy WOW this is the Bag.He thought it was great and so did all his friends 
26778 somehow, my husband managed to misplace his battery charger for the camera I bought him. I got the idea to order a replacement from my best friend, and I m so glad I followed through. Now camera works after a year of a missing charger! 
26779 Very nice and powerfull lens 
26780 Works great! 
26781 Good. Sturdy. Great Quality C Stand 
26782 Definitely helpful as you start to stack up the photos. More pages than I would ve imagined, as it can hold quite the amount of film! Arrived in good condition, good quality, a great buy if you re to use the Instax camera. 
26783 more than what i expected for the price 
26784 It is perfect, inexpensive and does exactly what it says it will do. Arrived on time 
26785 Great product. Great service A++++ 
26786 Product was returned. Camera itself seemed to work well but app is not friendly with older foscam cameras and old / most recent foscam app does not work with this camera when you have other old cameras as well.. Foscam needs a single app to control all cameras 
26787 The lens caps arrive quickly and fit my camera perfectly. The strap will keep me from losing the lens cap. The bundle is great because I have two lenses and two caps for backup. 
26788 The clip fits my phone, but the only that that stinks is taking the cover off the phone so it can fit in the clip. Other then that it is a good buy. 
26789 Too expensive! Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for a dollar less than this single cap. 
26790 I purchased this for our upcoming trip. This is a great device for night time pictures when you want to minimize camera movement. Works well with my Nikon D3100. 
26791 I ordered 2 sets and only one unit out of the 4 would make connection with any of my flashes. The other 3 units would not react the pins on my flashes to trigger them. I tried all my SB-900 s, SB-700 s and 1 SB-26. 
26792 Great product my boyfriend loves it ! 
26793 First of all the lens advertised was a Samyang lens but what actually ships was a Rokinon lens.They both had a F6.3 rating though.Go figure. I couldn t get the T-mount to attach and fully lock unto my Sony a-37 camera. A partial attachment just won t cut it. 
26794 Fast & sharp, less color and image aberration on borders. It is definitely an upgrade of its predecesor. I recommend it ! 
26795 nice but you realy need an optical viewfinder 
26796 There are several cut outs in the foam, but none of them are very clear of their intention. However, the case is great otherwise. 
26797 I use this to protect my laptop screen for the oils on the keys 
26798 Fast shipping, good product. My old Canon A50 is purring once again in all its digital glory! 
26799 this case came earlier than i expected! it s adorable and exactly what i wanted! thank you so much!! 
26800 Excellent. 
26801 Great product delivered as advertised. 
26802 I m very proud of these items. 
26803 The best deal ever! Outstanding start up camera and accessories for a new DSLR person! 
26804 Pretty good, it sticks well. But the Aperture wheel and Shutter Speed wheel are not even as close as the original ones on the camera. So leaves a three star. 
26805 Would not work with remote. 
26806 It would not hold my Samsung Zoom. So I m not using it at all....gave it away. 
26807 makes the picture not sharp 
26808 Excellent lens for the money 
26809 Need it to keep my Dremel Tool charged. 
26810 Good style and very easy to use. with my EOS 5D and 24-105 Len. 
26811 I love it ! It is a great and useful product. 
26812 Great to use but stopped working after a year with light use 
26813 does not fit on the Go Pro 4 
26814 Works as it should. STRONG clip spring. Can t go wrong if you have a need for this kind of rig. 
26815 They display screen was broke 
26816 This product does not work properly, the software is out of date, and something I didn t know is that COBY went out of business in 2013, so there isn t a website or a customer service # to help troubleshoot the issues. DO not buy this product! 
26817 Built well and no slippage when locked! 
26818 This works great. The remote doesn t have to be pointed right at the plug in to turn the light on and off. It makes turning the light on and off super easy. 
26819 I wanted to like this so bad, but the fact that you have to watch a light blink to figure out what is going on is a major con for me. Too confusing. 
26820 Inexpensive, works great! Highly recommend if you need to replace your oem charger or if you just need an extra charger! 
26821 Was a gift to my mom. She really likes the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
26822 Good quality. Comes with a case that holds all the parts--some others don t. 
26823 Hi!! I received my selfie stick with a problem. Thank u for pay attention to my coment. Sincerely Julio Mejia. 
26824 Great product 
26825 This product is not endorsed by Nest. It is a third party affiliate. 
26826 These are not original DJI. They caused my Phantom 2 Vision to fly anyway it wanted. It wouldn t respond to the controller at all. Put the original blades on and it flew normally. These blades cause me to crash my Phantom several times. 
26827 Nice little set for a great price. We mainly bought it for the float, which worked nicely while snorkeling, but we also put the selfie stick on it during a dive to get video of some harder to get places. 
26828 The ítem did come on handheld for me. It replaced my ítem guay no longer worked. 
26829 Great product. Good price. Fast delivery! 
26830 As advertised. Adjustable so it can accommodate larger hands. Very good quality. 
26831 So happy with my purchase!! The camera came earlier than expected, which is always awesome!! we ve had a blast using it this far, can t wait to take it in the cruise!! 
26832 Excellent 
26833 This tripod is great. I needed something to support a small portable projector and other mini tripods would not do it. They just collapsed. This holds it up without any flimsiness and the positionable legs are great. Highly recommend this tripod. 
26834 Arrived timely, precision cut and fit. It is a great product for new Go Pro users. Was unable to road test it, due to cancellation of trip due to weather, but it will be road tested. If it fails the test, you will be hearing from me. 
26835 Excellent camera, with all the features I wanted and more. 
26836 BAD QUALITY. Very flimsy plastic. I expected better. No instructions and I can t tell what goes with what! 
26837 System instructions are very poor. You are unable to setup the wireless cameras if you do not have a windows PC so MAC users do not buy this system. Returned to Amazon for a refund 
26838 I could not get it to link up to my smart phone. I tried everything I could. 
26839 Simple camera great forntakin pic of any and everything I wouldn t use it for photo shoots but serves its purpose takes great pics of my kids when they are silly and crazy lol 
26840 Great product. Easy installation and durable. Have had for my property for over 2 years and no problems. 
26841 I sent it back. It would not maintain a network connection well enough to be usable. Tried it with apple, Windows phone and android. Definitely a bust. 
26842 battery has very poor performance. it only functions a very short time before the battery is dead. I would like to return these two items. 
26843 Got it really quick. works perfect 
26844 Really nice and simple to use 
26845 Works great 
26846 NOT ONLY WAS THIS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT, IT WAS ALSO THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OF ALL RETAILERS THAT I CHECKED. 
26847 Fits my JCV record 
26848 Had to send camera back to manufacturer within a few months. It came apart. They did send me a new one. It was just a hassle to have something brand new that fell apart. 
26849 helps keep stands from tipping over and easy to see 
26850 It s good for the price but the things look a bit cheap the selfie sometimes twists with my iphone 6 plus to heavy for it. One of the lenses is two pieces in one and it came apart. But over all for the price its ok. 
26851 Does the job. 
26852 works as promised. 
26853 This is my third Canon digital SLR. Amazing cameras for the price! Very forgiving. Be sure to check out all the special features and program the camera to your liking. 
26854 Fits great 
26855 not bad 
26856 works great, now we know when someone enters our yard 
26857 Works great for such an oldie I love the way the picture turn out and the assisted focus is really cool, and it s hipster, how many other people have an al-1 everybody has the aw-1 
26858 Much slower than I thought it would be. I miss the rapid shoot feature on my previous camera. Not a good camera for taking quick succession shots. 
26859 Im loved no more strees. Protects the flash falla and better movility 
26860 outside very hot is dropcam feel hot is broke i call nest support shipper new dropcam only inside 
26861 Works great, just as advertised. 
26862 Great price for all you get. 
26863 Fantastic sling and fantastic value for its quality. 
26864 No marker to know where to attach to lens and won t sit in the case like before. Plastic is very thin and cheap. 
26865 Under powered. Returned unit, then struggled with vendor to get refund. It did appear to be well built. 
26866 luckily I could get, I saved my machine lens 
26867 These are awesome cameras for the price. Very clear picture day and night. WAY better than my older Sony cameras. Very Pleased! 
26868 Doesn t work. Charged, but it wouldn t turn on, and then not charge after. Cheap junk. 
26869 Vincent was great, I love my camera, great product 
26870 doesnt fix, 
26871 It s great 
26872 Excellent quality. secure and comfortable around the neck line. 
26873 Great little camera 
26874 Very fast delivery. Satisfied with the quality, its just that the size is 1cm wider for a Samsung NX2000 screen. 
26875 awesome better stable shots 
26876 Nice clean low light primary lens. Auto Focus works properly with motor in camera. It is another great lens from Nikkor 
26877 Good Batteries - provide 2h 21m for Sony Handicam HDR CX220 
26878 Great package! 
26879 GREAT replacement for the original GoPro batteries which cost a crap ton more. These even hold a longer charge it seems. 
26880 Great for nature, light, water resistant. Comes with case and lense covers. 
26881 It s okay, quality is good but it is kind of hard to use with my camera. It makes it hard to reach the shutter. 
26882 I feel like it s priced a bit high but it does work very well and is probably exactly what you re looking for if you ended up here. It s solid and works much better than trying to hold your hand or something over the screen. 
26883 Good battery 
26884 Came without monitor I have to spend 200 more to get all stay away! 
26885 Nice pattern and fabric but can be difficult to fold down. 
26886 Best home wi-fi camera on the market. Simple to set up. 
26887 Love it!!!- 
26888 they are awesome 
26889 This is the real DJI parts, not fake like some others advertised! 
26890 Simple enough to put together. Don t like the little ring that can be seen on camera at night. Without that it would be 5 stars. 
26891 Very good quality 
26892 I can t say enough about this little drone. Flies so well!! So simple to fly I bought them for my 8 and 10 year old kids. They love them!! Almost indestructible. If your thinking about getting one... GET IT! You wont regret it! 
26893 As a newbie to Go Pro, there is more than enough in this kit to keep me occupied. I went through everything and tried out several. Fit and finish is great. The only thing that I would like to see is a compartmentalized case large enough to hold everything. 
26894 Exactly as described. Shipped immediately. 
26895 Lots of tech for not that much money. Loads of fun especially if you are looking for a different perspective on photography. 
26896 Product was fine. five star 
26897 Mount was hard to slip onto the mount. 
26898 Arrived early! And the paper works as advertised! 
26899 So far this is awesome. 10 minute setup Very good broadcast for a wireless camera. Going to get some more and see how they tie together. 
26900 Works great and floats decent enough 
26901 well made. The pop-out foam is not a perfect fit but not a big issue.mu 
26902 Great chest strap. you forget you are wearing the chest strap. This is the much better than wearing it on your head. 
26903 Great variety of mounts for temporary FILMING situations. Set it and forget it. 
26904 Another cheap alternative to GO PRO big dollar mounts works well I use it in vehicle don t know if i would mount it on the outside of car 
26905 satisfied 
26906 Good fit, finish and function. 
26907 The cameras are high quality with great resolution. I added this system to my garage to supplement the system I already installed on my home. The software is easy to use and I am pleased with the initial quality and use. 
26908 The products are working fine. Good quality. 
26909 Works like a charm !!! The Little dot in the center of the receiver turns on a BRIGHT BLUE when the unit is on which makes this even nicer than we thought. 
26910 Very nice Camera, I have had mine for 3 years and it still shoots very well. Animal shots can be very hard to get and its very lightweight and I can carry it in my pocket wherever I go. 
26911 pretty straight forward, they do what they re supposed to. these are nice. would buy again 
26912 Great binoculars. I didn t realize how much better they could be until I spent the money on some quality optics. I wished I had bought them sooner. Really awesome in low light. 
26913 Very nice small digital microscope. To maintain a clear image, the microscope must be held steady...even the slightest movement will affect the image and deliver erroneous measurements. If you intent to use this for measuring, definitely get the precision stand 
26914 They re buoyant and colorful but way too big for a woman s wrist- It can be worn on the upper arm 
26915 I have been using it for about a week now. The quality of the product is great. Very versatile as it can be adjusted in size (fits in my backpack). 
26916 Grate 
26917 This camera is amazing, I have a d610 that I really like, but the d750 has made it the backup camera 
26918 Excellent 
26919 Using it for my Fuji X1S. Cost one third of original battery but performs equally well. 
26920 Fits well, cheap 
26921 300 photos and still on a single charge. 
26922 Good lens 
26923 Great film. I develop it in TMax developer. I like Fuji Acros, too. The two seem pretty similar to my eye but I usually use Fuji. Gotta help keep Kodak going, too, though. 
26924 Batteries dont last very long like the name brand ones but overall worth the money for a back up 
26925 Okay, but not worth the money though. 
26926 Awesome 
26927 Arrived on time and as described. 
26928 This does the job, but occasionally hard to pan back to different angles and lags. 
26929 Excellent grip 
26930 Great product. 
26931 just as advertized 
26932 The camera is nice, setup was easy. The deal breaker for me was all the videos I tried downloading to my phone were so fragmented and choppy that they were unusable. Otherwise the live viewing was fine and the settings were easy to navigate. 
26933 wouldn t need so many if collar had an ON/OFF Switch thankfully I bought them 
26934 product does what it is suppose to, links my phone to my computer via usb. the choice of delivery personal ment it went to my next door neihbor though since obviously the delivery man(woman) cant read those big huge numbers that shows my address up on my house. 
26935 Excellent 
26936 I highly recommend this case. The EOS came ina red color such as the inside of the case... but is very helpfull if you want to carry your camera with an extra battery and maybe some extra memory. 
26937 Not very happy with the product. The quality of the products are little cheap. The tripod is very light and usable though. 
26938 Works flawlessly.. AMAZING night time video (night driver).. 
26939 Excellent camera! 
26940 Inexpensive monopod is great for alternative to paying top-dollar for an authentic pro monopod. 
26941 Works well, came charged. Like that they have a Canadian store 
26942 Original GoPro died after a year. The Wasabi s, after a year and a half are still going strong. 
26943 Good value for price 
26944 Picture quality as expected. Great price compared to retail store pricing. 
26945 Works awesome. Batteries last similar time to the gopro ones. Nice to have extra batteries and a dual charger. Haven t used the car charger yet, but I m assuming it works fine. 
26946 Extremely nice unit, stable, flexible, nicely packaged, folds well into small, light size with handy carrying case. 
26947 The product is great my son loves it. I would also like to thank Winston for his wonderful customer service. 
26948 I love this camera I have it behine the window its clear also not ir at nite indoor be awsome 
26949 I love this camera. And the setup help that I received from D-Link was excellent! The tech, Jasmine (AR00426) was so nice, patient and helpful. I would definitely recommend this camera and D-Links support service. This is case #C6719277 
26950 Nice product. 
26951 I ve used it a couple of times and its worked perfectly. Thanks! 
26952 Item arrived in about 3 days and it was as advertised and worked perfectly. Would buy from dealer again. 
26953 Handy solution if ou always lose lens caps 
26954 This pack is well made and nicely cushioned. It fits a T3i Rebel just right. The velcro &#34;shelf&#34; at the bottom is adjustable so you can use the pack when you have the kit lens on the camera or a longer one. 
26955 Just got the batteries and charger in the mail last week. It s working great so far 
26956 Takes awhile to set up on the software end of things, but the functionality is great once you re able to get everything up and running. 
26957 was the exact as the store bought. it fit everything I needed, and I still had room 
26958 Excellent kit, great seller, great customer service, great warranty offered!!! A mandatory kit for anyone with a Nikon DSLR!!! 
26959 It worked. 
26960 Works as well as OEM and much cheaper. 
26961 Batteries work great and is way easier than charging one battery at a time 
26962 Works reasonably well. It is lightweight and a bit flimsy. Not particularly compact or easy to travel with but it s a pretty solid choice for a tripod. Anyways, it s cheaper than other brands so I recommend this. 
26963 Received as new 
26964 Such a precious gift for our 6-year-old! She loves is and has had tons of fun making Instax photos in a flash! 
26965 Arrived on time, and as expected 
26966 Placed in camera immediately! 
26967 Excelent product. 
26968 Great tough little bag! 
26969 The product came as advertised and functions just as advertised! It s a great product for the price! 
26970 Great seller ,product as picture 
26971 Great camera bag, sturdy, padded, lots of pockets, just wish it was a little bigger. 
26972 Probably the best purchase I have ever made. Love everything about it. Easy to use. Easy to transfer onto a computer. Great quality. 
26973 I prefer a wrist strap because it is less bulky and I dislike having a camera swinging around my neck. 
26974 Fast shipping, batteries charge extremely quick!! 
26975 Great Quality Product. Does everything that I want from a Circular Polarizer. Breakthough Photography is emerging as a big player in the photography filter market. I am Pleased! 
26976 Too bad 
26977 Battery meets with all my expectations and does the job. 
26978 Love it I have been able to use this to take professional pictures for products I sell on Amazon and on my website. It had to ison it out to remove the lines. 
26979 Takes a little bit time to set it up with SmartThings. Also the refreshing interval is too long and you cannot adjust it. 
26980 Great batteries long long battery life 
26981 I recommend this to everyone. This camera has night vision and motion detection. I use in my childs room and my business. You should order this. 
26982 Great binoculars for the price 
26983 Great underwater camera with good images with existing light. However, flash photos are not as good as standard point and shoot. 
26984 Camera is gray camera not warranted by Nikon. Products within kit are all low quality. Vendor poorly packaged product and it arrived damaged. 
26985 Great 
26986 there was no button on the bottom to click to take a picture and it is not 21&#34;, it is much shorter. 
26987 you will not get a better lense for 99 US-dollars. 
26988 If you have less knowledge about setting up such a cam then choose another product. The whole interface and simplicity of setting up this camera is far beyond dlink standard. Don t buy it. 
26989 Worked perfectly with my Nikon Coolpix. 
26990 Great 
26991 Ideal 
26992 This little camera bag has come in so handy!! I am able to fit some light snacks and some loose bills for our theme park adventures. Also, the inside is padded and I know our little camcorder is supported and safe. 
26993 Love it! Works great. 
26994 Great camera, very durable 
26995 Seems like just what I was looking for. Faster shutter speed and high quality pictures. 
26996 Extremely comfortable and versatile strap. I use it everyday and experience no pain in my shoulders whatsoever. I recommend this to anybody who carries their DSLR with them all day 
26997 Worth every penny and more. Operates at the same level and higher cspacity than $50 OEM battery units. No issues with my Canon EOS Rebel XT. 
26998 6 months passed but it still works well 
26999 I love these little things as hotshoe covers. 
27000 Is cool 
27001 Motion detection not accurate. It sends u a snapshot after the person is out of frame and still sends u notifications when that camera is not supposed to. The night vision is not good unless you are really close. 
27002 An excellent binocular at moderate price. 
27003 Phantom and accessories fit perfectly, and it s right size for carryon baggage. Went on a hike in the pouring rain with this on my back, didn t get to fly with the weather, but all kept dry. 
27004 Beware!!!! Do Not Purchase!!!! The Controller Does Not Pair With The Drone!!!! Total Waist Of money!! 
27005 Works well for an after market charger and the car charger was an added bonus. 
27006 great camera 
27007 Now, I never have to worry about having a dead battery. 
27008 More than i expected 
27009 It meets my needs. 
27010 I attached it to my camera. I went into the water. My camera floated. End of story. 
27011 Bad quality, for the price its bad. 
27012 Love it 
27013 For the price, it s a good quality filter, cheapest among the brand names purporting multi-coated surface. Build quality is good and screws on the lens smoothly. Does not degrade image on a consumer DLSR and lens and effectively protects the front element. 
27014 excelent 
27015 I got this for my son and it was perfect. It as exactly what he wanted 
27016 Works great. Perfect for traveling. 
27017 the handles came off the moment I put it on the camera. 
27018 Charges but came broken so I have to tie the battery in to make it stay. 
27019 SD cards fit great, Very good buy 
27020 Works as good as a new one. 
27021 Low price. Works great. 
27022 received item very quickly.....its works great!!!! 
27023 I think that it is such a great product for such a great price!! it s working great without any problems. 
27024 It s easy to use and transport. I d just prefer that it was a bit more powerful as I continue to have shadows in certain places while filming. 
27025 put this in a derby car over the weekend and it took a lot of hard hits and for it being plastic, I am amazed at how well it held. 
27026 This camera took a few attempts to get it hooked up to our wifi and phones correctly, but once we did it has been great! It seamlessly switches from regular to IR and the speaker and microphone work great. 
27027 Great experience with this order. Camera is as advertised and shipped quickly. I m already looking into accessories. Would use merchant with confidence. 
27028 Great quality...strong wifi signal! 
27029 This is the best 4k camera for the buck. Loving my new machine 
27030 The lens cap bundle arrived in a timely manner. The caps do the job required by our staff. 
27031 I received a wrong item 
27032 It s works as expected only issue is it discharges very fast when I use rechargeable batteries. Works best with disposable. Bought new rechargeable thinking the old ones couldn t cut it but same issue with the new. 
27033 Good only for about a year. When you warranty is up that s it. NO fixing or replacement. Really bad deal 3 out of 4 gone bad and the 4th doesn t work well 
27034 Very good ... 
27035 Just as good as the $100 version. Autofocus in most cases is not needed because the focal range is so small....although this product provides for autofocus in both types of Canon lens I have yet to use auto focus. 
27036 This is a great little air blaster. It gets all the bits of dust off my lens and camera, and it s small enough to squeeze into my camera bag. I specifically didn t want the larger models because they looked huge, so this one fits the bill just right. 
27037 Great space for camera and side pockets for batteries and USB cable. 
27038 DJI can do no wrong with me they make good product all around. 
27039 it was good 
27040 Works really well. Only thing is - You have to remember to turn on the microphone. I forget sometimes. That s on me, not on them. 
27041 Great quality and lots of extras but the case is a little flimsy 
27042 Very good product for the price!! Do the job!!!! 
27043 Gotta have it because the original battery power doesn t last as long as this. 
27044 Perfect for me who has 2 gopro hero 4s and a lot of accessories.. not everything fits but this helps a lot 
27045 cute! 
27046 I bought this for my Nikon D5200. It fits the 18-55mm lens perfectly, but will not fit anything larger. The little zipper in the lid is great for an extra memory card or my wireless remote. 
27047 Love it work real good and clear 
27048 I got this as a birthday present on August 27th, 2015 and I love it so much. I had the wide instax and wasn t sure if this would be too small a size photo but it s perfect. 
27049 Excellent binoculars which I used for my African Safari. 
27050 I live in the mountains and have a large front porch which is where I installed this. It s located high enough to where nobody can touch it without using a ladder. 
27051 grate i wish i can fine more seniors though lol. 
27052 Works well👍🏼 
27053 excelent 
27054 Not quite as solid feeling as my Canon 600 ex-rt. but it gets the job done. Would have gotten five stars except for the feel. Also less than half the cost of the Canon flash. 
27055 a toy 
27056 while shooting an event, some of my shoots came out warm colors and others very cold. Hope I can figure out this issue by next event, other than that, great item, easy to use, lots of functions, great price, fast delivery. 
27057 Excellent for the money. Use it for video work. 
27058 Works well, just as advertised. 
27059 Love this lens. It s great to have the wide angle option for my Canon digital SLR. And the price is right! 
27060 Absolutely great 
27061 Fits the LX100 great, opens up when the camera is powered on, highly recommended if you don t want to fiddle with the lens cap. 
27062 Great product, works great, thank you! 
27063 Holds all of my camera goods with space for more, I fit my camera and three lenses all in it, also cleaning supplies and straps fit well! 
27064 Fits my Go Pro Silver 
27065 Good 
27066 Excellent! 
27067 plastic and cheap feel, digital viewfinder was fuzzy and slow to catch up when moved. 
27068 Excellent 
27069 So tiny! 
27070 Excellent case keeps the gopro in place. Highly recommended, Purchase with confidence. 
27071 Very nice product 
27072 These power packs worked just fine. No problems. 
27073 go to the tube and see how to works.... first install the usb to ur pc.charged it? then follow how it works. just got it..meeennnn im going to bust this bastard dr s that take advantage of my spinal cord injury..the video is perfect.even the picture works great.tku 
27074 Awesome 
27075 Extremely well made. Comfortable to carry. The quick release straps rather stiff to start. Expensive but you can see and feel the quality. The chocolate color straps look more orange than brown in reality. 
27076 Easy to use, sturdy, comes with a storage bag. Well made tripod. 
27077 This will give you plenty of light for portraiture or any setting where you are not firing it over and over again. For serious event work. No. It will leave you hanging. The hvlf43m runs circles around this flash for event work. 
27078 nice 
27079 Picture Quality is horrible, Mic only works for the person holding the camera, the ones you are recording literally have to shout to hear you and there is no light other than that its ok... 
27080 good product, very fast service. 
27081 Stopped working after one use, and the sound was terrible 
27082 Very nice case. Much more utility than I expected. It also appears to be well made. I know I ll get years of service from this case. 
27083 This bundle is great. Everything works perfectly. And you sure Can t beat the price. Definitely recommend 
27084 Works the way they said it would 
27085 Came when they said it would. 
27086 Very *very* slight fuchsia hue, but the real problem comes on cold mornings. On two occasions these frosted completely and were totally unusable since it was like shooting through opaque glass instead of clear. Put it away on humid and cold occasions, figure something else out instead. 
27087 Works perfect for my application. And it is relatively light which is a requirement. 
27088 Great product. Works perfectly on my Sony A6000. I highly recommend it. 
27089 Too many unusable pixels , too much noise beyond 400. 
27090 They work well was expecting some bigger cameras tho. And the night vision is good! 
27091 Worked perfectly 
27092 Fabulous pics..... 
27093 not match with D40.cheap made bad quality.not recommend 
27094 The glasses were wonderful but the strap was not good at all. The weight of the binoculars made the strap cut into your neck. 
27095 I ordered two of these photo frames and upon receipt one wouldn t even power on and the other frame s color on the screen was very distorted. 
27096 Very poor quality photo and video. Set it to he 1080p setting and tried everything to get the best picture; never happened. Not sure why in the world there are anything over a one star review on this. Returning asap to Amazon. Don t waste your money on this. 
27097 Noisey play in the follow knob, pics up on mics. It s a good cheap follow focus to get practice on in spare time 
27098 These are quality lights that I wish I had purchased a long time ago. Although a carrying case isn t included, the small boxes can easily fit into a duffel bag for easy travel. 
27099 excellent quality and helps when moving stands 
27100 Perfect lens for birth photography! 
27101 Wish I could find more. They seem not to exist! 
27102 This works. It does not work with Polar Pro filters attached though. 
27103 great 
27104 Love that it has the double cameras for a broader view. We want purchase two more for all our vehicles. 
27105 Great 
27106 Much appreciated, if sold at more reasonable price. 
27107 Excellent lens. It is a bit heavy, but to me that s what a quality lens should feel like. 
27108 This is exactly what it says it is, a lens cap for Canon EOS EF 18-55. I had accidentally lost mine, and this was the perfect replacement. 
27109 Meh, the video on your phone is better unless you live in 1980. Move on. 
27110 Got this on a ridiculous deal to use on our Honeymoon in Belize. No water ever got into the camera. All you had to make sure was that it was sealed and that the gasket was covering it well. 
27111 Great for the type of camera that I own. 
27112 This viewer does not work, and unfortunately, I will return it. Rounded cornered slides work fine, but squared cornered slides get stuck and do not eject from the viewer. 
27113 I don t use it for anything but landscapes as the focus softens anything with sharp detail is not up to standards. 
27114 Saving much money since I no longer need to constantly purchase lithium batteries for my dog s invisible fence collar. One of the best decisions I have made lately, and I will be looking into buying similar chargers for other battery sizes! 
27115 Great little camera 
27116 Great camera for the money for sure! I say you should buy it! 
27117 These lens cases are great! Good quality with a soft lining for extra protection. Definitely recommend!! 
27118 The quality is not the best 
27119 Just what I needed 
27120 Descent case , good price. No complain 
27121 Worked well and easy to control. Setup just takes a little bit of effort. 
27122 My daughter loved it, exactly what she needed for photo class. TY 
27123 Super bright and amazing. Great price. Very happy. 
27124 excellent quality, but the backdrops are wrinkled, so I brought them to get pressed, which costed me an extra $30.00 for all 3. 
27125 Excellent Product 
27126 Couldn t get it to work with my internet, never got it to show up in my computer or phone 
27127 love it 
27128 Decent quality case at a modest price. Bought for Canon G16, loose fit for the camera. 
27129 This worked perfectly for my camera. 
27130 Perfect quality!! 
27131 Great buy. Would defenely recommend it. 
27132 Good replacement 
27133 Very happy with this lens. Used it on a full moon shoot and was pleased with the results. For the price, can t go wrong. 
27134 I love this filter. Used it for sunset and beach shots this summer and the effects were stunning. Highly recommended. 
27135 Everything came as ordered and works fine. 
27136 DSTE is the best non OEM grip out there period! I ve tried 3 others and this grip is by far better. The build is spot on with the OEM and all buttons/knobs work just like the OEM. The seller shipped fast from China and it arrived 8 days early. 
27137 Good Product Works as expected 
27138 Does what it s supposed to do. Solid build. 
27139 Worked exactly as written. 
27140 good for the price 
27141 Decent for the size. Has some trouble with light correction but worked fine with my fatshark goggles and a hawkeye transmitter for 5.8 ghz fpv. 
27142 Great value! 
27143 Great product 
27144 This is tripod is cool, a good deal, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am specifically using it for my compact Nikon, CoolPix camera, and it holds perfectly. 
27145 for peace of mind a low cost worth every penny.. 
27146 Great Tripod 
27147 They do jut what you expect batteries to do, charge and discharge. 
27148 Work good I am so happy I could used my camcorder again I fix it my self. 
27149 Great products, would recommend for everyone 
27150 Great color and very sharp photos! Last of the great 35 mm film for my great film cameras. 
27151 @ 6 months - Defective Monitor ! shuts down! occasionally needs to be Reset? 
27152 Works as well if not better than originals for a fraction of the price! 
27153 Useful product! Liked it. 
27154 This is not compatible with a p900. I called Nikon to confirm. DO NOT PURCHASE 
27155 great clear pictures and easy to use beats my I-Phone for pictures 
27156 wow what a package and all of them are useful. but yes i havent used all of them yet. But i really liked everything and all are of good standard. Exceeded my expectation really. 
27157 Fantastic. Incredible picture. Incredible price. Great bundle - all good stuff. These people are fantastic. Excellent customer service, fast shipping. Great in all respects. 
27158 It s defective....but I did not know that at that time so I could not return and I wasted money... 
27159 AAAAAA+++++ 
27160 Great camera. 
27161 Love this camera, easy to use, love the look of the camera and the case! I would recommend to all! The mini photos were a hit at the party in the photo booth! Just wish I would have purchased the mini photo album book to put the pictures in! 
27162 Real solid one 
27163 The wifi is not working i tested this cam with ios and android 
27164 Didn t work with my camera so I cannot review it. Make sure your camera can do wireless 
27165 I got this for my daughter fro her 10th birthday and she LOVED it! Great gift! 
27166 I had to send it back because it was way too big and bulky for my needs. The leather was a really poor quality and the front straps that snap were cumbersome. 
27167 More pink than red not to happy 
27168 I m fairly happy with this purchase. The only complaint I have is the length of the quick connect straps is too long and looks ridiculous hanging off the camera so I never remove the strap. 
27169 The product is great. Lightweight, portable and easy to use. There was a delay in the shipping for some unknown reason but Amazon gave me a $20 refund for the inconvenience. 
27170 works 
27171 It s great for getting tubes on video 
27172 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
27173 great 
27174 This camera isn t really that good. The Mydlink site has a time limit on continuous viewing. There are several more things, but why pile it on? 
27175 This arrived safely and as scheduled. It fits okay but acceptable with some adjusting; but not a perfect fit. 
27176 it works just fine, no problems at all :) 
27177 It is awesome! It is way bigger than it appears, I highly recommend this product, it s perfect for a camera and some small stuff. 
27178 Great Value, works great 
27179 Solid stand, no issues. 
27180 Good product 
27181 Love nest cam, except for 15% of the time when it says &#34;offline&#34;. I also have a thermostat which rarely goes offline, so I know its not my internet connection. Also, why is the subscription cost so high? I would get it, if it wasnt a ripoff. 
27182 Plug in didn t work well. had to adjust in all the time in the socket, still. good batteries, good price. 
27183 Haven t used every item as of late, but what I have used works as intended. 
27184 Perfect fit. No issues , great service and delivery right on time. 
27185 Cheap plastic 
27186 works great, good value, fast shipper. 
27187 I bought this little guy for my gopro. Its definitely not &#34;heavy duty&#34; as the product description states but gets the job done. Great little tripod for the price. 
27188 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27189 Great Price and easy to use.. 
27190 My daughter loves the product. Customer Service and product expectations where met. Love it. 
27191 I have dozens of rechargeable batteries that I use for photography. This is great because it holds them reasonably snug and with the two partitions, I can keep the charged and depleted batteries separate. There aren t many cases like this, so this was great. 
27192 Came two days early. Great surprise!! Excellent condition. Looks and feels brand new. Great buy!! 
27193 Not the exact copy of the Nikon part however the form fit and function is right-on. Excellent Service from the vendor. Ordered two additional sets of caps just in case one is lost or comes off again. 
27194 Great price for the cleaning set. The Purosol solution really cleaned up my lens after snapping pics at a teppanyaki restaurant. It would be nice to have an extra pack of Altura lens paper. 
27195 I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens. 
27196 Fits - timely delivery 
27197 Works great, the wifi remote with this adds to the value. 
27198 I was pleased with fast shipping and Lens is perfectly and I love it.:) Thank you 
27199 Fits well, easy to put on and take off. 
27200 I like that i can charge 2 batteries at the same time. Great buy 
27201 I ordered the black backdrop but received the white. It did come in one day though. 
27202 It is not quite comparable to Vera Hub 
27203 excelent extra life for your camera 
27204 For the amount of money this cost me the quality should have been a lot better. And now I can t get rid of the thing for even half that amount. 
27205 Great product 
27206 It s nice and big, but almost too heavy to hold itself up. The rod on the umbrella bends a bit. I m worried it may break eventually or bend too much. But for now, it works and gives me a nice big reflective surface at a good price. 
27207 Order came in fast and was well packaged. Easy to assemble and get operational. Home security even on the road. Which we tested while away on a long weekend. 
27208 Good 
27209 Cowboy studio has the best equipment for the price 
27210 Fit perfect! Serves its UV purposes but also peace of mind in protecting my lens face. 
27211 Fills up with water and then does not float 
27212 Sprays just enough air to make it work for small spaces. Perfect and no need to use nasty chemicals. 
27213 great! 
27214 I have more pieces of equipment than I know what to do with. But, I will figure it out. I look forward to more professional photos for my website. 
27215 The Oly Pro lens are great. 
27216 They arrived on time and they were great 
27217 Manual focus, manual aperture, and no image stabilization. I m using it on a APS-C SLR in AE mode. Creamy texture for landscapes and a wonderful lens for group pictures. I will be using this on my (all manual) film camera also - the advantage of older lenses being non-gelded. 
27218 Good replacement battery for my camera. 
27219 It was everything I hoped for 
27220 Great one! Should buy 
27221 Awesome for the price. 
27222 good 
27223 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
27224 lots of vignette 
27225 Nice album for instant prints. 
27226 Expensive for how long it lasted. picture quality/ auto-zoom mechanism deteriorated quite quickly (my family can be a little hard on electronics, but no so hard that it s unreasonable). Vast majority of pictures don t zoom quite right. Better with an iphone at this point. 
27227 It s too lightweight so it tips over with a heavy smartphone. 
27228 working as intended 
27229 This product doesn t let you face your camera forward which makes it useless to me if the only thing it s capturing is a side view. 
27230 Works as advertised. Compact and good workmanship. 
27231 It is light and protect the Phantom 3 and all parts. Really nice product. 
27232 Very quick shipment. Quality item. 
27233 Great experience. Very fast shipping. Thanks. 
27234 I bought 3 of this, 2 had to returned, its either the plug in adapter not working, or not working properly! and only the first one works within 4-6 feet! 
27235 got this camera when it first came out; love it. I have taken thousands of pictures with it; never had a problem with it. will keep this camera till it dies. 
27236 Great suction mount! A great buy with a low price. GoPro s version is like 4 times as much and just as good 
27237 The product is excellent and easy to use, it charges all my batteries without problem and since I read that some of the customers had problems with putting in or taking off the battery but I ve haven t experience that. Mine runs smooth for the Canon T3 bats 
27238 Great batteries and charger. I use them for my Nikon d90, and have never had a problem! 
27239 Great price. 
27240 Delivered as expected...works great!! 
27241 Works as advertised 
27242 The flash work beautiful with my camera. Have it professional output. 
27243 Great Cam! Easy to set up & use. 
27244 Perfect 
27245 Um.. Great case, but it s a square rectangular shape that looks a little boxy... also the purple comes out 5 times darker.. ok though 
27246 Can t beat the price. 
27247 Still got to test it more. It charged fully and seem to be running well. 
27248 The Teleconverter worked fine in my Canon. I did not realized that it would not automatically focus if the lens being used has a 5.6 apert.; but otherwise, focusing manualy is fine. 
27249 Calvin the tech was great. VERY KNOWLEDGABLE AND COURTEOUS He knew where to go and did things the other techs did not do! 
27250 all good thanks .. 
27251 These binoculars are very lightweight and easy to carry around. The visual clarity is much better than the older cheaper and much heavier ones we have. I am impressed with the view and focus. These are well worth the price 
27252 Bought this for my grand daughter to go along with her pink camera. Looked ALL over on line and in stores for a camera case with some design on it in pink. Very hard to find...well, this is perfect. She LOVED it. The colors pop and looks great. 
27253 works flawlessly 
27254 Super awesome and sturdy. 
27255 Perfect replacement for original charger. Additional batteries an extra plus. Packaging was excellent. 
27256 Simple, but works great for what i needed. 
27257 Good value, all parts seemed well made and fit well on my Go-Pro. More than I will ever use. 
27258 Works on the FZ-1000. Bright light that allows you to dim/brighten as needed. Excellent product so far. 
27259 Great item 
27260 Very good ball head IMO, especially the price. 
27261 Plug and Play with enough information to fly your Multicopter with TV Display or Goggles. 
27262 Great lens shoot very well! 
27263 Died after being used for 5 photos. 
27264 I love this unit it works great 
27265 Brand new and arrived quickly. 
27266 Great for taking vibration free photographs and time exposures. Although the release can t take timed photos, it is able to be locked open for long exposures with manual timing. 
27267 Great! 
27268 Moves way too fast for practically any video usage. If someone can show us how to slow it down I would probably give it a better rating, but as it is, it is pretty useless. 
27269 Good for the price. They lag a little bit connecting and they blow threw non rechargeable batteries. But easy to set up and use. 
27270 The display worked well but the remote controller did not work. 
27271 Very well made protection for my Manfrotto tripod.I use it all the time. 
27272 It was a perfect fit for my camera. 
27273 good so far. 
27274 Great upgrade for my old Q-see system! 
27275 Works as advertised and alot easier to install than the reglar cloth straps that comes standard with the cameras 
27276 One of the best out there. 
27277 Good job 
27278 nice pics cheap 
27279 Glad we purchased. A great addition to our gear. 
27280 Thank you thank you thank you thank you. Canon lenses + Sony body = happiness 
27281 fits perfect on the screen of my camera! 
27282 it is fun! 
27283 Great price. Works well. 
27284 Fast Shipping. Bought for our Daughter and she LOVES it. 
27285 Performed brilliantly. Got some nice pictures in the pool. Will be taking it snorkel I got next. 
27286 Good 
27287 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
27288 There okay, use them here and there.... 
27289 Effortless set-up and pack-up of all of these type screens. Saves a Lot of time for chromakey, etc. Recommended. They used to come in a really nice zippered heavy-duty blue case with handles, which itself could be put to use as a small Blue screen. 
27290 Great! 
27291 Poor quality, selfie connections did not work,returned you get what you pay for !! 
27292 2 out of 3 of mine don t lock to the lens properly. When you get the good one it stays that way. 
27293 As good as the real thing! 
27294 Great filters! They work really well, I love the look they give. The case to hold the filters is great quality as well. Would definitely buy these again in different lens sizes. 
27295 It did not fit my lens 
27296 Great 
27297 So far so good within a few days of attaching it to my Sony RX100 IV. Fits well, and changes the handle of the camera - in a better way. It adds a secure feel in handling the camera. Definitely a must have. 
27298 Cool 
27299 Bought this for my trip to Oahu, Hawaii. Real life saver. Not a drop got it. Floats in the water. Super convenient to store phones and wallets. Will probably buy one or two more as gifts! Great purchase, happy customer. 
27300 Exactly what we needed. 
27301 Still going strong since 2007 after hundreds of cycles. 
27302 The legs are extremely thin and unstable. 
27303 I cannot love this thing enough. For the price this thing is amazing. Can pull up live feed anywhere you have internet or a cell data signal. My friends always ask where I got it and how much it was. They can never believe how cheap they are. 
27304 The quality of the camera is outstanding. Never worry about it anymore. 
27305 I pulled it brand new from the amazon box, and the zipper sticks horribly! I kept it because I needed it for a trip, but very unhappy about it. 
27306 Great price 
27307 I love it!! thank you so so much! it works just perfectly 
27308 As advertised 
27309 Very easy to install and operate. I like it!! I also liked the price. It s a much better system than the one I ve had for years and couldn t operate. 
27310 Great protection! 
27311 Great item 
27312 Gift for my wife. Great product, prompt delivery. 
27313 Works good 
27314 Good one 
27315 FITS MY GIRL S COMPACT CAMERA PERFECTLY 
27316 It is great, but, am waiting for the camera to use this kit 
27317 Work as expected 
27318 Good picture, just as good as the expensive name brand cables. Well worth the price 
27319 Stopped working after couple months 
27320 Exactly what I needed 
27321 I have been a D.P. for 21 years....this far exceeded my expectations...if you don t need a large head to carry a big camera....this is amazing...not only just for the money...but I have heads worth 5X as much...this one really works well....paired with their carbon fiber legs....great 
27322 Great camera bag. 
27323 Charged as expected. Took a couple of hours. But the battery didn t last that long in Camera and battery life didn t show up on screen. 
27324 Excelente! 
27325 good camera 
27326 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
27327 Great quality for what I paid. I use it more than I thought I would. 
27328 works great photos in green shallow waters and glass lens is both a great protector for lens and scratch resistant. 
27329 Works and functions as expected. The downside is that the software is compatible with old operating systems like Windows 7. 
27330 Great product, good price! 
27331 This is just perfect!!! Nicely package and looks great. I will post a picture soon of what my cakes look with it and without it to show the major differences. I use it for cakes but it will also work well with jewelry or pretty much anything 
27332 They work pretty well and compare to the original batteries, so far no problems. 
27333 Meets my expectations fully 
27334 nice filters 
27335 item does not fit requested refund. Have not received approval. 
27336 dropped a 8mm fisheye that did not catch the holster. Needs padding inside the belt where the metal housings are. Lots of bruising. In the future I think I will combine one side with the Spider and one side with the Black Rapid strap. 
27337 Good ring light, bright LED s, good xenon flash as well, but as others have noted, it s difficult to get the light to stay on any given lens. 
27338 Can t get enough of this thing! I love the 4k quality and recently used it in a neighborhood cleanup effort in Detroit. The time-lapse feature is probably my favorite. It is very impressive. 
27339 As described 
27340 Great battery, great value! 
27341 Nice bag and fits a good ammount of gear. Only problem is it s a bit tight to zip and can get stuck 
27342 Great lens at a great price. I bought it used, but whoever owned it took great care and it s basically like new for a fraction of the price. Thank you! 
27343 Works phenomenally. Haven t had any issues with it fitting inside my camera. Would recommend 
27344 A must have for portrait photography! Clean Sharp images with beautiful bokeh. 
27345 works even better than the original that came with the camera 
27346 Loved having all of these back up camera batteries. 
27347 They sent me the wrong color, instead of white it s red... didn t know that there would be no sound when zooming in or out. Other than that everything works okay. 
27348 I am very pleased with it. Best thing I ve bought in a long while. 
27349 No significant drop-off from Canon batteries. Great to have replacements at inexpensive prices. 
27350 [[VIDEOID:9c439f3b04874cf69db357b20ad3fe9d]] My videos are typically short and sweet, but this product demanded a more lengthy video. I hope you enjoy it. I received this unit gratis in exchange for an honest review. 
27351 Great backpack for Camera equipment 
27352 Works fantastic , very good for the money , I am very happy 
27353 Thanks! 
27354 Good price. 
27355 Comes with everything I need 
27356 One word,amazing! ! 
27357 Awesome 
27358 remote won t work on canon t5i as advertised. Tripod is okay, you pay for what you get. not the best but decent for the price. 
27359 Batteries currently last about 5 hours per charge, far beyond my old camera. Only time will tell how they will hold up, but so far they are great. 
27360 A great lens!! 
27361 Works as expected 
27362 Battery did not fit in my camera. Had to throw away the product. 
27363 Great item. I ve used it for a while and had great video taken from this thing! 
27364 Very easy setup. Very useful in lighting up dark areas. I installed it next to my back door in garage. No more trying to find the keyhole. Very bright!! Motion sensor perfect 
27365 love these batteries and charger...I ve got several... 
27366 Beautiful pictures with this lens 
27367 This rig is dope! Don t set it up like dude had it in his video. Camera should be behind the handles. Also buy one of these to offset the shoulder pad. Way better if you plan on using a view finder. Sick rig for sure! 
27368 well packed and everything needed to use with the sony camera 
27369 awesome product great price would buy again 
27370 [[VIDEOID:e4369a1019f77856e8979118bb9ab375]] 
27371 Great product, it fit on any bag, no matter if it is a messenger or backpack.... I fit a Sony A6000 with 3 lenses.... recommended. 
27372 It was delivered quickly, it fit exactly what I wanted and for a finale they included a great (gratis) microfiber cloth. They even followed up with an e-mail requesting feedback. 
27373 didn t work for me 
27374 Lens cap does not fit once the lens hood is installed on 16-50mm kit lens for Sony A6000. Hotshoe cover does not fit either for my Sony A6000 ILCE. 
27375 Works good with my new Panasonic DMC-ZS50K camera. Pocket is good enough for a couple of extra batteries, and design is good. Seems to be built well. Zips easy. 
27376 A nice case to keep additional items such as an extra battery and/or memory card with your camera. The interior is soft and won t scratch your camera. My only problem is the Velcro and nylon strap material can/will snag most 100% polyester shirts. 
27377 Great camera in all respects 
27378 Not 900 tvl as advertised or atleast I got shipped 2 800 tvl cameras ? 
27379 I have not yet used the car charger but the home wall charger does what it needs to do and I am totally satisfied. Price was right, it charges the Nikon CoolPix camera I picked up on the cheap. Now I just need a proper USB cable. 
27380 Amazing. Lots of fun with this little camera. 
27381 battery works great 
27382 ok 
27383 I needed a spare for traveling. It works perfectly for my needs. 
27384 Nice kit and nicer price! Everything fits perfctly with my gopro. Delivered on time. Use the gopro screw insted of the one provided, it get oxid after first use. 
27385 Honestly don t know why anybody would get another tripod. Best bang for you buck. Granted it isn t as smooth in motion as the top of the line. But for those that need a ball head tripod this is the best. Solid construction and will last a long time! 
27386 Nice, you can see edges of the lens hood. 
27387 pain in the ass to use 
27388 This has a European style plug and you ll have to spend at least $5 more for an adapter in order to use it. 
27389 Good 
27390 This scope comes with a tripod and an eye attachment. Very good accessories and scope for the price. I have used this scope to look at stars and the moon, very pleased! 
27391 It good 
27392 The rave reviews of these binoculars are all right on the money. These are fantastic optics for the price. 
27393 Great charger, never had a problem with it. The travel and D cell kit comes in handy. Will be buying the higher end model next time and use this for travel. 
27394 works as expected 
27395 Using them for my twitch stream, they do exactly what I need them too. Seem sturdy enough for my use. Would not recommend using them outside. 
27396 Thank you very much. The shipping was really fast. I love the camera. It is the perfect camera for pictures and vlogging. 
27397 Pre-cut compartments that fits the GoPro PERFECTLY! Handy case to store all the go pro products while protecting it! Boyfriend loves it! 
27398 😊 
27399 It has a very clear picture during the day and the night feature is very cool. Never knew so many animals are running around at night. 
27400 Was really expediant on shipping , but this is not a minolta lens its an olympus OM. Should have done his research before posting .... but hey for $15 the oem hard shell case Is worth it sux I cant use the lens though. 
27401 I purchased this item,it did not work properly. I sent for a refund, i ended up losing 126. in restocking fee all because their equipment did not function correctly, very unhappy. I will never buy from this again..... I give zero star rating 
27402 Look professional. 
27403 Great quality at a great price …works perfect …good suction on the suction cup!! 
27404 My daugher loves this case for her point and shoot camera, especially the extra memory card slot. 
27405 works well. charges well. 
27406 No issues, works as intended. 
27407 ok 
27408 Great camera! Great price! Good response for my questions! Very happy with delivery! 
27409 Very clean, used body. have been pleased with the camera and fast shipping. 
27410 Best camera gadget I have ever purchased! 
27411 I tried one of these with a 76 MZ-5 and Canon 1dx. It did not work in TTL or ETTL at all. Pretty much just fired full blast all of the time. Could not find a fix so I returned it. 
27412 Could fit the P3 a little better. However, plenty of storage, very nice in general. Good build quality. Suits my needs. 
27413 This case is small & perfect to put in my carry on. It s sturdy construction should protect the camera well. If I have anything to add I ll return after my vacation and update my comment. 
27414 Such a conversation starter even if I m just wearing it. 
27415 be Careful, this unit is super strong. I threw it in my console and forgot about a laptop hard drive I had in there..... let s just say it s clean. Cheap way to wipe your HD! Seriously though, this magnet is ridiculously strong, an it doesn t scratch paint. 
27416 Getting this device to take video is complicated and the instructions are poor. I got the clock set, but have tried twice to get it to take videos. Have not yet succeeded. 
27417 ohh yea have already done some cool time lapse with this baby, and just waiting to experiment with leaving the shutter open for certain periods of time. 
27418 Great product 
27419 Works well to take pictures of rooms! 
27420 For beginner I think I chose the right camera for me more than enough stuff to learn how to use over the next 6 months to a year 
27421 Didn t fit my camera even though I was led to believe it would. 
27422 Cheap, but only of the price. 
27423 i need np-fp50 please 
27424 its like canon 580 ex II...takes bit longer to charge...and it is not recognized by the canon CAMERA...so ettl works partially...example...increase power dont work from camera 
27425 Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera 
27426 Wonderful! Amazing for the price. Shipping was slow by Amazon standards but I couldn t be happier with the product. 
27427 Does not stay on well, wish there was a camera store near me. 
27428 Another lemon I brought! It doesn t work with Canon 70D! 
27429 Better than the original charger. 
27430 GR8 Seller, loved my items and received them in record time, can t wait to take some pictures! A+++++ 
27431 Love my flash. I love how it automatically works great with burst shots. 
27432 This is the best deal ever for a non-professional photographer such as myself. 
27433 So much cheaper than buying the GoPro brand accessories! We basically saved hundreds of dollars and they are good quality products. 
27434 Works great! 
27435 You can t go wrong with this one PLUS it came with a car charger and a wall charger with are awesome! Thanks for the extras! Have yet to have to use both batteries on the same shoot with my GoPro. 
27436 delivered promptly, item was as described. charged the two batteries and am ready for a day with my camera. will shop with vendor again. 
27437 I should have gotten this sooner, if you want to get more versatility out of your camera this is completely worth it. Its great for capturing wide landscapes and taking pictures half above water half underwater. 
27438 I just got them and noticed that they drain really fast. (I have the go pro hero 4 silver.) My gut said get the go pro brand but i got cheap. You get what you pay for 
27439 Product as described. Would do business with again in the future. 
27440 Strap is well made but the small strap that go under my armpit is loosen all the time, can t lock it, the plastic buckle is the problem. 
27441 works just as described. only for indoors. not weatherproof but I covered mines with plastic for outside gate. remote works fine from 40ft. 
27442 RETURNED....this is NOT for a Nikon D3100 as it indicates 
27443 It is just a simple box...but GREAT in wet conditions !! 
27444 Great, love it 
27445 This battery has more capacity and lasts longer in my Sony Camera than the original. The price was great, and it arrived very quickly. This is a very good choice for replacement of this camera s battery! Thanks, jon 
27446 Good job 
27447 The padding is nice and thick and the case is light weight. Fits my camera perfectly. 
27448 I have two of these, but his is the one I use. I had a little trouble figuring out how much water to put in to make it neutrally bouyant but it works terrific otherwise! Would highly recommend this! 
27449 all ok 
27450 Very nice 
27451 It fits my Olympus Tough-1 camera perfectly. 
27452 It came fold so it has wrinkles and I roll it to see if it goes away I m waiting to see. Color it nice but I can t use it since it has wrinkles 
27453 Luv my new selfie stick this works much better than other s I ve used. The built in blue tooth switch and rechargeable battery make is very easy and fun to use The Rotating clamp and extended arm make for great angle shot s 
27454 Great product.. 
27455 Very pleased with this product. 
27456 Works great haven t got it wet yet I ll mount it on my racing jet ski this weekend so far really good deal 
27457 Great product! 
27458 It is the same as the original battery and charged and worked just like the original battery. 
27459 Just what I needed. 
27460 Works great. Really easy to setup! 
27461 fun copter to fly easy and stable but the FPV is really bad, see the RC forums for more about this. I recommend DO NOT buy this for FPV you will be disappointed. But for a fun quad to fly this is fun!!! 
27462 Great product! I will be purchasing again. 
27463 Loved what I received but the measurements were off from the description. Did not fit my Olympus. 
27464 This is a superb camera. Does so much for its size. Excellent for low light use! have always loved Canons but had to break away on this one... 
27465 great 
27466 there is no instruction or any package infomation in the package. 
27467 does what it says its gonna do --sometimes the tightening screw comes undone but it has never fallen out 
27468 I m very happy with the batteries!! They arrived quickly and they work great! 
27469 The case for my phone recesses the phone s lens and the lens clip doesn t compensate for it. This makes for a cumbersome removal of the case and I usually don t bother. 
27470 Super Fast Lens, buy it. 
27471 thank you for every thing. It is excellent. 
27472 Fast service, great price and happy customer. 
27473 Product was as advertised. 
27474 It s has only one fail , when not tight all the way it wobbles ... 
27475 decent enough digital camera. You just need to get a rechargeable battery 
27476 Arrived on time and works perfectly. 
27477 I ve received just 1 component. Add is not correct.... or the store trick us .... Do not buy it. 
27478 Fits all equipment but not very comfortable. 
27479 excellent product. 
27480 Good sale 
27481 I received this camera Monday. Extremely excited about taking pictures. I bought film for it as well, opened the camera put the film in and it didn t work. I watched several youtube video and read instructions and still isn t working? What s going on here ? 
27482 Quality was okay. But acceptable for the cost. 
27483 Excellent product and service 
27484 as described, got it fast 
27485 Works fine and cheap. 
27486 My daughter loves the camera. She took it to camp this summer. The picture quality is similar to the old polaroid pictures. The film is a little pricey, but fun. 
27487 Good 
27488 Love this and the convenience!!! Thanks! 
27489 not compatible with our Xfinity system. Returning 
27490 I am totally pleased with the 2 batteries. They arrived quickly and were a very good price. 
27491 Works great, we love it. 
27492 it was fine. just what I expected. 
27493 I ordered this case in the yellow with white dots. It came in the mail-it s the brown one!!! 
27494 Nice product arrived on time 
27495 Great service and product. Loved the ease of installation and helps greatly to see my camera screen in bright sunlight. Very inexpensive protection and photo taking assistance! 
27496 Very bad quality. In a two days one motor died. Bought new and replace. In a week another one died. 
27497 Great product. Exactly what I needed at half the price. 
27498 Good fit and decent build.. 
27499 No directions... Lists my camera, can t figure it out 
27500 The filters are amazing quality for such a low price! Bought them for my wife and she loves them! Fast shipping as well 
27501 Didn t fit the battery that suppsably it fit, didn t find out till the day I needed, 6 months later 
27502 Works really good with my Nikon D5500. I completely recommend this item. 
27503 Very hipster and ideal for a photo bug. 
27504 Was very helpful 
27505 Awful. Something appears to be wrong with the film. All pictures are either under or over exposed or don t turn out at all. Have tried two packs. Prior to this, the camera was working fine. 
27506 could be 2 inches bigger all the way a round 
27507 than it would be perfect 
27508 My father asked for this as a birthday gift. He absolutely loves it and made a point to buy the extra battery and parts to keep it running. 
27509 Instructions are vague at best I have not gotten it to work at all as of yet 
27510 As described. No issues. Fits well onto the diving housing for a hero 4. 
27511 These batteries and charger was just what I was looking for. 
27512 Works with the Sony HX300 well! 
27513 Exactly what I expected. 
27514 Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled. :) 
27515 The piece fits my D7100 perfectly but the magnification is virtually unnoticeable compared to the stock eyepiece. 
27516 Worth every penny! 
27517 Great as I expected! 
27518 It s a bright portable light. I would advise getting the li-ion battery & keep a spare set of AAs for backup. It looks weak around the shoe mount so be careful handling it. It s not Nikon or canon! 
27519 love it and easy to use 
27520 excelllent 
27521 Exactly what I expected. 
27522 I didn t believe the non-auto-focus would be an issue, but its a huge issue for me. I m keeping it for rare use but won t use it as much as I had hoped. 
27523 excellent tripod. I am using it with my pochade box. It is stable and works well. I love how small it folds to and fits in my backpack. 
27524 My 13 loves it takes it everywhere! Works great underwater! 
27525 Great product! Love it! 
27526 Just as expected, thank you 
27527 A great blogging/vlogging camera for beginners. 
27528 Very good, quality item.Love it. 
27529 not that great 
27530 Excellent!!! Full of room for all your gear!!! 
27531 cool... wish more came with the package 
27532 I bought this selfie crap it broke at the base where my hand hold the grip this is not a well made product don t buy it not worth it! 
27533 Shipped quickly, as described 
27534 My very first DSLR Camera...easy & fun to use & I can take better shots now. 
27535 Great price works better than expected 
27536 These cameras perform ok for what you pay. I know there are better options for color, clarity and resolution. This cameras does its job ok for such a low price tag. 
27537 They worked pretty good. 
27538 I would give this battery 3.5 if it was available. My Sony battery being very old still charges up to 235 min. This battery gets up to 190 min and discharges to 10 min of charge in about 80 min. But as a spare battery it could work. 
27539 Better than extensions not as short of a space to get your subject in focus. 
27540 Works! 
27541 Noticed some color fringing in the corner of some images. 
27542 I;ve been using this for about a year now. It was easy to set up, great picture and nice to see outside where there are no windows. Just added two more cameras. 
27543 Very nice present for my son. 
27544 holds all my camera and lens 
27545 Great case. This will easily protect our camera 
27546 very good for the price 
27547 Gift for my husband - he was very happy with this gift! 
27548 Telephoto did not work with my camera. Seller was prompt to make adjustment. Not happy with the product, but happy with the service. 
27549 Worked great, very happy we did not need to by a new tripod! 
27550 Can t use my camera without this... 
27551 I don t understand how this product has such good ratings. Almost every joint in the box did not fit with my gopro hero 4 housing (see the attached photo). There were a few exceptions, but I wanted a bundle, not a few working items. 
27552 Son in law was happy 
27553 Broke in 2 days. Not worth using 
27554 Perfect for camping flash light. 
27555 This came in a different color, but it s cute anyways. 
27556 Nice. 
27557 Great price and worked great for my nikon d40 plus lens, battery charger cables and more! 
27558 Very happy...very inexpensive replacement for the Nikon. 
27559 Very nicly made holds alot. Canvas looks good and it is a nicr quality bag 
27560 great! replaced the one I broke that I loved. 
27561 Added nothing special lighting wise 
27562 I have yet to get a bad Think Tank product despite many orders and many years. It does what it promises and does it well. 
27563 Love this little camera 
27564 Great stuff and on time 
27565 Great pole, easy to extend, gives me comfort we won t lose our GoPro while jetski-ing. Have purchased another, as a gift. 
27566 This product is identical to two others that I bought for about $4 each on Amazon. On all three the ball joints loosened up after 2 or 3 uses and it can t be used after that. Don t bother. 
27567 This strap worked exactly as advertised, and it works great because it allows freedom of movement rather than having the camera sit at chest level. The clasp is very secure and well done. Very happy with it 
27568 Good 
27569 Looks and feels like high quality leather.......probably because it IS high quality leather. Fits the Sony RX100M III perfectly. Leather, adjustable shoulder strap. Would like to see a small pouch on the back side for a small lens clothe. 
27570 Perfect! 
27571 Great Product!! 
27572 Great Product and Excellent Quality. 
27573 I like it,it does its job with ease. 
27574 misleading 
27575 It works and matche dmy len. Pinch caps are the best. 
27576 fits perfect with my camera 
27577 sturdy and comfortable:) Love the cute designs and the attractive color ^^ 
27578 This is a extremely useful dolly and I love using it when shooting shallow depth of field. 
27579 perfect 
27580 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
27581 As advertised and fast delivery. 
27582 Customer support is fabulous. Worked on my issue and continued until problem was fixed. 
27583 Not near as cushy or comfortable as I had hoped. Looks nice but just doesn t have enough padding. 
27584 Very beautiful bag 
27585 a gift 
27586 Delivery was fast and it works great. Some of the accessories were not worth having but the package is still a good value for the beginner. 
27587 Fits my nikon d5200 perfectly. Cute and sturdy. 
27588 Love it! 
27589 Good product so far, 
27590 Super replacement. Highly recommend!! 
27591 Pretty flimsy when extended. Can t support the weight of the go pro and will spin around. 
27592 nice set 
27593 I recommend anyone beginner or expert to own one. Can t go wrong for the price. Overall a great camera. 
27594 Works great! Still on my first protector 18 months later! 
27595 The CD with the software is full of viruses, detected in different PC running Symantec and McAffee, could not yet find the software to download from the realand.com website. So far useless. 
27596 Great Lens for travel and walking around. The focal range means you can shoot up close or wide without changing lenses. The pictures I get are tack sharp. Great lens at a great price. 
27597 use all the time-it works perfect so I always have backup when I m out on the road taking shots 
27598 great! 
27599 Great little lens for beginners to try macro photography. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of shots. Give it a try. 
27600 It s pretty sweet! I used it last week when I went diving and its great especially with the variety of lengths you can choose from! I like that it had a padded bag and parts to connect my camera too! 
27601 First one died after 10-15 pictures. Amazon was great and sent a new one and I returned the old. New refurb unit has worked very well for what it is, a point and shoot camera. I like the wifi capability and it works well with my IPhone 6plus. 
27602 It converts nicely, but I wish the screen was a little bit larger, so I could see what I needed to adjust. 
27603 Bulky 
27604 Good 
27605 Henry was very helpful to fix my modem issues. Camera works great Thank you 
27606 It works perfectly! Your only problem will be to change the battery as it is hard to pop open the port. Other than that an excellent product. 
27607 Works great. 
27608 great for my a6000 
27609 I purchased this camera as a gift for my son. His remark about the camera was &#34;awesome!&#34; The camera takes great photos and the zoom is amazing! May purchase one for myself! 
27610 Excellent Camera and an excellent package and price 
27611 Got the job done! 
27612 Very positvive this battery. In perfect status. 
27613 Great product for the price. the Lense cap was bit tight for my Nikon camera but it works fine. Will certainly buy from this seller again. 
27614 Looks good. Sent back bc i don t have internet 
27615 Henry Campbell is the best. So helpful! 
27616 Zipper jammed, and I destroyed the zipper trying to fixed that..... 
27617 It s listed to fit the Fujifilm X-T1 but doesn t. 
27618 great seller - delivered as promised! 
27619 I just wanted some easy to use quickly lens, and these are perfect.They are good if you are on holiday and want to take some nice shots or if you have some pictures planned. Especially good with the iPhone 5s as it has the very good camera quality! 
27620 Works perfectly. Safe, secure and attractive. The elastic function around the lens acts much better than the typical through-the-eyelet keepers 
27621 Thank you! 
27622 Perfect for what we need them for. 
27623 Arrived on time. Fits the charger and the camera as promised. Arrived with a greater charge than the battery provided with the camera. 
27624 Batteries are a bit larger. Tight fit 
27625 Excellent package 
27626 NONE 
27627 Love these things. I wish they were cheaper because I need 3 more. 
27628 GREAT PRICE,FAST SHIPPING, I BOUGHT THREE OF THEM. 
27629 Excelente 
27630 Pretty tinny cloths 
27631 I had to return these cameras due to the terrible connection to our wifi. The image quality was nowhere near 720p. I ended up purchasing a hardwired security camera set that works better. Save your money on this product 
27632 thx 
27633 was my husbands birthday present for his gopro. he loves it we carry it everywhere. 
27634 Excellent product. I use this for my spotting scope at the range. This allows for easy fine adjustment at extreme distances. Very intuitive. 
27635 Good for what I payed for it. 
27636 The battery was only $7 including shipping. Has quite a bit more milliamp capacity than the original. Made a great replacement battery. 
27637 GOOD DEAL 
27638 Complete garbage 
27639 great. 
27640 I purchased this shutter release for my Nikon D3300. the button on this release has a tendency of getting stuck and if you have your camera set to bulb mode this may lead to over exposure. I d recommend looking for something of better quality 
27641 Awesome camera for family! Super intelligent mode, a lot of scenarios and effect for more professional look. And also fully manual mode for more professional job. 
27642 most disappointing,worked for one day, total lack of support,phone calls were endless loop,emails returned.sending it back will be another irritation. 
27643 great product thank you 
27644 These are made pretty well, very happy. 
27645 works great easy to use 
27646 A LITTLE HEAVY, BUT IN THE TOOL BOX. 
27647 We bought these for a trip to Aruba...I was concerned about the quality of picture it would take but was pleasantly surprised that the underwater pictures turned out great!! Also, they were available at the gift shops on the beach for $22.00 EACH!! 
27648 The stick extensor is a little flimsy not for any major X-sports ,just casual pics all else as expected 
27649 Cheap, comes dirty, scratched up, but what can you expect for a cheap Copy Stand. Definitely got the job done though. 4 star because it came beat up. 
27650 This cute tripod does just what it should. The iPhone is held firmly in placen no wobbles. And I love the remote shudder control. I would purchase from this company again. 
27651 Super prompt with delivery. 
27652 .great items for on the road photo shoots. 
27653 Works just like it is supposed to. Not sure why the other one died but...... 
27654 very nice 
27655 So adorable, looks like a purse but holds the cutest camera ever. 
27656 Great idea however it does not close completely. It saves time and hassle of removing the &#34;standard issue&#34; lens cap. 
27657 Great buy I love all the features it has, especially transferring photos straight to your iPhone. 
27658 Its a perfect size for my camera. Not too big, but holds everything. Love it! 
27659 A bit difficult to lighn up with the camera lens but other than that works great! 
27660 Love it, best mount I have bought so far. Easy to use and not in the way. It is as if you were riding the bike while watching the video. 
27661 take some getting used to but overall but works great. 
27662 This works well. 
27663 terrible sevice will not refund item keep saying nrver got item 2nd return both item don t work keep away kenneth 
27664 It was exactly what we need and it came with a string that connects the lens to the camera to prevent loss of the cap in the future. 
27665 Fast shipping !!! Had Everything my Boyfriend wanted. Great price 
27666 Works as expected. Nothing fantastic but allows for a lot more use than the tiny battery. 
27667 I am extremely pleased with my Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital Camera and its accessories. 
27668 love it 
27669 Great! Wow I love it. 
27670 These radio triggers are simple, rugged and reliable. I use them for weddings, location and studio work. I especially love that I don t have to deal with cords anymore! 
27671 I does not work properly and need to return Garbage 
27672 Very pretty colors inside the film. We liked the transition from one pictures Frame to the next 
27673 Very good 
27674 This camera was a birthday gift for my husband, who takes pictures of things like Venus and birds a quarter of a mile away and continues to be amazed at the picture quality and features. Best gift ever according to him! 
27675 good 
27676 Quick service. Everything arrived as expected! 
27677 Great service and great product!! I could not be happier and am having lots of fun playing with my new toy. Thanks so much 
27678 It s so hard to press the button on the stick don t buy this buy a selfie stick with seperate camera button to take the picture. 
27679 works wonderful as a white black and gray refinance i would recommend this to any photographer from hobbyist to professional 
27680 Only one worked. The other never worked at all. Shortly after I received the package (2 weeks) the second battery stop working. Not worth the buy even for a short period of time. 
27681 Great System , easy to set up. 
27682 Works, big and bulky 
27683 good 
27684 Performed as expected. I like the way it folds to a compact size. Seems to be made well and for the price, it is a great product!! 
27685 Thanks! 
27686 Didn t stick well to my kayak at all. 
27687 it suks and thay all broke after 2 days 
27688 good size! 
27689 Came as ordered. Looks slightly different than the one I was replacing, but works the same, and fits the same! 
27690 So pretty~ suitable with nikkon coolpix p900.. And color is amazing...... 
27691 Simply perfect. Works great, Provides protection and does it s job well. 
27692 Too big, too wrinkly, doesn t come with stand. 
27693 I needed the extra length cable to go under the eaves of the house from the furthest point. Had a little left over at the DVR but no problem. The camera worked perfectly. 
27694 Great little camera 
27695 Item was as described and arrived on time 
27696 Buen producto 
27697 The screw is a little long. Did not fit my application. Quality is better than expected. Have to return however. 
27698 small, efficient, and the hot shoe can be unscrewed so it can be mounted on a threaded screw. 
27699 Perfect fit.. 
27700 Great set of lenses, inexpensive, and they definitely do the trick without spending a fortune. 
27701 My friend recommended this camera to me. She said she likes this model over the newer model. I don t know the difference, but I sure love this model. It s user friendly and works great, indoors and out. 
27702 will see if I need it 
27703 Go seemless or go home. I switched from canvas this and wow. Editing is a breeze now, and if there is a mess tear off the sheet and pull more down. 
27704 Useless if you d like to shoot anything at a down angle. Works ok straight on, but if you attach it to something and point it down at an angle, the top just starts drooping down. It can t hold the position. So, kinda pointless.... 
27705 The batteries are working great. 
27706 works great 
27707 Does not work looks very odd way 2 big took forever to come. 
27708 I needed the battery charger and it was a much better price than what was at a local store. I was pleasantly surprised to receive so much more than just the charger. 
27709 Great camera! 
27710 It was a great addition to my go pro! very easy to use! 
27711 Plastic fantastic. 
27712 Nice to have a bunch of these lying around. In the desk, in the backpack, in the car, with my sunglasses. Keep our screens and glasses clean without scratching! 
27713 Good 
27714 Easy to use. Did a good job of converting 35mm slides to digital. 
27715 The camera filled up with water 5 minutes into the snorkel trip. 
27716 My tapes get stuck in the door while trying to remove them. Have to jiggle them vigorously, then they can be removed. 
27717 Works perefext. 
27718 Thank you, it was exactly what I needed. 
27719 aaaaa 
27720 This camera is great! It s sooo cool and cute. And really easy to operate. The directions and manual answer almost ever question you could have. I LOVE it!! 
27721 nice product 
27722 Brilliant!!! Great customer support...completely intuitive to use. 
27723 simple to use with great outcomes 
27724 very good 
27725 Product is not compatible with Polaroid Zip Printer. I only get &#34;Paper Mismatch&#34; error. 
27726 I flew great then about the 5th flight it broke. Took it to hobby show they said it came with a burnt out motor. 
27727 Very nice set for the price. I am new to digital photography, and these filters are very helpful. They arrived in good condition, well-packaged, and I am pleased with the purchase. 
27728 Great item! 
27729 Amazing lens!! Very good quality and it s affordable! 
27730 incredible camera. 
27731 Love the bag but would like a little more room 
27732 It works, but there is no real way to get it tight because of the elastic. It bounces mad moves a lot if you have it set on the top mount making the video almost unusable. 
27733 This is an excellent clip. It stayed on my backpack shoulder strap was easy to adjust and went all over Europe shooting video constantly. 
27734 Got this a deal of the day for a great price. Its one of the best sling bags I have used. 
27735 Very durable product. Withstands a great deal of intensity using the product. 
27736 I want to love these, they are good, but if anything knocks them over, the umbrella boning bends so easy! My other issue is if you can t attach a reciever and use the umbrellas. I had to buy a new attachment that allows me to use it. 
27737 Great little-power house of a camera. Looking to add other glass on the camera. 
27738 Works great, love it! 
27739 Good resolution 
27740 All good. Thanks! 
27741 Only after using it once, the battery door broke. 
27742 Love it 
27743 Excellent! 
27744 great compact bag you will appreciate during travel 
27745 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
27746 The Internal Foam is not useful. Size doesn t fit the GoPro well. 
27747 The item was delivered earlier than expected. The quality of the product isn t the greatest but works as expected. 
27748 I was very satisfied to see that this replacement was exactly the same as the one I lost. 
27749 it came with everything promised and it works great 
27750 The filters have internal mounting treads and are for a Polaroid. They will not work. My Minolta AF200M Zoom 28 - 100 needs filters with external treads, 55mm for may D7 Maxxum; which is what I ordered for. I will never us Amazon again for my photographic needs... 
27751 This item was exactly what I needed and came right on time. It arrived the day before my trip, which couldn t have been more perfect. -TD These are The Last Days of Dark. 
27752 simply amazing. not the best in low light. but when it performs it is the best in it s class. 
27753 Great product for price. Easy installation easy to save data 
27754 Excellent quality for price 
27755 Just What I Needed. 
27756 Hard to use and didn t work for what I needed it to do. Not good unless you are working outside in wide open environments. 
27757 Excellent! 
27758 techhelpla.com approved 
27759 Good 
27760 This glasses is good I love it 
27761 I use this all the time. My Go Pro is always hooked to this! 
27762 I like the fact that it tightens well and doesn t move from your desired setting. Lots of applications and options with this. I will buy a few more. 
27763 No disappointments. It does exactly what the product description says it does. The only consideration is that it is, as advertised, &#34;light weight&#34;. As long as you handle it with attention that doesn t seem to be a problem. It s certainly worth the price. 
27764 The batteries get hot. Not so good 
27765 Bought for the wife and she loves it. 
27766 I haven t used it much yet but it doesn t seem to polarize as much as I hoped for. 
27767 I am soooo happy to get this and it works wonders, Thank You! 
27768 Very good product. Good price especially compared to the Nikon model. Fast delivery. 
27769 Flimsy. Can t hold my Canon 6d. 
27770 Perfect fit to Yi Sport. Charges quite fast. Haven t check how long it lasts but will update the review once done. 
27771 Some different precut compartments than shown in the picture. As a newbie not vital for me, as I m trying to figure out what I need/want, but if you re buying this for exactly what s shown, you may end up returning it. 
27772 Nice set! Everything here is usable and quality product. I would have liked a better case to store it all in together. Glad to see such a combo set available. 
27773 Good 
27774 Works like it suppose to! 
27775 Compared to the pricier monopods like Manrottos, this one seems a good bit smaller in size, which might be good. It s sturdy enough, and great for the cost. 
27776 It is a great bag, but way too small for any dslr camera and lens kit. I should have listened to the other reviewers. Now I am stuck with it or buy a bigger bag and lose the money I spent on it 
27777 Works as expected 
27778 1 star because 0 is not an option. This is not compatible with a sony A230 
27779 The product is good, but does not fit in my speedlight. I´ve just bought because of recomendations who bought together. 
27780 Easy to install and use. The longest part was the camera installation. ..running the wires through the attic and into the On Q panel. 
27781 really nice I got it to use for police harassment that s right!!! I recommend it for anyone who is being harassed imagine for the people who are supposed to protect you. But sadly its the truth. God help this new America. 
27782 Nice little case that goes well with my new Nikon mirrorless camera. 
27783 This thing will only provide power to the camcorder. It will NOT charge the battery. The red light blinks as if the battery were being charged, but it s visual trickery ! No charge in the battery, regardless of how many hours it is left plugged into the wall. 
27784 Worked great. No leaks. 
27785 Good 
27786 I love this background. Great for packing, stretches well and for this reason no wrinkles. Recommended. 
27787 Works exactly as described. Somewhat slow on auto focus, but other reviews mention that. Very pleased for the price 
27788 Good quality, simple product, easy to use. Does the job well, no setup involved. 
27789 The photos appear too light. I tried several times to adjust the setting, however; the photos still remain too light. The same photos were installed on another name brand, and they look beautiful. My wife and I are not happy with our Micca purchase. 
27790 Great charger at a good price 
27791 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27792 Works 
27793 It s super gucci i love it it makes my pictures look gr8 
27794 Uncomfortable to use... 
27795 work great. 
27796 works great thanks 
27797 Just Great! 
27798 It was horrible and does not work. The film turns blue.... Do not purchase this film. 
27799 Great extension to my cannon camera. 
27800 These little inexpensive triggers work killer. Great purchase. Will be buying a couple more 
27801 Could not get it to work on iPhone or ipad 
27802 The insert for the pole was no issue. The problem was that it was somewhat transparent and I had a client ask me if it was a sheet from my bed. Not professional. 
27803 Very lightweight and easily tilts over...overall a good value tho...lightweight and decent quality 
27804 Works good. 
27805 Just what I needed for my new Nikon D7100 
27806 Camera is just as described and works fine 
27807 Excellent 
27808 Camera mounts are standard 1/4-20. I use the suction mount on my kayak (with safety line), plenty of holding power so far. the helmet camera straps are basically useless, I had to replace them with the pull to tighten kind. Everything is great otherwise 
27809 This drone was outstanding! I could preform flips and fly very high. The drone does not handle wind very well, and is currently stuck in a tree. 
27810 It s great I bought this for mountain biking and it has held up through many bumps and some crashes and records great and stays tight. 
27811 Great price for quality videos. Easy to use. On time delivery. 
27812 Love it 
27813 Works great, and the extra dry storage is a bonus. 
27814 Glad you offer this plan. 
27815 Materials expected to feel better 
27816 Very adjustable. Easily get a perfect and comfortable fit. Mountain biking videos are much more interesting from this perspective vs. a handlebar mount. For $13, this is an absolute steal. Quality is very good. Stop looking and just buy this now. You won t regret it. 
27817 Good condition! 
27818 This filter was delivered SCRATCHED. Not just slightly scratched--it looked as if it had been scraped along concrete. Not exactly what you want to put on the end of your camera lens. THE WORST product I ve ever purchased online. 
27819 Good buy 
27820 Excellent for the money 
27821 Have never had a problem with Hoya. It works as it should. 
27822 Worked great! Used it for whitewater and climbing! Adjustable and Seems to have more adjustability than the gopro brand chesty mount. Love the blue also, makes it pop! 
27823 I hope not use it. but none one knows it. 
27824 YAAASSSS 
27825 This is a heavy duty case great for demos! 
27826 Worth the price. Maybe 
27827 These are nice 
27828 This was just what they say it is. I like this because it blocks the sun from hitting the camera so that you can see the shot a whole lot better. Great when shooting from a tripod. I love it.... 
27829 Great experience with purchase and a great camera. 
27830 I like it. seems sturdy, easy to use, bluethooth connect intantly. will recommend this product to a friend. 
27831 This was the recommended size. It did not fit my lens 
27832 good 
27833 .works but a little too heavy 
27834 Excellent product for the price. 
27835 Delivered on time and fit my camcorder just fine. 
27836 I absolutely love this camera! It came with a handy strap and color of the item was true to description. Item was brand new and packaged really well. It takes great shots however just be aware that there s only 10 film per cartridge (not included in purchase). 
27837 Excellent product 
27838 Extremely small and lightweight das good. However, it pops off its rotating ball far too easy and does not support the weight of a point and shoot camera. Also what if this &#34;free gift?&#34; There was no free gift. Does the plastic bag count? 
27839 Great product! 
27840 Perfect, during night has a good view 
27841 Good adapter 
27842 Good! 
27843 Simple, plain, to the point, fast 
27844 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
27845 excellent very pleased 
27846 Not a bad purchase. It is a bit light and I wish the lens were thicker. 
27847 But now it don t work ! 
27848 Very nice. We got them to clean DVDs but staff all wanted one for their glasses, too! 
27849 Everything worked perfectly 
27850 Great filter... 
27851 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
27852 looks very good outside! very real 
27853 I matched this mount with a gorilla-pod tripod holder, and it works great not only for holding photographs, but for holding phones on headrests for in-car video. 
27854 Great item 
27855 This kit is exactly what I was looking for and needed. Set-up is easy. I know I ll get a lot of use out of this product. Should this not be durable, I ll be sure and let you know. Thanks! 
27856 Good for the price. 
27857 Bought his for my Canon Tebel T3i Does what it s supposed to! What else do you want? Charges perfectly, no issues. LED light indicates when charging is done. It s compact, no wires. Pins flip out to plug into socket. Very happy with my purchase. 
27858 This bag is the perfect size, not too small but super lightweight and easy to carry all your stuff in. 
27859 NICE product 
27860 Great product. Better than all other baby specific monitors. Will buy again. 
27861 IT S the best very BRIGHT strobe flash. 
27862 Very average photo s phone in a bag is better 
27863 Well made. Does what it s supposed to do, and will last. 
27864 Fantastic camera. Cannot tell you anything about the vide as I am a photographer and did not get this camera for video. 
27865 Nowhere near as large as described. I returned it since I could not get the gear stashed that was described. 
27866 Charger works great, and will definitely purchase another one in the near future. 
27867 Very good!! 
27868 Works well for the moon. 
27869 light, portable, works great 
27870 Takes a bit of trial and error adjusting the setting, and maybe a few film sacrifices. Other than that great camera. 
27871 The cameras have great video when connected directly to the NVR... unfortunately we could not get them to work wirelessly with my existing wireless network. Tech support responded but could not follow their instructions. The manufacture needs to provide a LOT better and understandable instructions. 
27872 great value 
27873 Richard 
27874 They really look like active cameras. 
27875 Could not get this to work with my Canon T5i. Sent it back for canon model. 
27876 a 
27877 great camera for the money 
27878 nice but not very durable 
27879 Can t beat the performance for the price. 
27880 Awesome lights 
27881 This is one of the best deals for this product! 
27882 Easy to install and look real. 
27883 I love this bag! So happy I bought it!. Its nice and big and I love the color. Great buy! 
27884 Lasts longer and charges faster than OEM battery. Using with a Sony AS-100V action cam. Update 5/30/2016: Do not leave the charger or car adapter in direct sunlight. It will straight up melt. If you leave it in your car cover it up with something. 
27885 Simple but nice product 
27886 A camera made for dummies like me. I love the zoom feature. And I like not having to carry a supply of batteries with me. 
27887 It s film and it works. What else can I say? 
27888 Great product and works like a charm.. 
27889 got a couple of these, i don t know if it deterred and burglar but so far no break in yet. 
27890 Does not last as long as I thought it would. 
27891 I have taken more pictures and not have to watch my batteries...Ready for my curse. 
27892 As Described, recommend 
27893 This strap works well with the camera I have. 
27894 easy to set up. 
27895 I m a beginner, very happy with this stabilizer. It took me minutes to balance it 
27896 I love it and wish I still had it. I had to through it away because the top fell off while I was running away from a lightning storm. Anyway, it was great but not durable but I didn t expect it to be for that price. 
27897 I really like this camera. It takes really nice pictures, including panoramic and other features. Only complaint is it goes through a lot of batteries. I suggest getting rechargeable batteries if you buy this camera. 
27898 I lost my lens cap. This one works. Not a whole lot to say about it. 
27899 Fits my DJI phantom 3 pro camera like a glove. Easy and quick to install. Not ackward and cumbersome as the camera stabilizer that came with the phantom. 
27900 As advertised; delivery on time. 
27901 Fit perfectly and great price.Could not find locally. Was glad to find on Amazon 
27902 doesnt fit my sony alpha. not sure what ass backwards connection i was given. dont waste your time! 
27903 Excellent !! 
27904 Good Price. Works as expected. 
27905 What is there to say? .... It seems sturdy for an important modern need. 
27906 Great flash bracket, simple an reliable. I will probably replace some of the knobs with something all metal and then these will be as good as expensive manfrotto brackets. 
27907 As soon as it arrived I opened it and it was completely scratched on both ends I don t know if they don t put much effort into making these or if I got a used one. Totally dissatisfied 
27908 too flimsy, needs to be stiffer 
27909 Works perfect! 
27910 Good product, but the resolution could be better. 
27911 It never worked. I should have sent it back. 
27912 Amazing 
27913 Simple to use and with the included pocket on the gel holder, the gels will not get lost and last a long time. It s also easy to cut your own gels out of material found at Office Depot. The gel holder fits perfectly. 
27914 This works great for taking photos for my online store. The light does suck up batteries so be prepared with some extras. 
27915 Happy to have the extra protection. 
27916 Works great! 
27917 Bad ball head for heavier cameras. 
27918 high priced for a dolly that barely holds up my dslr. Next time I will shop around. 
27919 nice 
27920 This is a nice case. Its vintage and can be used for more than just your camera. 
27921 Works as stated. 
27922 Excelent. 
27923 Captures stunning video. This is my first GoPro so I m still figuring stuff out, but man is this thing fun to play with. Easy to take ANYWHERE and capture most anything you do. Touch screen is a nice, new feature. 
27924 Really great picture and package, especially for the price. Took it under water just fine, love it. 
27925 Not very liked. It doesn t allow for quick access to the camera and you can t take a quick photo. Protects very well though. 
27926 Product quickly re-charged my camera & the extra cleaning kit had everything I needed to take care of my equipment. Thanks you. 
27927 I am so happy I bought this, I used it for the first time and it was wonderful. So easy to change the screens. the size is also nice and can be used as a backdrop. 
27928 Excellent product. A+++++ 
27929 It s a more comfortable alternative to cheap cord straps. It rides about mid-chest on me, which is what I like because whatever is on it doesn t swish around as much when it s mounted higher. 
27930 Good Deal! 
27931 Awesome original part, in oem package and from slicktron rc, got it first class mail in 2 days, wish I had know would have ordered all parts from them! 
27932 works great! 
27933 MagicFiber works great for me so far. No lint or fiber material left on the surface of my sunglasses or laptop screen during or after cleaning. I use one of the oversize MagicFiber sheets to polish and wax my guns. 
27934 Great product and Service. Walter in support was very helpful in setting up my remote access 
27935 Poor quality, and not costly for what is delivered. Poor quality eyepiece optic focal adjustment. 
27936 fits fine 
27937 Excelent and original piece for my old Minolta 100-300 mm Xi lens!!! 
27938 Love it! 
27939 simple and easy to use 
27940 Absolutely perfect for my needs. 
27941 Connections drop when used for a while, battery seems to go dead but actually experincing loose connections 
27942 There was no way to choose the color I wanted. I ended up getting gray and white even though the orange was displayed. 
27943 I bought this one little a year ago and now it is dead. 
27944 It s ok!!!! 
27945 Works great. Easy to use and easy to transfer photos to computer. 
27946 Works great and easy to set up is you re familiar with CCTV DVR S. 
27947 not as cool as i spect 
27948 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
27949 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
27950 I ordered this item and I must I say I love the design of it as well as the construction. Definitely well built and durable all the way around. I will be combining with other accessories such as the vest and belt but so far its working great!! 
27951 Came with a few extra little things that I can hang my pictures with, and a nice little note. Very lovely people! 
27952 The pics are clear and it has plenty of options. I was a little disappointed but 360 view in a half sphere is pretty neat. It s a fun little toy. 
27953 pretty cheap and ugly but works ok 
27954 works 
27955 I like having extra batteries on hand for my camera and the fact that this was a 2-pack was better yet! 
27956 I love this bag! Perfect size for the camera and everything that goes with it! Received on time and in great condition! 
27957 Works better then the original battery. I purchased six of them. So Happy. 
27958 I needed it for a micro sized projector.. It works but not without some effort 
27959 Works ok for family stuff, but not reliable enough for professional work. It s freezes my camera now and then and the only way to fix it is to take the camera battery out. 
27960 Looks good. Have not used it yet. I does not have any decals. 
27961 Light and very adjustable. Nice to have the level bubble. 
27962 Converting to a monopod the 1st time was a little tricky but I got it to work. Product is exactly what I wanted and is a nice size so I can travel with it and set it up quickly. 
27963 Item arrived broken. I was required to pay for the shipping back. 
27964 Love these flashes. I use them with the Yungnuo 560 triggers and I couldn t be happier. 
27965 Takes a nice picture, but has awful focusing issues. 
27966 Very nice product lasts longer than the one provided by Nikon 
27967 Good product has a rubber liner on he inside that works great 
27968 Works for my wife, price is good, thanks! 
27969 Very Good 
27970 Received the case and it fits the Samsung camera quite well. This case is going back as it s not made of leather at all. If you want a plastic case buy this one. 
27971 High quality images using my Canon 70D. Incredible sharpness. High quality construction, feels very solid, great feel to the focus and aperture rings (fully manual) beautiful appearance as well (love the giant front element). 
27972 My experience with this item was not good, as the performance was way below expectation. 
27973 Cute and quaint. A role of film is about 20$. 
27974 Neither device would trigger the flash no matter what setting the camera was set on. 
27975 Excellent looks very real 
27976 Geat replacement screen. Will look great once i put it on my old gameboy color. Great product. A++ seller 
27977 Works great, and at a great price! 
27978 Such a great camera for beginners especially! Easy to use while still producing quality photos and videos. 
27979 Looks real enoughat a distance. 
27980 Simply awesome. Charges my 18650 batteries very quickly. 
27981 This did exactly what it said it would do, and seems to be pretty solid construction. It doesn t feel like a lightweight piece of junk. Some things like this feel like really cheap plastic, but this one does not. 
27982 Works perfect it was a gift for my girlfriends mom and she loves it takes it fishing camping to the beach always gets it wet and it does perfectly fine 
27983 Great battery. I bought two extra ones when I purchased the Q500+ which gave me four batteries and ensures me at least 1-3/4 hours of flight time on breezy days and up to 2-1/4 hours on calm days. 
27984 Nice items. Just as spected 
27985 just what i expected. and it is simple to use 
27986 Works great! But I would recommend getting a better GoPro pole. But 1 problem I always open the case upside down:) so you need to mark the top. 
27987 These work pretty good. I use the smaller ones for my old binoculars and one of the bigger ones for my range scope and they fit and fold down just fine. Easy to stretch and fit! 
27988 The battery works great,also I m using it in my battery grip for my d60 Nikon and it works flawless 
27989 The rings seems to be dropping colors on the box itself. Not sure will it drop further? 
27990 Great mount and allows me to position the camera in a multitude of ways with ease. Deducting one star because the one I received was only able to go side to side, not the side to side and front to back as pictured. 
27991 Very nice bag, it works perfectly with my Zipshot MINI. Please note it will not fit the larger Zipshot tripods. 
27992 The moving(swivel parts) make the camera rattle around to much. 
27993 Excelente 
27994 Great 
27995 all good ingredients. very help first. 
27996 I got my moneys worth,keepup the good work. 
27997 Had to return the first one due to communication problems between the remote and the drone. They promptly sent me a new one. I was pleased with that. Other than a few technical glitches, I am enjoying the DJI Phantom 3. 
27998 camera is great, accessories not that good 
27999 Perfect for a new YouTuber like myself! 
28000 it is okay and good 
28001 Great quality. 
28002 !!!!**** Fits the Fujinon XT17 x 4.5BRMK14 lens for a Panasonic HPX 370 
28003 Good 
28004 Where are all these 5 stars coming from? These cloths leave more lint behind that what they remove! Or I must be extremly picky but Im not happy. Others work better do more research. 
28005 Performs as presented ,great camera for long trips. 
28006 Inexpensive and lets me keep my go pro going all day at the track. 
28007 Everything was shipped and came on time, but the quality of the items were horrible. Everything that had to do with the lens (hood and attachments) did not fit the camera at all. The tripod is cheap quality as well. I am pretty disappointed by the turnout. 
28008 Easy and fun camera to use for the price. 
28009 great for the price. 
28010 Cheap, works as expected 
28011 works better than I thought it would. Beats paying hundreds for a Coolscan. 
28012 Great product and the quality of the pi8ctures are great 
28013 Good 
28014 Nice camera! 
28015 No instructions but easy to figure out. Great product, great shipping. 
28016 It is OK, but I am not blown away with the quality. I guess you get what you pay for. The shoulder holder is definitely not the best part on this rig. 31/2 star. 
28017 Great, works as anticipated.. Only wish it were a tad cheaper. 
28018 Good product, works great. Like the separate packaging, Threw a couple in each glove box for my glasses. 
28019 Used this on an adventure course near Lake George. Worked great. Was worried it would stay on throughout the rough course. The little grippies worked fine. Glad I purchased this 
28020 COOL!! 
28021 nice light...at a very inexpensive price...you get what you pay for though...the stands are cheap...and the light hoods don t collapse for easy travel. But still a lot for a little. 
28022 Well made and strong, sturdy but unfortunately the shape of the handle bars prevent it from fitting good so cant see the phone but still a good product. 
28023 Great Cameras... Best for reliability if you need to do remote monitoring of your house. 
28024 Great case! 
28025 Great way to organize the stuff I have for the pelican case. 
28026 Arrived on time as described. I installed it and had my alarm system back up and running. 
28027 This item was a gift for my daughter. She said to give this a 5 star rating ! Very pleased ! 
28028 It s a little heavier than the one I have at home. You can only use this MANUALLY. Other than that, I thought it was okay. Add in a diffuser, and you re good to go. 
28029 This worked our perfect for my T3i!! 
28030 I am very pleased with the product and the service. 
28031 It is a lot of fun for the money. 
28032 Love this lens, clear pics and f/2.8 makes it great in low light! 
28033 Yes! I used this to go on ZIPLINE with a video camera. I used both straps connected to one camera for certainty of control. Worked Great! I removed one of the Metal screw on camera bases, and just used the lockable hook of one of the straps. 
28034 It was great until the waterproof aspect failed and we had no luck getting a warranty replacement, as &#34;Kodak&#34; does not really make this product. 
28035 I love it!!!! 
28036 Will keep your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean. Worth the price for peace of mind. 
28037 I ve had this camera for a long time and have never had a problem with it. Great purchase 
28038 Pretty nice lens for the money......you have to run it in manual mode but once you play around with f stops and shutter it s pretty nice. It even took nice pictures of the moon. Very satisfied 
28039 Very Good Tripod for price! 
28040 You would think this would be a no-brainer, but despite following the poorly-translated directions, I haven t been able to make it work yet. I think its simply defective. 
28041 Great training drone, easy to fly. Small enough for indoor use. It can really take a beating. You will need additional batteries for a good flying experience, the batteries last 7-10 minutes per charge. 
28042 Puts light right where you need it... 
28043 No comment. 
28044 amazing customer support, excellent product at a great price! Support from AR004216 was incredible! 
28045 Accessories are great. I had hoped the case had a permanent insert designed for the Go-Pro but it was just a foam insert that falls out and slides around too easily. Still a great deal. 
28046 Fits phone. Arrived promptly. Only difference is my original one had foam and was slightly more comfortable. 
28047 I ve owned this product for a little more than 6 months and used it for roughly 10 shoots: It has been finicky for the last two shoots, causing one to be cut short, and has now stopped working all together. Don t waste your money on this garbage. 
28048 Question: I have taken pictures inside and outside, close and far away, most come out blurry. It has the smart auto and smart flash settings on. I am not knowledgeable about cameras which is why i bought one with the auto features. Am i doing something obviously wrong? 
28049 could do without the rubber in the middle of the view finder 
28050 Nice, rugged little bag. Tight fit for my Canon PowerShot D30, but OK. Would hesitate to put more stuff in the bag, such as SD cards or cables. Several options to carry: neck/shoulder/wrist strap or belt clip. 
28051 This tripod mount works really well. Would have benefited from instructions on how to put it together but I eventually figured it out. 
28052 Really don t think you can find a better tripod for cheaper! Bought it (and a binocular adapter) for use with my astronomy binoculars and I couldn t be more pleased. 
28053 Great professional stuff. 25+ years in the alarm business, but don t do it for a living anymore. I swear by it, 
28054 Wow! This is one of the cutest and best deals. You get everything in the picture and they re all super cute. Can t wait to use it. Packaging was nice and arrived sooner than I thought. I highly recommend this deal. :D 
28055 I bought this product for some tabletop product photography. I needed a white, seamless background and diffuse light. This product worked great, especially for the price! I paid $20 and would happily do so again. 
28056 The camera was exactly as promised and i have loved it immensely. It was a good price for the camera, and it has been rewarding to me. 
28057 Great deal. Far exceeded my expectations. Great starter if you re really interested in photography. 
28058 Excellent product , really improves vision in bright sunlight. 
28059 Does the job. Great price. No issues here! 
28060 No life at all. Went dead with in an hour of use... 
28061 Awesome 
28062 Works as advertised 
28063 Just stopped working 
28064 This is not the described pink I was expecting. Although the color is more a salmon/coral shade, it is OK. 
28065 The camera is excellent, and the package included tons of things that made a great choice. 
28066 The camera is long gone, but the case is indispensable. 
28067 Like the camera, once I got it set up. It however took me 10 hours to set up a website and set up router. I am not tech say, had to watch YouTube to get it done. 
28068 It is affordable and works as intended. Might need a bath when you first get it, but not a big deal. I would order it again. 
28069 It works as it should. 
28070 It takes wonderful photos. Frustrated that I can t get the movie button to work (that means no shooting video). 
28071 One of the best camera bags I have ever owned :) 
28072 Well made, easy to use 
28073 works very well 
28074 Works well if you know what to do with it....LOL so really cant say. But looks nice and installs easly. 
28075 lots of storage 
28076 Great thanks🌸🌸🌸 
28077 RECEIVED IN SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WOULD RECOMMENED 
28078 I filled mine with heavy cat litter inserted into ziplock bags first. 3-6 pounds on each side does the job. 
28079 ♡ 
28080 Love it. Very easy. 
28081 All parts were in orders. Nice small camera for travel. Easy installation and download. 
28082 A versatile lens with great glass. I use this lens for everything from portraits to landscapes and have no complaints about its performance. Only praise. On the pricey side, but you get results. 
28083 A little too small 
28084 great 
28085 Only thing wrong is it is a little wiggly but it stays close to zero all the time 
28086 Great quality, fast shipping. Performs as needed and appears to be of solid construction. The first float I had, the stitching came apart where the camera hooks to the float. A lot of good that does to save your camera from sinking.Float held my Nikon perfectly. 
28087 Thank you the batteries and charge, perfect for my camerar. It will give me additional time to take pictures. Now, I will need an SD card with extra storage. 
28088 I lost the original hot shoe cover on my Olympus OM-D E-M1 and purchased this as a replacement which fits perfectly. Since is made of rubber, it has not accidentally fallen off. 
28089 It was really great at first but one trip to the beach got it rusting pretty bad. 
28090 I was very surprised at how easy and simple it was to use. It keeps the great quality of pictures. 
28091 A nice kit for your DSLR. Filters really make a difference in the quality of your work, and also protect your lens at the same time. This is a very reasonably priced kit. 
28092 Firmware is not updating over internet.. Certain albums are not displaying. Is there an option to update software by USB or SD card?? 
28093 Works perfectly! Don t waste hundreds in an electronic viewer. This is actually better! 
28094 Would not work!! Would not connect!! We put it to the side and forgot to send it back!! Never used!! 
28095 Exactly fit! And very good quality and fast shipping! 
28096 I really don t know what to say, it came in and the part that you screw on to the mono-pod was broken, never did get any answer back from vendor, but it gets you out there to the subject your trying to get a pic of.... 
28097 Works great. Cheap enough I bought several. 
28098 I was hoping to soften my image a bit, but this just blurs beyond recognition like an 1980s mall photographer. Also its coming from Hong Kong so too forever to get here. 
28099 Love this Magnifying Loupe. Had been thinking of buying it for a long time and finally saw a price I could afford. The transaction was easy peasy and the seller was great...no issues....def recommend both this seller and the item. 
28100 good 
28101 Excelent cam !! 
28102 Spot on! 
28103 does what is expected, good product. 
28104 Neat little softbox for the price. Nothing incredibly but definitely better than using the naked flash. 
28105 Works great for everyday photos 
28106 Small, adjustable, great picture and sound. Built in microphone has good range and helps eliminate cable clutter. Easy to disconnect to avoid hackers who would use your camera to spy on you. 
28107 Have only used one of the batteries, but for one cycle it seemed to match the performance level of the Canon battery. 
28108 Is exactly as stated and works great. 
28109 Outstanding little camera system with many features. A great value for all you get. Mobile viewing was very easy to set up and the picture quality is good. Too many walls will shorten the distance of reception however the system is outstanding in all. 
28110 Does what it says and now I don t have to buy separate filters and hoods for different size lenses! 
28111 very good I love it. 
28112 Not what I tought it would be 
28113 great price 
28114 I bought these small binoculars for my Sister who likes to watch birds from her kitchen table! She said they work perfect! She uses them every day! 
28115 A+ 
28116 yes just what i needed 
28117 Great little camera and DVR system, very easy to set up. 
28118 Fits the GoPro well! 
28119 Makes a big difference in the overall appearance of the camera. It works very well and cost a fraction of the Canon battery grip. 
28120 As described and good quality case. 
28121 Everything it was said to be! 
28122 I combined this with http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VV7JMSC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=1OABL0D3PBHIE&coliid=IGQJXE3GB584V for a wonderfully complete kit for under $100. The only thing I need now is a quadcopter... ;) 
28123 Perfect fit for my Pentax K50 And all the little things to hit the trails 
28124 The material is quite good but the smell of the leather is so strong ... this makes me feel uncomfortable. 
28125 Good tool 
28126 Best BIG umbrella i ve ever used, and the quality of the rods and fabric are well above average. The parabolic dome shape makes a big difference in light control. I threw a 7 Impact diffuser on it to soften the flash even more. Looking forward to shooting this weekend. 
28127 sturdy and easy to adjust 
28128 A must have for humid climates. 
28129 works great 
28130 im happy i will put sam pic or video later 
28131 Great case, perfectly fit my needs and priced right too. Arrived on time. 
28132 Solid construction. Packaged well. Performs as advertised. 
28133 Same charger that Canon ships with the camera. Lost mine. Canon wanted 50 bucks for the replacement charger. nuff said. 
28134 good 
28135 Beautiful strap BUT you better have a small hand. Difficult to get my hand through the loop and I don t have especially large hands. It s a 5 inch loop, needs to be 6 inches. 
28136 Just received my gopro today and no sd card but i choose the package with sd card :(((((( 
28137 good product 
28138 I love this. I was expecting something smaller and it s huge! You definitely need to have a place for this telescope. It is a very sturdy telescope. I haven t gotten to use it yet but can t wait 
28139 Excellent!! 
28140 The lens is amazing! BUT, I just bought this specific package because the lens hood like in the photo. When I opened I was very annoyed as they are not as described. HOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM??? 
28141 camera record in AVI only which is not compatible with 90% of the devices out there. I recommend buying the Wi-Fi version if you would like to actually see your videos. 
28142 Works well as a basic, every day lens and fits my close up lens set for use in flower photography. Nice addition to my camera bag. 
28143 works as described 
28144 My first review was rejected because it was very emotional, well, I will say easier, the device does not work as claimed, I did everything according to the instructions spent more than 3 hours making the one and same action and the result is zero does not work! 
28145 just what I wanted, real nice screen to see 
28146 My camera and all my lenses fit beautifully in this case. I love the fact that I can just grab it and go. 
28147 for the money ok but lots of plastic will fatigue ecome britle and break over time Im sure. More cheap junk from China. 
28148 Great for low light and quick photos. We use it take photos inside mostly and it works wonderfully. With just the little bit of light that makes it into the room from outside, we are able to take fantastic photos that look like they were taken with great lighting. 
28149 Def awesome does it all 
28150 They work great with both my 60d and the 70d. 
28151 Broke after one month. Need to return for one that works but is past return period. Motor just clicks but does not move. 
28152 Works great! 
28153 Exactly what I was looking for 
28154 Cannot beat the price on this and goes with my little vintage style polaroid perfectly! 
28155 ok 
28156 One battery was ok, but the other looked 20 years old. So swollen, it wouldn t fit in the compartment. 
28157 Love it! The retractable design makes it easy to carry. The brush is soft and it does the job very well. You must have one if you love your camera lens. 
28158 The lens hood work effectively and fits the lens correctly. 
28159 Product was useless, and the installation took almost an hour with cable Internet, as fast as it could be, I am still not able to set this camera, the My D-link was pain to find the product. 
28160 Please read comment By jnunniv on April 23, 2015. He is 100% correct. I followed his advice and, just as he said it would, it &#34;works like a charm.&#34; 
28161 ok 
28162 Soft, Gel-feel that you can keep on for hours. Camo is a plus too 
28163 So far so good 
28164 Worth the money. Don t see much difference I m GoPro brand with length of battery life 
28165 great 
28166 Fast shipping, great price! 
28167 Good Stuff 
28168 It does the job it s supposed to do. 
28169 [[VIDEOID:6cdee2e305bf59b79ec48101e10270a9]] I have reviewed the Ambient Weather BC-3000 intelligent battery charger and highly recommend the product if you are looking for an all in one battery charger for your home or business. 
28170 This is the greatest drone ever. It takes great pictures and videos. I am very happy with its easiness to fly. Definitely an A+ rating. 
28171 My cell phone takes better pictures, and my cell phone takes awful pictures. 
28172 With 1) a sensor battery life of only 6 months, compared to a Honeywell system of 3 years, 2) No-one that wants to monitor the system. makes this system not very realistic for an alarm system. Spend a little more money and buy a real system. 
28173 remarkable range and reach that most users will come to love. The main reason why I fell in love with it. 
28174 Like the way it brings out the blue of the sky. Awesome Poduct. 
28175 Only half of the picture was color. The other half was black. So much for &#34;rainbow&#34;. This was a birthday gift for my girlfriend... never been so disappointed. 
28176 Cute film, awesome colors. 
28177 perfect 
28178 little small but really protects lens 
28179 Very impressed with the clarity and quality of this film. Looks as good as digital but with the character of film... Nuff said ;-) 
28180 WASTE OF MONEY! 
28181 The quality of the video is fantastic. The microphone for sound is very sensitive to wind noise making the audio during the ride completely useless. 
28182 all ok 
28183 Works great, decent video quality and easy to set up 
28184 Too heavy. 
28185 One of three arrived torn. Extra material on the back is great if you need a sun screen, but a pain in the tail to deal with. Likely will cut excess material off. Just not worth it. 
28186 worth the money for clarity 
28187 Exactly what I expected 
28188 Love it, just love it. Simple to install, connect & configure. 
28189 Worked as expected 
28190 I got the 720p , picture very clear, infare red cool, its like having alight on, visiability only around 30 ft at night. Set up was easy, the only real work is running cable, which has label s, so you can t mess up. we love it! 
28191 My Camera is amazing...Maybe a bit overpriced but nevertheless it was worth it. 
28192 It s made out of plastic,the unlock bottom is flimsy I m afraid it might get stuck in the long run. 
28193 Nice easy to fly toy quadcopter. Great for first timers - like the blue color, I have 3 white ones that I have flown to death. 
28194 Just what I was looking for 
28195 just so so,it is tiring to change the camera lens 
28196 Excelent 
28197 The camera was more than I expected. Pretty much brand new with instructions. Completely satisfied with my purchase and this seller. 
28198 The battery was the correct battery for my camera and is working fine. Walt 
28199 Takes forever to focus whenever you zoom in and the picture will often come out blurry even when it indicates it s focused. Constantly made loud static sounds in the background of videos. Returned it the same week. 
28200 Did what it supposed to do 
28201 These batteries work beautifully in my Canon EOS Rebel XS. They hold a charge as well as name brand. I got them so I would have plenty of backup batteries on hand and I am so very glad I did. I will definitely buy them again! 
28202 I am very happy with the product... Customer service at amazon is the best... Thank you. 
28203 usefull to put all the elements of your camera. easy to open and get everything you need 
28204 We love our new camera. It took amazing photos of our Smoky Mountain vacation! 
28205 We like this camera but it is not doing everything it is supposed to do. It looks like there is some software glitch along the way. 
28206 How could you not like these. Five reasons to say thank you. 
28207 I bought this based on some of the reviews, one of the review s was a video review and what I got was not the same thing in the review s. I returned it. Later I read some of the other folks had the same problem. 
28208 Great for extending cables without have to splice new ones in. 
28209 I miss read their ad, but they stepped up and helped me out. 
28210 Great product thank you. 
28211 Great service Calvin! Camera works well after help from support. They were very responsive. 
28212 great little webcam. 
28213 Love this backpack. It even has a nice compartment for my netbook. Thank you! 
28214 fake gopro product with bad quality cheaply made chinese goods 
28215 The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is realy useless 
28216 seems to work well 
28217 The lens has it s limitations, but if you know what you are buying it for, it s a great lens for the price. I absolutely love it. 
28218 good strap arrived on time 
28219 never worked as described 
28220 did not work with my altura flash. no problem with refund. 
28221 Works as advertised, no issues! 
28222 Excelent Product, Use to carrier a Video Camera (Handycam). 
28223 fast shipping, as described. 
28224 it is a good product, it is too small, though. 
28225 fits well 
28226 I love this tripod. Its is very strong and has a lot of features. I strongly recommend it, you wont regret it. 
28227 Love them and they came on time!! 
28228 It is perfect. My identical camera had broken and this is completely like my old one. I love it and it was packaged beautifully 
28229 The orange tabs did break, I bought a bag of 24 clamps from Home Depot (various sizes) for a better value. 
28230 Holds my DSLR well and protects it 
28231 Great product--leads to fun memories. 
28232 Great set of filter. They truly add contrast and detail to photos. The case is really good quality as well. 
28233 Product as described!! 
28234 Excellent product. Multi-element achromatic design provides very high IQ compared to single element close up lenses. Adds flexibility to large aperture zoom or single focal length lenses. 
28235 This is a great value !! We love it 
28236 Very sturdy and great quality 
28237 excellent 
28238 Amazing product definitely not a fake I highly recommend it. No problems with delivery or the product itself. Comes with a lot of accessories ! Love it ! 
28239 Better than original go pro batteries. 
28240 The first one I had was great, but i lost it. The second one for some reason the top keeps falling off. 
28241 delivered as advertised very reputible. 
28242 Better than Expected! 
28243 Ok 
28244 Amazing quality for such a small lens. I love it. 
28245 Auto focus does not work with my Sony, but it is not a big problem. This lens lets you get some really interesting shots and people are amazed. 
28246 Wow! I truly love this camera body protector. It was just what I needed for my new canon 6D camera. It fits like a glove and it s also very light weight. I truly recommend this product to anyone. Protect your high end purchased. 
28247 excellent! 
28248 excelent , no problem 
28249 Very good product though a little costly. 
28250 This was a gift.. Never asked how it went.. 
28251 It does what I needed it to do. 
28252 Great binoculars for the price. I would recommend using a tripod for astronomical viewing. 
28253 I have owned several of these for various camera models. I have even bought them as gifts. I have never been disappointed. 
28254 Great product, great details. Not very clear description. The product is not a touch screen. 
28255 I LOVE THIS CAMERA. Stepped up from a Rebel T3i (which I love and still use as a backup body). Love the speed and the low light ability. Great pro-sumer camera. Wifi addition is tremendous and allows me to use my iPhone as a remote. Love it. 
28256 so far it work good. the only issue is that it won t start recording automatically when power is inserted which is important as I keep forgetting to turn on. 
28257 It s too hard to get an item under it to see anything. Can t really use it for the reason I purchased it. 
28258 This perfectly fit my needs. Love it! 
28259 love it 
28260 My product arrived just in time for my trip. I was able to use the covers to protect my lens. I am very happy with them. 
28261 The quality isn t GREAT, but it does OK. 
28262 I m using these as weather cams on wunderground.com. They handle FTP posting well. Directions are clear and easy to understand. 
28263 Great lens, probably not quite as sharp as the Nikon 14-24 but getting really close. 
28264 love it. works great and the accesories have exceeded expectations. 
28265 Does NOT fit the updated versions! 
28266 not working. I followed the instructions and it wont work. 
28267 Perfect fit. Love it. 
28268 Loved it...wish Flip was still in business. 
28269 Ordered for cousin 
28270 Very good value for money. All the components were good quality and worked perfectly. Will be buying a second kit for another camera. 
28271 Works great. I m only giving it 4 stars because it s aftermarket, and not canon brand. But hey- it s works great, so far!! 
28272 Good👍 
28273 No problems. Works as advertised. 
28274 This was a gift so I haven t used it, my granddaughter loves it. 
28275 Good 
28276 Works fine 
28277 NONE 
28278 It works, does the job, not big improvement on using time 
28279 LOVE it!!! Exactly what I need and use all the time...outstanding quality! 
28280 Not really that helpful but does have many functions spelled out. 
28281 Purchase was easy and product arrived on time and worked fine 
28282 Works as expected 
28283 Works perfectly and seamlessly with my 5D MkIII and my flashes. Exactly what I expected being another great Phottix product. They really are excellent! I would definitely buy again but doubt I ll ever need too! 
28284 Easy setup and good replacement for my Izon 1.0 - now i have a night vision - great. 
28285 Awesome loved go pro type this video to see it in action 
28286 Henry Campbell did a nice job helping me get my camera up and running again after moving. He remoted in and fixed it within 5 minute. Thanks, Henry. 
28287 Had to return however, did not fit my camera. 
28288 There is no info about camera on internet. Camera works well, but there are no infareds so no night vision and i can not figure how the usd cards works 
28289 Only way to connect is third party app that does not explain anything. 
28290 resistente 
28291 Works great. The people that posted negative reviews just don t know how to use this. Don t set on max setting and manually prefocus if you have to, or set at lowest setting, auto focus and only then adjust ND ring. 
28292 Works great for cell phones, quickly charges and can recharge a cell phone many times between charges. 
28293 The tripod works great. It came very fast. This tripod does what it is supposed to. Great for its price. The travel case, however, came defective and the material is not good quality. 
28294 Worked great. Batteries corroded when left inside though. 
28295 Good 
28296 Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap 
28297 Generally good, but focus is erratic and sometimes you get poor pics. 
28298 Easy to use, glad to have it while being on our tropical trip (boating, fishing, snorkeling)! 
28299 Great kit, the pad is nice and the belt is easier than putting on your own belt. 
28300 was used and missing the brkts for attachement. besides that it won t just fine 
28301 works great easy to set up 
28302 Easy to install and it works very well. Best price you can find online. 
28303 This plate is an exact match for my Ravelli APGL3 tripod. 
28304 Once I started using these for location shoots, I ll never stop. I absolutely love the results with my speedlite. 
28305 Shipped a large fragile and valuable sculpture in this. Pelican products are simply the best - built like a tank and flawless quality and design of every detail - clasps, wheels and handle are all outstanding. Not cheap but you will never regret having any of these cases. 
28306 tHE CAMERA LOOKS GREAT BUT MY GRANDAUGHTER HAS NOT USED IT YET. I THOUGHT FILM FOR THE CAMERA WAS IN THE &#34;BUNDLE&#34; & SHE NEVER SAW IT. AM I MISTAKEN/? BARBARA K MC CORMICK 
28307 Love it 
28308 I receieved the first one it did not work at all. Then the second one I rec d only one side of the charger works. It appears that the terminals inside are very poorly attached and just fall loose from shipping. Quality is very poor. 
28309 good product, price and company. 
28310 As other reviewers have stated the cloth does leave excess lint behind. 
28311 My Phantom2 is awesome!! Easy to fly without any experience! 
28312 Good quality 
28313 keeps the neighbor from parking in my driveway when i m gone. 
28314 Very good and useful to use the telescope out of city. 
28315 Works great. 
28316 So much stuff for a really great price! It came just in time, tomorrow I have a ghost investigation so gonna try it out !! 
28317 Works great,no probs yet,I m happy. 
28318 These Sony tapes work very well in my Sony Handicam Digital 8 camcorder. Output is in nice, clear video. I have used this camcorder and these tapes to record my grandaughter s birthday party and make an excellent DVD from them. 
28319 Non-standard thread size and ilconcieved proprietary clamp mechanism make this flag too flakey to trust on any shoot. If you have spare room on a cage or rig, lots of time and odd parts maybe. 
28320 Best digital camera on the market, hands down. I ve played with and used almost every brand and functionality out there and this one won my heart. Too expensive. 
28321 Be real careful mounting ,adjusting , the arms-mounts are very delicate , flimsy, once up near my real ones ,they look good, and may not be detected as fake, 
28322 Had sum questions of if it s 1080p but it is a good pictures 
28323 good quality but it s abit big for women wrists 
28324 works flawlessly 
28325 Easy to use durable and reusable. 
28326 Worked well for short period of time and then died. 
28327 Good flash.. delivered as promised.. thanks... 
28328 it is awesome 
28329 Works perfectly great. Seems really solid for anything we d ever need it for. Holds steady and turns smoothly. 
28330 as described good product 
28331 Nice product, all is well 
28332 Nice, but not quite long enough! 
28333 Handy gadget, works great, love the little storage compartment. 
28334 Comfy!! 
28335 dope lens you can t beat an F2.8 plus its made of strong material kinda heavy too which is good 
28336 It s okay. But I find the phone apps to do more! 
28337 Keeps your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake. Covers back door completely. Includes the two tether mounts/anchors, not the surf mount, as depicted in the first photo. 
28338 A lot of fun. Easy to use. However I now want an upgrade. 
28339 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
28340 Arrived with tear at the seam. 
28341 Works just as described! Incredibly simple to set up, and I love the function and aesthetics of it. Will probably add more! 
28342 The camera 📷 works great. 
28343 Got the cord and it doesn t work. I had to buy another one from best buy. 
28344 GReat price great service 
28345 Just as expected...added to my home surveillance, works great. 
28346 Great Product 
28347 Product just as expected, would use seller again. 
28348 I received the items before the target but 3 out of 9 were no working. 
28349 Excellent binos. 
28350 Worked perfect. Used over-sized bulk black paperclips to hold to Cowboy speed light stands and did my first green screen video. Worked perfect. Easy to store between video shoots. 
28351 Gud 
28352 It s okay, some vignetting and the outside is a little soft. I can t really complain because it was $250. I love h the wide angle though. 
28353 I like the 8-in-1 gopro kit, it arived pretty quick. The only thing is that the straps for the chest mount can be a little small if your a big person. All in all cool to have. 
28354 worked well for paint ball mask 
28355 not the right one 
28356 what i needed 
28357 for tus price its a good buy. 
28358 Love this alternative to pocket wizard. been using mine for a year. I have 6 and, they are reliable cheap and easy to use. I found a few youtube videos and had it all figured out from there. 
28359 It is very functional and very well protected. 
28360 This item was a gift for my 15 yr old granddaughter in Texas. She loves it!!! 
28361 excellent! 
28362 This has to be the best camera in the market. Pics are sharp, performs great in low light and with 32MP you can crop like you had a 500mm lens. Lots of options, intuitive to use (for an FX DSLR). 
28363 Nice quality. Good price 
28364 Delivered on time with great packaging. Items were as described and definitely a great asset for my photography! 
28365 Works well 
28366 Good Seller and Product 
28367 Had a few cosmetic issues, but lens seems to be in great working condition. 
28368 This unit works as expected. Great quality, built well with perfect connection to batteries. No longer have to worry about having access to AC power! 
28369 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
28370 Great product. 
28371 Garbage, don t waste your money. 
28372 A dream lens on my D700. Big and heavy and built like a tank which may be an issue for some weight wussies out there, but hardly a concern of mine; I appreciate build quality. Very sharp, great contrast and color saturation. 5 stars all the way. 
28373 Legit. Convenient. Easy to use. Smart design. Practical. Follow me on Instagram @heyitstony 
28374 Received this in really fast time, and as pictured. Had to mess with it a bit to get it on, but the extra filters I purchased fit fine. No real complaints. Would purchase again. Thanks. 
28375 Love these Wasabi cells! My GoPro 4 Silver does through a battery pretty quickly. A whole day of photos and videos is about 3 batteries worth. 
28376 This is a great case and perfectly designed for the dji Phantom 2. The drone and all of batteries, chargers, and miscellaneous pieces fits perfectly. It s very well built, lightweight and is what I had hoped for. 
28377 everything was ok. Thank you! 
28378 Good quality 
28379 I pulled it out of the package and plugged it into my wall. I then put a battery in the charger. It charged the battery like it was supposed to, even on off-brand products. Works great! 
28380 Husband likes this case because you can t see in it plus no one knows what it is. He also like it because it s very small. 
28381 RETURNED THAK YOU 
28382 Works so well I had to buy another! lol The picture is very clear and very wide. 
28383 This is definetly a must have product! 
28384 Product arrived deffective, with one loose leg, like there is a missing screw or something. I needed it for my vacations, what a waste of time and money. 
28385 Perfect solution to watch your pets and your loved ones at home. I found out that my dog just sits and waits near the entrance of the apartment from the moment I leave until the moment I come home. Amazing. Almost cried. 
28386 Worked splendidly. 
28387 very good.... 
28388 Awesome camera We took it on an 11 day safari with a six year old and 64 year old Grandmary. Easy to use n awesome shots were taken with the zoom. We took 1084 shots n kept 200. 
28389 Does NOT fit Canon M series. There were two questions on here answered saying that it does. I bought it and can confirm it doesn t fit. 
28390 Great all work fine 
28391 nice quality 
28392 Easy to fit on the handle bar. the actual GoPro holder can be removed from the handlebar holder what leaves a small peg on the handlebar 
28393 It meets my expectations does everything I thought it. Very pleased with the product. 
28394 I loved 
28395 very nice great value , perfect for those quick shots w/o using a slr. 
28396 This adapter is life. Works perfect! 
28397 It was lovely. 
28398 excellent 
28399 The quality is low but you get a lot with the deal. 
28400 good outside bad inside 
28401 Good price compared to battery stores 
28402 thank you 
28403 Works as advertised. I like the charger being independent from the camera. Have not fully cycled the batteries yet but don t expect issues. Also provides 12V. charging. Much cheaper than others. 
28404 takes fantastic pictures, model is a little older now, but cant beat this camera at this price point. Do not hesitate 
28405 Very nice filter set. 
28406 I love this Air Blaster..easy to use...no problems at all... 
28407 Richard. did a great job helping me set up port forwarding as well as email triggering.......10 Stars !! 
28408 My 18 year old and my 13 year old traveled to Toyko Japan and Manila, P.I. for the summer vacation. My teenager daughter got awesome videos using the GoPro while riding the wooden sailboats in the Phillipines. 
28409 great for the price 
28410 Seriousity and fast shipping!! 
28411 Just what I needed! 
28412 This is exactly as described. I bought this as a second battery for my camera and it is better than the original in that it lasts longer. The charger charges both batteries fine. 
28413 Does what its supposed to. 
28414 nicccccce! 
28415 Love it, but two weeks later and I still cannot figure out the instructions for downloading. 
28416 Not what I was expected. Came without any parts or helping page how to use it and how to see your pictures. This is our way to our future. Will be a disaster as planned by the experts in Washington, D.C. 
28417 Used on my panasonic dmc-fz70 camera. Fits perfect and pictures/video are great. Like that it protects the main lens. 
28418 Absolutely perfect, great price! Thanks! 
28419 Does what it is supposed to 
28420 its very good for taking photos but not good for videos. very smooth 
28421 A bit bigger than I expected, but works perfectly. I really like the fact that it can be plugged in directly in case the batteries in the receiver do die. 
28422 nice 
28423 It served the purpose. 
28424 Here s the bottom line: people wave at it as they walk by. :-D 
28425 Batteries are just as good as the original Nikon battery. I really love the travel charger. I keep a spare one in my suit case so I never leave home without one. I highly recommend. Shipped as promise I would purchase from this seller again. 
28426 Excellent Camera, Thanks. 
28427 It s very difficult to get off. It does wok but I wish it was machined better. 
28428 Omly wish it had beewn waterproof. Excellant telephoto and video. 
28429 Fit is very very good. Would buy again. 
28430 Very nice camara 
28431 cool looking 
28432 Awesome purchase!!!! Came in fast and everything is wonderful quality! Def would buy again 
28433 video/audio quality were good. i liked the product until the only button on it broke from pressing lightly. it was useless after that 
28434 works great 
28435 Fits like a glove, keeps out dust and protects the connectors on my a6000 flash shoe. 
28436 does what it is suppose to, and its made of metal. 
28437 Got this for my husband discounted to review. My husband has a canon camera but it didn t fit so he gave it to a friend who has a Sony. The friend says it works well. But the adapter does not work with all canon cameras. 
28438 versatile unit and easily achieved the position i wanted. 
28439 Great camera and the quality of the lenses are out of this world 
28440 Great--fits snugly and makes the camera look better, too 
28441 Works well. Cracked easily when dropped and now doesn t float well. 
28442 Everything perfect! Thanks! 
28443 You ll look a little silly with it since it s so huge but your camera will stay dry. 
28444 Takes clear pics. Great video! Small, portable, and powerful. 
28445 Amazingly sharp cutting wheel that will trim such a small sliver of paper from a photo if I didn t position it correctly the first time I cut it. Love that! 
28446 Nice polarizer, nice price! 
28447 They didn t work on my Kindle 7. 
28448 Excellent product.. it helps me a lot since I m new with my camera so I use it a lot... for me it s perfect to have more than one battery to use. Thank you! 
28449 Works great for a fraction of the price of the orion brand. 
28450 Great Camera Bag. Bought one as a gift in 2012 and the bag is still protecting the camera and lenses. 
28451 Exactly what I needed so I m not constantly changing lenses. The &#34;leash&#34; for the lens cap is a sweet bonus. I have &#34;lost&#34; the cap so many times in my travels. Also, the bag is well-padded and perfect for my Nikon and the new lens. 
28452 It s made out of plastic not carbon fiber. While not perfect, it will give some protection. 
28453 The backdrop is exactly how it looks in the seller pictures. Pictures can out looking great. Recommend this item. 
28454 I realy like my new Phantom!!! Thanks 
28455 WORKS GREAT BUT A BIT SLOW TO CHARGE 
28456 Awesome! use as a security alert. 
28457 FANTASTIC UNIT 
28458 This filter is working very well. I ve read where some photographers have had a problem unscrewing a filter (not necessarily this one), so I don t tighten it down all the way as with all of my filters. I m very happy with it. 
28459 bad. very bad. didnt charge my battery. went to a wedding to shoot, popped out the battery, and it hadnt been charged. the design is bad too. the battery easily falls out of the charger. 
28460 Works great but make sure you either carry a tool that will loosen these. They work so well with the gasket that sometimes your hand strength isn t enough. 
28461 it works great.pain in the butt to get set up right but with a home security system you will have that 
28462 Came quickly and as described. Worked perfectly for my Canon Powershot 
28463 Bought for my mother as a birthday gift. She loved it an it s many capabilities.The touch screen makes it very user friendly. Great resolution and IR mode. Very pleased with this product. 
28464 this part finished off my telescope. perfect 
28465 Works great with my 18-135 canon stm 
28466 Purchase inspired by Ken Rockwell review; it s totally awesome for power, compactness, and utility with a consumer-grade D3300. The price was painful, but the product was worth some of that premium. 
28467 Excellent 
28468 Fits my Canon SL1 with standard 18-55mm lens, battery charger, and USB chord. Tight fit. Good compact case. 
28469 Did what it was designed to do. But the product that I used it for (not a Sony product) did not work out. So I sent it back, along with the defective camera. 
28470 It worked great 
28471 Uncomfortable and pointless. You cannot comfortably take image with your hand in this thing with a D3300 
28472 Needed a back up battery, fit the bill nicely. 
28473 as advertised 
28474 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
28475 Thanks 
28476 good complement with the purchase of the quadcopter I recommend this a lot 
28477 Waterproof case doesn t work, water got in and now it doesn t work, never opened. Screen turned greened after 1 use 
28478 Thanks to Joseph badge #AR004204 for the set up help, product works great! 
28479 The case is attractive and compact! Like the feel of it and the utility! 
28480 Couldn t get a picture to show on the screen. Directions very poor. Tried some you- tube video instruction to no avail. Toshiba laptop should work with it but doesn t. Emailed Protensic but never got an answer. Don t know what else to do. 
28481 It s really great, but after some work in events I m not using because it s heavy without the chest acessory. 
28482 5 generic-brand lens covers for for my camera for less than 1/4 the price of one of the name brand. Fantastic! 
28483 Great product just wish the case was a little bigger 
28484 it started to shake. I barely used for 5 times. 
28485 Love it great light great customer service from seller great experience all the way around 
28486 When I was trying to download the firmware files. The wifi from bebop drone keep saying. Impossible to connect. It toke me about 30 mins to download the firmware. :/ 
28487 If I could rate it lower I would. It was a complete waste of money. Worst video quality you could imagine. I should have known better trying to save a buck. 
28488 Works great! Quick delivery. 
28489 They work really good 
28490 I like so much. Yellow bobber is easy to find in the water. 
28491 GREAT DEVICE at an Outstanding Price!!! 
28492 Works well as a monocular... however unfortunately it calls itself night vision. It is not even kinda night vision. 
28493 These have everyone fooled. combined with some legitimate Brinks security yard and window signs, I think this is a decent deterrent. 
28494 Works well... 
28495 I am very satisfied with this purchase. The camera is like new and charges itself, I never need to replace batteries as I had to with the old Coolpix. 
28496 Strong case but makes some of buttons hard to press 
28497 As advertised. 
28498 Great! 
28499 Worked ok but speakers were not very loud for video. 
28500 the fan has a problem, at first everything was fine, now is making a lot of noise 
28501 No problem with them.. 
28502 Excelente 
28503 This filter is remarkably constructed. The build, quality and and overall construction is excellent. It screws on nicely onto the lens and fits snugly. The coating is even and of high quality. Breakthrough Photography really makes great filters for a great value. 
28504 Great product and fast delivery. Look forward to next time 
28505 I ordered this battery for my Nikon D7000 and put it into a grip. Used it for a night time star shoot and had no problems. I ll know how good it is after a few months of use but so far so good! 
28506 I still have this canon camera and still use it for everything! it is so simple if you just like doing simple video and photography. And you can change the way it looks depending on what size lens you buy. 
28507 So far this floating bundle has been great! Easy to use and good qualtiy 
28508 Installer said it was a malfunctioning camera. I had throw packaging away so I did not return and counted as my loss. Discourage as a client for future purchases. 
28509 Bag was too small for my new 3/4 Lumix 
28510 camera did not function 
28511 Working good 
28512 So glad I bought the extra batteries for my Canon Camera. They keep a goo charge and comes in super handy for those long days of shooting pictures. Great Price as well for the pack. 
28513 I am amazed with the quality of service and as well as how I received my order 
28514 fitted perfectly on an om-d em5 even if its not listed as compatible, and its really good. perfect as replacement for the original one it may already broken 
28515 Really hard to rotate at times. does not bend forward and back well. It is fine for the price it is at. Will get the job done for low cost 
28516 Part of the head fell apart when I went to mount the camera! I returned it and got my refund back 
28517 Got it delivered very quicjly and it is perfect for me. As a photographer, it s so nice to have something so comfortable on your back! 
28518 Received the case which I like a lot it makes the camera look very retro ad offers good protection. 
28519 works great. I use it as an access point. Setup is very easy 
28520 DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!! IT TOOK FOREVER FOR ME TO GET AND ITS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE IT WAS FIRST OF ALL IT IS USED AND NOT NEW THE PASSWORDS AND USERID DID NOT WORK SO I COULD NOT RESET IT AND ADJUST THE SETTINGS! 
28521 cable s a little too short, so buy an extension cord. other than that, It works well. 
28522 Buen producto 
28523 Thank you 
28524 It is a good back up battery. It has a lot lesser charged life... about less than 2 hours maybe. Where the original Lumix can go 4+ hours of photo shooting. But for the price is worth it... 
28525 Most of the time works fine, but sometimes you have to re-connect it to the shoes to make better contact. 
28526 Good range does come in clear 
28527 Good product but it does not screw on my t3i. I heard you need the filter for it to fit I ordered one we will see if it works now. 
28528 Much cheaper than Fuji original, fits to camera, looks good, made from solid material. 
28529 I m still testing it out. I wish there was a way to turn them off to conserve the battery. 
28530 total crap. 
28531 This has worked flawlessly, nice looking and sharp images. I use on my desk at work and love the reliability and quality. 
28532 Awesome Quality! 
28533 Much better than having a camera! All pictures look good! Do not expect real colors, it s like old instant photos. Be careful not to open accidentally the film storage cover. 
28534 The seller was quick to respond to my question regarding the type of camera that the case would fit. It does fit the Cannon Rebel 1000D with the 250mm lens. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28535 wasn t all that is cracked up to be 
28536 The unit has the front red windows was broken, the horizontal movement is not smooth but jerky.The movement is continuous and can not be used for multiple shots into a panorama. 
28537 Good for a low budget tripod. 
28538 The customer service is awesome and the camera works great. Great picture and set up is easy with videos. Hard to find great customer service today and this company and product is exceeding expectations! 
28539 No prob. Good quality. Recommend 
28540 Does not operate all that well. 
28541 The best camera for adults having to much fun and great for kids too! ;) indestructible!! 
28542 Great system 
28543 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
28544 Can t beat for the money but don t keep a large as long as original brand batteries. 
28545 Great Product 
28546 Fits nicely, to replace my lost Nikon D5100 battery lid. Don t have to live in constant fear that the battery will fall off. 
28547 Seller was great. Very good quality camera although it is just a basic one. 
28548 Timely arrival for a great price. 
28549 Good 
28550 Work good 
28551 Lasted about a week. Camera lasted three days. Buy a &#34;real one&#34; if you want a drone. 
28552 Quality 
28553 Its a camera battery and works just fine as expected for a Canon battery. I have never had it run low, even after 400+ photos in one session, using an external flash, but the builtin. 
28554 Not calibrated very well. 
28555 kenneth helped me out setting up the camera and camera works great just not as smooth as i thought it would be but everything else is perfectly fine. 
28556 Haven t used it in the water yet, but this is a nice, comfortable hand grip. With the wrist strap, this is a no Brainer for water enthusiasts! 
28557 Great!.. Thanks 
28558 works OK hard to use 
28559 Keeps my GoPro 4 going, charges fast with my Anker chargers. 
28560 very good 
28561 A good product. 
28562 Just exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. 
28563 Love the ball design ...can angle my camera in abstract way to capture a pic and it captures right every time...also like the ability to switch from tripod to monopod without falling...not a professional photographer but highly recommend this tripod 
28564 BESTTTTTT Love it!!! 
28565 Its great just what i was looking for. 
28566 great product for price , needs better instructions , not Bluetooth cabable 
28567 Add stated for phantom 2. However screews included were for phantom 3 only. 
28568 Don t use wrist mount the part that spins Broke off when I was on my jet ski and I lost my hero 4 
28569 I purchased this item for the Nikon D7200. It s a perfect fit for both the top and rear monitors. Very easy to install, no bubbles, no troubles. Does not degrade the display quality at all. 
28570 Bien 
28571 several year later and still going strong. love this accessory so much for longer battery life and for better grip. 
28572 I was looking for a tripod for my camera and not for a phone. 
28573 We took about a days worth of pictures and another half-hour of video (flyboarding) and the battery was just about done. These work great and the charger handles the original battery from my Olympus TG-4. 
28574 This is a fun scope to take along any where. I was surprize at how clear and good viewing through it was. I like and recommend all the Orion products. 
28575 Worked ok when I was able to use it. Every one of the loops that the strap goes through came off on one end. Super glue doesn t even want to hold them in place on that cheap plastic. You get what you pay for I guess. 
28576 love it, small enough to fit in my pocket, takes great pictures. wpi;d recommend to buy it. 
28577 Works as described. expensive for what it is, but I really didn t feel like trying to build my own and the cost for dies to cut right and left hand threads, so I paid the price. 
28578 O.K. Please send me a Guide to understand better to use it. I need also drawings and guidelines because I have problems to know better to use it. Thank You 
28579 The Best...... 
28580 works as expected 
28581 So glad I found a replacement for my camera, works great! 
28582 Love this camera! Not as intimidating as I first thought it would be...takes great pictures, no buyers remorse or disappointment. Very happy with my purchase. 
28583 Getting a real canon IS lens at this price is great. It s not as hefty as the more expensive lens, but for the price, it s hard to beat. I find this a must for those interior shots where 24mm and up just don t capture what I need. 
28584 Works great! My images look fantastic. 
28585 Don t work. Don t charge 
28586 Great lengths for the money 
28587 Doesn t work for me - cannot see to focus - view is distorted. Trying to return 
28588 Excellent remote. 
28589 Exactly what I expected. 
28590 Worked great for taking pics for eBay 
28591 Works great! I ve should ve gotten one of these ages ago! Helps my night photography a great deal. 
28592 the L830 is a wonderful prosumer camera sadly the shutter speed is not controllable 
28593 Decent camera for price. Quick delivery 
28594 The product is exactly what I needed. The speed at which I received the item was very good. Used the item day after I got it and it works great. 
28595 Our lights arrived quickly and in one piece. They are bright. 
28596 I bought this and 5 weeks after I bought it the base rusted. They expect me to pay shipping cost to get replacement. Bad product, Bad company, bad support. Bad use of money 
28597 Perfect.......better than expected! 
28598 The battery is just what I wanted. Thanks. 
28599 Works over wifi or cell service from any where in the country. It does freeze if signal is weak but you can speak through it and listen to conversations. It is an excellent low budget home surveillance alternative. 
28600 So great filters with good price, high quality build. 
28601 I am very pleased with the quality of the product, and the price and prompt delivery. A+ 
28602 Ok so the selfie stick itself is pretty good and sturdy but.... The go pro attachment snapped off in my hand which was lucky because with what I do it could have been the end of my gopro... An extra $10 later I buy a real adapter which was annoying... 
28603 These actually work very well - I now have 4 of them. The product would be better served by the inclusion of instructions that are better written in english; however, that notwithstanding, they perform as would be expected by a more expensive product, and are recommended. 
28604 Lost my original charger, this one works wonderful 
28605 Fast and efficient. Your batteries exceeded my expectation. Thank you for your great customer service. 
28606 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
28607 great 
28608 great flash 
28609 received as expected 
28610 High quality and durable, honestly I am very impressed with this kit for the price! 
28611 My hope was to trigger my Canon 580EX-II off camera and this bracket is perfect! Most of it is metal with the exception of the knobs and feels very sturdy. Great product! 
28612 This tutu is absolutely ADORABLE!!! The quality is great and the color was exactly as pictured. Any little girl will look like the cutest little girl in the world with this tutu abd headband. Highly recommended this product!! 
28613 I really don t use it very often, but when I need it, it does perform as expected. It might not feel super sturdy and tough, but taking the price I paid for it into account I give it 5 stars. 
28614 Fits my new Nikon P600 camera perfectly. 
28615 Awesome, as usual for Canon products!!!! 
28616 Well and aesthetically built. Works fine, uses widely available AA batteries. Now all my studio devices run on the same type batteries. Great tool for a studio or outdoors shoots where extra lights are needed. Not that easy to use as it has so many functions. I am still learning. 
28617 I bought this a couple of months ago. I am disappointed. When the wifi does work, it will only let you upload 1 photo at a time. It is slow and frustrating. I wouldn t buy this product again. Don t waste your money. 
28618 Very nice for the money. Everything fits and works wekk with my Panasonic AG-HMC80. 
28619 So happy with it, it is so compact. Also happy that it has a re-chargeable battery. Also easy to use. 
28620 Excelente. 
28621 Kind of a joke not being able to see any history without having to pay for subscription. It s not a bad camera but not the best 
28622 Great price, and works as needed. No complaints. 
28623 This was a surprise to me how much I like these. Good enough for my elaborate home studio. 
28624 Great price for remanufactured, works great with Amazon oem battery and chargers available. 
28625 I got this for my brother and it was really cool! 
28626 It works some times and doesn t work other times. I was hoping it was more reliable to use my iPad or iPhone as a monitor when shooting video but it seems to be more of a deterrent than helpful. 
28627 AMAZING! 
28628 As described. Perfect high quality Galaxy S6 dummy phone. Fast shipping! Thank you. 
28629 Great value for the price 
28630 Does NOT fit the 55-250 Canon lens. 
28631 Item delivered on time and as described. 
28632 I m very satisfied with this purchase, because it s exactly what I was looking for. It work perfectly and is the battery that I need for my video camera. I want to Thanks the seller because they still have this kind of products in existence. Thanks. 
28633 Very high quality CCD. For the price you can t go wrong. Very good fish eye lens for outdoor. 
28634 Very good camera!!! 
28635 I don t like typing 
28636 Excelent product 
28637 Great and fast shipping. Lights are near daylight and perfect for my application. 
28638 Does what it is supposed to do, hold the camera nice and tight. 
28639 Only issue is they are a bit hard to separate. 
28640 Very good film camera. What else could I say? 
28641 The color is darker than shown in the picture, but all in all a neat little case. 
28642 Its bulky, just not the fit for me. I ended up stashing it behind a tree on a hike, and leaving my camera around me neck, with my extra lense in a smaller bag. 
28643 It worked even better than what I had anticipated. I strongly recommended this little but powerful gadget. 
28644 on my phone when you plug it in the phone it act like it want to zoom so it doesn t work but I set the time on my phone and use it that way not that big of a deal 
28645 Now both my wife and my self have spare battery for our photo trips. 
28646 I like how I can start a video shoot right away and not miss the event! Haven t had it underwater yet, is nice size to keep in my purse. TY :) 
28647 good seller, I recomend 
28648 Definitely a &#34;5&#34; on a scale of 1-5 in the COOL FACTOR Ratings...Adds a little style to my new X100T...Love it! 
28649 We are using it for 5 years, and still works as day 1. 
28650 good 
28651 This works great as other reviewers noted. Still trying to figure out how to set up motion sensor to start recording. Otherwise recordings and snap shots are clear and I love the two way talk. Love to have an outside version of this video cam. 
28652 Most happy with this kit. Came with everything I needed 
28653 The A77II is a great camera.The battery grip helps for extended shoots. Picture examples from the A77II. 
28654 Great picture 
28655 It work Great 
28656 Fail. Bought two. One dead upon arrival. Would not hold a charge. 
28657 The person for whom I purchased it as a gift was delighted to have it. 
28658 Fits great and gives extra much needed grip to the smooth as silk Rx100 exterior. 
28659 Hmm quality of the construction is solid and looks good, but I found that using camera under water and then on sun the lens sweats from inside. Also lcd screen had same issue. All covers was closed and using in normal conditions. 
28660 great suport great item, 
28661 Works as expected. 
28662 great strap 
28663 ggreat product 
28664 Use these all the time. 
28665 can not delete misinstalled Canary 
28666 I love this camera. It works great. The staff is very helpful with any questions. 
28667 Great it works 
28668 Its a smaller size but its really fun and durable! 
28669 Really good 
28670 We love these little things - they are so economical, we wound up with a half-dozen - even one keeping an eye on the water heater closet. 
28671 sturdy, good product 
28672 Exactly what I was looking for. 
28673 Got it , have not had a chance to use it fully, when looking through it you can see circle s. Don t know if that is normal. 
28674 Great camera works well 
28675 still working after all this time; and doing it well 
28676 Much better than just looking at the screen from a distance. It helps me ensure I get the right adjustment for the light and it can detach since it has a magnet. 
28677 my wife loves it 
28678 Had it for a few years now. I have literally used it for about the first 3 months then bought me a real camera. This thing is the slowst camera in the world. Horrible battery life. Waist of $300.00. 
28679 Very nice! The entire package was much more than I really expected. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28680 Did exactly what I needed it to do, help my webcam fit my eyepiece. Couldn t ask any more from it. 
28681 So far so good. The product was delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery date for free shipping and packing was good too. Started using it and looks to be a good product for the price. 
28682 Works extremely well. Used for bear-detection in the mountains. 
28683 perfect 
28684 i have some problem on the button using the cover and i expected more from the battery BUT the quality video is good , 
28685 Alright part of it didn t work thougj 
28686 I m returning/exchanging this one. Doesn t charge from an outlet, only from cigarette lighter in the car. 
28687 This lens turned me into a pro. Love it. Easy to use. 
28688 The shipping time was ok. The only bad thing was that the instructions booklet and the camera strap didn´t came but I was rewarded for that. Regards. 
28689 poor resolution 
28690 Good Quality 
28691 Easy to setup and use! Very affordable as well. Worked with no issues Nikon D5200 
28692 It was what I needed and fits nicely in my camera case. 
28693 Fit on my Nikon body but did NOT fit my Minolta lens. 
28694 This is a must have if you have a NEX 7. Its great for protection, connecting over the shoulder harness and also easily clipping into my tripod (both landscape and portrait). No regrets. 
28695 Great battery for LED lamps... !! 
28696 Just what I needed! 
28697 Working fine, quick set up and fast service 
28698 Strap no good. Glasses were fine. 
28699 Perfect Fit for my new Pahntom 3, and plenty of room for the iPad Mini and extra battery. 
28700 Works perfect for my needs 
28701 An amazing camera. I just shot this music video in 4k and it came out great! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkheLRGWCZU 
28702 If the springs pop on you all you need to do is unscrew the 2 screws in the back and align the springs back and its good to go. 
28703 Item delivered on time, and works perfectly. Glad to have the keeper leash so I don t lose anymore........ 
28704 Best tripod I could buy, works well in all weather conditions. Doesn t float however :) 
28705 Couldn t even test out the set because I could only read about 1/4 of the digits/characters on the transmitter screen. NOT recommended. 
28706 Bought it for someone else 
28707 Great for travelling, the smallest of my 3 tripods. 
28708 It was great for about a month, comfortable, lightweight, but the clip broke and luckily I was holding my camera at the time or it would have been a disaster. 
28709 I ued this only 3 times, It can t be close-- only last 1 month.lose anymore, so I do not know how I can ship back. This cheap stuff is too expensive for 1 month lifespan. 
28710 It does not read, I thought maybe I was using it wrong so I asked the man that put my solar fencing in & he could not get it to read either. He used his own tester and got a reading. 
28711 Great case, protects without being bulky and at a great price. 
28712 M haaa a 
28713 Fine 
28714 Good 
28715 I love the way it looks like a WWII Leica case! 
28716 They ll work, mostly, but do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more. I had one that didn t want to let go of my lens (release button was only semi-coupled to the pin), and promptly chucked the set. 
28717 Works as described, have not had any issues yet. 
28718 great price 
28719 Great deal and batteries worked well. 
28720 Great bargain. 
28721 Great product. Not too heavy. Perfect for bringing on hikes. 
28722 Easy to install, great for security. The camera setting for recording is not totally intuitive. 
28723 Bought three of them already!!!! 
28724 Works great! 
28725 My unit was stolen, but it worked OK when I had it. 
28726 LOVE IT, works like the original. 
28727 I use these for all my delicate screens, cell phone, TV, and most of all for my navigation and compass clean up. 
28728 Easy to install. Works great. 
28729 I like it, but be careful when you receive it. The light went out on one side very easily. 
28730 This is perfect for what I intended... 
28731 these batteries were a good price and works perfect. and came with a car charger and a wall charger. i really needed the car charger. it really comes in handy. 
28732 Grate 
28733 Very Well Satisfied. 
28734 Great camera for the money. The website is convenient too. 
28735 Looks too fake-ish 
28736 Five star 
28737 Awesome... 
28738 Product was like brand new, everything worked and even came with a Sony carrying case I wasn t expecting. Very nice 
28739 I bought this camera 6 months ago. It was perfect for my needs. I looked at a bug collection that my grandkids found and also used it to watch while my students tied surgical knots. It works great and never had a problem. 
28740 Works well 
28741 Just as described. Received my camera quickly with no issues. 
28742 Works well 
28743 Nice design! Very good construction. Camera and accessories fit nicely. 
28744 Fits its purpose. No issues. 
28745 A good charger at a great price. Small, compact and does what it is supposed to do. Arrived quickly and as advertised. 
28746 Good battery,good price,and fast shipping. 
28747 Works the same as the original canon battery Good value 
28748 This is a really good ket for the price! 
28749 Great little case for your GoPro and some accessories! 
28750 Great case!! Took it overseas and it held up through a lot of abuse!! 
28751 Work great picture come out really nice ... Love it 
28752 Exelent product. 
28753 Got FV and not the FW 
28754 The greatest problem I have with this camera is the battery life. does not last but a few hours 
28755 Love. I am still learning some of the features for this is my first nice camera outside of pocket digital cameras. 
28756 works as advertised, nice price, seems to be reliable. 
28757 I could see the ends of the filter in the frame, its too long. Used with Canon EF 17-40 on full frame body. Didn t like the threaded mounting system either. 
28758 Awesome macro lens! I too, am newer to photography and recently discovered macro lenses. The shots I was &#34;attempting&#34; to capture with a standard lens seem a million times easier with this lens, and are much clearer. The price is also very good compared to others. I highly recommend. 
28759 The battery arrived fully charged and worked as well as the original equipment one had. Truly a remarkable value when compared with the price of an OE battery. 
28760 Video is washed out. Night time ir is grainy. Focus piunt seems fixed even though camer has adjustable focus. Pay the extra 10 dollars and get something better 
28761 Very good lens. Close range pictures have really nice colour and depth of field. I 
28762 Amazing and better!! Highly recommend this product. It performs better than expected. I did order another battery and a case to transport it in. 
28763 My light didn t work but from far away LOOKS REAL enough to fool average thief, the average thief isn t to bright anyway ! 
28764 Videos on my GoPro 4 hero turned out just fine! Colors looked good sharpness of video seems fine. The only thing I could see as an issue is the longevity of the product itself but for the money it was great. I would by again if needed. 
28765 Work well, thanks. 
28766 Great product and nice looking. Great for aero bars as well. 
28767 The screw that you tighten to secure the flash is very hard to grip with your finger tips. The first time I used this mount, my flash was on the floor within minutes. 
28768 It works great, especially for my camera lens. The grey cloth is the perfect size to keep in my camera bag, and I think I ll be keeping the larger one with my laptop! I would reccomend this product 
28769 Awesome value! Pictures turned out great! 
28770 The most versatile ruggedly made fun camcorder that you can do just about anything with from outside sport activities there s a very special moments in the home I would recommend this to everyone 
28771 Really bright. ...!!! 
28772 Replaced a previous model that had worn out over time. 
28773 Exactly what I expected 
28774 NICE ASSORTMENT OF ITEMS TO COMPLIMENT THE MINI 8 CAMERA. 
28775 Nice price and good condition. Highly recommend. 
28776 Very cheap quality. Does not fit the tripod. 
28777 STK always a winner. 
28778 Great product. Highly recommended. 
28779 Great simple camera 
28780 Good 
28781 Works perfectly! 
28782 So powerful. So useful. Get this in your camera bag right now. I know people that have 2 or 3 of these. You will not be disappointed. 
28783 Excellent product. 
28784 serves its purpose really well. 
28785 the camera, the lenses, the spare battery, the spare charger, the memory card and the lens converters are alright. I didn t like the flash, the bag and the tripod. The long distance shutter didn t work. 
28786 very good 
28787 Great! Received as described. 
28788 great value 
28789 You have moved an old timer into the digital age with this purchase. I m learning how to use yet, but I m satisfied with my purchase. 
28790 Great batteries. As far as I am concerned they are very close if not on par with the standard &#34;Canon batteries&#34;. Great Deal. Very Pleased. 
28791 So coll 
28792 Robust air blower. Never run out of air. No disposable cans. 
28793 Well-built, seems sturdy. The GoPro adapter can be unscrewed, leaving a traditional screw camera mount, so it works for other cameras as well. Very pleased. 
28794 The HD picture quality is outstanding. I am thoroughly pleased!! 
28795 It s a battery 
28796 Works well as a greenhouse/fish tank monitor. More resolution would be nice but this is adequate. It connected up at a distance of 40 feet or so from the router. 
28797 Very happy with purchase. 
28798 the image is not clear an not wide enough, do not waste your money in this purchase 
28799 Great price. Fine product. Works as expected. 
28800 Bad product but good customer service. I have bought two of these and both died after just a few months. I got a third one for free after I complained but this one also died after a few weeks! 
28801 The product works as advertised. You have to make sure the flash clicks into place though or it will not work properly. 
28802 Only problem encountered was a defective USB cable. I had to scrounge one from my drawer. The setup and subsequent use is very good. The software is an improvement over Drop Cam and I currently am using two of those. 
28803 This camera does not work 
28804 Great lense, good for shallow DOF 
28805 Clips and holds pretty nicely. Def a great replacement for a stock clip on cap. It was shipped from China, but came in roughly 2 weeks. So all in all... good buy. 
28806 This fits perfectly in my backpack to turn the front pouch into a camera bag! This way I can bring other things like clothes, water bottles, snacks, maps, etc. dedicated bags aren t quite as versatile, so this gives you the best of both worlds :) 
28807 The studio lighting is great for video and pictures. 
28808 Very good and easy to use. 
28809 Not bad for the price, it is not as good as original Nikon battery, but as a backup it is not going to disappoint you. 
28810 works as advertised! 
28811 good product 
28812 Very cute background! Looks exactly like pictured. 
28813 Excellent product, was everything it calmed to be. Fast shipping, friendly CS 
28814 bought to go with camera for 11 year old selfie generation- she loves it 
28815 It took me a little while to get everything working according to the instructions, including using sim card from at@t, but I m happy with the system. I did have a bad window/door switch but received a new one after notifying support@pisector. Their support people worked with me very well. 
28816 Works great 
28817 It works great for the camera and the other pockets will come in handy for something. 
28818 It works. 
28819 This a quality bag for a bargain price. I use this for a Sony Nex-7, multiple lenses, tripod, and all my accessories. 
28820 It works for my camera 
28821 Almost impossible to place on dog. 
28822 it is hard and inconvenient to connect, let alone keep the connection going. 
28823 Great lens, super lightweight, perfect for travel, great image quality. 
28824 Works great on my 150-600 mm 
28825 Just bought an Olympus underwater camera, used just one of the two floaty included and it works like a charm. 
28826 Motion detection doesn t work. 
28827 It s a rechargeable battery. It s still taking a charge after 4 years. What else can I say? 
28828 Perfect for my 75-300mm lens! Well made case. I love this case and having my 2nd lens right on my hip. I hate having to get into my bag every time I what to switch lenses, this case saves me so much time! 
28829 Fast service and good for beginner this is my first drome and is easy to fly...... 
28830 good item 
28831 Good 
28832 Pretty good but i have Android 5.02 which should work with WiFi feature but it does not No way of telling if it really does have WiFi or not. 
28833 Used it for the first time on my family vacation. Though I was a little nervous at first but it was an actually good buy. 
28834 LOVE THIS!!!!! 
28835 This latch doesn t hold as tight as the original GoPro latch and will let water in. GoPro replaced the original broken latch for free even after 2 years. I know keep this latch as a non-waterproof backup. 
28836 I ve ordered two of these lights and both begin to flicker after being powered on for about 30 min as they start to warm up. 
28837 Good 
28838 worked good 
28839 Bought 2 of these batteries! Work great in my Canon rebel xti! 
28840 Product as described, love it and would buy it again, thanks! 
28841 Awesome!!! 
28842 Love these reflectors! They pack up nice and compact and fit right in my camera bag. 
28843 Happy experience! 
28844 This was to be a NEW item. It WASNT. 
28845 The Camera is so great, like others in the segment, the accesories kit is fine and usefull but not so well made. Hope all of the parts works properly (425USD) for all was 
28846 At first I thought that the camera was going to not be of high quality, but I was wrong. The Fujikam camera has exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with this product. 
28847 perfect 
28848 It s not easy to use as there is no view finder so you re not really sure what you re shooting and it s very far away and you have to do manipulation on the photo to get a good print before you can post or use the picture. 
28849 One of the best values I have ever found. I don t care what others say, Cowboy Studios sells good products at better than affordable prices. If you are just starting out in photography, or a seasoned pro, you can t beat CS prices and quality. 
28850 Very sturdy, note that it will fit an unusual size pole. 
28851 Camera is still great. 
28852 didnt fit for my camera 
28853 Thanks Works Well! 
28854 It is a great buy !!! I had to return because it was not I wanted not because any problems 
28855 very Good 
28856 Did not fit my iPhone with the case. 
28857 This is a very fun camera, I appreciate Fuji for picking up the mantle after Polaroid, but it is seems a little oversized. In fact it is HUGE. 
28858 Love this tripod, very study 
28859 Quick and easy claim process! 
28860 great case. camera fits in it well. 
28861 This fish eye lens is comparable to the actual cannon version but at less of the cost. I have used these lens millions of times and I get great photos. I get great angle shots and lots of different views. 
28862 it s small and adorable, but the pictures come out too dark and the resolution is not great, just average. the pictures are misleading. 
28863 Looks to be what I needed. Thank you 
28864 Good price and very short time for delivery. 
28865 Outdated 
28866 Worked great, charged my orginal battery,and the battery that came with it. I recommend 
28867 Exactly what I was looking for...a camera case that did not disconnect from the camera when the camera is in use. It easily fit my smaller zoom and was a perfect fit for my Canon 35-300 Zoom. 
28868 AC Adapter die just after 1 yr 
28869 Good 
28870 Sturdy and well made 
28871 okay 
28872 Absolutely the best purchase 
28873 This case is bad ass. Sort of a tight fit around the motors (with the new Vortex limiting straps installed). I took pictures and sent the feedback to GPC.. all in all, terrific case 
28874 Only played with them slightly, but, enjoying them 
28875 Links easily with Honeywell L7000. 
28876 This lens is pretty cool. Can t beat the price, and it does just what its supposed to. Its also very lightweight, yet durable. A nice addition to my camera bag. 
28877 Got this case for my wife s large Panasonic point and shoot camera. It fit perfectly and had room for cables. Excellent quality bag and my wife loves the color to boot! 
28878 Currently using it on a bracket connected to my OMD E-M5 Mark ii and it works perfectly. 
28879 does what it says its gonna do 
28880 it works really good 
28881 I ordered for a Canon D10 and I received a Vivitar Kit. 
28882 A+++++, Will buy again! Excellent in all aspects & highly recommend!! Thank you! 
28883 love this 
28884 Nice addition to my gopro stuff 
28885 Works as advertised 
28886 Product worked well...it charged the batteries, and a green light indicated when to unplug the charger. excellent 
28887 Got everything in this plus a couple extra things. The suction cup is a little small. But zero complaints 
28888 I needed these to hold a few old 8x10 school photos and other nostalgic pics of yesteryear! Great protection for important mementos that are strictly 8x10 or smaller (unlike the 8.5x11 page protectors, which are slightly larger). Highly recommended. 
28889 True to description! Slim and user-friendly. My only complaint is that the photos are in the same order every time and that the memory card doesn t get inserted completely. There s a margin at the edge, so be careful if packing it with the card stored in it. 
28890 This was the perfect solution to my addiction to larger lens for my wildlife requirements. It has plenty enough room and i find comfortable for my use. AAA+ 
28891 works great and so much cheaper then the gopro one 
28892 Great mount! It can be put on a bar or handle as well as your wrist! Solid quality and trust my contour s life with it. 
28893 I thought it was for panoramic photos-it is better suited for close ups where you want a wider shot. 
28894 Fits perfectly 
28895 This would be an excellent bag/organizer for a GoPro if it was a little bigger. It just doesn t hold enough accessories! 
28896 This device a while go open it up yesterday today is the 21st August it don t work I want my money back piece of junk I charged it all night then turned it on and nothinghappen didn t clock did not even come on send me a return slip 
28897 good fit 
28898 it doesn t fit the whole screen so dirt and stuff collects at the edges. 
28899 Great item!. Used it to monitor my feline while away. 
28900 Perfect to stabilize my camera and perfect for iPhone when doing Flipagram for stop motion animation. You just need a part to hold the iphone, which you can find on Amazon, too. 
28901 Tiffin always axe a decent product. They sent me wrong size for my camera lens. Instead of 40.5 I got a 43.5. Trying to see if I can use it on another lens 
28902 Q-See has good equipment. These cables work just fine with Q-See camera. 
28903 pretty steady for indoor use 
28904 Definitely like this unit, its extremely solid as far as the frame and rods, The motors work ok with my cameras and are a bit noisy but that was expected if they hold up over time I will definitely give this rig 5 stars. 
28905 Nice set for the money. Had a hell of a time setting it up but it all works. It s not 5 stars because I m having trouble logging in because the name and password given to me for first log in don t work. 
28906 Same performance as the OEM battery at a much better price. 
28907 Nice and fresh. 
28908 😀 
28909 Charger for my Canon camera batteries. You can never have enough. Charged like the original, no overheating and my batteries did not lose the charge as some claimed. Its perfect for what I needed. 
28910 Only 9 out of 10 worked, which was disappointing when I had planned to take four pictures knowing I had four films left. The last one printed blank. 
28911 Missing some stuff 
28912 It did not fit my Sony a330 like I was told so I went to Florida for a week vacation with no camera cause of this. 
28913 Great service! Great product! 
28914 Very Happy with my Drone 
28915 Bought it again after losing it in the woods. I used it exclusively outdoors during hiking/climbing/camping. It stood up to the abuse very well for almost 8 months. 
28916 These cameras are great! We ordered two, and one of the selfie mirrors... used them at my daughter s wedding reception. Very fun idea, and not that expensive. 
28917 great picture quality, love the custom menu options. The only bad thing about this minister is that the battery mount falls off REALLY easily. Like I m about to gaff it on its so bad. But other than that the actual monitor is wonderf. 
28918 The batteries are perfectly fine, but the charger takes several hours to recharge just one battery. 
28919 Great battery last for long time for mic in sunday service for the church. 
28920 Love this strap! I wish I had another camera so I could buy another one! Very innovative 
28921 I was shipped a broken product. Gooseneck seems fine but without the clip it is unusable. 
28922 It s a great addition to my 5d mark III! Also amazing on the RED and great having the downstream LUTs for video village viewing! 
28923 Using camera for business -real estate photos - used just the auto setting but photos were amazing! 
28924 So fun to put on my dogs. They are a little confused with it on them, and try and take it off but once they get used to it they forget its on the,. 
28925 Love it, solid protection and easy installation! My screen is now protected and my investment is safe! To top it off its made in the USA!! 
28926 I got this as a replacement for another company s camera that lost the ability to get on a wireless network. I really like this camera. Easy setup, lots of instructions and support software. The images are incredible and the night vision is perfect. 
28927 Loving this system we have had in for a couple weeks or so now and it is pretty simple to set up. Also had to email support from Zmodo with a question and I got an answer back the next day in full details.. Awesome customer service!! 
28928 Very nice digital frame... Worth the money! 
28929 I wish the strap was a little longer but that s my only issue with it. 
28930 This was my 2nd roll of film, (right after the Tri-X 400). I also had this developed right away, and I love the results. I will be using much more of this film as well. 
28931 good 
28932 Shot one roll and immediately had it developed. This film is wonderful! Can t wait to use the rest. 
28933 San disk Mico SD a great media or I can say its a great performance card,greatly recommend to anyone. And the Nikon battery EN-EL 15 a long lasting life I love it 
28934 Love using these. Gives a great warmth and life to photos 
28935 Awesome 
28936 ok 
28937 Works really well, I have them in several rooms so I will always have one handy. 
28938 Works like a dream! 
28939 Awesome bag, great quality and smart design. I have space for everything. Carries tripod under as in photo. Completely waterproof, and it makes everything feel lightweight while carrying. I want to get one in all colors! 
28940 Flimsy!!! Poles seemed bent! Parts missing! 
28941 Lightweight, nice balance and cool looking. These fit on my Phantom 2, just for all those wondering. 
28942 good product 
28943 easy to apply, as expected 
28944 The LCD Viewfinder keeps fall of the camera. 
28945 A must for diy home security rigs and led uv boosters. 
28946 These lenses are very fun! I love how it s three different lenses in one! Product came as and when expected! Fit my iPhone 5 just well. Takes really cool pictures, you can get SO much more in the frame! 
28947 This is My Second Fuji Camera , I love them 
28948 for the Dollar ! Great Zoom for a cheaper camera 
28949 It was easy as 123 I love 
28950 Held charge forever! Lastest all day; photos and videos. 
28951 evth ok! 
28952 Great product, works well. Good value for the price. This was replacement to my old tripod and I am happy with it. 
28953 good 
28954 Very versatile. I can charge at home or in my car. 
28955 Perfect. 
28956 Item was received just as described. 
28957 Works but took along time to set up. not the easist set up but once installed has been good. 
28958 Will not last very long a year or so at most 
28959 Durable and well made, lightweight and lots of room. Easily fits under airplane seats. A must for traveling with your photography equipment. 
28960 AWESOME CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!! GLAD I PURCHASED IT. PICTURES ARE GREAT. 
28961 Shipping was good. Battery works fine. 
28962 It s just what I needed. 
28963 I think this is my second 10 pack of these types of clothes. As a family of forgetful glasses wearers, we go through and lose quite a lot of these. They work wonderfully though! 
28964 I know this bag is for NEX, I have a A6000, I thought they were almost the same, well, I was wrong, the inner bag is too small for it...... the bag itself is of good quality. 
28965 My biggest complaint with this is the battery compartment; it is awkward to open and close and its hard to keep your batteries and photo chip in plae 
28966 Worth the money. 
28967 I like the ability of screen flipping between the cameras. The on thing I would suggest is to increase the storage amount. 32 my would be preferred. 
28968 Basic as it gets but it gets the job done without hurting the wallet. 
28969 works like original battery. 
28970 Excelent 
28971 Product works as advertised 
28972 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. 
28973 perfect 
28974 No instructions, thanks! 
28975 Compared this to a brand new battery for the same camera and this lasted about 1/4 of the time of the new battery. You are getting what you pay for here. Only lasted about 2.5 hours with continuous use. Not really worth it. 
28976 Great camera for a great price. Super fast shipping. I recommend it! 
28977 Bad camera not good at all 
28978 Excellent product, and buying experience. I will buy in future 
28979 cool looking bag!! Good enough to carry a medium sized DSLR with 18-140mm attached onto it. And a 50mm lens. + the charger and cables. Anything more you will need a larger sized bag. 
28980 Pay the extra money for the best. Do Not Waste money on the cheaper products. 
28981 It would be nice if they had indications of what they were. Specifically the color and strength. 
28982 Bought for my boyfriend for his birthday in April, last month (July) the camera stopped working and won t turn on. Need to contact the company and hope they will work with me and replace it! 
28983 Highly recommended for a Canon 7D Mark II with a Canon EF 24-105 mm f/4L IS USM lens! 
28984 good product 100% 
28985 i love this camera! must buy product if you like traveling 
28986 It´s a very good product. I found it confortable to handle it. 
28987 ok 
28988 Vincent very knowledgeable and very helpful. 
28989 This filter works great for enhancing twilight and sundown colors. I saw a video from Bryan Peterson showing how well worked, and I ve tried it a few times with great results. 
28990 Reliable and much cheaper than the original. It s a little tight in the battery compartment of the camera, so sometimes we need to give it an extra push with a blade/key to pop it out. Camera operation is definitely as good with this battery as the original. 
28991 good deal! 
28992 Love my frame! 
28993 Great set for a good price. Quick shipping too. 
28994 Great camera! Love the quality of the photo. Very crisp and clear for a small camera 
28995 Good price. 
28996 Great item to allow me to see the camera LCD on a sunny day. 
28997 Great device and I bought for very good price 
28998 I haven t tried the Panasonic version of this cap, but I will say this one works perfectly. Probably not quite as tight against fine dust as the stock, hand-removable, cap, but very convenient, protective, and considerably cheaper than the Panny. 
28999 Great product... 
29000 may be Anti-glare. But because the surface is &#34;frosted&#34; it s difficult to see though. 
29001 Returned the item.send wrong item 
29002 Have only needed one battery replacement, in 2009, for camera purchased in 2005. These batteries work great. 
29003 good for price, working great 
29004 Very good product, I would recommend it. 
29005 Bought these as backups for my Pentax WG-10. They last as long, if not longer, than the OEM battery (which is not that long to begin with). Great price. Worth buying for extra shooting time, since these cameras suck up the juice pretty quickly. 
29006 Great bag for the price! 
29007 GOOD 
29008 I brought this awesome tripod for my sister and she absolutely loves it :-). Thanks! Dear eCost, I have rated the tripod. Here is my name and order number: Name: Dwayne Martin ORDER # 112-3476448-4701025 
29009 Go big or go home. If you hike, have some camera gear and other stuff, this pack is for you. It is big, well built, functional and roomy for everything you could imagine including a camera or two. 
29010 Just the right fit 
29011 ok...ok 
29012 A highly capable lens for a bargain price. I ve since switched all my gear over to Fuji, but would recommend this to anyone with a Canon looking for a budget lens. 
29013 Great service from the supplier, Amazon Prime gives you peace of mind, the drone is working well. 
29014 Works great for my Canon Rebel EOS T3i when the battery needs to charge but I still want to snap pictures. Decent length cord so you are not super tethered to a wall. 
29015 ...I used to store a Fuji X-E2 camera, fits correctly. 
29016 Absolutely great camera and huge bonus with all the accessories! Definitely recommend anyone looking for a great camera to purchase this bundle set!! 
29017 great strap 
29018 I am quite pleased with these little clothes. I leave one at each spot I leave one of my pairs of reading glasses (all over the house and my office). great clothes and a good value 
29019 Works very well. 
29020 Great price, work perfectly 
29021 Received product and tried installing it myself, that didn t work. Called D-Link customer service and received excellent assistance from Employee id# AR004671 
29022 Take with me all the time 
29023 The idia it s good and pricticle, but i being try to charge the remote control and i can t get a 100% charge. 
29024 Exactly what was needed. Worked as anticipated immediately and was pleasantly surprised with the additional charging devices. Appreciated the quick delivery. 
29025 Excellent. 
29026 Nice package but I did not realize the filters were only for the wide lens. No problem. 
29027 Fun 
29028 I had a couple of parts broken. A Lense was chipped and broken apart and the mini tripod broke but otherwise everything else works just fine. The tripod might be my fault though I don t know. 
29029 This is a great bag! It has great features to hold all my camera needs!!!!! 
29030 Decent camera, GORGEOUS screen and excellent functionality as far as sharing your photos on social media instantly, but if you re a serious amateur shutterbug, give this camera a pass. NOT good for theater/concert pictures. :/ 
29031 Easy to use 
29032 As advertised. Great replacement as it is longer than the factory cord. 
29033 This works just fine for my 18-5m lens for my Sony nex 3n! I m quite happy with it and see no problems! 
29034 fit my go pro hero 2 so I m good 
29035 Love love this bag much better then my previous one lots of space. Great ease of handling wish I would have had this one first. 
29036 Performed as expected. Reasonable quality for the price. Would recommend to a friend 
29037 awesome in every way. don t get a gopro, get the read deal. this blows gopro away. great seller 
29038 Makes it easy to align and do long exposures. 
29039 As someone over 6 feet tall, the strap is shorter than I like it. Other than that its great. Fit my Canon G16 perfect 
29040 perfect 
29041 It works properly and charges the battery quickly! 
29042 It has a nice level and quick release but the lock doesn t always hold well. 
29043 Makes a big difference in comfort from the original one that came with the camera. I can barely feel that it is there. 
29044 I can t live without it. Very nice product and good quality. 
29045 Changed up fine. Work well. 
29046 Most of the package is good. But the tripod is cheaply made. 
29047 Great 
29048 It s perfect for a nikon j4 or any of the series. 
29049 Works great. I have had no issues 
29050 Quick delivery, great camera features. Sharp colors, 42x zoom easy to use. 
29051 So great, purchased this for a 10th birthday. It was a huge hit ! 
29052 Perfect fit to the &#34;T&#34; 
29053 I feel like this case protects my camera very well. It stands up and has great padding inside. I like the &#34;hammock&#34; it keeps the camera from sitting on its lens. Only issue I have is that the zipper gets stuck on the corners or the bag with unzipping. 
29054 It has been so hard to take decent pictures with my camera phone!!! Finally someone came up with a way to IMPROVE the pics with THIS PRODUCT!! LOVE THIS!! 
29055 Great quality for the price! Still trying to get used to the whole connect wireless with WI-FI but overall it s worth it! 
29056 works great cheap price 
29057 Nice but for my TG-3 with the silicon skin it is a very tight fit. 
29058 Very good credit card machine works well! 
29059 Works as expected 
29060 looks absolutely real!! good quality for price!! 
29061 Don t waste your money. It doesn t hardly enlarge the slides at all, and is very cheaply made. 
29062 every thing ok 
29063 Too visible. I wanted a light that was less conspicuous. 
29064 Just what I needed. 
29065 Did its job 
29066 as expected 
29067 Good 
29068 Arrived at specified date. I have mo problems at all with it. It does seem a really good beginner drone. Crashed it a lot but with no breakage at all. Just picked up and took off again. 
29069 Nice but the bluetooth will not work the video on S6 Edge. 
29070 Perfect for aluminum housing for GoPro 4. Nice add-on. 
29071 Works well with Night Owl and Swann systems 
29072 Great quality Tripod! 
29073 No complaints here. Easy to use and makes the most of my poor photography skills. 
29074 This lens is not tack sharp. I had this exact lens before and it broke and that lens was much sharper than this one.... not sure what the deal is. 
29075 muy bueno 
29076 Easy to assemble and great quality. Would recommend for anyone! 
29077 I needed a spare battery and this charger was bundled with two, so that s it! 
29078 This camera is working perfectly in my home. I LOVE the wide angle lens, the motion detector and the Mic. 
29079 Thanks ...!! 
29080 I love it, hook it to a tree, railing, small, fits in your pocket. 
29081 Good solid case, protects memory cards very well. 
29082 I absolutely love this case; it fits my camera perfectly and has room for all of it s cords and accessories! 
29083 Best one I ve found so far, doesn t completely block the flash on the camera like the others do. 
29084 Takes awesome.pictures! Was really impressed! 
29085 Fits well 
29086 As advertised. 
29087 http://youtu.be/aQB3NtnNnlk 
29088 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
29089 Ok product. No a bad product but I should have got a more heavy duty product for surfing. 
29090 Works great. Perfect for multiple shots over long time periods. Or many quick shots in short time periods. Great for long exposure too. 
29091 Easy to install works nicely !! 
29092 perfect replacement for the remote. 
29093 Perfect charge 
29094 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
29095 its a pass trought device only, so make sure you have powered mics other than that is very well built and makes it convenient if you have multiple recording devices and or external mics. 
29096 Super heavy 
29097 nice product for the price 
29098 I installed two of these with Foscam 12 volt cameras. They work! 
29099 Arrived on time, but with open box. Filter a little dusty, plastic case obviously opened. No sign of wear on filter, though. 
29100 Good one 
29101 Very bright and useful only negative is the light has more of a blue tint rather than a natural light color which in turn leaves pictures with a. Blue hue. 
29102 Amazing binoculars for a great price! 
29103 cheaply made with bad quality.not real gopro stuff 
29104 I m a little disappointed that I had to pay to replace the top plate for one that actually works. Especially after I exchanged emails with them about the original being wonky. 
29105 Delivery was on time and case holds everything I use. 
29106 Small enough to fit in my messenger bag and super light weight. 
29107 Great quality picture and range of motion... 
29108 This product is far better than i thought it would be, very sturdy. 
29109 This does not fit Panasonic DMC-GF2. 
29110 I like the concept of this, and it works alright, but it makes it so you have to unscrew it to change the battery on the Nikon D5200. Not sure about other models of camera. 
29111 It s ok. Seems solidly built. Started immediately getting some sticky liquid coming out of the joints (viscous coupling?). It s not what I expected though... 
29112 this is a great little camera very happy with it 
29113 Very Good 
29114 An excellent and affordable way to protect your home. We have been using for about a year now. Still love it!!! 
29115 Works great. 
29116 nice easy use 
29117 good little camera. I use it on my boat 
29118 it s interesting toy,cheap than gopro,worth the price. 
29119 I saw some posts that suggested the battery was generic. Mine definitely said it was a Sony. What more can you say about a battery until it s been used for a while? Guessing it will be like other Sony products - very good. 
29120 Excellent 
29121 Selfie #YOLO 
29122 Love, Love, Love! 
29123 I ve been using Canon L lenses and this ND Filter is the worst I ever seen. Not even on manual focus can not get a decent picture. Sometimes cheaper is expensive is you are gonna lose clients taking photos. 
29124 working like a champ. way better than original batterys 
29125 Work awesome and it s extra long!!! 
29126 Works--keep checking for tightness 
29127 Product is very good and satisfactory. This seller s items are always welcome. 
29128 great battery and one I highly recommend to have on hand if you have an nx camera 
29129 Absolutely love my new Canon Soeedlite! It makes such a huge difference in my picture taking. My pictures now look like professional pictures. And it s not as hard to use as I d thought ! 
29130 Great case for a mirrorless slr (Sony a5100) Small enough to carry around easily but big enough to carry the camera and some accessories. The built in rain cover is really great. 
29131 This is a really nice tripod, the price was lower than I would expect for something this nice. 
29132 The degree of play due to the overall design/manufacturing and plastic internals make it hard to adjust and use this for reliably accurate focusing. 
29133 its solid...like a good battery 
29134 Comes with all the pieces and features you would need in a simple tripod. I love the quick release base. 
29135 Very good product so far I din t have any problem 
29136 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
29137 After light use, the ball head no longer holds. It shifts from one side to another, in a straight line, under light pressure. The no-name one I bought before this one works great. Go figure. 
29138 Great battery charger. I am very happy with the item and great sellers to do business with. Will most certainly buy from them again when I need something for my camera. Thank you! 
29139 Easily floats the Olympus TG-4 
29140 instructions are minimal. I can t seem to use this product because it doesn t seem compatible with my camera. I reached out to cowboy studio to see if they sold a remote connection and they never responded to my inquiry. 
29141 I really like this camera the quality of photos and videos are amazing. Very easy to use... 
29142 Lots of space. So far so good. Wish there was a water holding spot 
29143 works well with my all Canon lens, slow with autofocus, don t work with my Tamron 28-75 2.8 in Autofocus, but all of them work fine in Manual focus. 
29144 nice lens. 
29145 Exactly what I was expecting. Nice quality, great price. Even nicer that the owner hand signed a thank you in pen. 
29146 Good high resolution BNC camera for the money... Great daytime images 
29147 OK for night does need better infrared for night use to get better images. 
29148 I’m truly disappointed with this product. At f5 150mm your picture is ok but as soon as you ZOOM further to 600mm the picture is get Hazy. I am waiting on a replacement...wouldn t recommend this product unless this issue is resolved. 
29149 This was perfect for my husband s home base business. It works great for his green screen. He has now picked up more business and making quality videos. I would recommend this to anyone. Great product and price. 
29150 Excelent 
29151 This is one of the best built monopods I have ever owned. High quality all the way through it and never an issue to work with. Recommend very highly. You cannot beat having this one. It works with you, no matter how you have to use it. I love mine. 
29152 Fast delivery, quality product. Thanks ! 
29153 Such a good price for a gopro product 
29154 This camera did not last very long. I ve got some that where bought direct from Lowes and they are still going strong. This camera only lasted 7 months before it died! Not sure why this one died so quick. 
29155 The lock broken in one month. It is very danger for an expensive DSLR. 
29156 https://youtu.be/XRIlIN1fJPg 
29157 Worked perfect. 
29158 China made crap. 
29159 Great Price. Great Service. 
29160 It was a gift for Grandson 
29161 Best color checker out there. 
29162 Excellent product and good price with good delivery time. This camera make me happy because i can take good quality pictures 
29163 This is a great little camera takes good photos this is the 4th one i bought. if it did not drop them they would last a lot longer for me. use it a lot and have taken thousand of photos with them for work 
29164 How is nobody talking about the fact that this camera doesn t have an external mic port!!! 
29165 This is a fantastic camera ! I m still learning all the things it can do, but I m well pleased with both the quality of photos and ease of operation. 
29166 Just what I expected. Very nice and in perfect condition. 
29167 Luv it....so much like my old Canon didn t take me long to learn. 
29168 Batteries stopped holding charge a year later. My SONY batteries that I bought with the camera long before that are still holding. Will not buy again. 
29169 love it works great 
29170 good 
29171 Perfect Product. I think it is great. 
29172 Amazing lens! My favorite lens! 
29173 Super light case that has just enough room for your base camera equipment along with a hydration pack. 
29174 thank you 
29175 Item received as described, thanks. 
29176 It could be better! 
29177 Connectors weren t fit right. 
29178 Good camera. Night vision is good 
29179 Gemtune 577C is a well build quick release plate. When I bought it I was hoping it was going to fit on my Benro S4 tripod head and it did! It fits perfect!!! And it also feets on my Benron K5 tripod head not perfect but it works. 
29180 Worked as stated 
29181 Convenient.Works as advertised 
29182 exact replacement for the charger I misplaced works great, shipped quickly 
29183 Perfect for my coolpix 530. Well padded with plenty of room for charger and extra batteries 
29184 Using it for DSC-RX100M3. Works fine. 
29185 Great transaction and looking forward to my next purchase. Can t believe the price versus high quality! These are my standard lens filters now and go on every lens I get from now on! 
29186 Best tripod for a heavy camera and lens! Agility and construction designed well. Based on the fact that the unit is designed to hold heavy components, it s a bit heavy, but I woul buy it again for a second camera. 
29187 This is a handy addition to your lens collection. It is a two part lens. The wide angle distance shots do have a curve to them. So be aware that it is not going to be a straight on shot. The macro portion is great! 
29188 Practical. Now, have battery to long time =) 
29189 Worked well. 
29190 NONE 
29191 these work great. i continue to buy more 
29192 Works, Can t really think of anything I would change. 
29193 Really good... More than expected... 
29194 I needed a tabletop tripod to use with my spotting scope on my terrace overlooking the East River in Manhattan. This small, sturdy item holds my heavy Kowa with ease. 
29195 No complaints, fit my product without any problems 
29196 Very nice product--cloths clean my glasses without scratching the lenses. I appreciate the individual plastic sleeves as well. 
29197 Very good 
29198 I could not activate the camera on my mac. Going to the default IP address by directly connecting to the mac or through the switch did not work. (It just hangs.) The included SADP software only works on Windows. It is going back. 
29199 Awesome works great! I love it! 
29200 worked great. Exactly what I needed. Expect to use them for a long time. 
29201 After figuring out how to sync my YN-560III flashes, the unit works great. The only thing I wish to be included in this unit is that Yongnuo put an option to turn off and on the flashes. 
29202 does take a day or 2 in the sun to charge batteries, but if you have enough you can always have some that are fully charged. 
29203 Henry very fast service. lots ok knowledge. pleasant to work with.I will recommend this product to all my friends. great camera. 
29204 good product. easy to configure 
29205 Great camera! 
29206 obodys perfect. Came as advertised. on time, just what I expected. 
29207 great product worked better than I expected delivery was on time 5 star all the way 
29208 great affordable lens. adds a nice touch to composition and does what it needs to do. works great on my sony a7 
29209 The security guys asked for $600, Well I bought these and installed them on existing wires as I had replaced my windows. Work like a charm , tested with security company all reeds work 100% 
29210 Inner lining separated. Poor stitching. I only used it a few times. But, unfortunate for me the return period has passed. I have only had it since June. 
29211 all wrong need np-fp50 
29212 Best buy! 
29213 The plastic ring around the lenses cracked just from having it in a bag. For a waterproof/ shockproof case this is absolutely unacceptable. Also the seal tends to not seat correctly so you have to really press to get it to seal. 
29214 No bag to carry the equipment and the umbrellas seem to be on the very low end of quality. 
29215 Meant for the 5D3 feels like a perfect extension of the camera. 
29216 excellent! 
29217 Same dust/oil spots issue as with D600 -- it s back to Nikon for maintenance again. Auto-focus gives up in low-light. 
29218 all ok 
29219 Not a real kit; multiple individual items shipped as a &#34;kit&#34;. The only authentic Canon item was the cleaning cloth. 
29220 Crystal clear view and a great addition to my cctv pack 
29221 Simply a joke and a ripoff. I had to place the leg of my dehumidifier on the battery to keep it in place long enough to charge it. Does not work. 
29222 Good value and perfect way to protect your lens investment. 
29223 Batteries are good for backup but are by far not as good as originals 
29224 thank you i feel more comfortable in my home now as it as done a wonderful job thank you again 
29225 Happy with the quality 
29226 Batteries charge quickly, and they use the same charging cable as the GoPro which is nice. Battery life is comparable to that of the battery that came with the GoPro; No complaints here!! 
29227 Love the ease of use and speed of attaching. I had to buy a second one for a second camera. Would highly recommend 
29228 I love it! 
29229 the product does not fit my Nikon D3300 camera even though it claim it does. But the return is pretty easy 
29230 Very light and comfortable. Seems like good quality for the price. The clasp mechanism is quite secure, though I use the backup strap as well just in case. Best solution I have used, way better than a regular neck strap, or just holding the camera in your hand. Very satisfied. 
29231 Excellent 
29232 Perfect item. Fits as snug as the one that came when I purchased the unit. Highly recommend this product and seller! 
29233 the filter is well made. and works well. 
29234 for the price i paid its good 
29235 Very good 
29236 Fun and cute designs! Order cam fast and in great condition. Would recommend! 
29237 I love the shots it captures and the price was right. 
29238 Steady, lightweight, and resistant. The ball head is ok for the price. But I would recommend to buy another if your doing panoramic or night photography. 
29239 The strap is comfortable. Would appreciate some instruction or suggested attachment ideas. None was included.. Tried to email provider but the suggested address didn t work 
29240 Camera fit perfectly in it! 
29241 great 
29242 A bit of wind can knock it over but it s ideal for the price. My first tripod and I m super happy with what I got. Stands up well and tall, also the grip latches work strong and in all it was a perfect buy. I highly recommend! :) 
29243 good camera, good quality videos even is 25 fps max on 1080p, the materials quality is ok 
29244 Good size, well padded, extra storage space, good price, and well built. 
29245 The band is high quality, but not quite wide enough. It tends to contract into the small space between the front of the lens and the manual focusing ring. 
29246 Although the unit seems to work fine (after modification). It did not include the us adaptor as advertised. 
29247 Works great!!! 
29248 Flimsy when up. Hard to handle without flipping over 
29249 Battery and charger are good 
29250 Everything in this kit has been very useful and one heck of a price. THe lens is sharp, light weight and everything you need for a walking. 
29251 performs well 
29252 Just got my X1 CPL and the thinness of the unit is absolutely incredible. I will be testing it out soon and leaving another review. But so far the packaging and the ultra slim construction have impressed me. 
29253 The first one I got wasn t a perfect fit for the lens, so they sent me a new one. Works great for my Sigma 18 - 35mm. With my Canon 70 - 210mm, it causes vignetting. 
29254 excellent product. 
29255 This is way hard to manipulate. 
29256 If you don t worry about pets, open the cover and pull the jumper off the board. MUCH better as it picks up movement almost instantly. Other than that, does what it needs to do. 
29257 Easy to adjust, easy to wear. 
29258 Great. Does exactly what it s supposed to and seems to be of excellent quality! 
29259 Used it for my wedding and I was thrilled with the results. 
29260 great lens, works as described. 
29261 Works as advertised. Have one in the house and one in the backyard. If anyone enters the garage we are immediately notified. 
29262 Just what I expected! 
29263 Does what is advertised. Very comfortable handle and easy to use mounting equipment 
29264 Recently received, It appears a sturdy, well made monopod. Just purchased a ball head for it, 
29265 Works great for all 4 of my bodies with a 70-200 (hood reversed), but grip will not fit. 
29266 excellent! 
29267 You will not be able to fit it in any case. more importantly, the flash will leave a dark mark where this large protrusion interferes with the flash. 
29268 works ok for my simple needs. 
29269 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
29270 Wow amazing camera, great quality. 
29271 Perfect bag for the camera and accessory, great value and quality. 
29272 Damn this camera is the s***. Buy one. 
29273 The include foam breaks on in 1/2 inch squares allowing a perfect fit. I fit my Nikon D70, 2 standard lens and a 600 zoom along with my GoPro. 
29274 Works flawlessly. 
29275 Perfect for the small underwater camera, quick delivery, thanks! 
29276 excellent batteries 
29277 All good made it a great trip 
29278 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using this in the ocean. I got this for bodysurfing and the camera snapped off the base almost immediately. My GoPro belongs to Mother Ocean now. And no....the waves were small - about 1.5 feet. 
29279 Good. 
29280 Not too much to say. It works perfectly, no sizing issues or difficulty putting on / taking off my camera. 
29281 arrived promptly and as promised, thank you 
29282 TERRIBLE SERVICE from the Seller. product broke in 2 months and no one will help replace. Not the seller and NOT HP. TERRIBLE al around. 
29283 The mount works nicely on most flashlights but ocassionally, the flashlight tends to drop on the floor during the middle of the ride due to the clamp doesn t have a top locking mechanism. It just had a half grip to hold your flashlights. 
29284 Great product. Works as described. Great service after the sale. 
29285 works well with a speedlite flash 
29286 Really good but I don t think it s $1000 good Returned and bought em5 mkii instead. Much happier 
29287 Good product. Work as expected. 
29288 Works. 
29289 Use it all the time and takes great shots 
29290 This is the best case for my phantom 
29291 Way too bulky. Impossible to go on trip without tripod and without tripod rings. 
29292 After very little use, one of the props continues to spins but without the force behind it to lift properly. 
29293 Gave it as gift for my Brother in law - He LOVES IT!!!! 
29294 Lost the charger for my camera and so happy to find it available on line. It works great and now I can use my camera again. 
29295 Works perfect on my d5300. Wanted a flash to get started with and its perfect for learning. Get the remotes too! 
29296 My wife LOVES them! They work great - better than we even expected! 
29297 for an LED light it takes a lot of batteries but it produces plenty of light. 
29298 Arrived after I left for vacation. didn t do any good setting on back porch. 
29299 arrived and in all working order good to go the batteries are heavy and you ll need to make a bace for them when charging but thats it 
29300 Simple to set up .Works great ! Thank you 
29301 Price was also great 
29302 Very satisfied 
29303 Amazing product 
29304 It worked out fine. 
29305 everything was great but the camera settings won t change kinda of a bummer.. 
29306 Fits my Nikon Coolpix P530 perfectly and should fit all similar cameras. It s attractive looking and feels very well made. Very happy with my purchase, especially for the price. 
29307 Lightweight and compact. An excellent tripod for hikes and for backup. 
29308 Sold material works very well. I am using this to mount my H4N on my DSLR 
29309 this was exactly what I needed! 
29310 Worked just fine 
29311 Perfect match for my Sony camera. 
29312 Great little camera. Comes in handy when hooking up my boat trailer too. 
29313 Works well with the mobile app and easy to set up using the mobile app. However, I have yet to actually set up the camera because the detailed setup is way too confusing and difficult. The mobile app is good for basic features. 
29314 It was a little smaller than we anticipated but otherwise we are very happy with it. 
29315 Great Charger! I like the way it lets you know on the screen what is happening during the charge process. 
29316 Ordered this a week before a trip to Chicago. Not only did I receive it in time, but it fit and worked perfectly. 
29317 No comments 
29318 great. 
29319 Very happy 
29320 I really like this lens. It comes in a soft Pentax pouch. 
29321 It is exactly what I ordered and exactly what I needed. No problems! Works perfectly! 
29322 Works OK 
29323 Horrible!!! Do not buy!!! I used it twice and on the second use it blew a fuse, caused sparks to fly, and fried the cord... & a clients floor... Also the product is made cheaply 
29324 It s all all right!! 
29325 I am completely satisfied with this camera. I haven t had any problems. 
29326 A bit too small, even for my small camcorder ... but well made and designed. 
29327 Perfect! 
29328 Excellent Product! 
29329 They are best battery I ve ever used very good product don t mess with the rest 
29330 It never worked. 
29331 Arrived before I expected it and was fully charged out of the box, unlike the fuji battery that came with the camera. 
29332 The poor quality of this tripod was immediately apparent. Plastic, lightweight, I m not sure how it stands to support anyone s camera, but it was definitely not suitable for mine. 
29333 A++++ 
29334 It was easy to replace the old DVR with this one. Very straightforward to setup and access via the mobile apps. 
29335 Great 
29336 Took it with me to Yellowstone. Comfortable enough, and I liked all the different ways to get into the bag. I m a little concerned about the durability of the zippers. Had just the right amount of space for my regular lense, my telephoto and some extra things. 
29337 Just what it said it was. 
29338 I use it for outdoor work, good 
29339 Works like a charm! 
29340 Works great. 
29341 better than i expected. 
29342 This works great. I had to purchase this because I lost the cord for my camera. Now I can upload everything I want. 
29343 So easy to use and install. I love that I can check on the house while I am away. The picture is great too! 
29344 Great product, easy to use with my iPhone and my iPad. Quick shipping is a bonus!! 
29345 Works with my Sony camcorder however DOES NOT work with my Canon Rebel T1i. The Canon does not have the second hole on the bottom to attach it to the tripod base :( 
29346 Good package deal! The camera is very good and have been getting great results so far. 
29347 Arrived very quick. I love how pictures are capture. 
29348 Just the right size for &#34;Grab n Go&#34;. 
29349 This tripod is great for run and gun , the only issues are the legs , after the 4th time i used it the lega became loose , maybe the item that i got is bad , other than that run and gun shoulder stablizer was amazing 
29350 Excelente. 
29351 These are the best deals on security cameras I have came across. They work just as well as the high price cameras. They are weather proof. The IR s work great in total darkness and they have a wide angle lens that covers a larger area. A GREAT DEAL.... 
29352 Use this while on vacation. Could have one battery in the camera and the other one in the charger 
29353 Excellent product 
29354 Love this bad so far. Wish there was a few extra small zippered pockets to keep some smaller accessories separate, but all in all its been a great bag so far. 
29355 Perfect, no need to purchase a light stand when I have extra tripods! 
29356 Love it. easy to setup. Takes a bit to get used to the navigation. Wife loves it. She can fast forward thru the commercials. Worth every penny. 
29357 very lightweight and easy to carry. well done. 
29358 okay 
29359 Wonderful 
29360 A really fine focuser. Built well, heavy duty, very smooth and powerful. A worthy upgrade for a fine telescope. 
29361 pretty good camera, had it for 6-7 months and a camera has already gone bad. but pretty good picture. You want know who robbed you, but that you got robbed! 
29362 Fantastic little monitor!!! You simply can t beat the quality and features at this price range. Wish it had SDI IN/OUT and HDMI out, but come on... for $139... this IPS monitor is AMAZING!!! I promise you wont regret it! 
29363 This Kit is awesome, Worth every penny, It has all that you need to clean the sensitive parts of your camera. I love it. 
29364 The video is blurry and unable to capture license plate numbers. I guess you get what you pay for. I will be buying a better one. Sounds are good. The video gets distorted when it gets too hot. 
29365 A high quality product. 
29366 was a gift. Very well received. 
29367 Great Product! 
29368 Friend went through. 3 batteries before I went through one with this 
29369 A quality piece of equipment. It fits well and is well made. The extra quarter inch added to the bottom of my Sony a7mk2 makes it easier to hold. Combine that with the ease of using the arca swiss style plate and it is a win, win. 
29370 Great product, great price 
29371 The remote works well but their is no bag that comes with it for protection. 
29372 Not an infrared filter - it is a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter 
29373 Great Product 
29374 The camera is too &#34;smart&#34; constantly adjusting...I need to read and look up youtube demos. Some of the flash photos have a bit of red in the color. It is heaver than expected and cannot be concealed at concerts...OK (sue me) anyway the dog doesn t mind the flash. 
29375 Works great! 
29376 Works great! And very economical. 
29377 They fit like a charm! 
29378 The camera was all that I expected and more. I m very pleased with this product. 
29379 junk 
29380 I liked the product 
29381 I got this for my 9 and 13 year old boys. They love it! Took a few tries to figure out how to fly it, but once they got the hang of it, it is great. Just make sure you go to an open field. 
29382 Does not fit the GPH4B perfectly, it s a bit loose. 
29383 Loved it, great condition, excellent pics, better than Nikon 200 
29384 Very helpful!!! 
29385 Great for everyday use, pictures are not as crisp as what I am used to. Good value, if you want great photos, spend more. 
29386 Exactly what I wanted perfect and for the price 
29387 This charger never gave me any issues, and did just what it was supposed to do: Charge batteries. Even though it s not an &#34;official&#34; Song charger, it still works perfectly. 
29388 It was good... until I dove just below the surface of the water... then it leaked 
29389 useless 
29390 Works great for our Nikon camera! 
29391 This lens fits perfectly with my Sony A5100 camera. The pictures are crystal clear. Totally worth it for the price! 
29392 not good spend more and get something stronger 
29393 Great quality adapter ring screws smoothly no binding onto camera lens and filters.Fast shipping too thanks Goja. 
29394 It worked fine 
29395 perfect camera if your into the outdoors and are hard on cameras. has never let me down ... even with underwater pictures 
29396 Extremely surprised - super great sound quality. Appears is little cheap (pastic wise), but does the job. Used them on my Canon 70D. Picks up great sounds from the back of an auditorium (80-100ft). 
29397 Works as advertised. Charged up my batteries for my range finder. 
29398 Great replacement. 
29399 Its a bit darker, but not enough to offset how helpful this focusing screen really is. Recommended for anyone with fast glass. 
29400 Works as advertised 
29401 Could not get to work with Mac edited images. Returned 
29402 Works on iPhones, cameras & small animals!!! I have even used it to read books. ymmv 
29403 just too light to be useful - going to return mine 
29404 meh. My older coolpix took nicer pictures. was really hard to figure out how to connect to my phone. returned it. 
29405 I m sure this is a fine product, but could never get it to transfer images from my camera. Remote control worked okay, but never transfer. 
29406 Well made perfect fit, looks like it belongs with the camera. Saved me from hitting buttons while holding the camera. And made my grip better. Love the material, aircraft quality machining. 
29407 Worked as expected. Charged batteries without issue. Only thing I did not l like is that the plug is attached to the unit. Not on a cable. This made it problematic with multiple charging units on wall outlets and strips. Other than that, it is a good purchase. 
29408 I go through lots of these it seems 
29409 excellent 
29410 Everything is good and just wish the recording resolution is bit higher than 480. 
29411 Top choice 
29412 At random, the system would restart or get stuck for no reason. Other than that, the unit is OK for the price. 
29413 Don t be fooled. The color is florescent pink, but its not florescent at all. Impossible to see with full blackout on stage. Unfortunately, this is of no use to me. 
29414 Works as advertised, looks good, feels good. glad I could use this on my A580 instead of the big expensive unit Sony says is needed. 
29415 I m in the installation task and adjusting the wi fi configuration. 
29416 Everything I needed and more for all my small cameras! 
29417 Great little case well made overall! I will be buying a larger version very soon 
29418 This is the tripod I ve been looking at. 
29419 Good hood for the money. The clasping system is very cheesy in my opinion however that is not their fault that canon made that bad call. If it had the flocking is give it 5stars but overall nice for the money! 
29420 Really good pictures for a small inexpensive camera. Nice size when traveling and want to take a lot of pictures and not use I-Phone 
29421 Good. Just what expected. 
29422 easy to set up like all Nest items but I wish you could move the camera remotely. 
29423 Amazing and funny toy. Excelent for beginners. 
29424 An excellent buy! 
29425 I have taken this camera just about everywhere so far. The ocean, mountain biking, on roller coasters, and hiking. I even mounted it on the side of my speed skates for a pretty cool angle. I m very pleased with the outcome, and the cost was great. well worth it. 
29426 Thanks. This will be my extra battery. 
29427 Good bag, but after owning for awhile the velcro attached to the straps ruined any shirt I had on. Was not noticeable at the time, until it ruined a sweater to the point that I no longer wore it. 
29428 Don t work well 
29429 Worked just as well as the original, and having the travel charger was great. 
29430 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
29431 Was exactly the camera I was looking for as a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday. Great size and weight for a 10 year old. Easy for her to use. 
29432 Ordered this to fit my binoculars. Great product, very thick foamy material on the strap. Easily hooks to camera. Feels very secure. You shouldn t be anything but satisfied with this, if it s what you are looking for. 
29433 NEEED MY MONEY BACK!!!! thanks 
29434 great seller - delivered as promised! 
29435 Very impressed with the system. Picture quality was more than expected, set up was fairly easier. Love the fact that can link multiple devices and have 24 hours live access at no charge. Very happy. 
29436 Stopped working less than 3 months after purchase. 
29437 Yes this is a very good case but my Nikon D750 did not fit in it. But for my D90 it was perfect. If you want it for D750 or D810 please look for something else. 
29438 No complaints on the quality. I do wish it had more capacity. There s really not enough room for anything more than the basics. Room for extra batteries, a small charger, and touch screen back pack accessory (for hero 4 black) would be nice. 
29439 Great image quality. But i m still using my pen lens for everyday ... size does matter especially in the small mirrorless category. But still it s a great lens. 
29440 Works perfectly! 
29441 The model I received (which might be a fluke) would not even hold my GoPro after I locked into place. I was really disappointed. 
29442 Works great. I used it to look at dates and markings on coins. 
29443 Great motor. It s a bit bigger than regular Nema 23 motor, but hole spacing and sizing and everything, fits everything made for Nema 23. It is also much stronger than any Nema 23 motor that you can get and can be wired to be parallel or serial. 
29444 kenneth was helpful with setting up an external ip address for us to view our camera from a different network. At times it was hard to understand him. But overall it was a positive experience and we were able to set it up successfully. 
29445 Package hot here on time. Love the camera! Great purchase! Thank you. 
29446 Took this little Action Camera with us to Puerto Rico and it worked perfect. I bought the extra battery pack and boy was that handy! I recommend this product for the price and its quality. 
29447 I bought it for my niece she really loved it. Everything work and fit perfect 
29448 not was I was hoping for… 
29449 Does a great job. Easy to set up on my phone too! 
29450 The adhesive is great. They are still on my lens months later. 
29451 Good 
29452 Great product 
29453 Fools everyone. 
29454 Absolutely amazing!! Huge upgrade over my Phantom 2. 
29455 Great filter. Now I can shoot video in sunny condition with low aperture and fixed shutter speed. Good deal! 
29456 Great bargain easy to use, fairly intuitive, but recommend reading the manual first. 
29457 i have an extra battery for gopro now. it works~ 
29458 this was just what my little camera needed to help stabilize it to eliminate blurred photos! 
29459 We attach this to a model rocket, and the audio and video are awesome. 
29460 their perfect 
29461 Thought it was a good value, but to good to be true... pictures not consistently clear and didn t double focal sight. 
29462 it s ok 
29463 Fast delivery. Batteries fit & worked fine in my Nikon S9900 camera. 
29464 and it will hold more that just filters; things like lens caps and body caps; I wish it closed more tightly (the Velcro is not wide enough if the case is not really stuffed full). 
29465 Wasn t sure what to expect because of price, but it really holds a charge. 
29466 Al Was perfect 
29467 Met my expectations and was priced right. 
29468 to small, good golly how did they make it. 
29469 Great selfie stick. very portable and surprisingly sturdy. inexpensive and fashionable. even works on snapchat. 
29470 works woderfuly keeps my Nikon D3200 lens clean 
29471 good product 
29472 Its okay, video looks good in the cam-recorder s screen, But, while seeing in the computer, it is okay, not very good. Picture quality is also pretty ordinary. 
29473 Just what we were looking for. Well satisfied! 
29474 Great Product! Why pay $60 for the Black Rappid when this is the same thing for a fraction of the cost 
29475 The quality of the head strap was great! 
29476 works great and feels sturdy while use in my go pro4 camera 
29477 Great little camera very sharp pictures easy to use 
29478 Great when shooting low to the ground. I use with a baby backdrop stand and an umbrella. Also good for back lighting a backdrop. 
29479 Excelent 
29480 The price is fair and the item is built in pretty strong material. I use it to mount my digital recorder on top of the DSLR. It works fine. 
29481 Camera works. Put it under my garage door opener and now if door is open get constant video. You can turn off too. 
29482 Good dependable power I think a bit over priced. 
29483 dank 
29484 This Brinno camera is outstanding. Many operational choices. Very fast shipping service. Construction is perfect. Well thought out design. 
29485 Does what I expect for a camera at this price point. One heel of a zoom range! Sometimes a little slow focusing in busy areas. Pretty crisp and clear too. 
29486 might need it 
29487 The internal screw terminals allowing an external sensor was a welcome surprise. This should be part of the documentation. I discovered that it worked by testing it. Sensors out in the garage are working well, but needed a repeater. 
29488 These are great batteries. Just what I wanted. 
29489 Not only protects the hot shoe when not in use, but also provdes a convenient spirit level! 
29490 Fast best-of-the-breed telephoto lens. Fantastic pairing with a tc-14e III teleconverter and/or aps-c camera for extra reach. It s big and heavy though but personally I find it manageable. You will get a workout but I m still spry and haven t been hospitalized because of that. 
29491 nice 
29492 great for my river raft trip 
29493 Doesn t do much 
29494 We love our GoPro! This thing is amazing! The editing program is very user friendly as well. I recommend buying some kind of steadying mechanism though... the video will look so much more professional if it s not as shaky. 
29495 Good quality and really amazing 
29496 doesn t go to terribly far but it s lighter then a d celled one 
29497 Looks nice and cool. Seems to be sturdy. Would recommend. 
29498 Had to discover after delivery that this item will not function without buying the additional Capture Camera Clip for 59.95$. Either sell the entire kit in working condition or don t sell at all 
29499 Served the purpose to communicate from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor. No power plug was included so they run on batteries which only last one week. 
29500 Awesome. I live one block from Lake Erie in Ohio. I love all the ways to use my go-pro gear-pro camera. I would highly recommend to take on vacations and adventures. 
29501 Arrived on time and better than expected. Great product when you don’t have three arms. 
29502 Amazing bag- really cant say enough about it. Even let friends borrow it for their Hawaiian honeymoon when they went hiking and they loved it. We used it all of Europe and it was invaluable! My husband felt comfortable wearing it and didnt feel out of place. 
29503 I don t know who comes up with these things. They should go work for Mattel. This thing is a joke! 
29504 Connects with Microsoft LifeCam Studio 1080p HD Webcam (Q2F-00013) 
29505 The telephoto lens works fine but the adapter included in this kit did not fit my G16. The telephoto lens does however fit a real Canon LA-DC58L lens adapter. Since I really bought this for the lens I m satisfied with this purchase. 
29506 It was a steal. I shoot music videos with it. I shoot events. Its great i just need extra batteries. 
29507 These batteries are added to my growing collection of LP-E6 s for my 5D and SmallHD monitors. They seem to work as good as my OEM batts as well as my Chili and Wasabi Power batteries. Thanks STK 
29508 Everything worked as described. The charger was slower than I expected, but it did charge the batteries completely. 
29509 The batteries are great and the delivery was earlier than promised or expected. All together a great experience for me with Amazon! 
29510 Great product and a good quality for how cheap it is! 
29511 Received as expected and works great on my Nikon D5000. Slipped on easily and is very comfortable to use. Great product so and I would definitely order this again! 
29512 Great 
29513 Worked well give it 5 stars 
29514 just because I ordered to a European address didn t mean I wanted the Eruo plug... super inconvenient since I m not even in Europe any more. 
29515 good little lamps 
29516 Henry was absolutely wonderful! He totally got both of my cameras set up. I didn t have to really do anything, whioch was great being I do not understand a lot about computers. Thank you again Henry! 
29517 I have old Nikon and new Panasonic. Went on trip to Alaska. Held batter charger and batteries and san discs. 
29518 Perfect 
29519 This external viewfinder actually works quite well, but it s prone to breakage since it s dangling off of the camera. Also, for $250, I would recommend just getting the newer Sony A6000 or NEX 6 that both have viewfinders. 
29520 favorite black and white film 
29521 No quality control at all! :( - Monopod sections don t lock, so camera flops down, rotates with gravity. - One of the lens adapters doesn t thread properly - Remote doesn t work (Even tried a fresh battery) 
29522 User friendly, crisp imagery, good battery life. 
29523 Great product and fast shipping. Just as described. Thank you! 
29524 Works fine for just a hint of extra lighting or if used as backlighting, but makes VERY LITTLE difference. Get something a little stronger. 
29525 The batteries do not hold a charge. We charged them for 24 hours before using them and they lasted less than 20 minutes. 
29526 I had some difficulty setting up external access from the web, BUT I called the Foscam tech support people and spoke to a gentleman named Edward, and he fixed me up in under 5 minutes. so far so good. great resolution on this camera 
29527 Love this case, came as shown in picture. The foam was easy to remove and everything fits snug. 
29528 I didn t make note of the three inch size when I purchased them. They are really little! 
29529 I love this bag!! perfect size and looks more expensive than what I paid :) 
29530 Love it. 
29531 good price and product. 
29532 My 15 year old loves this camera. The film is very expensive, but it is a very fun camera she uses with her friends. 
29533 Great film. Enlarged one of my Ektar negatives to 20x20. Looks fantastic on my wall, professionally framed. Amazing skin tone quality. 
29534 Good price. 
29535 Don t be fooled because this is a third-party brand; this is an outstanding lens! I used it on my Canon 7D. It s manual, but don t be scared of that. It produces some great images and the 8mm is perfect for crop sensor bodies. 
29536 as expected 
29537 Great features, Love the ease of use, Got this for a parent that s not super tech savvy and the fact that there s a button for taking pictures and another for recording video is awesome! 
29538 Do not buy. Accessories are not as per the details provided. And after sales experience is also bad. 
29539 nice adapter now I can use all my Nikon lenses on my Sony vg10 
29540 Did NOT fit my camera 
29541 very pleased with it all! 
29542 Love it! So much for a great price!!! :D So happy!!! 
29543 Not built very well and the tolerances are not great, but you get what you paid for. The item works well enough for me and I am satisfied with it. If you are doing hobby level macro photography, this works just fine. 
29544 If you don t have one of these you need to. i had some stains on my UV filter that lens cloth wont touch. But after useing this pen they where gone. i gave thisitem fivestars. 
29545 Great protection 
29546 Excellent lighting solution for my video game streaming set up! 
29547 I use this w/ a Tascam to record my mando. Rock solid. Finding well-made stuff in the sea of never-ending (cr*p) makes me Happy. 
29548 works great 
29549 Works like original battery in my Minolta digital camera 
29550 I tested this in a pool and no leaks! I was going to use it on a snorkel tour, but it was canceled. Not sure how well it works in deep water 
29551 I really love this lens! 
29552 worked great but now after charging the camera says the batteries are dead. Cannot seem to charge them at all 
29553 Works as described. Easy and the case is very nice 
29554 Just used it on our river trip in Europe and found the settings to be spot on. Threads easily and adjusts smoothly. A good universal fader. 
29555 Broken and not working when it arrived. 
29556 I like it it is working fine 
29557 everything fine. works great. 
29558 Works great, and I especially like the car adapter. 
29559 The order came in record time and was exactly as advertised. The pole looks very well made, with robust aluminum parts and no cheap plastic. Company seemed to take suggestions about its last iteration of this pole to heart and made the lock screw captive. Very pleased so far! 
29560 A cozy but good fit for the Canon SX 50. Room for extra battery and memory cards. 
29561 A relief to find avreplacement that works. Go-Pro was no help and don t support older products! 
29562 same as OEM if u wanna save a few bucks buy em 
29563 Excellent!!! 
29564 Nice kit, I ordered it for the hood. It is good enough and stylish, I like it. Filters are fine and I like the case they came in, very handy and useful. Came fast and well packaged. I recommend this item and the seller. 
29565 This product is good and reliable! Packaging was good! 
29566 Very good enclosure and mount for the Dropcam Pro or NEST camera outside. Just add a Fosmon 10ft Micro USB to USB Flat cable to get under a closed window and you have a perfect installation 
29567 We used these for our wedding guests to take selfies at the wedding reception. You have to find a place who will develop these and they have to be sent away for processing. We loved the idea and it was fun! 
29568 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
29569 Worked fine, though I never did figure out how to use the dividers. In the end it met my needs to have a sturdy, safe way to store and transport my family s collection of slides from the 1950 s-1970 s. 
29570 was a gift. no complaints so far. 
29571 Battery hold a great charge! Good value and well built. 
29572 So far so good! Still can t believe the price for this bundle. Looking forward to diving more into this product. 
29573 Met every expectation 
29574 Seems just fine. No problem, no regrets. Good value. 
29575 Package arrived on time as promised. Batteries did not last as long as original GoPro battery. One battery worked once and then would not charge again. Package returned. 
29576 great price and works great 
29577 The battery gets discharged completely if left in the camera overnight. It recharges fine and it says it s 100%, but doesn t hold the charge at all. I have Canon and STP brands also and they work fine. Total waste of money. 
29578 Great size & colors that won t get lost in the bottom of your bag! 
29579 very compact and easy to use. 
29580 I haven t cracked the code of shooting with a white background yet. Everything turns out gray unless it s essentially over exposed. That said, this is a decent little setup for occasional use. 
29581 Easy to setup. Mydlink works great on Android. BUT The picture quality is way below expected. I increased the resolution which helped, but nothing was ever in perfect focus at any distance or lighting. Disappointed 
29582 buy it, strap and brackets work well 
29583 Its ok but hard to set up 
29584 Very well made. I used a youtube video to get it on my camera, which I recommend because if you put the strap on wrong it can come off and your camera can break. This strap is very solid and the pattern is beautiful. 
29585 Make sure to pick up the right SD card for best performance 
29586 great product thank you 
29587 Worked well but after a couple weeks the app is not working so I can view on my phone! I am pretty angry cause I can t get it to work. The cameras work fine and do their job. App sucks. 
29588 AMAZING!! There isn t one thing in here that I have a complaint about!!! All of it worked awesomely, is durable, and I have yet to have a problem with any of it. Plan to buy two more for Christmas gifts! 
29589 Richard Helped me the reest of the way the cameras aree great and the wireless distance in my case is excelllent aso have utdoors wide excuse me i have treemors 
29590 Worked like new. 
29591 Works nicely love it! Picked it over the Dropcam. Very happy used it for a few months now. 
29592 Everything came as described. The cleaning pen works very well. Plus you can never have too many microfiber cloths 
29593 Shipping is fast and quality is good 
29594 Very nice filter. Slim profile and machined very well. 
29595 Haven t tested it out yet but it is obviously made of high quality materials! 
29596 I like it! 
29597 used this in the ocean with my go pro and it worked great 
29598 Great mount, aggressive price. 
29599 Too big for bikes or motorcycles 
29600 great! 
29601 This was a real surprise. It was a cheap gag stocking stuffer gift for my wife. The gag was on me. We have used our GoPro soo much more with this than ever before. Definitely worth the price and convenience. 
29602 as described 
29603 Seemed like a good product. I just wanted more of a walkie talkie so I could use inside unite anywhere in my house. Seller was very good about saying they would give me a refund. 
29604 Awesome. If I ever need a part I will definitely use them again 
29605 Was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it...she used to have the same one that her son drop by mistake inside the water.... it became a perfect gift for her :) 
29606 Minimal design, Solid construction. Needed to mount my monitor on to my gimbal. Works great 
29607 Our dial was broken but we did not get a chance to return it before the 30-day window. Luckily, the manufacturer fixed it under warranty it just took a while. 
29608 These are visitor brand batteries at a Bargain price as far as I can see. Basically getting three for the cost of one fuji battery. Came well Packaged and Fully charged. Superfast service. Highly reccomended 
29609 heck ya 
29610 This filter is superb, use it all the time when traveling especially 
29611 As described, great Product. 
29612 It s great to have an external charger and extra batteries. They save a lot of fusle. 
29613 Is ok 
29614 good quality. 
29615 Great case 
29616 Just like the original! 
29617 This was perfect for a trip I just did to Nicaragua. It helped me to have great pictures and not having to worry about my camera. 
29618 This case is the perfect fit for my DJI Phantom3! Plenty of room for all accessories including my ipad! It keeps everything firmly in place and can be adapted to almost any accessory that you might have. The wheels and handle are rugged and store away nicely for travel. 
29619 Works well 
29620 Henry 
29621 Very good quality and fun to use As described, easy to use, bluetooth paired without problems with my samsung. Good quality design, the phone holder grips the phone securely, when unextended its like the size of a normal umbrella, fits into the handbag. Worth every penny, no regrets. 
29622 shorter than expected, but I ve heard it s all about how you use it and size isn t necessarily everything... 
29623 Cheap plastic lenses, scratch easily... Shade limits photo area & casts shadows at certain angles 
29624 Have been using this for a long time now. Works great. Always keep extra batteries available when on vacation. 
29625 fake 
29626 Good value and easy to set up 
29627 I haven t actually testing this under water, but I m happy with it. It s just what the description says it is. 
29628 excellent 
29629 I finally received my order I believe it was lost in transit. I have used a product and it is like magic 
29630 Great product, well built, easy to use, delivered on time. 
29631 Nice case 
29632 Yep! It works! 
29633 The cold shoes are milled wrong and will not accept a flash shoe. 
29634 Flimsy and poorly crafted. Strap broke in 3 days. Stitching started to come apart after 6 days. Stay away! 
29635 field of view small. recordings will not play back on mac or pc. 
29636 VERY cute film!! I m definitely looking forward to using it as it is definitely one of those &#34;here&#34; moments for your fujifilm. I will treasure it and it came very fast and securely packaged! Would order again! 
29637 As described. 
29638 Nice case - covers lower body and easy to take on and off - looks good. Has little door on side to open for access to USB. One drawback which others have mentioned is to change battery or get access to SD card you must remove the case. 
29639 It would have been better if it could charge from USB port. But overall it is pretty good price and quality for two battaries. 
29640 This camera is everything I wanted, except the battery doesn t last as long as I would like. This is great for sports pictures, they came out crystal clear, love it. 
29641 Very nice strap, I have a full frame DSLR and been wanting a different strap but didn t like the ones that connect to the tripod mount. I saw another photographer with one of these and he liked it and I really like it also. 
29642 Fantastic strap that really fits. Shot all day, all week and hand rested well when camera hanging down. Room to use index finger on shutter for once. Great device. 
29643 Excelente 
29644 Horrible...replaced the bulb and blew within a week I would not buy this!!! 
29645 Great for that extra camera body so it is ready to go onto your harness. Nice and snug and good firm click when engaged. I do not worry about them coming undone. 
29646 fits loose but it seems ok 
29647 i ll try it later this week. 
29648 Great Product 
29649 good value and works like original 
29650 Terrible &#34;x&#34; banding at darker settings 
29651 works good 
29652 Works great 
29653 Great back up. Holds charge. Similar to original Canon battery. 
29654 Excellent product and great customer service!! The seller worked with me to fix some issues which were caused by me. Highly recommended. 
29655 I didn t even receive the rilakuma film. It was little twin stars. What the heckie! 
29656 I really like these. I ve bought four of them. Their mount is a little bit hokey, but it works, just gotta be careful. can be used on the camera, or hand held. Really very flexible and at a good price. 
29657 Awesome! 
29658 One stopped holding a charge and inflated in size indicating short circuit, the other worked fine 
29659 cheap made 
29660 wrong size for my camera 
29661 Great size pictures for scrap booking 
29662 It is what it is and what it is is fun. 
29663 This product arrived as promised. Everything that was described on the site was delivered. Very satisfied overall 
29664 it worked perfectly for my camera and got here just in time! 
29665 As advertised. 
29666 It holds the microphone. Can still hear shocks though. 
29667 Good product and received it quickly 
29668 Worked perfectly with my camera. 
29669 Obviously not top of the line. But it does the job wonderfully! I used this because I will be upgrading my camera soon and the underwater housing for the camera I will be upgrading to would not fit my camera now. So until then I will use this! 
29670 I can t say if the video quality is good or not because I can t figure out how to work it. The instructions are terrible and don t make any sense. I would love to be able to find a video showing you how to use this. 
29671 Love this camera. Got it for under $100. The red is nice color. Needed wifi camera with 1080p hd video and at least 16mp and this does the job. Bought accessory pack for $20 for case and extra battery. 
29672 Great for pics with baby. Cute 
29673 Nice camera for a decent price. However, I was eager about the wifi automatic uploading function. It is WAYYYY too complicated - I have never gotten it to work, and I am not tech illiterate. 
29674 Not work after two weeks 
29675 It is really good 
29676 as promoised 
29677 wonderful and easy camera to understand and use. 
29678 its a case ? 
29679 A little bulky 
29680 Super handy. I have to always use them with stage weights or sand bags. The base legs do not spread wide enough considering the giant sail that is attached to them. Very light weight, so treat them gingerly. 
29681 not much room at all 
29682 Works great from the moment it arrived which was on time. 
29683 Works Great. Very small and compact, can trigger the camera from the front, or from the back of the IR detector on the camera. Includes 2 buttons - one for focus and shutter release and the other is for a 2 sec delay. Tested range - 3m. 
29684 Wonderful camera and you get sooooo much with it for the price! Love it! Perfect for beginner or intermediate photographers! 
29685 Not gopro brand but high quality none the the less, great product for the price 
29686 Great quality. Not a huge fan of the fish eye but was expected with wide angle lens. 
29687 Novelty camera, photos are small and washed out. Don,t waste your money 
29688 As an amateur, i found this camera excellent, easy to operate, realistic colors and the build quality is very sturdy as you expect in a product like this. Lens upgrade is a must, the default lens is a bit poor in zoom in my opinion. 
29689 Worked great for my application. I m very pleased. Plugs into mic input for DSLR camera. Works for computer and iPad also. 
29690 Dove with these about 8 times up to 65 feet and had no fogging problems. I also used a stock gopro 1 and had no leaks, did not use any special dive case. 
29691 To expensive 
29692 Easy to use, lightweight and compact and came with all the accessories I needed. Shipping was quick! 
29693 The eye cup is too big for the Nikon D7100. It s loose and the right side partially blocks the diopter. 
29694 Batteries work great in my night vision scope... 
29695 Two stars 
29696 In the day its a wide clear color view... at night its clear black and white in the pitch dark :) 
29697 really surprising 
29698 I haven t used it yet, saving it for my cruise in October, but my camera fits nicely into this pouch, and it s triple sealed so you camera won t get wet. 
29699 Description is deceiving it states, &#34;higher quality video than what is provided through cable and satellite operators,&#34; which leads you to believe it can work with Cable or satellite TV and it does not. 
29700 As described 
29701 Works fine 
29702 Work like a charm, dusts on sensor of my Nikon D7000 were cleaned, thanks 
29703 This should hold my 15 x 56 binoculars steady. 
29704 A security camera has no Audio!! Whats the $190 for ?! that was the worse purchase I made within years. On top of that there at least couple of seconds delay. Non of these is acceptable for security camera, garbage! 
29705 THIS WORKS LIKE A FRONT LENS CAP SHOULD!!! WHOa !!!1! 
29706 Good product for the price; but doesnt feel it s going to be durable... screws seem they will break with use after a few months...let s see... 
29707 Excellent 
29708 Work just fine. No surprises 
29709 nice item, works well on my bag 
29710 Good protection at a decent price. 
29711 Arrived as described and on time. Thanks 
29712 Not the highest quality build that you have ever seen but it does what it needs to do and does it pretty well actually. It has very bright lights and takes double A batteries and it does last a pretty long time. So pretty good purchase made here! 
29713 not very sturdy. recommended to spend extra money on the actual stick from GoPro 
29714 We love this. It makes the target you are shooting about 100 yards closer. 
29715 Excellent 
29716 Essential equipment for all photographers can t wait to give it a try. Especially for night and tripod shooting. 
29717 I bought this lens for astrophotography. I tried on a clear night in a place away from city lights. The results met my expectations. I recommend this lens to anyone starting in astrophotography with a DSRL. 
29718 Just what I needed. Thanks 
29719 Great tripod. Grips to anything. Small and compact. Very easy to use. 
29720 Awesome camera, setup was a snap! 
29721 Awesome video quality, light weight and small in size. Perfect for my 250 quad build. Will do business with again 
29722 Thanks! 
29723 Received these and have charged them up, work fine, thanks much. 
29724 Excellent product. Works great. I couldn t get all the features to work at the beginning. Called customers support and spoke with Calvin, everything working perfectly now. He helped me set up the Wireless and the Laptop support. One of the best technical support calls I ever had. 
29725 this is a very good flash, it won t disappoint you 
29726 Genuine Pentax batteries are the *best!* The shooting time I get with a genuine battery is 10 times longer than a non-Pentax brand, and the battery retains most of its charge after long periods of storage. Highly recommended! 
29727 Bought one for me and as a gift for a friend. Trust putting my d-800 on it with a small lens. Great for the price. 
29728 Everything works perfectly and for much less cost. The Sony has smaller batteries so you must have one or two on hand when you go out. This really fills the bill. 
29729 No what I expected:( 
29730 I love them! They were cheap and good products. At first it only shipped one so I contacted the seller and he automatically sent the other one. I got the other one about a week later. :) 
29731 Great product and allowed an easy installation of my Security Camera System. 
29732 Great value 
29733 really nice and conpact 
29734 It works great just as stated. Veto is very clear and night pictures are great. 
29735 I use this to mate a Nikon D3100 to the Meade ETX 125EC, still requires T-mount that &#34;clicks&#34; into the camera 
29736 Excellent 
29737 Haven t seen the Canon version, but it can t be much higher quality than this one. 
29738 Did not fit our Canon camera as described. Returned for refund. 
29739 Works perfectly with no issues. 
29740 This case is a snug fit for the Sony Nex-6 with a compact kit lens installed. 
29741 has rust which tells me it obviously got wet at some point, though it does work (but for how long) 
29742 These cloths have been invaluable for getting my glasses clean. No cleaner necessary, just a few rubs and I can see again clearly. 
29743 Best new toy! 
29744 Received as expected 
29745 Good price, and good quality. 
29746 Works as advertised. 
29747 Great little flash for the price. 
29748 Super cute. Goes well with my camera and I just love it! 
29749 works fine. 
29750 Everything you need to start capturing the best moments. Love the fact that everything was in perfect condition. I m really enjoying my camera. Even though it s a refurbished, you won t notice it. Because it performance is the same as the new one. 
29751 great circular polarizer, fits my 52 mm lens, does a good job in various light settings, makes the colors look so vibrant and nice, particularly the sky when i take landscape shots! 
29752 When used with various Lowepro bags this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
29753 price is good but its very cheap made and cant adjust levels on the leg 
29754 The quality of this I thought was going to be cheep. I was surprised very sturdy well worth the money! 
29755 very light but stable 
29756 Definitely love my Polaroid! Film is a little expensive but it is so much fun and in good shape. 
29757 Wow. these actually work. I thought for the price they would be half azzed. Can play music, record video, charge thru your PC. If you ride a motorcycle they can be indispensable. 
29758 Very very sturdy tripod, I can feel it immediately when I hold it in my hand. All the locks lock in very steady. And the monopod function is very nice too. Generally a very good buy! 
29759 Great Camera. Crystal clear and very vivid picture. Love it. 
29760 Don t come close to fitting around my 62mm filter. Waste of money. 
29761 good to observe Moon only.. not good for even... Mars and Venus. 
29762 Works and fast shipping! 
29763 The filters work well well for the price. 
29764 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
29765 Does fit over case of my I phone but not stable easily dislocated Has typical fish eye distortion as expected 
29766 GoPro products are such good quality. This clamp is very strong and I would trust my GoPro clamped to anything with this mount. 
29767 One camera came broken and the other two they drain brand new batteries in less than 24 hours 
29768 Large enough to fit all my components and to travel with , made very well, I would definitely recommend this for the GoPro 
29769 Although it is said to be the h4 3d gimbal, the computer software recognized it as an h3 3d....? Flew great but due to software issues I returned for a full refund. 
29770 Works very well on my camera. 
29771 This is pretty poorly constructed and doesn t really match the camera at all. I ended up returning it and buying the genuine Panasonic part (which is much better). 
29772 I can t get it to work and I threw away the paperwork - so I cannot return it. 
29773 Perfect camera for my quad. Simple and easy to install. 
29774 works great 
29775 Exactly what I needed to complete installation 
29776 It works very well. Ken Wolf 
29777 This lens came well packaged. So far it has performed well 
29778 The bundle work awesome, the stick are very steady and not slippery at all especially I use it to do Tough Mudder..and the boater work wonder since I dropped my go pro couple times in the water during the obstacles. 
29779 Great lighting kit. Everything described perfectly. I actually received an extra Sandbag that was not listed but love it since it helps to hold down the hair light. 
29780 Just what I needed the battery that comes with the camera does not have near enough power the handle an hour of recording time. I recorded about an hour and a half and the battery was still at about 75 percent charge 
29781 Doesn t last as long as a GoPro brand battery but pretty close. But they are totally worth it for the price. Fit perfectly in the gopro 
29782 We bought this for our Nikon Waterproof Coolpix camera. It s a perfect fit with enough room for the charger and wire! Great quality and light weight. Definitely worth the price! 
29783 Very cool 
29784 Love this looks real. keeps people on their toes. 
29785 Great cameras, fantastic value 
29786 Got the battery, charged it, and it is working perfectly. Fact that I have two batteries makes it better!! 
29787 I haven t been able to try it yet but I think it will be awesome. 
29788 Awesome camera. Loved it 
29789 Inexpensive, a terrific buy! 
29790 Camera freezes, we tried it for backing up our 5th wheel but the camera would either be black or freeze up. It was working for just connecting the hitch but now it is freezing up on that too. Very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. 
29791 Dark filter works as it should, but polarizing filter is not impressive at all. My honest opinion - isn t worth the money. 
29792 Does the job thank you !!!!!!!! 
29793 Nice little camera for the money- I may buy more 
29794 I like it, it s well made all metal. 
29795 Really love using these polaroids in lieu of traditional photos as they add more of an artistic touch to the photos! I would definitely recommend this! 
29796 Lobe this camera! If you wanna have fun with photos this is the product for you. 
29797 this does not charge from the sun, but will charge from electrical. it will not charge my phone at all. 
29798 VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !! 
29799 Almost worthless. Customer support is useless. I cannot get my computer to recognize the sd card to view the files. CS was unable to help me and offered no solutions. Save your money on this product. It does not work as advertised. 
29800 Works well; strong glue. 
29801 Extra batteries are great, charger is super fast! Although that mini tripod can barely hold up any weight.. doesn t stand a chance to hold up my Nikon D5300 (36.5oz ~2.3lbs!) 
29802 Good 
29803 excellent 
29804 It s a piece of junk. Haven t been able to contact the seller to retire this junk so I m stuck with it. 
29805 I love that I can bend the tripod to fit where ever I need it to be, used it on a TV, on a shelf. and on my arm! 
29806 Love it! perfect for monitoring my house!! 
29807 so far good kit, just learning it. will follow up soon. 
29808 I bought this originally to hold me over until I could afford the Money Maker from Holdfast. But after 12 weddings in the 2-3 months.....I m not sure I need the Holdfast. Granted it looks awesome....but is it worth $200 more than this??? I m just not sure. 
29809 Excellent. Wors as advertised, and the price can not be beat. 
29810 Looks real and the motion sensor works up to long distances triggering blinking red light. Great deterrent-very happy! 
29811 Works fine as a back-up battery for the camera. 
29812 Hold up as well as the name brand cannon ones I have. Great battery! 
29813 great battery, I have many older cameras and this works great 
29814 I bought this for my Nikon D7100. I love it, light weight and durable. 
29815 Hi,the quality is not good. After 3 times the screw was broken, my new flash has been dropped and he has had damage! Don t buy this product! 
29816 very nice 
29817 So cute!!! Love it! And the delivery speed is very impressive! I ordered at noon and received it the same night! 
29818 Did not charge my Sony battery or battery it came with!!!! 
29819 Nice Props....no problem at all after 16 flights. Recommend to get prop guards also. 
29820 Purchased two of these monitors and was very pleased in the ease of setting up. Now all my family members want one. 
29821 Item was broken on arrival. 
29822 I really did not know what to expect. But this little light weight tripod is great! I like that the legs extend if needed. 
29823 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
29824 They re ok.They get the job done but just get a real sensor. 
29825 This product looked lioke and advertised to be a two lens case. It is not! only one lens fits into the case when it is closed. 
29826 Exceptionally clear and crisp for a cheap lens. Great depth of field with plenty of bokeh. Nice for DSLR video or pictures. 
29827 very nice quad, realy easy to fly and take videos, even for beginners 
29828 after 3-4 flight the battery connector was melted. (both sides) 
29829 I love my len 
29830 Needed a replacement charger for my video camera and this one really came through for me. 
29831 Perfect! 
29832 Ie worked perfectly with my old camcorder. 
29833 Works just like the GoPro brand name one. Perfectly fine for me. 
29834 awesome selfie stick! 
29835 This product is more than I could have imagined. 
29836 Works as advertized, extreme high qualith cloths 
29837 I could only use autofocus on intelligent automatic. 
29838 I wanted an IR camcorder to do some amature paranormal investigation. For the price you get what you get but that isn t all bad either. I added the Poloroid 36 led IR light and get up to 30ft of lighted distance. 
29839 First time I used it the screen froze. I waited to use it for a vacation and by the time I got back the 30 day return policy had passed. Stuck with a paper weight. 
29840 Great product and arrived on time. The charger works well and the batteries hold a charge at least as well as the much more expensive Canon one, possibly better. I am very happy with this product and look forward to buying from this seller again. 
29841 This fits my Canon Powershot SX10is perfectly. Price is great. Arrived promptly. 
29842 In bought 3 of them and none worked!!!!! 
29843 Fantastic item and very economic. I cannot recommend this enought! I am using it with my Sony A7ii and YN-560 III and RF-603. 
29844 Kenneth helped me to set up all 3 of our Foscam s so we can have security throughout our home. He was very patient and very helpful. Thank you! 
29845 Other reviewers were correct. OK for finding lost change in your sofa. A bit weak for finding anomalies in rifle tubes 
29846 Philips wireless Home Monitor is perfect...It is small in fact tiny and can be put in a inconspicuous area. I love it and it does the trick... I can see who is in my home and see if someone is up to &#34;no-good&#34; Money spent well! 
29847 Just as described 
29848 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
29849 It s good, isn t big enough to get the ring in subjects eyes. But it functions very well. 
29850 I have been a pro photographer for over a decade, why did it take me so long to buy this lens? It s amazingly sharp and contrasty and great for portraits and candids. 
29851 It s Great! Great price and just what I wanted. 
29852 Great working camera. Day/Night mode switch over creates a loud click but works like a charm in night mode. 
29853 Great addition to your camera set. Definitely a great buy. 
29854 Good product 
29855 Great case that protects your camera, is compact enough to fit in a purse and easy access. Love it 
29856 Works well so far. Good price. 
29857 Very cute and worth the price :) 
29858 This is an absolutely necessary accessory to the LX100. The clip-on cap is cumbersome and you will end up losing it. This one is always where you need it. Who needs filters anyway? 
29859 I love this camera! It s so small I can put it anywhere. I love the color of it. The only thing I didn t like was you can t see what you are recording. Other than that it takes great videos and photos. 
29860 Works perfectly on my Sony a5000 camera 
29861 Excellent in every sense 
29862 Out standing clamp, I hem-hawed over the price for a bit, looked at other options. I already owned a Arcatech ball head, the quality is top of the line, made in the U.S. You get what you pay for in life. 
29863 nice item 
29864 Definitely a smart purchase 
29865 it did meet my expectation. very good picture quality, nice camera color and easy to use. 
29866 Yea...this flash is AWESOME! I ve been using a canon 430EX in manual for a while now and I still use this Nissin in manual also (mostly). But the lower profile by itself and easier to use controls just really adds icing on the cake. 
29867 This is one outstanding piece of equipment for the price. 
29868 great camera 
29869 Remote does not have much range to it 
29870 Setup is a little confusing, but once you get past that it works great. Access from my smart phone, tablet and PC. 
29871 Bought for 17 year old daughter birthday. She loves it. Picture quality is great. 
29872 The battery that came with it didn t work. Foto& Tech were quick to reply to my first review. I went to Walmart to get a new battery and it works fine now. 
29873 They work great, shipped fast. Would buy again. 
29874 poor quelity... fair for the price. 
29875 Works great to attach a handle to and is very high quality for the price! 
29876 Great quality sound, can hear voices very well even with a great deal of background noise. Highly reccommend these as a very economical yet very effective means of audio monitoring. 
29877 Great real like it. 
29878 Worked great for me. Did a DSLR video for a big well-known organization using those filters. It worked like a charm. Everybody loved it! 
29879 To lobotomize a drone tie a heavy cord or even a light chain to it. The higher it goes the more weight it is dragging. While debugging your new drone, start in the middle of a field, not in a room. 
29880 Works great. 
29881 cant fault the camera for anything so far. So I should really give 5 stars. However, lack of local storage is a significant drawback. The fifth star lost for lack of local storage possibility. 
29882 Total crap. Bolts didn t reach nuts, cheap cheap construction with no QC. Didn t come close to being worth what I paid. Save your money. and get this instead. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WFN4UIS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 
29883 Works great on my Watson Duo Charger. Now I can charge batteries for my X-T1 and 7D at the same time. 
29884 Received as new 
29885 Great! Works perfect for my sony camera 
29886 Was damage when I buy 
29887 Great camera, so great we just ordered another one. Wonderful day image and super clear night image. Our DYI security system works great, especially with our cell phones at work. Great for watching the dogs while we are at work. 
29888 Thank you you were very helpful! Couldn t find the batteries anywhere else! 
29889 Got it and tried right away. Picture was very good using an older SD card. Just ordered the new model of SD and hoping it will be even better. Glad I bought this instead of paying $300-$400 for something else. 
29890 Great. I will buy more 
29891 Thank you, A+ 
29892 Was impressed with the packaging of this product, as well as my camera! 
29893 Gives good battery life and fits perfectly in the Canon SL-1 camera. 
29894 works for me 
29895 B 
29896 Works great and is a must for non-floating cameras. 
29897 Looks decent arrived with one broken bulb and another one flickering like crazy. Reaching out to Seller to see what steps they are taking to rectify. I will write more reviews about that and also the product when I use it. 
29898 Just what I needed for my wide-angle zoom lens. My only concern might be that the fitment to the 35-70 mm lens could have been a little tighter. Otherwise, it works great. 
29899 Love this case. Already have it too full. Looking for next size up. 
29900 Slipped these feet into my Watershot case. iPhone 5c now fits. 
29901 Great product and received as described 
29902 A+ 
29903 The battery was delivered timely. It charged as advertised and seems to be holding it s charge as expected. I ve only had the battery for a month, so it s still working from it s initial charge. I bought it as a backup for a Canon 70D. 
29904 Excelent 
29905 great 
29906 sooo clear in picture and sound... BUMMED it took me this long to buy it! 
29907 it was OK 
29908 These cords work well at a fraction of the Canon price points. 
29909 For an inexpensive lens this is easy to add on and does enhance the distance. 
29910 Easy to use, easy to carry - can hold very large lens and camera and still be very stable - would definitely recommend. 
29911 This was a slight upgrade from my old Canon digital which was misplaced. Really great high res photos in any light. I use it for merchandising online. 
29912 Absolutely love this camera, the white really sets it apart from the typical DSLRs out there. I highly recommend this for any amateur photographer like myself. 
29913 Meet my expectation 
29914 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
29915 The same as the two cameras I had previously. I lost both to water accidents. I bouth another because I like this model. It is small, inexpensive, has a view finder and takes decent photos and videos. 
29916 Junk! Kodak will not support this and the sellers charge a fortune to return plus a restocking fee. My first one completely died after only a year and that was only turning it on during holidays and special occasions. 
29917 must have! 
29918 I ve been using this with both a FL-600r and an FL-50r. It does it s job but overall I much prefer to just use a small softbox for on-camera. I couldn t recommend this for off-camera use either. 
29919 awesome 
29920 Great 
29921 These cloths work amazingly well and the price is right. 
29922 Works good for the price 
29923 Fast shipping, smooth transaction, perfect product Thanks! 
29924 Product is exactly as expected. They are sitting there as spares - hopefully will never need to use them. 
29925 DID WANT WE WANTED IT TO DO 
29926 doesn t havew the strength it needs 
29927 CAMERA IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE , NO PROBLEMS 
29928 This is a great camera. Its worth the cost 
29929 The motor is loud and you can hear some of it on videos. I also do not like how short the battery life is. It does make nice videos otherwise but I would recommend getting a spare battery and external mic. 
29930 Worked has advertised. Was able to take shots of the starts and lightening. That was the whole reason for the purchase. Excellent price, well worth the money. 
29931 Both hoods work very well for my application. I use the retractable hood since I can extent it as needed. I have purchased several products from Gina and have always been happy with my purchses 
29932 Worth every penny, AAA+++ 
29933 very nice! 
29934 Good product, fits perfect on 55/250mm IS STM lens and cheaper than original Canon lens hood. 
29935 I like this a lot but I m not a huge fan of how you strap the tripod on. 
29936 Finally found a good product for safely cleaning my monitors and flatscreen TVs. The spray and magic fiber cloth work well together and get a good streak free clean. I ve got the small magic fiber cloths for my sunglasses etc. Quality product would definitely recommend to everyone. 
29937 Love this bag, great seller 
29938 no good. 
29939 Bought this device to enable me to download images from my camera to my iPhone for sharing. Absolutely easy to install and intuitive to use. Works as advertised for me. 
29940 Supposed to be HD, but it s only low quality SD. Very narrow view lens, can t get much of what you are looking at on the video... maybe somebody s ear, or a blank wall, etc.. 
29941 Batteries worked great with my S32. Two batteries got me through a 14-day backpacking trip, hot and cold temperatures. 
29942 It works 
29943 They do not fit in the camera. I have a canon t5i which it clearly says that they fit, but they do not. They do however fit into my battery grip, but that is not why I bought them! 
29944 Super product 
29945 as advertised 
29946 Hard to remove ! Excellent fit and quality 
29947 Love it. It costs less than my previous camera, which I unfortunately dropped and broke, but this seem to have better features. I just hope I don t drop it again. 
29948 Excellent! 
29949 Purchased 2...easy setup...works great...runs smooth...fast delivery...tech support is there when you need your questions answered...PS LIVE SUPPORT. 
29950 I love this polaroid film. However, the light sensitive layer in one pack arrived damaged and each polaroid in that pack was ruined, which is a bummer since each polaroid costs about $3.00 
29951 fits on my shotgun and my bow. but feels a little flimsy and may easily break 
29952 Fun gimmick, although package arrived damaged on the corner, the lens itself was fine. 
29953 Great! Wouldn t use the selfie stick in water... It rusts in a few hours😂 
29954 I have been wanting a macro ring light for many years. The Canon light was always too expensive for just casual, non-professional use. This one works great, has adapter rings for almost any lens and is so inexpensive, you deserve to try this. I m very happy. 
29955 It doesn t work how can I return 
29956 ok for the money, obviously not even close to the manfrotto version, but it will work.. 
29957 Awesome little kit. I can t think of a single complaint for these. 
29958 Awesome! Vendor great too!!! 
29959 Excellent purchase 
29960 Nice setup, just the car mount alone normally runs about the cost of the full package. 
29961 Use all the time. Do exactly what they are advertised to do. 
29962 Very solid but seems to be easily scratched. Perfect use to build a customizable shoulder rig. 
29963 Already broken but I didn t keep the information to return it. What a disapointment! 
29964 good stuff! 
29965 AVOID this case. It leaked while submerged in 30&#34; of water and ruined my SJCAM. No clue what to do from here. There s something to be said for shopping at actual stores. 
29966 Very good system 
29967 Great little camera for the price!!!!!! I bought this just to keep in my pool bag and it works fine! 
29968 Good tough straps that allow very good length adjustment. They were very close to being exactly what I was looking for. The strap adjustments could be tighter to prevent movement. 
29969 Work perfect and really come in handy when you have the bluetooth running. For sure need to get if you have a gopro 
29970 Excellent package deal. Love this thing. 
29971 focus doesn t work and the flash doesn t woik 
29972 Lets be honest, you re getting what you paid for. Cheap plastic, cheap quality, looks good for decoration at least. 
29973 Fit the case exactly as stated. I didn t have too hard of a time getting the screws in as others have mentioned. Really helped me fit all the smaller camera gear in my case to utilize the most space possible. 
29974 Works well really pleased with the GoPro product line. 
29975 These are amazing!!! I have one on every lens. I will never lose another lens cap again! The adhesive works perfectly. Best deal ever! 
29976 nice item..... 
29977 vintage 
29978 My son loves this camera! 
29979 best strap i ever had. this is way better than those that comes with the camera. this is very comfortable and my camera feels secure. for the price, its no brainer not to get this strap. 
29980 Product didn t work. It kept crashing and was very unstable. When I called for support I spoke to someone in India who eventually ask for access to my computer. Although this may not be unusual I declined. Returned the product. Great disappointment. 
29981 Okay head, had to grind down the screw heads on the base so that the clamp would fit flush. Also, the clamp is okay, but I have to adjust the tension as the size of the Desmond brackets are different than all my other ones. Wouldn t buy again. 
29982 Worked as expected. Car socket adapter made it a plus. 
29983 This product really works. Bought a bunch for me, family and friends. 
29984 Amazon Basics does it again with amazing quality products at an affordable price. I feel like I stole this thing, it is so much better than it s price tag suggests. I can t imagine what more I would want in a tripod. 
29985 As described. Works well. 
29986 The majority of the accessories did not fit my GoPro Hero 4 and I inquired about the issue twice will no answers 
29987 Works as well as the technology permits. 
29988 Works just like the more expensive canon flash. Does what it s made for as long as you know what youre doing. 
29989 dont buy from this buyer even by mistake! product looks worse than a chewed up cellphone! 
29990 gives you all of the cool items for any adventure 
29991 I rarely use it right now, because my mic. Once that is resolved I can use the whole thing. 
29992 Great &#34;old school&#34; type cameras and were fun to bring to an event. 
29993 This was a gift, but my friend seems pretty happy with it. 
29994 It s a great value for a Canon camera, we couldn t be happier. 
29995 I love this little thing. It gets great angles from my gopro and very durable. The only thing I don t understand is the Rope thing that came with it. 
29996 Great product 
29997 Exactly what I wanted! 
29998 Does not sync up to our openers. 
29999 Horrible product and service. 
30000 Had the same problem as others. I plugged in the charger and 30 seconds later I heard a pop. My battery was damaged and the charger no longer worked. 
30001 it work !! 
30002 This does exactly what it s supposed to. I am able to fit my Sony Nex-3n as well as a Kodak Zi8 and extra batteries, cables, and sd cards. For small cameras and accessories this is a great bag. 
30003 Right fit. Lost my original while on vacation. Works great and reasonable priced. 
30004 Good 
30005 I ll try to remember to add to this next year because these are to replace two competitor s batteries that didn t last but about a year. So far these charged up well and seem to hold their charge well. 
30006 Descent. Set up i got what i could afford to learn with. I know its going to be fun either way. 
30007 This viewer worked great for slides that are 60 years plus. 
30008 Very good 
30009 Great housing for the Xiaomi Yi camera. Adds a bit of protection to the unit. Recommend, especially at this price. 
30010 Works great, exactly what I needed at the star party. Best to wait until it is on sale. 
30011 No problems, charges and lasts just like described. 
30012 very grainy picture quality but what do you expect for this price. 
30013 Order more, limited life. 
30014 Works 
30015 It s perfect and wonderful for cutting out glare while looking into the viewfinder. 
30016 Works great for spare batteries for the GoPro. And great price compared to GoPro branded batteries. 
30017 It did what I wanted with the slides, I have yet to try it on my super 8 film and negatives. 
30018 I bought this for my NEX 5 camera to use when we went to Yellowstone this summer. It is a fine lens but it is rather heavy for the camera. However, I am pleased that I had it with me because I got some excellent photos! 
30019 Excellent lens hood at a great price fit perfectly! 
30020 Exceptional product - in fact, I liked it so much I bought another one! Lightning fast shipping. Great experience and would definitely buy from again!!! 
30021 work great best camera at this price. 
30022 too small for my use 
30023 Arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed. 
30024 Horrible back drops. 
30025 Super! 
30026 The clapper had separated from the board during shipping and i had to glue them back together. Other than that the quality seems good and the price is right. 
30027 Received in an appropriate amount of time. Very pleased. 
30028 spend the money and buy the real deal 
30029 as advertised 
30030 Still learning how to use it all. 
30031 It fits ok in general but clutching the stop buttons requieres more handling 
30032 Best birthday present I ever bought myself. I m still learning this camera and have yet to fiddle with each setting; but the photos I have taken with this camera are polished and look fantastic. I love submitting them to photo societies. 
30033 excellent product. it was what I was expecting. 
30034 I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it! In the digital age where everything is online she was so excited to have instant &#34;old school&#34; pictures. 
30035 Awesome product and customer service! 
30036 I had one before. I bought one to replace the old one and they work fine. 
30037 Got to love Gopro. I recently lost my old Hero 3 Black, and found this one as cheap as it could get. All items arrived as described, it was just as new. Great Photo and Video quality. 
30038 Works well! 
30039 For the price, this is a decent saddle-bag weight. The material is nylon but appears and feels durable. I placed zip-loc plastic bags inside the compartments of the sand bag then filled those plastic bags with sand. 
30040 Great item. Love using it when we are surfing and also when kayaking and hiking 
30041 Nice blacked out housing 
30042 lenses won t focus - don t waste your money 
30043 Fabulous package with so many accessories in it! Couldn t have asked for more! 
30044 Very, Very Good Camera. Metal casing is heavy, but I shaved most of weight by making a 1/16 inch thick plywood box for it. Now weighs 0.6 oz. 
30045 great 
30046 Great 
30047 Nice. Easy to set up, sturdy, and is a very gracious size. Also, the carrying case is very helpful. 
30048 Like everyone else says, the plastic parts seem weak. But higher priced versions have similar or worse complaints about the same problem. I came back to this one and am pleased that with some care it will stand up to my infrequent needs for a reflector stand. 
30049 Case was well made and fit perfectly. Appreciated the extra thought involved in developing the battery change panel. Surprised with the gift wrist added to the package. 
30050 I purchased this while I was expecting my first baby so I could capture all her firsts 
30051 So simple to use, which was great while I had pregnancy brain! Videos are amazingly crisp and clear and look great on our HDTV! 
30052 More than I expected. Came with car charger and even plug that we used un Iceland. Great value 
30053 Very bad quality products. One mount cracked at 1st time I tried to use. Monopod seems like its gonna break when u extend it. All these cheap chinese stuff. 
30054 The strap started ripping I only had it for a month if that. 
30055 Cute 
30056 Good stuff 
30057 This product needed to be set up with their web site and their link didn t work! Still can t use this product! (Not happy!) :-/ 
30058 I love these accessories for my go pro hero 4 silver, works perfectly and looks so cool :) 
30059 What a tool. this camera rocks. 
30060 Very nice lens and affordable to. helps get that clsoer shot 
30061 ok for the price. It fulfill my basic needs for a monocular 
30062 Lightweight, well built, great optics. Perfect for our Kodiak Brown Bear viewing operation. 
30063 helpful 
30064 Glad to find original Nikkon products 
30065 Excellent!!!! 
30066 Arrived as promised and fits the battery. Haven y used it since the battery arrived already charged. 
30067 TERRIFIC! 
30068 Easy set up, works well, phone app lags a little unless you have 4G but still very useful. would be good if you could adjust the audio notification, motion notification works great. overall a great camera, I will probably get another to monitor another part of the house 
30069 Does exactly what it is supposed to! Very well made metal lens hood. I needed a 62mm wide angle for my 28-80mm vintage zoom lens that works great but is prone to flare. This hood solved the flare problem nicely! 
30070 Surprised the wife and it works great on vacations. 
30071 Love my new Fugi! 
30072 Works with d5300 
30073 Great polarizer, does not attract dust and I have not had problems with it getting stuck. Inexpensive for the quality, although if you have a budget for a more expensive filter like B+W that would be a better route to go. 
30074 I like it. Nice, smooth and eazy to use 
30075 Good price, excellent product!!!!! 
30076 Would not stay registered on my Veralite, even though I had a repeater less than 20 away. I was unable to get Vera it to recognize it again, even when I brought it inside. Maybe defective - I sent it back. 
30077 Works great for mating the pistol grip from the Amazon Basics 70-inch Pistol Grip Tripod to a monopod that s fitted for 1/4-20 thread. 
30078 Five star récord. 
30079 Never got it to work, and I tried on multiple OS s. Very disappointed 
30080 Works as well as OEM at a fraction of the price. 
30081 I can t fault the product, it is as described--- but I seldom us it. Too lazy I guess. 
30082 it works ! 
30083 Fixed the blinking red light of death issue with my FI8920W. I replaced the failed power supply with this one and I was back up and running. 
30084 Fits the camera fine, just don t like how it fits in the camera case. Sticks out so far that you have to leave room for it or take it on and off. 
30085 Absolutely great value! Super snug & comfy with just the right amount of compartments and dividers. Would purchase and would recommend. 
30086 Love using this for my DSLR in the kayak! I holds my camera nicely with extra lenses and some supplies. The shoulder strap is a little awkward, but at least it has it. 
30087 I have had no problem with this battery. Works great in my Canon camera. 
30088 Excellent ball head, especially at that price! 
30089 As expected 
30090 Very nice camera for the price. Good clear image, great features, easy to setup. Very easy to use, both from my smartphone and laptop. My wife loves it for watching our pets when not at home. 
30091 Perfect and much less expensive than the go pro ones. 
30092 Too flexible 
30093 Great camera for the price. I m not a great photographer who can use the SLR s. This camera is about as close as you can get to the quality of a SLR, without buying a SLR. Very pleased with the purchase! 
30094 The right arm broke at the 4th use... and the camera died within a week... Don t buy this :P 
30095 I put 6 rechargeable AAs in it to see how long it would stay on at full power. After 10 hours I finally had to go to bed. I am very impressed with this unit. 
30096 This is my third Sony Cyber shot, I feel like it s NOT made well, but it does take AWESOME pictures. 
30097 Excellent for low light. Great build quality. 
30098 Great camera, great transaction! 
30099 Its pretty good but its not very strong, thats why Im gving it 3 stars 
30100 Works great 
30101 nice 
30102 I slip this into large purses, totes and backpacks so that I can take my digital camera with me without having to bring a separate camera bag. It seems to cushion the camera well. 
30103 Light weight material makes this tripod easy to carry - it comes with its own carrying bag, too. Surprisingly tall (when the legs are fully extended) and sturdy. I mounted my heavy binoculars on this tripod, and the whole thing was very stable. I would definitely recommend this tripod. 
30104 Looks so real 
30105 cheaply made 
30106 Perfect to use with my older GoPro Hero 2 and the inline microphone. 
30107 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
30108 Good product 
30109 Great 
30110 I love it. it is light and have a lot of adjustment. it perfect for me. thanks 
30111 It works ok. Not spectacular, but ok. 
30112 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this item!! PLEASE restock so I can buy more!! :) 
30113 Beautifully sharp portraits from this lens with gorgeous bokeh. So glad I saved over $1000 by getting this one instead of the 1.4G! 
30114 good results 
30115 This was a sweet camera until the view screen stopped working after a year of light use. I wouldn t buy another one although the color resolution was excellent for art work. Now a monument to wasted money. 
30116 Works as intended..... not easy to operate, but that s how it can be made 
30117 Great backup! 
30118 Excellent product and oportunity, great price... 
30119 great value and excellent product 
30120 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
30121 Perfect!!! 
30122 I upgraded from the FC40. This unit is amazing! 
30123 Fantastic camera for the price. I have gotten several hours of HD video out of it. Love the fact that it automatically corrects for orientation of the camera. 
30124 Great package. Fits my Panasonic LF1 perfectly. 
30125 horrible pictures. piece of junk. 
30126 Perfect for sage keeping and easy transport 
30127 Nice well made hood. I purchased this hood for my GM5 and it fit the kit lens perfectly. 
30128 The sensors are lacking on this product. I am not impressed with the quality and I would have went with a different one if I had it to do again. 
30129 The film I received was either expired or defective. Once I went to use it all of the pictures came out like they were not properly developed. 
30130 lots of product for the price 
30131 great light for video filming the only thing it does not come with the stand 
30132 Fell apart. Crap 
30133 LOVE IT!!!! 
30134 It does a good job with AHD cameras. So far so good. 
30135 Works great. 
30136 it works only a couple of times than just die 
30137 Hope I never have to use it.... but I will.... and I will demand to be served. Thanks. 
30138 Great, and very useful. 
30139 FRIGING best thing I ever got for my GoPro !!!!!! I use it on 75% of protects it allow me to get so many different angles that mounts sometimes restrict you to have. 
30140 Very nice 
30141 I haven t used this enough to know if it will hold up, but so far it s a good tripod for the price. 
30142 Works great. You can mount the brackets on the wall or use c stands for more portability. Great product and the quality seems good. The rollers and chains are plastic, so naturally I was worried but they are sturdy enoug. No complaints. 
30143 Barely got it last night, BUT. First thing I notice is how noisy the shutter is. This surprised me since no one else mentioned this and I thought an electronic, mirror less camera would be silent. Not so! 
30144 Ok 
30145 This little camera works great! VERY cool, and affordable. Here is a little time lapse I did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRXNr8AMMrI VERY FUN! 
30146 Good product for the price 
30147 Nice and clean shots. I use it with all my lenses now and it is producing get shots for it s cost. 
30148 The Hood did not fit my Canon t5i, as described. I was able to wedge it on most of the way, but even after that, it did not work as well as the other lens hoods I ve used. 
30149 Great product! 
30150 Works a treat 
30151 Needed this for an older JVC. The cleaner did the job. The heads were so bad that I had to run the cleaner through two times, but I can now view and transfer my old Hi-8 tapes to disc. 
30152 It was as described. Have not used it yet. I got it for using under water when in Hawaii. Might go for one that is a bit longer. 
30153 solid 
30154 These cloths are perfect for display screens, glasses, tablets, kindles etc. I use one mostly on my Kindle, it s great for wiping the finger smudges off the screen. 
30155 It is kind of bulky but it provides much more battery time than stock battery that came with videocamera. 
30156 Battery drops dead withins three hours. 
30157 These are excellent cameras, at a great price. Very well made and a definite improvement in resolution and night vision over the cameras that came with my Swann system. I will continue buying them as replacements and add-ons. 
30158 Works great. Good battery life. 
30159 Excellent product. 
30160 Got camera. Working. Fast shipping 
30161 All I Expected! 
30162 Great harness. I took this on a 60-mile hike and wore my camera 6 days straight.. couldn t be happier. 
30163 Was as advertised 
30164 very pleased with the batteries and receiving them so fast 
30165 Excellent camera at an excellent price. I graduated from the SX 40 so had a good idea on how to use it. 
30166 Great product 
30167 Cheap material. Light won t lock in place very flimsy. But the pro is the lights are very bright. 
30168 Excellent product. I have several monocular but Polaris Explorer is another level. Very high build quality, very good optics. Highly recommended. 
30169 This works very well, does all the single shot and burst and timer and bulb shots, exactly as expected. I have not tested the transmitting range distance but am never very far from the camera in my photography. The instruction manual was surprisingly helpful and well done. 
30170 Love this camera, but the history feature take a long time to load. Maybe I need to set it to 780 instead of 1080. 
30171 Worked perfectly as expected. 
30172 It works as advertised, but I do wish the brick was a little smaller. 
30173 Works very well with the Samsung Camcorder. The professional wedding photograph even used it. 
30174 I use this quite a bit with Macro photography, works really well.... 
30175 excellent product 
30176 doesn t work ;( 
30177 It was everything I excepted. 
30178 Very well made. It can even be used as a regular purse if needed. There s plenty of room to fit other stuff besides the instax mini. Beige looks very classy as well. Overall very pleased with my purchase! 
30179 This was purchased for my grandson and he loves it. 
30180 Nice prime Canon EF lens for portrait and low light shooting. It is soft when wide open, but sharpens significantly at about f2.8. I don t use it often, but when I do the results are very satisfactory. 
30181 Average. Works, but not especially well-made. 
30182 Excellent 
30183 No issues 
30184 These worked well with my D3100. 
30185 I love this strap. It feels so good when wearing it because of the velvet that touches the neck. Very good quality and beautiful! Worth the extra money then some others I ve looked at. 
30186 Used it the same day I received it. Have no complaints, as described. 
30187 i love it so much; but the one thing i can t find is the &#34;flash button&#34; to turn it off. 
30188 It served it s purpose for street shots in Europe, but I always wanted to be able to change lenses 
30189 Poor quality. Plastic, not durable 
30190 Great 
30191 Works fine for thé moment. Will really use it only in tow monts. 
30192 It is perfect. This I exactly what I wanted. The camera is a gem. 
30193 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
30194 Awesome camera has alot of extras but moves around when accelerating like on a dirtbike. Just need to figure out how to keep it facing the right way but great picture underwater and regular 
30195 Shipping was fast but missing tripod mount. 
30196 Great product at a great price. Had all the features of the expensive flashes at a fraction of the price. I love this flash! 
30197 good 
30198 Amazing sandals very comfortable 
30199 Was tight at first and nothing said it won t fit with the lens cap on but now its fine. 
30200 Better than previous model with the IR separate, also has audio feed. A challenge of sorts to mount, but doable. Great picture for the price, make sure you get English firmware. check the suppliers.. Some say it is others say from China. Not support available to upgrade if from china 
30201 I love it. 
30202 Just note that the USB cord is for the battery charger not to transfer data from your camera to your laptop (my mistake). However, the battery works great on my Nikon CoolPix AW110. 
30203 Great picture quality day or night. You wont be sorry if you buy this camera. My ZModo system came with 4 and I added 2 more they were that good. 
30204 very good 
30205 This camera is great. I bought mine for a nursery camera. It does get hot when I to turned on so I try to turn it off when I am not using it. But it is super handy and the remote option is awesome. 
30206 cheap! broke on it s first use 
30207 I am returning Kodak Easy Share Printer Dock. We were delighted to find one, but it only prints half a picture. I am enclosing sample. Would like to request refund procedures and information to print return label. Thank you 
30208 Really nice lens bags. Good protection and smooth sides so they slip into my overloaded bag really easily. Will buy more when ii need them. Better than the Nikon bags that come with their lenses. 
30209 No instruction manual, doesn t have very good video at night 
30210 I need more direction 
30211 makes the motor and iris very noisy and slow. but it works i guess 
30212 Love this, if you do not get anything else get this. This really makes you life easier. 
30213 Really like, fits alittle small. 
30214 My son loves this!!! 
30215 Horrible definition 
30216 My son is in love!!! He s a sports fanatic and into all things outdoors. These let him and his friends use their GoPros hands free!! And I don t have to worry about it getting smashed up or left behind!!! 
30217 The carmers is a replacement they work fine and they were what I want. 
30218 Works for Sony action can 
30219 excellent! 
30220 Loved it, I just needed 2 but is good to have them in a drawer next time you need it. 
30221 Yes this is fantastic for our baby monitor. Can put the monitor everywhere now. Very happy. Although it does look very suspect in its packaging which the postman gave me a funny look!!! Lol 
30222 Great for smaller items 
30223 good for the price! here s my sample clip @1080P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfuSAyqW8_Y music outdoor sample acoustics https://youtu.be/SdLSbkG1EKE https://youtu.be/lSs5epPOFHQ orchestra/band https://youtu.be/Q37u77MbnaA https://youtu.be/1Q-L_ffqd1c very nice zoom downside battery life 
30224 Limited value with sigma 150-500 mm lens since you can t use auto focus and it is hard to manually focus, like shooting craps. Not worth the money. 
30225 I ve had this remote a few years. Recently, the cable stopped transmitting, but Promaster s warranty is wonderful. In a very short time, they shipped a brand new cable to me, and the whole remote works just like new again. 
30226 The plastic finish could be better but the results match the expectation, great flash for any camera. Good battery consumption. 
30227 great what i wanted block out light 
30228 Excellent 
30229 Great little camera. Nice size for a pocket or a purse. Takes great pictures. Nice zoom range. Also, didn’t buy it with the idea of taking any video but the video capability is a good addition and the video quality is better than I would have thought. 
30230 Perfect light with the size , solid build 
30231 Great camera!!! Excellent quality, both pictures and video, a lot of cool lenses in this set. Tripod is very light so you can take it anywhere with you. 
30232 The case was covered by full of mold... But lens covers were ok. Works good too. 
30233 Long and black -- connectors are good 
30234 bad I never worked and the seller did not want to be responable, Amazon had to help me and I returned the money 
30235 Holds a charge well, does its job. Would buy. Again. 
30236 everything came and look like it was in the picture 
30237 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this camera! GREAT picture, LOVE that you aren t replacing batteries all the time, just needs a charge once in awhile, easy to get pics off, and AGAIN GREAT PICTURE! WORTH EVERY PENNY! 
30238 Quite a few tapes for the money. 
30239 Love just as much the second time purchasing as the first. Awesome product at a crazy awesome price. THANK YOU! 
30240 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
30241 bueno 
30242 This is an excellent buy for the money. Very satisfied. 
30243 Everything looks just as promised. Used the products last night and they did a swell job! 
30244 Unit received fits well on my camera and allows a secure hold and feel. 
30245 You really can t beat a good Pelican Case. I mounted these to my 2000 Triumph Tiger 885i and the size is perfect for long rides. For daily riding I m just using my Seahorse tail case. 
30246 Best bang for your buck out there. I use these for star gazing at the milky way when in the bahamas and for other scouting uses during the day. they work very well. 
30247 Thank you. I got it! My friend said he loves it too! 
30248 I love these batteries Work great and they fit my camera 
30249 Now I can carry all with me incase I need a fresh charged one. Great deal 
30250 As expecteted 
30251 Pros: Shipment was timely and met specs as advertised. Cons: Not recommended for a heavy DSLR with large lenses. 
30252 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv0BUK0YocQ Check out the video I did on the unboxing of this item! 
30253 Perfect fit, no loose connections to mess with! 
30254 Awesome 
30255 works as advertised 
30256 Works fantastic even in sunlight at F/1.4. I highly suggest it. I am using it on a 1.5x crop-frame DSLR, so I am not sure if any issues full frame cameras would encounter. However, it s a perfect ND filter to start with. 
30257 Defective product, poor customer service, one of my biggest mistakes 
30258 Fantastic optical quality. 
30259 I could write a technical review here. Many have touted the 7DII and its amazing performance. I will say simply......untouchable for a crop frame camera. If you are thinking of adding this to your collection, DO IT! 
30260 The ball joint works fine, but for the price this company charges for the weather proof housing and this stupid ball joint, it s ridiculous. For $30 you should get the housing and the ball joint. Instead it s $70 for both. 
30261 So far I like them. The rest we will know when he gets back from the deer camp. Anxious to see how videos turn out 
30262 Nice lens for the price. 
30263 charges my camera up right 
30264 Batteries charge up and hold charge well. Great value at a fraction of the cost of Canon batteries. 
30265 I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it, hence the 4 stars. Based on design, appearance, and the ratings of others, I am very confident that it will perform as expected. 
30266 Great quality great quality and intensity 
30267 Nice case, not too small and not too big. Several pockets outside and inside. I have a camera backpack, but I use this case much more often. 
30268 Worked perfectly on our older security monitor set up. Much cheaper then trying to buy a bunch of cat monitors. 
30269 Works like a charm. Lock the mirror up on your camera for steady shots. Great for selfies of my wife and I as we send pictures to our friends. 
30270 I bought this as a replacement for the original canon one that broke. It looks as good as the original however it constantly slides off my T3i. It doesn t lock in place securely and the slightest touch makes it fall right off. 
30271 Love the camera, new to DSLR. Easy to use, on auto settings, yet definitely want to explore more manual settings. Highly recommend. Came as advertised. Delivered on on time with prime. 
30272 Great looking camera but did not check out the functions since I had returned the camera. 
30273 You get what you pay for. The lens is exposed to dust even when not taking pictures. You have to hold this camera very steady or the pictures will be blurred. If this is a 10.1 MP camera, I am disappointed. Bottom line, it is a cheap camera. 
30274 Couldn t get the wrinkles out 
30275 Excellent products and good pricing. Thanks much. 
30276 It s a nice beginner scope but it is very hard to sight in and shakes a lot when trying to adjust. 
30277 Super happy with my drone looks great everything is there how it was advertised thanks guys 👍👍 
30278 very good 
30279 GREAT FOR HIKING,EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT. GREAT VALUE. 
30280 Good Product Works as expected 
30281 OMG! I don t know how Ive done without this! 
30282 So far so good, a lot to learn with this camera to use it to its full potential. 
30283 Sharp views. Takes care of lot aberrations. Excellent high end eye piece for an affordable price. 
30284 These floats work as advertised. Used them in pool and ocean. Used on my Galaxy S4 phone and Kodak waterproof camera. All went well, items floated and the colors were visible. 
30285 Excellent! 
30286 Arrived quickly, and just as expected from the order. Thanx! 
30287 Unfortunately the tapes do not work. Not sure why but ever time I put the tapes in my equipment it would say the tape was dirty. I had to clean my equipment. Unfortunately I missed the window to send tapes back. 
30288 it sucks 
30289 exactly as described, I love this lens 
30290 Great bundle. Only thing is that the tripod seems a little low quality but that s something that we all have preferences for. Other than that amazing. Very pleased :) 
30291 Good camera bag, has a lot of compartments, well padded for protection and durable to use. 
30292 Tripod is a little off center like the guy posted in the video but is easily corrected. I use it with a Logitech C615 Webcam works amazing for this. 
30293 This is the best. I love how compact it is, it fits in my purse, and holds an extra battery. Definitely worth having. 
30294 My experience echoes the experience of others—they re super functional and a good buy. 
30295 Only used to scan 35mm. Magnifies small dust. 
30296 Lens works great 
30297 The order arrived quickly. The batteries and charger have been as good as the battery that came with the camera. Performance as I would expect. 
30298 I m a film student in NYC and i want to take my filming to the next level. The stabilizer was a gift from a dear friend of mine. After expressing my need for a stabilizer, my friend did his research and found the perfect combination of affordable and excellency. 
30299 good pictures, cycle time a bit long. 
30300 For a DSLR such as a Canon Rebel or Panasonic GH4, you need this! Make sure you don t leave it in direct sunlight or you will burn up your LCD like ants in a magnifying glass. 
30301 This is horrible only because mine turned out to be a fake. It wouldn t work and looking at pictures of the same camera, they looked nothing alike. :( 
30302 OUTSTANDING 
30303 Great glasses. Everything we wanted. Thanks 
30304 Great product 
30305 Fantastic backpack for camera and accessories. I don t go anywhere without it. 
30306 first they sent wrong sin card , went and got the new one and it doesn t record!!!!!!!!! The pictures freeze all the time, what a waster of money!!!!! 
30307 Great product 
30308 Nice to have some extra for all my USB sticks and then some 
30309 A complete kit,very usefully Nice and thought camera 
30310 I was sceptic all at first but after playing with the cenera and learning to programimg I am very pleased 
30311 Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you. 
30312 Great camera for a great price. Still highly recommended 
30313 nice product and an excellent seller 
30314 Zipper broke just after 30 days warranty period expired. Do not recommend this product. 
30315 Film didn t work Did receive refund 
30316 I LOVE, VERY GOOD AND EXCELLENT 
30317 The notes showed this was good for beginner star gazing. It s really hard to set up and not user friendly at all. 
30318 Fits my Tamron 150-600 mm to a T! Quality of materials and fabrication are outstanding. Should last many years of heavy use. This item was supposed to come in September, but it arrived even before the other items I purchased from Amazon on the same order! 
30319 Some work, some don t. When they work they are great for a dark cabinet or a gun safe. Unfortunately some arrive DOA. 
30320 awesome case. helps you keeping it organized and protected 
30321 People had mentioned previously that it doesn t seem to have the same battery life as original camera battiers, but I have not found this to be true. I am very happy with this purchase 
30322 Work great , not problems 
30323 Hard to find Polaroid type film. 
30324 Wonderful camera, color is sharp and clear, the night vision IR is also great. No complaints here great camera at a great price. 
30325 I thought it will be good from the reviews, but no. Its not a quality product, maybe some users liked it but your experience may differ. The part that connect the legs is s***ty and sort of broken? One leg gets off really easily. Sorry, not worth the money. 
30326 This is truly a great value and is very functional. I received this product as promised, in great condition, and it nicely fits my iPhone. I was a bit skeptical about this product because of its low price, but it is truly a great deal and it works nicely. 
30327 This arrived so quickly and is working like a charm. 
30328 Unfortunately this is not adjustable and didn t realize it is big, would not work with someone with smaller wrist. Seller is very professional. 
30329 Good for what it is. Head mount. I don t really use this but its not bad when wearing a hat so you don t feel the elastic sucking the hard plastic pieces onto your forehead! 
30330 Does not improve lens of Fuji HS50EXR, save your money. 
30331 I had no problem installing and they work great. 
30332 No complaints so far! Affordable and far more compact than the manufacturer s charger. 
30333 Just what we wanted. Price was good and arrived as expected. We are very satisfied. 
30334 Would have been far better had it come with some directions. Bought it for my wife. Neither of us are tech gurus. Will figure it out but it would have been far easier with direction. 
30335 The product description mentioned a non-corrosive set of accesories such as the floating handle grip and the hand-held monopod extendable telescope pole, and both have signs of corrosion starting to show in addition to the floating handle grip getting full of water. 
30336 After finally figuring out how the charger works, this is a wonderful thing to have. I think the instructions of use need to be a little more clear to purchasers though. Always glad to have extra batteries for my camera though. 
30337 This is a pretty good little remote. Was able to use it from 16 
30338 There are no bells and whistles - just shutter button and a 2 second delay option. Your camera must be set on self timer - the 10 second mode. Easy, 
30339 Decent product BUT they put the name of the company very large on the side. Masione. Written large on the side. Simple google search tells you they make FAKE cameras. Why not put ANYTHING else? Gonna try and sharpie black it out. 
30340 Great product 
30341 Great for the price! 
30342 Fast shipping. Good performance from products 
30343 Great for underwater photos but extremely mediocre for normal use. Flimsy strap provided broke in a week. Takes blurry photos. Disappointed. 
30344 Great product! Good price and fast delivery!!! 
30345 This stand is HORRIBLE!! Took it out box to set it up and literally pieces began to fly everywhere.The center rod disconnected from the base causing it to be un-level. I could go on for days but overall very inexpensive,bad craftsmanship, It s TRUE You Get What You Pay For 
30346 impossible to make it work. 
30347 OKay, range is a little to be desired. Batteries that came with it were dead, thought it was DOA until i switched it out. 
30348 Very well-built 
30349 Good fit for our Sony A6000 with 30mm prime lens :) 
30350 Works great and easy to use/install! Great online help guide too. 
30351 We are enjoying watching our backyard birds with this great pair of binoculars. Finally had to buy new ones after the one pair we had is over 25 years old. Thank you! 
30352 I am very disappointed to say the following; Item came or received not as advertised in the amazon site. Model came was &#34;Incorrect&#34; and different from the picture shown. No item description or Label see on the device itself and looks like fake and not at all a &#34;genuine&#34; product. 
30353 The pictures are great, I kove this camera. 
30354 Unbelievable. I really appreciate this product. High quality! Amazing photo, video and time-lapse! 
30355 perfect, just what I wanted to protect my camera when out and about. 
30356 Great for my purposes 
30357 Equipment looks great, to bad it s worthless. 
30358 It seems to be doing what I bought it for, protecting the lens from dust and fingerprints and etc. 
30359 runs out quick.... 
30360 For my first backdrop stand it was a great buy. Sturdy and come with a carrying case. Great value! 
30361 These batteries are great for on the go and work very well to keep a long charge! 
30362 Given as a gift. 
30363 Great product 
30364 The camera is great and the service is quick. Walter helped me get I back on the app. 
30365 small bag which does the job for a starter 
30366 This light modifier produces lovely directed light. I wish it came with a carrying case. 
30367 The life of these batteries is about 40% of the battery that came with my GoPro. That s an estimate. My GoPro battery lasts about 3 - 4 hours at 1080p / 60 fps. These batteries last about 1.5 - 2 hours each at the same settings. 
30368 The charger worked and the delivery was very good. Happy with purchase. 
30369 Roy 2nd call did the job .as far as camera ,for the money ,excellent and great picture and wireless ,perfect 
30370 Works great 
30371 Package came waaayyyyyy before expectancy date (like 2 weeks early )it was amazing product is gorgeous and fitsss nicceeee 
30372 Great !! 
30373 I purchased this while on vacation so I could get all of my cameras and lenses back home safe. this is an amazing case. I love it 
30374 Perfect day bag for quick trips. I don t like to carry all of my accessories so this works perfectly. Can fit my DSLR body, two lenses inside easily. Outside pocket is great for extra batteries and memory cards. I use the side pockets for my cell phone and money. 
30375 Works ok. The only thing I would recommend to the designers is away to know that a camera is truly straight. Maybe put some markers to know a camera is leveled. 
30376 Great batteries. They save you money as the C123 s are very expensive. I ended up buying an 18650 for 1 of the lights and it worked amazing but it was to big to fit into the other. These will do. 
30377 Everything was as advertised. You could spend more and only get the charger. Here you extra batteries as well. 
30378 ok 
30379 As advertised. Quicker than expected. 
30380 The opteka micro lens does not even fit. They really try to trick into saying this is made for the AX100 this company needs to get its act together. 
30381 Worked for my 77mm Variable ND Filter which had 77mm threads and 82mm opening on front. Good quality. 
30382 Very good for an everyday use of online selling. Be aware that this is only for small items and if you have bigger items to photo-shoot you need to get something bigger. price is excellent. 
30383 love the borders! perfect for a day at disneyland. 
30384 Awesome 
30385 Thank u 
30386 Great Cam for the price! 
30387 I love these camera s, and with the Hero 3+, every change has been a solid improvement. 
30388 got these for hero 4 silver. no problems at all, and the dual charger is super handy! also charges the GoPro battery with no problem 
30389 I have already used this product numerous times. Including on my boat when my camera battery died! I LOVE IT! 
30390 works great...and still working great 
30391 Everything works pretty well. It get what you paid for. But I did not recieve the spare battery in the package. It is included with the picture but I didnt get on in my order. Other than that its not half bad. 
30392 The sound from this little guy is great. Love the bass that comes from it. 
30393 The fix for the battery is a bit loose but, it does the trick for the price. 
30394 Without screw lock on bottom of case, camera will fall out of case.....when opening to shoot? WHY??. 
30395 functions well and looks good. L E D has discontinued to function after a month or so. Will not operate without a battery. 
30396 The best deal in a TTL flash. Complete kit with off camera remote. Everything except batteries included. TTL Zoom flash pairs perfectly with Nikon 5200. If you need a flash but unwilling to spend $300-400 for Nikon branded one, this is what you want. 
30397 Can t fit extended battery. 
30398 I ordered these especially to make colored sleeves to put over my Windows Phone in my purse (so I could find it!). I ordered Aug. 15 and received the cloths on Aug.17. 
30399 Good Batteries for the prices. 
30400 Fit easily and looks good. 
30401 I just received these items yesterday 8/10/2015 and everything seems to be just fine. 
30402 good 
30403 Great underwater shots! 
30404 Ordered in March, stopped working on June...ineligible for return. 
30405 Cheap and effective. Arrived very promptly 
30406 It s strong and smooth. The only minor drawback is it could use a locking mechanism on the horizontal axis. But the friction knob is very adequate when transporting in the wild. 
30407 Excellent product 
30408 Very Good for Great Price 
30409 These work just as good, if not better than the GoPro version. No complaints and you get more for your money. 
30410 I was nervous it wouldn t fit/work. It worked great for my Fuji Fine Pix F850EXR. Very happy. 
30411 Works like a charm. 
30412 love, have a lot to learn best next to top of line cameras lens is built in and a viewfinder. 
30413 I believe it was a combo of 45 plus developing time and problems with it not feeding the 1st or last pic right which left me 6 pics.....bummed was stoked on the idea. 
30414 Great price with great image 
30415 Very comfortable, and very secure. 
30416 perfect for a beginner 
30417 Work great! 
30418 Just what I wanted. 
30419 Resolution, not that good 
30420 works but very flimsy, do not expect to much out of this thing. 
30421 Clear videos....takes a learning curve to have it up and running, but I got through it. Love the &#34;quick&#34; settings so the camera can move faster. Linked it up to my cell so I can see whats going on from my workplace. Either in the home or away...very nice camera... 
30422 Simple case that offers protection but not a lot of bulk. I like the zipper pocket -- I can keep extra memory cards there or just a little cash. 
30423 Good product. 
30424 Just what I needed. Couldn t find the right battery for my camera. Now I m taking pics without having to purchase a new camera. Thanks. 
30425 Not for outdoors. I hate it 
30426 This was the same number battery, but did not fit my Kodak camera. 
30427 Great fun recording waves and surf. Can not wait for the surf to quiet down a little to get some snorkeling done. 
30428 Works to get better looking video using my DSLR Nikon camera 
30429 Quick shipping, just what I needed and works well. 
30430 asdf 
30431 The particulars of this plan seem to suit my needs if I should need to utilize this protection plan. 
30432 water leak about 25ft 
30433 Very good. 
30434 Great quality from DJI as expected. I have purchased knockoffs at a cheaper price and they have all failed. This is by far the better value. 
30435 works for me great product and real peace of mind keeping my go pro safe. Thanks!! 
30436 Very soft and nice just like the vonoto. This one came in the write color. 
30437 Very good and cheap batteries, I am satisfied ! 
30438 Works great and has a good picture. Pretty easy to set up. 
30439 I love this bag, it is now my primary 
30440 Exact fit for my Canon 70D. Easy to apply. Touch screen function still works perfectly. Highly recommended. 
30441 A gift for my father. He loves them. 
30442 The device didn t work 
30443 Perfect for my needs. Very versatile, quite bright. I have three now. I have some vision issues and this is a lifesaver when I m doing fine work 
30444 Fine purchase 
30445 The GoPro stays on perfectly. No issues with that. But if the pole is extended it rotates. To keep it in place I have to have it retracted and hold the silver part of the pole so that the GoPro stays upright. Not satisfied with this product. 
30446 Excelente. 
30447 excellent 
30448 Excellent and they actually float too 
30449 My daughter loves it. 
30450 So glad I bought this replacement. Works great and charges well. 
30451 Great kit, and great value. 
30452 i really like it,,its a little motion senitive but all in all a good little camera 
30453 Did great. Went on vacation 
30454 Rained a couple of days and did not worry it got wet. 
30455 Working great and the longer length is nice too. 
30456 Can t beat it for the price! :) Fully Manual, but works! 
30457 the quality is noticeably worse with these papers zzz quite disappointed. the ones that come with the printer are way better. now i m going to have 100 crappy pictures ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ never again 
30458 Well done, I Like 
30459 very simple plug and play gimbal. very good value. great if you are to scared to but those metal 3D gimbals for twice the money 
30460 Good product, but buy the 6-pack and get the free case from the PolarPro site - better deal and more complete. 
30461 works well. the alarm will continue to sound until you turn it of. The GE model will stop alarming when the trigger is released. 
30462 Excellent case is much bigger than expected. Holds my extra batteries, suction mount, chest and head mounts, and tons of fixture adjustments. Very well padded, perfectly fits standard locks, and the pressure release valve is very useful when travelling across country with altitude changes frequently. Worth every penny. 
30463 Very good camera , the only flaw is the instruction book only in Japanese. 
30464 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
30465 Reverted back to my old Pogoplug because this wasn t working right. 
30466 works ok, sometimes it goes off when no one comes in 
30467 Really good cleaning cloths!! Highly recommend for anything with a screen 
30468 Great! 
30469 Super easy to use ! 
30470 awesome flash for videos 
30471 got this as a gift... but hope to get one for myself soon. 
30472 Works well, I took it snorkeling with my underwater camcorder. The extending and retracting method is a bit difficult and needs getting used to. 
30473 Perfect for rooms. 
30474 Does not work. Trim falling off. 
30475 Shipped quickly and is as advertised. 
30476 Works well with my lamp stand. cord would be a little longer. 
30477 Cheaply made in China. Instructions would have been a big help also! Don t buy it! 
30478 Junk. Did not work - at all. 
30479 Item does not work according to the manual. very poorly made. 
30480 The cables were perfect. Just what we needed. They are a nice quality. 
30481 Very good! 
30482 Work just like the battery that came with the camera. So convenient and charge quickly! 
30483 Original cap for my Lumix camera. Fits perfectly. 
30484 very good 
30485 Very well made Product. 
30486 This set is awesome.It is very durable and easy to use, It keeps your go pro in place so you dont have to worry about it getting damaged or falling while in use.I recommend this to everyone to use! 
30487 pretty impressive little gizmo. Everyone in my office wants one. The phone app is also great. All I do is touch the app on my phone and I can see my living room. 
30488 Mobile phone tripod attachment. Works perfectly well. 
30489 It s not professional quality, but for $24.99 you can t really complain. 
30490 Works great! 
30491 It was what I wanted at an affordable price 
30492 perfect 
30493 Fast ship! Very well-designed bag at a reasonable price. 
30494 Nice cameras easy to install excellent picture quality 
30495 Just what we needed 
30496 It worked for me for a year and then my cmaera would not recognize it any more. Next time I will purchase a Canon grip. 
30497 Definition of image is not very good even with adjustments allowed by the program. But what could you expect for the price. Would be nice to add a mirror to be able to see at angle i tight space. Probably could pay twice as much and get a better image. 
30498 One of the Camera s don t work and the hard drive doesn t record. One of the holder for the camera is strip. They haven t responded back to my request for a new camera and hard drive.. 
30499 I couldn t find a better price, and their quick shipping to Hawaii is second to none. Product is as described. The precut slots are perfect for my GoPro and accessories. My only regret is not getting the large sized since I ended up buying more accessories. 
30500 excellent product and fast delivery 
30501 surprised with how solidly its built. provides extra utility as a baton, if needed. 
30502 Works well 
30503 Works great with my Honeywell vista 20p panel. I picked it specifically because CDMA coverage in my area outperforms GSM by far. Telguard interactive is also a great feature. Very happy with the product. Long time Telular customer back to SXT1 
30504 It s ok 
30505 Works great! 
30506 WORKS WELL. 
30507 Good 
30508 nice product i ever used. just go for it 
30509 Love it 
30510 This did not work as expected. 
30511 Works wonderful for all of my lens. I like the hook on them for security and also so I can hook them onto whatever bag or case I am using for easy access! 
30512 Great lens, check out some photos I took with it on my instagram @jonathinadams 
30513 Does the job it was made for. Thank You 
30514 Worked perfectly! 
30515 POJ! Make pics blurry. They make magnifiy 2x but its not worth it when every pics comes out blurry. Returning. 
30516 Camera is good but battery life is low. It drain out fast. Need more power full battery. 
30517 good 
30518 The mechanism seems to be doing fine, but the programming of the system is terrible. Need to make some major improvements. 
30519 This kit comes with everything you would need. The quality is excellent 
30520 Great flash best ever 
30521 Thank you ! 
30522 Great camera, underwater pics turned out awesome! 
30523 Great 
30524 Excellent product! 
30525 Not much to say here, good quality cloths for a pretty good price. Gave me enough to keep one near each of my primary devices, the little phone wipe is neat but overall just kind of gimmicky. I feel like it will lose it s sticky properties in short order. 
30526 This product worked for 1 week, then it wouldn t recharge. My opinion spend a little more money and buy a more expensive one. 
30527 Everything went smooth. 
30528 It s not what I expected you need to remove the whole front cover in order to take pictures 
30529 Poor / little instructions on use i cant figure out how to cycle through all cameras on full screen not switch from 1 to a 3 view. 
30530 Still learning to use, good starter kit in my opinion. 
30531 I like it a lot... My first ring light and so far is good... 
30532 Good product, bit of a fiddle to apply, but then they all are. Customer support from them is excellent. 
30533 Cheap, easy to use, small enough to fit in just about any pocket of my pack. Lasts as long as the GoPro branded stuff. 
30534 I bought it as a portable container for my GoPro and various accessories. It works, but despite the flexible sections inside it really isn t ideal for it. I do like it, and it seems to be holding up well. 
30535 Better than I had hoped for an aftermarket product. Fits perfectly and snugly to boot. Well worth it. 
30536 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
30537 The acessories not very goos, the camera is amazing, but the quality of the acessories not the same. 
30538 Loved the look and feel. Sadly it fell off after some time never to be seen again. 
30539 Works like a charm! ✔️ stabilization is quick and easy! :) 
30540 Works well as advertised in my Sony A6000. 
30541 Good 
30542 DVR is junk and not usable from web even internally. Received and returned to replace 3 broken cams. Should have sent the whole system back but I had already ran the cables throughout walls. I m now replacing it with blue iris and WiFi cameras 
30543 Awesome juice when you need it. 
30544 It works great thanks 
30545 wish it came with an owners manual like my other one. 
30546 First lens I got for a beginner camera. Works great. 
30547 this thing is better than a gopro picture good but the video is awsome 
30548 Great thanks!! 
30549 Came very quickly and works great! They don t make this camera anymore, and mine got a crack on the battery casing, so I was happy to find a good used one on amazon. VERY SATISFIED! 
30550 Very Good 
30551 Great pictures 
30552 Exactly as advertised. Good camera, accessories were not premium quality, but I knew that going in. This was a great value for me. I m using it to take vacation and family pictures and hobby photos. 
30553 It is good battery 
30554 Came in as expected! 
30555 i need help with this how do i use this i cant find out[[ASIN:B00M7RROU8 8GB Mini HD Glasses Spy Hidden Camera Sunglasses Eyewear DVR Video Recorder Cam]] 
30556 It arrived on time. Everything was as advertized. 
30557 Perfect for my Sony RX1003. Snug fit, looks good. Priced right. 
30558 Fits perfectly and gives piece of mind. Like some other reviewers I had the issue fitting the installed guard in my hardshell backpack, but after a little careful cutting of the pack s foam w/ a sharp knife, the guard slides right in, secured w/ the zip ties. 
30559 My Swann video security system came with four cameras with the DVR able to support eight. I purchased two more cameras and needed the additional power supply. This unit powered up the new cameras just fine and has been working fine for several months so far... 
30560 Excellent for holding multiple flash units 
30561 This lens hood fits perfectly on my 75mm f1.8 lens. I have not seen the Olympus equivalent, but this lens hood is well built and works as expected. 
30562 Dead right out of the box. My dogs were roaming the neighborhood until I could find a decent replacement. 
30563 as described 
30564 Nice backdrop. 
30565 Great 
30566 This strap makes carrying a camera very simple without pulling on the neck or being uncomfortable. I would recommend to anyone. 
30567 Good build quality, but did not fit my Canon EF 24-70mm 4.0 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
30568 guuud 
30569 Good quality 
30570 I wish that I had this from the start. Now I have my 18-55 and 55-300 that are useless to me. This does it all and yes it is very well constructed. Nice Job. 
30571 Great Product, it is a better back pack than the actual DJI back pack. 
30572 Did not work! 
30573 Does not connect to wifi no matter how hard you try, had to return product 
30574 This item arrived promptly. Unfortunately the white reflector was marked with purple throughout. Whereas, I have done a lot of positive business with Fotodiox in the past, I am willing to upgrade my opinion of this product once it has been replaced. 
30575 Every bit as cute as shown. 
30576 Extremely helpful!
