22753 0 Cheap, the plastic inside that holds the ink so when you turn it it ll come out - came broke. So I cant even use it as a pen. The camera points way high so it doesnt even work if you have it in your shirt pocket. 
22754 3 Great product. Did what I needed it to do. Just wish the cameras would adjust the zoom. There to close 
22755 4 very very cool!!! 
22756 2 Flys and takes video great, but you cant take it over 500 ft. The older ones you could take well over 1k feet. 
22757 4 My favorite mount now, can be angled just about any direction you will need. Quality is good. 
22758 0 So disappointed. The pictures weren t high quality. And it was so smart, but I couldn t figure out how to sync everything. I quickly gave up and went back to using my phone for everything. 
22759 4 Lens works great! For its price it s definitely worth the money. 
22760 2 Good price. I wouldn t check it on an airline but it s good for taking the drone places. 
22761 3 Its hard to find anything when not on the plate but overall a great little scope. 
22762 4 Very nice basic lens hood 
22763 4 This is the second one of these we bought. Gave our &#34;pro-sumer&#34; camera much better audio capability. Beware! The 1/8th inch audio in is mono. Using this unit you can input two XLR lines into a camera with only 1/8th in stereo input. And you can balance them during operation. 
22764 4 It is awesome! I love this camera! I use it all the time! 
22765 4 It s a go light product. The name and product speaks for itself self 
22766 1 To short creeps down the lens. Needs a rubber type material on inside to grip lens barrel so it will stay put. It is built good but doesn t stay on. 
22767 4 Henry was very helpful. he not only fixed my issue buy did resolve some issues i was having on my pc aswell. very knowledgeable on the product, very happy with company. thanks Henry 
22768 4 Great camera. Great price. 
22769 0 Lights are ok. But the rest of the kit is complete garbage. You get less than what you pay for, you re better off investing in a higher quality built light tent than this kit. 
22770 4 Very happy with my camera package! The only thing that bummed me was i received the case with the zipper jumped off track and doesn t close in the corners. But that s why the front clips are great! VERY happy. 
22771 3 After losing lens cap I now know the importance of using one, the lens cap fits perfectly. The sticky thing is supposed to stick to the cap - good luck with that. 
22772 0 Very flimsy and not supportive 
22773 0 Poor quality video .Hard to load onto computer. 
22774 4 Bought for my sisters birthday/moving away present! She loves it! 
22775 4 Love it! It is sturdy enough for a phone. If extended, fully, i would just take care not to bump it. It is light weight aluminum. Still...a great product, for the price. 
22776 4 Great buy it looks and feels original and fits my lens perfectly this is a 67mm lens cap I use for my 18-140 nikon lens. 
22777 4 Very handy to have without carrying extra pieces of equipment. 
22778 4 Awesome product. i always get great quality when i buy Tiffen 
22779 4 Very nice as a camera bag and room for a wallet. 
22780 4 Works great!!! 
22781 4 Fit perfectly! 
22782 0 does nothing it says it does 
22783 4 Ok 
22784 4 Works as expected 
22785 4 This package has so many stuff that there are so some accessories that I don t even know what they re for. 
22786 4 Great product at such a discounted price. Fits snug around my GoPro 4 Black Edition and still provides easy access to ports & SD card. 
22787 4 Excellent value! 
22788 4 I Love this camera. It works so nice. This camera video quality amazing. It is perfect camera for video. 
22789 3 Awesome value for the money. Light, sturdy enough for basic photography. 
22790 3 Setup was easy (once the wires were run). Great resolution for this price point and the Android app is pretty good. Only negative is that the mouse that came with the DVR requires a lot of force to click the buttons. 
22791 4 Very comfortable and looks great too! 
22792 4 Great! Works well and will come in handy for so many situations. 
22793 4 Had one before - lost it and thought enough of the performance and fun to buy a replacement of the same product 
22794 4 Great product 
22795 4 Works perfectly in my video camera. 
22796 4 They work great. Cons: Not enough range for my application, but they work well. They Need to come with power adapters, they use a LOT of batteries. 
22797 3 included battery lasted about 3 hours, functions ok with new $7 battery 
22798 4 Works Great for making porno s 
22799 4 These fit perfectly, went on easily.. I don t know how well they hold up, but unless they re a total disaster, they re a great buy. 
22800 3 Works well for CCTV cams 
22801 4 came home from outing and the package(CAMERA)was sitting outside my door!it was worth the wait. Mahalo for your persistence and tenacity! mahalo nui loa!!!! rty. 
22802 4 Works great on Canon lenses. The attachment string is also long enough for a zoom lens mounted on the caner. 
22803 4 I Love my Nikon 810 camera. Clear images..and can handle dark areas with high ISO. I am a photographer and use it everyday. 
22804 0 Do not buy this item. Did not work as described or at all, in fact. 
22805 4 Works how it should, high quality! 
22806 4 Literally perfect 
22807 4 Good 
22808 4 The Phantom 3 is awesome! Check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW509QAZH6o&feature=youtu.be 
22809 4 Good! Easy installation and setup, reasonable price, nice pix. 
22810 4 i wouldn t trust the reviews of an amazon purchase for a 3K camera, but i love it. 
22811 1 should have bought OEM unit - name brand...you get what you pay for - if you only look at price then its a good unit 
22812 4 great products. Thanks 
22813 4 Fits perfect 
22814 3 The product arrived on schedule, charged in my Canon charger, fits the camera and appears to be as advertised. I will be using it to have a second battery during an upcoming vacation. 
22815 4 lots of fun ways to use GoPro 
22816 4 Fits perfectfly with the GoPro Hero 4 Black. 
22817 4 Fits well, does what it s supposed to do. 
22818 4 Better Than Expected 
22819 4 Very good 
22820 4 camera will not hold a charge but the film paper is fine 
22821 3 cool camera. only thing is doesn t come with film. you have to buy it separately 
22822 3 okay material, but good for the price. 
22823 0 82-77mm step down adapter does not fit the Tamron 70-200 f/2.8 which is 77mm. 
22824 4 These cloths are just what I was looking for. They are not thin cloths, there s weight to them. I love how large they are especially when cleaning my eyeglasses. I highly recommend these. 
22825 4 For the price, a pretty good camera. Surprisingly good night vision for single IR led. 
22826 4 Great. Arrived as promisef 
22827 3 I m not going to lie, i was disappointed that the Blue wasn t like the picture! It s a lot darker but haven t had the pleasure in really using the Tripod but so far it seems really sturdy 
22828 4 This is a pretty great little product here! It is strong and sturdy. I use it with a canon rebel and it works perfectly. 
22829 4 Nice fit, slim profile 
22830 4 its perfect, super cute and fits camera nicely, it will surely protect it 
22831 2 Need to know how to really work it.... 
22832 3 Pretty well, is what I wanted. Fits perfect in my manfrotto shoulder brace. The chapest and confidence image stabilizer ever 
22833 4 its better than original canon 
22834 0 Could not get it to work. 
22835 4 Vincent was an expert at getting my cameras to show on my phones. He took the time to explain everything perfectly! Thank you! 
22836 4 This is made very well, and has a quick set up design that is extremely secure... 
22837 4 Love this tripod. Purchased it to use with my Nikon Camera and Im very content with it. 
22838 4 eyepiece set is good.. need to add a barlow and some other parts in the case. 
22839 4 Love this camera. It s great for someone like me who needs to rely on the autofocus feature. The zoom is powerful and takes clear shots. 
22840 4 They work fine. Very happy with them 
22841 1 Lags & it sucks. 
22842 4 I bought this kit for my daughter s Nikon D50 camera. It worked perfectly while she was a way at Photography camp and every time since. 
22843 0 Waste of money. Will fall off at the slightest movement. Should have purchased the Nikon hood. 
22844 4 It works for my use, not as a piece of camera parts. 
22845 4 Great quality product. 
22846 0 Too short of a chord. REturned 
22847 2 mediocore 
22848 4 Everything fits perfect, no complaints. 
22849 4 Great camera, FOSCAM remote installer, Walter took care of business right away. The whole set up was about 5 minutes. 
22850 4 worked perfectly 
22851 3 I think this kit is very good. Has most options that you would use though I tend to use the 18-140mm most of all. I have changed the filters to the better but the one provided are reasonable. 
22852 4 just as described. 
22853 4 Sturdy, no issues and has all pieces to easily use with your GoPro. Love it! 
22854 4 Bought to store my ultra light fishing reels. Works just fine as I expected, no more worries when traveling. 
22855 4 Love it!!! I also love that it comes with a strap 
22856 4 Effective. Work great. 
22857 4 I ve used these for years. Best generic battery out there 
22858 3 easy to use 
22859 4 Works as described. Great value. 
22860 4 I love it 
22861 4 small but works well 
22862 4 I am SHOCKED at how well thay work for the money! I have a old canon rebel that gets no respect and they did a great job on a filthy sensor. 
22863 4 good capacity, good delivery 
22864 3 works well 
22865 4 Works great 
22866 4 Excelent product! 
22867 3 Does what it s suppose to do... Wish it was easier to install and uninstall without using tools.. but not bad. 
22868 4 I love this battery!! Easy to understand what s going on, holds charge well, and charges my full size Asus ultrabook to about 100% once with a full charge - all I need. So far, it never got uncomfortably warm either. Now I *never* have to stop working! Oh, wait... 
22869 4 Great selection for my camera! 
22870 4 Awesome batteries. I get over 5 hours of recording time on my Canon Vixia HF M41 with one battery. The car charger is a great addition to my kit. Probably a dozen cycles on one of the batteries so far and I m getting full charges quickly. Great package. 
22871 4 Everything works well. 
22872 4 Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites! 
22873 4 Much sturdy than the plastic one I had before. Three level adjusting legs can make it very tall. I haven t figure out how to use the reverse function. But it fits all my needs now. I m happy with it. 
22874 2 Good price to scare off thief who try to break into your house. 
22875 4 Just perfect! 
22876 4 This camera is so cute and so good! 
22877 4 Perfect condition. 
22878 4 Got the camera to keep tabs on the animals while we re out and it works fantastic. It was very easy to set up on my Android phone and the video quality is very good. 
22879 3 Great value for the price. Purchased as a gift so wanted to load some photos onto product before giving. Found the remote a little unresponsive at times. Picture quality and display vary depending on quality of original data loaded onto frame. 
22880 1 Well almost everything is good, it just the 4 spliter adaptor is not working only if i bend it , i don t know why. Thanks 
22881 4 I bought this career to remote control my dog when I m not at home. It works perfectly. easy to apply and the quality of pics are great!! highly recommend!! 
22882 4 these are great for the buck 
22883 2 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
22884 3 great 
22885 4 Can be a little hard to view the screen in bright sunlight even when screen is set to its brightest.. 
22886 4 So many options! Going to take some time to learn to use it. 
22887 4 Exactly as advertised!!! Quick shipment+++ 
22888 3 Love this bag! 
22889 4 Great product! I have it on my front porch and I have the base hooked up about 100ft away in my shop. Yes, there is the occasional false alarm, but not often. Has lasted 2 winters and 2 summers in the South. 
22890 4 Good 
22891 4 Love it! 
22892 4 terrific 
22893 4 Great price and product arrive perfectly. 
22894 3 The sound isn t the best 
22895 1 It doesn t work for canon, i didn t realize. Trigger should do its job when it s not attached to the camera, but it doesn t. I guess it works for nikon though. 
22896 4 Great product! Used it for a trip to Costa Rica and it was awesome. I d definitely recommend this product and seller :) 
22897 0 does not work. Can only get red light after 4 hours of charging and inserting an sd mini card. Could not do any recording and computer does not recognize the glasses as the instruction say. 
22898 4 I attached it on my Dicapac WP-ONE Point & Shoot Digital Camera Waterproof Case with Canon powershot S95. It was perfect for snorkeling. I love it! 
22899 0 Had to return it. I bough it for my wedding and all the images came blurry. The quality is appalling. 
22900 4 It works flawless without network drops. Excellent video Quality 
22901 4 Cannot be beat for the price. 
22902 4 I purchased these for my iPad, but can use them for so many things! 
22903 4 Connected it with my dvr, it has sharp image at day and at night. Good experience. 
22904 1 After 1 and a half year of use, 5 cameras dont work anymore. They were profesionally wired and indoors. 
22905 0 Not original 
22906 4 Being able to handle a picture to each person really made the photo booth a success 
22907 4 Very good 
22908 4 works fine 
22909 4 Perfect sized bag and cush enough for my Nikon D3300 and extras 
22910 4 Excellent..... and very prompt devilery 
22911 4 This is awesome. I wanted to be able to take pictures while in New York without having to hand my several hundred dollar camera to a pickpocket or thief. This allowed me to take pictures and remember my trip without having to bring someone else or have my camera stolen. 
22912 4 Perfect 
22913 0 Used once and it cant charge anymore.....became trash.. sigh... 
22914 4 great condition , very clear optics 
22915 4 I left this case on the back of my truck and when I drove off it fell off onto the highway. It got run over and I went back to check it out and he case did its job. My gopro is perfectly fine 
22916 4 I now always have a spare. Reasonable price. 
22917 4 Perfect and just what I needed for my camera!!! 
22918 3 Thank you, very happy with the management of purchase - sale. 
22919 4 i have worn this pin to work once a week for the past year & I wash it in the laundry. It hasn t lost its color & is still as cute as ever. Highly recommend! 
22920 0 This camera takes a few pictures and then the lens gets stuck and says lens error, no wonder it was so cheap! 
22921 4 Battery works fine. I use it as a back up and have not tested the battery life. 
22922 4 Fit GPS, seems to work properly. 
22923 4 Perfect item worx great THNX 
22924 4 Works great, all my fd lens work well with it so far 
22925 4 I love this flash, helps me take great pics! 
22926 3 Smart Majic in Photo and Video Technology 
22927 4 Great film! 
22928 4 Item delivered on time and as described. 
22929 4 The pack rocks, I have purchased 2 more and- 2- 360 light units at 72 years old I no longer have a desire to carry heavy light sets and stands. Everything goes into one rolling case stands,lights,boxes, brellas,etc cables, and packs. everything I need 
22930 3 Looks real enough, but the batteries on the larger cameras wear out quickly! 
22931 3 I first received the wrong product, was completely disappointed. Immediately, returned it. Received the correct product quickly (in time for my trip) and am VERY happy. Great quality bag! It is awesome for what I need! 
22932 4 Awesome little cloths! got the for my touch screen laptop to remove finger prints and it works great! started using one for my phone too and it keeps it looking clean 
22933 4 Works straight out of the box with both my Canon 430EX II and Vivitar s 285V s. 
22934 3 Pretty decent close up lens and exceptional value. I find it works best by selecting one of the three parts, maybe two, but haven t found a need for all 3 in combination yet, if that s even possible. 
22935 4 Love love love this tripod. It s light and still sturdy. I use this almost every day. I have a Droid Turbo and it holds it nicely and the remote works perfectly with it. I highly recommend this product. 
22936 4 Worked perfect it was great using my camera again after so long 
22937 4 If it had the Wi-Fi camera and longer lasting batteries, I would consider it perfect. 
22938 0 I was missing the bolt for the micro macro lens could not fit the adapter on 
22939 3 works good 
22940 2 The Table Top shooting cube is fine but the four backgrounds were folded into 6&#34; squares that are difficult to impossible to get rid of the folds. The really should roll them up. 
22941 4 Like others, my only complaint is that you could place the battery in backwards. Not sure if that s an issue, the charger might have reverse polarity protection? Batteries work well, charger works well. 
22942 4 Cute :) 
22943 4 Exceeded my expectations. I ve been using everything for several months and.no problems. Glad I saved money and didn t buy the gopro kits for 3x the price. 
22944 4 Great replacement charger. Works fine and does a fine job. 
22945 4 Works well and solidly built. 
22946 4 Henry :did an outstanding job helping me set up my F19821W camera for both wireless operation & remote access. I am very pleased with the customer service and the camera. 
22947 4 Great alternative to the comparable Nikon lens for a fraction of the cost. It s a bit noisy, but that doesn t bother me. 
22948 0 dvr does not give signal to LG monitor. cable is good.but does not operate. when turn on zmodo logo appear that says loading, then turn black with wording no signal., cannot get help from support. 
22949 4 Worked exactly how it is suppose to. I was kind of scared because of such a low price, but it worked like a charm! 
22950 0 Film wasn t developing properly or not at all. Film may have been too old. 
22951 4 I hope my gopro never falls off in the ocean, but at least I now know it ll be up on the surface when I go looking for it. 
22952 4 A+ 
22953 4 Does what it says on the box 
22954 4 Works great 
22955 4 Excellent product! provides great visibility while protecting copter from noob damage. Installation tip, lay thick towel on flat service and flip copter without props. This will keep all your motors in alignment. 
22956 3 The back protector works great however the top screen protector does not fit perfect since it is flat and the screen on the camera is a little rounded. 
22957 3 Gets the job done without any hastle. I love being able to use my gopro on a tripod. 
22958 3 It charges the batteries fine, but have not used the camera enough to need extra batteries yet. 
22959 4 Absolutely what I wanted! 
22960 4 nice compact camera with hight Mega pixels 
22961 4 Met my needs and expectations and the price was really good. 
22962 4 Camera is fantastic and the package was a great deal. Recommend! 
22963 4 Great 
22964 4 Great camera for summer fun! Works well underwater and outdoors. Very durable. ..it has survived many water slides and works perfectly (even after being dropped a few times by my child). 
22965 4 The little camera that could! Great, crisp picture. The only downside is the talking feature. It is so quiet my dogs can barely hear me when I talk through it! 
22966 4 It does what it s supposed to do. Installed on Nikon D750. 
22967 3 Pictures are not big enough, I bought the 300 wide two weeks later 
22968 4 Great camera, consistent 
22969 3 Good 
22970 1 Very blurry and slow. 
22971 4 The perfect flash backup. I shoot Nikon and use a Nikon SB-910. I needed more flash units for off camera use and this product works great with my Nikon system. Will most likely order more so I have plenty. 
22972 4 works very well. shipped quick and I am very pleased with the quality and construction. 
22973 3 Not as easy to program as hope. 
22974 4 These are just wonderful. With the border s finish, they don t leave any lints hanging. The simili-suede just grabs dust and lint and doesn t smear like tome cheaper cloths. Great value that I highly recommend. 
22975 4 Quality Nikon product at a good price 
22976 4 More than I expected. Thanks 
22977 4 The camera was all that was advertised. Took me a bit to figure out all the gadgets that came with it, but I did. Camera takes very high quality photos. I am very pleased with my purchase. 
22978 4 Great item, great price, quick delivery. 
22979 4 Lost my original one so this one will fasten on to the strap., 
22980 4 works perfect. battery charge status shows up. 
22981 4 great 
22982 4 Works great has a great range 
22983 4 Excellent product. Thanks! 
22984 4 works as advertised good customer support. 
22985 1 Can t usually get it to stay straight so the flash actually hits the softbox correctly. 
22986 4 great fit and finish, no complaints here 
22987 4 It meets my needs 
22988 4 I just got into the hobby, and didn t want to spend a lot of money on eyepiece s just yet. This was the right upgrade for me! 
22989 4 I purchased these cleaning cloths based on previous reviews and I do not regret! Great quality and good value! 
22990 3 It s okay, but not in love with GoPro style mounts in general. 
22991 4 Just received the camera. Took just a couple of pictures and I am very pleased. At first I found it a little hard to center the pictures but I think I am getting the hang of it now. Bonnie 
22992 4 It s great.. and I m sure that it s amazing. Thank you for getting it here on time. See you guys soon. 
22993 4 Purchased the RFN-4s for my Nikon D800 fitting was easy to fit and worked straight from the box. Would thoroughly recommend this product. 
22994 2 FOR THE PRICE NOT BAD !! 
22995 4 Yes, I like this camera, its perfect for my real estate work. Good quality, and my 2nd Coolpix. 
22996 4 Have had the camera for 1 week and am amazed at the quality of the images. Have hand held low light images at 720mm equivalent and gotten clear sharp images, wow! Other low light images have been equally impressive. I suspect that I will never use the flash. 
22997 3 Great lens 
22998 3 This is my favorite 2x3 instant camera, only surpassed by the Fuji Instax 300 for the picture size. 
22999 4 Shipped fast and item works as stated. I like the compact design. Easy to fold up and carry along for a shoot. 
23000 0 I never got the darn thing to work. I didn t return it either because it was cheaply priced and not worth the hassle. 
23001 4 Wonderful cleaning cloths. Great company. Would buy again. 
23002 4 Very good product and good picture quality 
23003 0 One of the batteries came with defect and it doesn t hold the charge... 
23004 4 Came in on time. Was able to charge the camera before going see the baby thanks. 
23005 1 The tripod itself was great but the quick release came broken I can t put the plate back on. Now I have to by a whole new ball head. The price to ship it back is just to much hassle. 
23006 0 Not good 
23007 4 Great entry level camera. Decent quality. I love having it for off-road and rally cross races. I wish the battery life was a little better, but since it can record while charging, I just leave it hooked up in the car. 
23008 4 great product thank you 
23009 3 Little bit of a tight fit, also don t try to remove it from the case its very hard to get back in. The case fits my Hero 4 Silver great but the rubber with most 3rd party cases is thicker and harder to close. But overall great. 
23010 4 Pelican quality always. Sold on quality and long lasting. We use about 20 cases with our equipt. 
23011 4 Fits like a charm. Exactly what I needed when mine fell off my Canon XSi. 
23012 4 Worked great on my camera very happy 
23013 3 Great novelty gift. Don t expect clear digital quality pics however. Fun camera to take to parties and gatherings. 
23014 4 Very nice price. 
23015 4 Great product...most others have a short range, but I have tried this one at 140 feet and it still works! 
23016 4 Good 
23017 2 Fits well and works with the metering system (aperture priority) of the camera. However, I don t understand why the camera (Fuji) side is plastic and the lens side metal. Other adapters have metal on both sides. Can t they match metal to Fuli X mounts? Curious. 
23018 4 Zmodo makes the best camera system on the market for the money. I ve had several of these models for many years. 
23019 2 Good for the price. However you can t see pictures outside because of the sun glare on the screen. 
23020 3 the flash is not Polaroid as in the picture, the filters lens aren t filters, just 4 diferent close-up lens.. everything else was cool.. 
23021 4 Great 
23022 4 Was a replacement for one that stopped working. 
23023 3 seems to work fine...a little tight fitting 
23024 2 Did not work but it may be a problem with laptop and not the charger purchased. Have not determined yet. Arrived fine and no problem with transaction though 
23025 4 Worked great 
23026 2 I m not sure the one I got is a Watson. It doesn t say Watson anywhere and just looks like a cheap fuji ripoff. It seems to work okay and fit for now. 
23027 4 good yes!!!!!!!!!! 
23028 4 A very nice, very functional, full featured camera, in a compact package. A keeper! 
23029 2 It works great to activate shutter and video record but their is no option to adjust shutter, iso or aperture so you still have to touch your camera even when you have this remote. I wish it had all the functionalists. 
23030 1 Decent cams. Very easy to install. Had to return, one s night vision stopped working after 2.5 wks. You can only view day time. 
23031 0 Not working @ all..not even 30 days & now I have 2 return it. 
23032 4 Works great! 
23033 3 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
23034 4 The Vivitar Dual Action Lightning and Motion is a great devise for shooting lightning during the night. Needs some practice to figure out the sensitivity adjustments. Thanks Amazon for your awesome service and promptitiude as well as you did many times for me. 
23035 4 Ordered extra batteries for my new camera. Arrived quickly and work perfect. Thank you. 
23036 4 good 
23037 4 Does what it s made for 
23038 4 You get whet you pay for, so this works fine at this price. 
23039 3 Finally I can store all my camera stuff in one place!! this is a very nice bag with lots of room for my &#34;stuff&#34;, and it arranges nicely with compartment dividers that are movable. 
23040 4 Fun for a party. Film was fresh and easy to use. Great picture quality. 
23041 4 The Rokinon Cine Series are a great value. Perfect for the low to mid-budget filmmaker. 
23042 3 The first picture got stuck and ruined in both cartridges. 
23043 4 Great product & service 
23044 4 Description matched product. Was a perfect fit for our overhead projector. 
23045 0 Not the item pictured! This is a single pocket wizard for Einstein mono lights only. I should have read the description. 
23046 4 This is the best camera I ever owned. Makes you wonder why hauling a massive camera makes any sense. Seems stupid now that I have this one. Let s see the death of massive SLR cameras! 
23047 1 you get what you pay... 
23048 4 I absolutely love this quadcopter. My main use for it is photography and the turtle mode allows for slow and predictable movement. 
23049 0 One sided, off centered. Not as described. There are many other sellers selling much better straps for the same price 
23050 2 not for dslrs rigged or with heavy lenses, may need some fiddling or twiking to make it reliable ! 
23051 4 Like it and recommend for those who doesn t have a studio flashes 
23052 4 Great Camera. I have given up on my big DSLR cameras. I make big 16X20 or 16X24 inch prints and they are great. 
23053 3 Love this viewfinder, just wish it worked with my new GH4. 
23054 4 Works great with Pisector GS08 console. I lost my original one and was able to connect this one to my system in a matter of minutes. Pisector customer service is always really responsive and helpful if you have questions about compatibility with their systems, sensors, remotes, etc. 
23055 0 Complete Garbage 
23056 0 Terrible camera shaky video grainy I bought two and I m sorry threw away the boxes or I would have sent them back not even close to my go pro 
23057 4 one battery has lasted for a few months already in my dog s bark collar, with no sign of slowing down yet 
23058 4 I like the quality of this tripod. Not plastic like other moderately priced tripods. I especially like the ease of adjustments and love that it can be close to ground level as I enjoy photographing snowflakes. 
23059 4 Needed storage for my memory and I have always liked this memory holder. 
23060 4 very good 
23061 4 I m so pleased with the product and the speedily delivery! Great doing business with, I highly recommend! 
23062 4 Very user friendly. Excellent color. Like it much better than my canon. 
23063 0 not usefull 
23064 4 This product is excellent value I am very pleased with it. There are lots of pieces in this kit including several cloths, lens cleaning fluid and tissue, a blower and brushes. Did a nice job cleaning my camera lenses and filters. Best value hands down. 
23065 0 It fit in the charger but would not power up my camera. 
23066 2 It s nice quality but I thought it was a longer pole. I should of paid better attention when I ordered it. 
23067 2 Just what we wanted. 
23068 4 great product and have bought again based on good performance 
23069 0 Terrible Product. Not stable at all. 
23070 4 good 
23071 4 Excellent product 
23072 4 I read lots of reviews before ordering this. I hooked it up and took some shots at home right away and it worked great, comes in a nice carrying case also. Will work great for catch light. 
23073 4 Great viewing and quality for the price. Very happy with the binoculars! Use it for the horse track and watching birds. 
23074 4 Works great. Even fits over my life jacket when I used it on the water 
23075 4 Worked as advertised. Took the scare away from those snorkeling trips over deep reefs where I previously worried about losing my $400 camera. Also got some cool video in a lake by letting it float upside down by itself and get visits from the resident fish. 
23076 3 GREAT CAMERA! 
23077 4 Just what I needed! 
23078 4 one of the best gadget so far! thank you for your great customer service! appreciate it 
23079 4 Love this! 
23080 4 Awesome product my nephew absolutely loves it! Excellent value and high quality made. 
23081 4 Good lens 
23082 0 Doesn t work with Applie PC 
23083 3 The product good value for money. Although it needs a faster net connection, it works average on standard speed. Image quality fair Motion detection alarm a bit complex to set. 
23084 4 Love this case keep all my essential accessories in one place and super portable very strong 
23085 4 worked great with D3200, allows you to set interval and or duration. 
23086 4 They re microfiber cloths, what s there to review? 
23087 4 These are fantastic. I ve used other microfiber screen cleaning cloths before, but these are amazingly better. 
23088 4 I love it. 
23089 0 Used this flash for one shoot--then it died. Was hoping for more out of this product. Usually I don t have issues with this brand. 
23090 4 It was great 
23091 4 Great picture quality with this lens. 
23092 3 The product was received in very good time, I think it was a day early. Packaging was very appropriate and no complaints about the product as it was exactly as expected. 
23093 4 Perfect to fix stripped tripod mount 
23094 4 Excellent product!!! AAA fast delivery! 
23095 4 Everything was perfect! 
23096 4 Everything I expected it to be! 
23097 4 Excellent lens, 5 years warranty, great for my Nikon cameras. 
23098 4 KAZA filters are excellent choices and have a great price. I look forward to using this filter on my Canon lens. 
23099 4 Très bon 
23100 4 This is exactly what I needed for a camera that was given to me. I can now use this excellent camera because I now have the right charger. 
23101 4 Great deal! 
23102 4 the camera is great shot so fast unlike eny other camera at that price, the bundel is a real added valeu, thogh it wood be nice if there are 2 extra battery because the camera consume the energy quite fast 
23103 3 Did the trick ..fixed our lens with the help of youtube and a fraction of the cost of taking it in. 
23104 3 I ve taken some great shots with this, couldn t be happier. 
23105 4 This is a perfect travel lens. It has a very large range, but is relatively light weight. 
23106 4 Certainly worth the money, I recommend it! 
23107 4 I use this a a portable Chromakey system and it works great. With two people, it s easy to lean against the wall. With a little practice, folding goes smoothly. 
23108 3 Very nice. Might buy another one. Very quick and easy set up. Added a nice soft light to photos. 
23109 4 It was nice 
23110 3 Nice group of accessories, don t know if I will use them all, but it will be cheaper in the end than purchasing separately. 
23111 4 Used this (in my fanny pack) my whole 2 week Disney stay and it was nice and compact and light but hard enough that I knew my camera was safe. 
23112 4 For $20, this microphone is phenomenal. I can play ukulele while recording my own voice and even sound distribution is given to both. 
23113 4 Perfect for street photography and to take on vacations. I didn t use any of my other lenses on my last trip to NYC. Very lightweight and portable, it doesn t draw any attention. Silent and fast focus. Very pleased. 
23114 4 Once I learned to use it I love it. 
23115 4 Price and quality were both excellent. 
23116 4 Perfect flash, never failed and doesn t cost an arm and leg like the other named branded flashes 
23117 4 Works Great 
23118 4 great battery 
23119 4 Haven t used this a ton but it seems really good quality and it is nice that the whole camera holding assembly moves on the strap 
23120 4 Very good 
23121 4 Held battery life to expectation, isn t too heavy, does the job. It ll do. 
23122 4 Match the body of my camera! 
23123 2 No RGB values for color squares. No PDF of manual. 
23124 4 I toss it into my backpack every time I go hiking and never have to worry about my filters getting scratched or lost. 
23125 4 Good, inexpensive! 
23126 4 It works as advertised 
23127 1 Dropped connection, can t get it back 
23128 4 Great price, fit s my Manfrotto Heads perfectly. 
23129 2 Background is very thin, so keep that in mind. 
23130 4 Nice and durable 
23131 4 Works perfectly. Great picture transmission. Simple setup. I ve ordered 2 more for other rooms. 
23132 4 This is a great product. It is small compact easy for travel. The company TrioSports USA is a wonderful company to do business with. Excellent product and customer service I would recommend this product to my friends. Thank you 
23133 4 Great for the Microscope and great for science kids! 
23134 4 It came on time only 10 days love my pics😄 
23135 4 Great camera, now if I can learn all its finer points! Turns out it s the same one my grandsons bought after extensive research, so it must be good! 
23136 4 Easy setup, quite versitile. Using it to make photos of old family pictures. 
23137 4 I like it and am enjoying it for the purpose I bought this for... I ll be back for more, it works amazingly well! 
23138 2 Should have read the specs closer. Only takes high resolution pics. Cannot change setting for smaller file sizes. Crazy in the day and age that this feature is not included. I have a 15 year old Sony that does it. Otherwise it s a decent camera. 
23139 4 This is in use everyday. I put it in my garage because I normally leave the overhead door open. Now I know when a person enters the garage from in the house. 
23140 4 I bought this for my daughter s 16th birthday and she loves it. It is a great starter camera for the serious young photographer, or anyone starting out for that matter. All the items in this particular package are of good quality, and the Canon products are excellent. 
23141 2 ehhhh, it s great and has great promise, but ultimately the colors are dull and the user experience leaves a lot to be desired. 
23142 4 Perfect!!! 
23143 4 Great case. Just what I expected. The insert holds everything perfectly. 
23144 4 Exactly the battery I was looking for. Product was shipped and at my house in 2 days. Very pleased. 
23145 3 Love the size & color. But, it can t hold an additional lens. Only one... 
23146 1 Very unstable. 
23147 0 The glasses became loose on the third day... I assume that means the filter is not functioning properly. 
23148 3 Great, but not perfect. 
23149 3 Works great! Good Quality! Would definitely recommend! 
23150 2 Decent picture. WAY over priced for a Chinese camera. Software is confusing if you have little experience. Night vision is good to about 30ft. Does not come with SD card. 
23151 4 It s a well thought out design and very snug on my Manfrotto sticks. Nobs are big and look like they aren t likely to break easily. We ll see about that. In any case, I think this one will last. 
23152 4 a necessity for use with cokin filters without having extra equipment 
23153 4 Love it! 
23154 4 Great backpack for DJI. Love it. 
23155 2 Good quality but can t use the protective lens cover on it. 
23156 4 very good for my a6000 setup 
23157 4 Have had 2 of these for about 4 months now, and they have never pulled up an error message on my D3300 or my D5300, have worked great, last just as long or longer than my En-El 14a. Will be buying more. Thankyou guys so much!! 
23158 4 Amazing shipping time. Got it within 3 days if the order. Was exactly what was pictured, well packaged. It is the 70d w. Had the wifi. Just awesome. Better quality accessories than I was even expecting. Thank you. 
23159 4 After using this cloth, my computer screen looks just like new-- it is crystal clear! 
23160 4 love these 
23161 4 very compact and very cushioned for travel. i have Nikon D7000 camera. the case is perfect. all my accessories fit very comfortably. very happy with this purchase 
23162 2 If you want to read my full review with some photos, I posted it on my blog: https://petecocophotography.wordpress.com/2015/08/31/neewer-vertical-grip-for-canon-6d/ 
23163 4 It working like Nikon Battery 
23164 4 Just what I expected 
23165 4 These stands were as described. 
23166 3 Cheap construction hence the price but adequately held my Nikon D5200 and Canon Vixia with no fuss. 
23167 3 The lens caps work great! My only complaint is that the adhesive on the strap didn t work for too long, but otherwise these work great. 
23168 4 There only need me open the APP and scan, no need the cable, it`s so easy for me 
23169 4 A part with a tripod hole is an excellent addition. 
23170 4 Very happy with the battery and the seller 
23171 1 Video quality very poor. See for yourself before making purchase decision. https://app.box.com/s/nxk36fuhqdkcyn1x3iugq1hklo0rzu3d Recorded at 720p 60fps A family member purchased 1 for me and I was about to place order for another one for bicycle but after viewing few recorded video, due to poor video quality, will be returning it. 
23172 0 Took it on an overseas trip of several weeks. When I went to use it it would not work. 
23173 4 Nice one for the price 
23174 4 Great protection. Bit bulky though... 
23175 0 Item works well but it took much longer to receive I paid for faster shipping and it was a Strain on my business because item took much longer 
23176 0 The product came broken and it hás locked into my lens. I have sent my lens to technical assistance to fix. Horrible. Don t buy! 
23177 4 I use this for my Canon T3 and it works very well and charges in the original charger that came with the camera. I love it. 
23178 0 I will not buy again, once clipped requires a screwdriver to unclip it from the camera 
23179 0 Picture quality was ok but the sound was no good at all, I sent it back and would never buy the item ever again Junk. 
23180 4 Second frame I have owned--seamless setup and great picture quality. 
23181 4 As expected still experimenting with this lens forbid is totally new for me. 
23182 4 Sturdy Case, fit s my Hero 4 silver. I m happy with it. 
23183 4 This was a good surprise 🎁. The camera 📷 was ready to shoot right after taking it out of the box. Easy to operate, and the pictures are clear and sharp. Anazing product. 
23184 4 This a good battery replacement than paying a crazy amount for the official canon battery. 
23185 4 Great all around package has everything you need and then some, great product 
23186 4 Exactly as I expected it to be. Works great. Thank you. 
23187 4 I was giving the opportunity to purchase this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest opinion. Great product at a great price. Easy to setup and use. Very sturdy and easy to extend. Highly recommended! 
23188 1 NOT TOO HAPPY.. very complicated to install, not people friendly... I wont recommend this. 
23189 0 Did not work on arrival. Seller refunded money. 
23190 3 as described fast shipping highly recommend 
23191 4 very nice little camera for FPV flying a quadcopter... good clear picture and nice field of view. small and light 
23192 4 Amazing 
23193 4 For the price this bag is great. Love the security for travel. 
23194 4 Always like to have a reserve battery for my camera. This is proving to be very reliable. 
23195 4 This was so easy to install and has been so fun to use (though we seriously installed it as a security measure). Love it--and will probably buy a second one. 
23196 4 gopro is very handy. Beware that you do NOT get the micro SD chip with it and you will need to charge it before using it. 
23197 3 Works as expected Nikon D5200; this is IR not wireless and needs a line of sight. 
23198 4 Use them often, would buy many more. 
23199 1 Seemed good at first until the plastic broke. Can t find replacement parts. 
23200 0 Doesn t even compare to my Olympus - THIS CAMERA IS TOTAL CRAP. The interface is almost the same and I figured that I d give it a shot for $129. GARBAGE. Not waterproof. I repeat - NOT WATERPROOF. Terrible pics. I ll be requesting a refund. 
23201 4 Work 
23202 4 Great accessories 
23203 2 It ll tide me over for a while, but it s soft plastic and is very loose on the lens. Slightest bump and it falls off. 
23204 3 Works perfectly, just a little expensive. 
23205 4 It great to have spare batteries and it charges them quickly. I love having the car adapter. 
23206 4 Excellent product for the price ... and w/ spare batteries. Did the job for me. 
23207 4 Works great! 
23208 4 Just what I was looking for! 
23209 2 Batteries are a tight fit, but all in all, a good product!!! 
23210 4 Works as advertised. 
23211 0 Didn t fit my iPhone 5c right 
23212 3 I have received the product and with no problem. It is always good to have a warranty for expensive items. 
23213 4 Just as expected, nice quality for cleaning glasses. Didn t need individually wrapped, but its a great idea to keep them clean. 
23214 3 A good flash, energizer doesn t make camera flashs, another brand. The listing said this would work with my sony a58 dlsr. It doesn t fit the mount. Had to buy an adapter. Works fine now. As good a flash as those costing twice as much. 
23215 4 Very good attachment to have 
23216 4 I love it. 
23217 4 So perfect for the GoPro!! The clear case is Great!! It is working wonderful and with the mic 100% a most get if you want to do more with it 
23218 2 Not bad. All filters work except the 10x. Decent for price. Good for beginners wanting to learn a little. 
23219 4 Exactly what I needed. 
23220 2 It s usable, but the price is too high for a simple plate like this, especially I already bought two Dolica tripods. 
23221 4 Absolutely love it❤️ 
23222 4 This has proven to be an essential element in my pocket at all times while photographing. Tee cleaner part (not brush) works extremely well and conveniently. 
23223 2 It s ok. Smaller than I hoped for but it does the job 
23224 3 Works great 
23225 4 Nice filters 
23226 4 Was super easy to install and readjust. Is resistant to fingerprints, eye smudges, and protects the glass. Very worthwhile getting. 
23227 0 Terrible! This turns on the GoPro and makes it cycle through menus, takes pictures, etc. It is way too tight and doesn t fit right, caused my battery to die and my gopro to take hundreds of photos. Can t not recommend enough. 
23228 4 My frame quit functioning within 6 months, however the manufacturer has contacted me to offer a replacement. I will update my review when it is received, but I am very impressed by the customer service at this point. 
23229 4 Great 
23230 4 Excellent 3rd person in case something happens. 
23231 4 I already needed 
23232 0 Doesn t stay on very long even with a full charge. Kind of crappy, not nearly as close as it it was going to going to be 
23233 2 Returned them.....really is not way to attach to the sling because its a closed unit...you can not slide these on. I called the company and wondered what the purpose was....because the sling WAS a closed unit 
23234 4 Henry from Support was knowledgeable, patient and very helpful. The camera is very technical and requires too much maintenance for those who are not IT-inclined. 
23235 4 Works just as well as the official GoPro chestmount. Adjustable straps; Fits adults perfectly. 
23236 4 perfect replacement and on time. 
23237 3 Love this thing! My only wish is that the padded shoulder part covered a bit moreFor more padding, and that the adjustment buckle was in the front for quicker adjustments. 
23238 4 Was using the neck strap that came with my Fuji XE-1 and it was so bulky. Changed over to this wonderfully crafted little wrist strap and am a happy camper. I got the camera because it is small and light. The strap conforms and enhances those qualities. 
23239 4 Excellent cloths. Individually wrapped 
23240 1 Only has a hdmi out put dosent have the bnc out, or the rca out 
23241 4 A gift for my daughter ! It looks more expensive than it is .and she loves it!! 
23242 4 Works well for using a one or two sets of filters to cover the from element of your lens. 
23243 4 Great deal 
23244 3 Great!!! 
23245 4 Great 
23246 4 Very sturdy plate. I m using it on a flycam nano to make it easier to remove my Canon 70D. Works great. 
23247 4 I ve been using these batteries in a VIXIA HF R600, and they are performing perfectly. The camera displays the remaining battery life, exactly like the Canon battery. The charger works with these batteries and the original Canon battery. 
23248 4 Great 
23249 4 Always good product from STK. 
23250 4 Very helpful. Calvin was able to help me with my problem very easily. 
23251 4 Good picture quality for the price 
23252 3 Works great, fast charging 
23253 4 put it on my o ring for my water housing of my Sony action Cam and worked great! No leaks and kept the ring nice and lubed! 
23254 3 So far the batteries have performed as expected. Battery life is good. I haven t time it to determine how long it last. 
23255 4 Good quality for the price. 
23256 4 Just what I needed for a spider man car. 
23257 4 NO IDEA HOW MUCH MORE I CAN URGE ANYONE TO BUY THIS. Digital and cell phone images are great, but this!!! Is a must!!! 
23258 3 Cannot be used with a Sony genuine hard lens protector, which I didn t know before. 
23259 4 This is very comfortable to use especially when using a long telephoto lens while hiking. 
23260 4 Nice 
23261 4 excellent product. does what it says. 
23262 1 Maybe I need to go trough some learning but the pictures have odd colors and are blurry. 
23263 4 Product was exactly as described and at a great price and very fast delivery !!! Will be back to this sellers page !!! 
23264 4 This is a great LCD protector, and the only type (GGS) that I would even consider for my camera s. 
23265 4 Great photos 
23266 4 It s nice having extra batteries and the car charger. 
23267 0 Not as Advertised Wrong Item&#62;sent it back. 
23268 4 Excellent first timer s camera, great quality, video, and accessories are a nice added touch. The price deal was great too! I like it a lot! 
23269 3 Really happy with this accessory. I really like that as well as a pistol grip, it can be used as a small tripod. It has helped keeping my shots steady as opposed to using the handle on a traditional handy cam. 
23270 4 Works great. Could have made the knock out holes easier to punch out. 
23271 4 Fits camera well in both directions. Costs a little more but it works! 
23272 4 If you give a good description you ll always have a satisfied customer. 
23273 4 they are all useful product with reasonable price. 
23274 3 Fine so far. 
23275 4 These do an awesome job of cleaning!!! 
23276 4 Perfect. On time. 5/5 
23277 4 This camera mount works excellent for my bicycle. It is a very simple design, but sometime the simplest designs are the best, which is the case with this product. It attaches securely on my handlebars. Once secure it stays that way. My camera takes excellent pictures/video as I ride. 
23278 4 The quality is very good for the price. The ball is smooth, hardware are build to high quality. It is quite big and heavy, not a travel ball head. For stationary use, it is perfect. 
23279 4 It was nice A+ in my book 
23280 3 nice easy to use takes great photos 
23281 4 Great and handy ....easy to setup 
23282 0 ZERO STARS, this P.O.S. came with users guide written by some one with no working use of English and it never worked after we worked out the coded messages it came with. the old saying is true : you get what you pay for. 
23283 0 Terrible. Used one piece and it broke putting it on. The suction cup dose not work at all. 
23284 1 the straps don t handle the weight of all the glass and the camera. I am frequently adjusting the straps. the front pocket is awkward. 
23285 4 Worked as advertised 
23286 4 Nicely constructed and great fit for GX7 camera. I am quite happy with this purchase. 
23287 4 Really helpful to keep your gopro safe on your boards, bikes, and even wrists. Definitely recommend if you do not want to lose your gopro. 
23288 4 Very well made, it s comfortable and durable. It feels more secure in your hand than any handle. 
23289 4 Excellent product works as expected. 
23290 4 awesome. these batteries are great, came in quick, charged up pretty quickly and lasted for longer than they should on a charge. 
23291 4 Love it!!!! Excellent zoom! Going to take it on my cery first cruise with my girlfriend. I plan on taking some pictures and videos. 
23292 4 Wonderful lens 
23293 4 okey 
23294 1 This says that it will fit Sony Alpha cameras, but it did not fit my Alpha A6000. Not sure who gets the credit for the description, whether it s the manufacturer or Amazon. Big caveat emptor. I returned it of course, and have to look for another product. 
23295 3 Not bad, for more effect I added some wires 
23296 4 Works exactly as expected! 
23297 4 My daughter loves this camera fun for teens but pictures are pretty expensive about $1.00 each. 
23298 4 every thing ok 
23299 4 IT WAS BETTER THAN I EXPECTED!! PRICING WAS EXCELLENT 
23300 3 Great! 
23301 4 Excellent product. Thanks! 
23302 4 Great cam for recreation use. YES...It is Water Proof. We submerged it for 5 minutes or more and we continue to enjoy the benefits of this camera. Little heavy but durable. SPLASH 
23303 4 Used this case while white water rafting. I was able to fit two DSLR cameras into it and they remained dry and protected. Able to stand on the case too without impacting its contents. 
23304 2 I thought it was bigger but it works well with accessories. 
23305 0 These cameras are junk. Extremely poor video if you can get them to work at all. 
23306 4 Work well 
23307 4 This product met my expectations. 
23308 4 Kenneth was very helpful and figured out the problem. Everything working now. Foscam is a nice camera. It s great to be able to check on things when we are not at home. Thanks for the great service. 
23309 4 I bought this as a spare. I use it with my Sony A72 and it works well. Great price and I recommend it highly 
23310 4 Pretty decent product but a little tricky to install. Overall, I m fairly satisfied that it will protect that fragile screen on my G16. 
23311 4 Works perfectly fine in my E-M1. 
23312 0 The battery is broken 
23313 4 Great high quality product at a good price. From a company that stands behind thier product and are aiming for not just the highest of quality product, but top knotch customer service for any of your needs! Highly recommend this ND filter lack of color/ image distortion is suburb. 
23314 4 Fits perfect 
23315 4 Easy set up. We needed a barn camera to monitor our animals. The barn was well within our router range and this worked well for our needs. 
23316 4 Very pleased 
23317 3 Had some problems with recording button, sent it back to replay to fix and they changed it for a new one, working perfectly! Sellers experience was quite good and I can only recommend them. 
23318 4 Wish it had instructions 
23319 4 Recommend 
23320 4 Really great tripod. Stable and quick to setup. I have used this at weddings, events, portraits and filming. 
23321 4 Excelent product 
23322 0 filters - are ok but - the wipes had a cloud of dust on them 
23323 4 Love the product. Very easy to set up. Pictures are very clear. If putting outside I would suggest buying the adjustable mounts. 
23324 4 Quality of this tripod is excellent compared to my old one. Easy to use & transport. Really nice flexible piece of equipment for shooting from various angles. 
23325 4 nice 
23326 0 it s not working as expected it would work and I can t return it anymore 
23327 4 love this lens for landscape and astro photography. 
23328 4 When using a timer just won t cut it - remote control! 
23329 4 Awesome, thank you so much looks amazing! 
23330 4 Nice cable, armored from sharp edges. 
23331 4 Everything about this camera is great! Size and weight is so much better than my old camera. Fits easily in my pocket for on-the-go use. Mine was refurbished, but it looks new. Not a single problem with it so far. 
23332 4 Worked out great. 
23333 4 Easy to use. Practical size. Nick 
23334 4 I like the black over the silver. The bayonet action is smooth. 
23335 3 Good 
23336 0 Did not fit, did not respond to my inquiry. 
23337 4 Fit my Canon 28-135 IS just like the Canon version, makes me regret buying these overpriced Canon branded ones for all these years. 
23338 4 Thank you 
23339 4 Nice compact size for a good price. 
23340 4 Expensive but works and worth it! 
23341 4 Was worth the purchase it s very easy to use 
23342 4 Great! 
23343 3 I was disappointed that it doesn t come with a full instructional guide.I had to play with it to figure what most of the buttons do. 
23344 4 Fits perfect to the Coolpix AW130 Great stuff! 
23345 3 worked well enough for my purposes so far. I still have some more experimentation to do before I can give it my full approval 
23346 3 Easy to set up and excellent support available. First one was a breeze, second one ran into a small issue but Ed from customer support walked me through it easily! Would recommend and will purchase more dlink products in the future. 
23347 2 Regular 
23348 4 Good charger for my IS-200X sONY 
23349 2 This is a perfectly acceptable inexpensive camera bag. It s just not great. I am storing my 1950 s Voghtlander in it so OK for that since it sits in my closet most of the time. 
23350 4 Works well easy to use 
23351 3 It fits the Nikon P7800 perfectly. Not much room for anything else 
23352 4 Works very good.. Pic s are great. Not at nite... 
23353 4 great works love it , great price 
23354 4 Worth it for the price. The tripod is not that sturdy but you ll get use to it. 
23355 4 Soft rubber means good protecting, easy to pack and carry, and it s lightweight. 
23356 4 Really nice set. Has all you need for the camera. Seems to be well made. 
23357 1 Night vision works great still not hd but the regular video is so bad when played on a regular sized monitor its super grainy... didnt like this camera at all 
23358 0 Terrible..just terrible... I bought three camera s and could not even get one to hook up to the WiFi. Even the tech support (unfortunately one over worked person in California) could not even fix. Sending back. 
23359 0 unit was bad / ok day light but not at night / ir was bad (oversaturated). sent it back. 
23360 4 Although I had a cleaning set, I didn t have anything like this one. I gave my DSLR and good cleaning after I cleaned the CMOS. Now I use this set as my first cleaning attack before each major usage and am really happy, 
23361 1 The case the lenses comes in broke immediately upon opening it. 
23362 4 Just adding my five stars to the rest of the reviewers, the ring s threads are fine and attach to the camera and filter smoothly. The price is fair and the cloth is an added plus. 
23363 4 Got the product on time. Loved it, it took very good pictures and was very happy. Thanks 
23364 3 I bought this case for my boyfriend to use for his SJCAM. The SJCAM and his accessories all fit nicely in it. I was drawn to this case because it was one of the few I found that was big enough to accommodate his suction cup. 
23365 4 The item works great. Thank you. 
23366 4 Great product and price. Fast shipping! 
23367 3 Does what I need. Nice design and accessories. Glad I got it. 
23368 4 More than I expected for the money. Great deal and more gadgets than I could ever use. 
23369 4 Worked just as advertised. It better 
23370 2 Pretty cool stick, but beware, the clip that holds the remote is a little wonky-- I bumped it and the clip and my remote dropped to the bottom of the lake-- reinforcing it w duct tape would ve probably been the thing to do. 
23371 3 It work as intended, the price is good, waiting to see how long the battery last. 
23372 4 Handy! 
23373 4 Worked perfectly, including the couple of times I needed both hands and wanted to let the camera just bob on the surface. 
23374 3 Its very easy to scratch and it give blue tones to long exposure images- can be easily fix in lightroom, still trying to figure out white balance for different filters. 
23375 4 Have not used it yet but it looks nice 
23376 0 Doesn t fit the hero 2. Is there another piece I need? 
23377 4 I was learing about buying one of these on amazon, but it was a nice pleasant surprise! It worked absolutely wonderuland the quality is great, especially for the price! 
23378 4 Great 
23379 4 Excellent product and arrived on time. 
23380 0 Does not plug directly into the wall. Comes with chord (not pictured) 
23381 2 As promised, the picture keeper was very easy to use. However, the 16000 photo capacity picture keeper only held 6000 pictures, so be smart and buy one that is 3 times what you think you need. 
23382 0 Horrible. Upon attempting to remove it from my flash trigger, the end of the cord snipped off. ULTRA delicate junk. 
23383 2 These vibrating motors are great to make robots and vibrate a lot and effectively. The wires are a little short though (1cm) 
23384 4 Nice. I carry the camera in my purse, great protection. 
23385 3 exactly what I expected. good quality 
23386 4 I love it and recommend this product. 
23387 0 A right disaster. Not only are there no instructions in English, the flash gun stopped working after 2 sessions. It simply stopped coming on. Really disappointing. 
23388 0 Worst product ever! Its all plastic, its weak, the wind doesn t let it spin, even when there where no wind still doesn t spin. None of my timelapses ended up right. Not recommended 
23389 3 Works well but somewhat oversized. Fast delivery. 
23390 2 Doesn t really do high end FD lenses justice. Also could never figure out how to take out the optional element. 
23391 4 works well..no problems so far 
23392 4 Greate equipment, we re using it for a mine site and it gets really dirty and have no issues at all. Previous camera was lost and we had no doubt on getting the same as a replacement. 
23393 4 This bag is very spacious and secure. I travel often for filming projects and so far I m pleased with how this bag protects camera gear and additional items. 
23394 4 Love this bag, very comfortable to wear. Very durable. 
23395 0 I ordered this product, totally excited to get the fabulous DSC WX350 plus accessories for this amazing price. When it arrived, it was NOT the DSC WX350 at all! Instead, it was a DSX W830, a substantially less expensive camera with limited capabilities. 
23396 1 Did not work out sent back still waiting for credit. Should have paid more attention I had to send back to China cost me more in shipping then I was ever willing to pay it is not a good product I would not recommend it does not deserve to stars 
23397 3 Work well last a long time. 
23398 4 Worked great, bought 5 more for friends that I showed 
23399 4 I lost my charger some time ago and couldn t use my palmcorder until now. I was glad to find it. 
23400 0 Received the wrong size batteries. the description suggested this type for the camera, but they were not the right ones. 
23401 4 Love the products from cowboys studio 
23402 4 Good product 
23403 4 These lens caps and cords work as well as original equipment. Price was right. Arrived quickly. 
23404 0 Only able to use once went to use it again the red lights pop up on the back showing I have full battery life but the light doesn t come on anymore. Waste of money guess you get what you pay for ! 
23405 4 These offer a great value and super clear image. I would order these for friends! 
23406 1 Extremely unreliable when connecting over wifi. After two months it stopped connecting to my network at al, wifi or wired. 
23407 4 Just the perfect size for my Coolpix S9700!! 
23408 3 Great item for the price! 
23409 4 As advertised 
23410 3 Great scope. Get your scope level and its on the money locating objects. Doesn t view nebula really well at all. Grey spots in space. 
23411 4 Perfecto 
23412 4 Very satisfied and excellent multi-platform charger. Charges LifePO4. 
23413 2 good deal 
23414 4 Works as advertised; holds battery, looks nice 
23415 4 This works perfectly on my monopod in conjunction with the DP-50 QR Camera Plate. 
23416 4 Very well made, just like all their cases. Would recommend. 
23417 4 Daughter loved the border on the photos. Even at high school age all of her friends thought the product was great. 
23418 4 Takes great pictures. 
23419 3 working just wish it came with better instruction 
23420 4 Very good product 
23421 4 Great product, solid, and good price, I sold my old plastic clamp stands for thisones and im glad i did.

23424 4 Fits my Hero and all of the accessories 
23425 3 Working nice 
23426 3 Nice starter scope. It would be nicer if it came with a sky watching guide. 
23427 4 I m SO satisfied with this camera. I fell in love with it instantly. It s small and comfortable in my hand, the quality is great and all of the added accessories help as well. 
23428 2 it s an ok point and shoot getting all the extras were good the optical zoom just was not good enough to suit me. I ended up getting a canon SX50 refurbished from canon website for $179 
23429 4 Great product 
23430 4 Well made, very fast lens and a great deal. Very wide angle without much if any distortion in the edges. Really like this lens! 
23431 4 Great camera for the price! ! 
23432 4 State of the art Have had it for a month still learning what it can do Take the time to acquaint yourself well worth it! 
23433 4 As described. 
23434 3 i like 
23435 4 Mine appeared to be used and had a tear in the flash wrap. Had to return. Nice very soft, even light comes from this thing. I used it sometimes for macro shots. You can pack this in the same slot for you laptop. 
23436 4 My niece loves it. takes awesome pictures. Color was cute and modern 
23437 4 Henry was very good could figure out remote view he login to my computer show and voila toke 5 minute very guy 
23438 4 Meet my Gitzo and Really right stuff head perfect.Some extra pouch for small tool and my Gimbal kit. 
23439 1 Quality isn t what I would expect for a samsung. The casing is cheap plastic and the actual video quality is on the poorer side. I think my samsung phone (note 4) takes better quality video. I was surprised and disappointed. 
23440 4 Great investment and I love it so much And here are some pic that I took for my Sony a6000. 
23441 4 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
23442 4 Excelent product 
23443 0 Camera exploded when power was applied. I don t think the specs were correct saying 7-27v input. Looks like one of the resister fried. 
23444 4 use these to protect my lens 
23445 4 Good quality! Fits my Fujifilm X100 perfectly! 
23446 0 piece of trash, not even good enough to use once 
23447 1 [[VIDEOID:2159cfd3aadee35e75e247a07f4f2ce4]] A quick demonstration of the pros and cons of the Fastfire camera strap. 
23448 0 Cheap. Toy looking.

23451 4 Delivered on time with great packaging. Item was as described and completely met my expectations. I absolutely love this lens! 
23452 4 Great lens. Does exactly what I wanted. Take pictures of my kiddos outside for sports and fantastic landscape shots when on vacation. 
23453 4 excellent product, but no information or use recommendations included, would have been nice. Well made. Quick delivery, no issues. Did not need to contact company, used Go Pro, as described. No complaints. instructions. 
23454 4 Best baby monitor/security cam on the market. I sent the others brands back after seeing how easy to use and powerful the nest was. We ll be buying more for each room in the house. 
23455 0 Don t waste your money on this one. Parts falling off as I pulled it out of the box. Pieces cracked as I tried to put together. Didn t hold reflector. Total garbage. 
23456 4 Excellent 
23457 4 Perfect size, great zipper quality and material and has side bag for equipment. My carbide tripod for telephoto lens fits perfectly. 
23458 0 This was poorly and cheaply made. Don t waste your time or money. Big disappointment. Better to hide the camera among some books. I returned it at once. EW 
23459 4 Great product 
23460 4 Very good! 
23461 4 Works great. I already have it hooked up to my body board. Got some dope footy. 
23462 4 Smells like bad rubber for a while. But does the job fine 
23463 4 Great add-on camera, this is actually replacing one that failed to work upon installing. 
23464 4 as shown 
23465 4 Once you get the hang of it, it s easy to use and an overall awesome product. 
23466 4 Good, inexpensive! 
23467 4 Excellent buy!! 
23468 3 Great price 
23469 4 Excellent product. Excellent company. The BX-2 gives my gear extra protection and I feel confident nothing short of an elephant sitting on any of by BX-2 gear will cause any damage. I am extremely happy and highly recommend this product and the Brenthaven. 
23470 4 I purchased a a back up battery for my camera. This battery holds a charge, for a long time. 
23471 4 love it. 
23472 4 It is ok to make home pictures 
23473 4 Almost cant look at the moon without it. Works great! 
23474 4 Best full frame ever!! Nikon has done it again!! 
23475 4 good 
23476 3 Fit my SJ4000 good a snug. On mine though one of the legs for the clamping area was bent badly and barely works. But it does work. 
23477 4 I don t see any play, a good product for the price 
23478 0 bad product 
23479 4 Very nice kit! Planning on using it on vacation out west. I love Canon products and so far so good. 
23480 4 Still working in my Olypus. 
23481 4 Fantastic FPV camera. So much better than using a Mobius for FPV. 
23482 1 Not an east fit! 
23483 4 does exactly what it needs to do... i little scary to try it, but it really works 
23484 4 Thank you 
23485 2 difficulty using. My fingers are too big!! 
23486 4 ok 
23487 2 weird little robotic guy I guess it works great for scaring people 
23488 4 Great product 
23489 4 Good quality pictures, compact design, and easy to use. 
23490 4 The best action cam. None compare. 
23491 4 I bought h t these for a trip. They are an excellent buy and I have confidence in this brand. 
23492 4 I have received it well. 
23493 3 It works just as I expected for the price I paid. I love that I can take photos that don t look as selfies... 
23494 3 My son likes it a lot. 
23495 4 Just what I needed for my new SX60 and a spare battery 
23496 4 This worked really well - comfy and easy to locate! 
23497 2 It works but did not come with a memory card 
23498 4 Great value, wish that camera was more wide angle. 
23499 2 letters of &#34;celestron&#34; logo are cheap stickers, and got lost rapidly 
23500 1 More difficult to collapse in comparison to other brands. 
23501 2 Very cheap casing but it will do the job. 
23502 4 So cute i love it , and some people say it has a nasty smell but really imine doesnt smell funky So happy my birthday is saturday now i have a baggie to wear with my outfit to carry my camera 
23503 4 Best money I have spent. Love this product 
23504 4 Very nice lens, tack-sharp 
23505 4 Great product 
23506 4 Sweet produce. Better than expected build quality and fit. 
23507 2 Works well easy quick app install and remote view. Haven t done the port forwarding yet. Although major issue with speaker and mic very close on camera you get a lot of echo and feedback 
23508 0 Put in a new micro card, can t get product to work at this time. Been trouble shooting for a week now and I ve tried everything (yes, including the reset button.) Don t see any way to reach out to the company for customer service. Wishful thinking I know. 
23509 2 The title says this item has two hot shoes. Not so! A &#34;hot&#34; shoe is electrically connected to the camera, which controls the flash triggering. This item merely holds the flash in a bracket. It s up to you to connect it to the camera somehow. 
23510 4 I highly recommend Celestron lenses in general and this kit is tops and worth it when purchased with the scope. 
23511 4 This is one of my favorite purchases I ve made in a while. The quality is great and fits my 30 pound dog perfectly. Get ready for some of the most hilarious GoPro video you will ever shoot. 
23512 4 Bought it for my Mom. It s her first digital camera, and she was a reluctant convert from film. She loves it. 
23513 0 This is a terrible case. Do not buy this product! I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased it. My camera was ruined in only 35 feet of water. 
23514 4 wrong lens 
23515 4 Great product! 
23516 4 Super fast delivery. Great value. Very good product. 
23517 2 If the pockets were a bit deeper and a bit tighter to prevent the memory SD and Micro SD cards from coming loose in the case I would have given it a five star rating. 
23518 3 Good quality and great price. 
23519 4 As described. Good value. 
23520 4 The best camera I have bought so far. In great condition and delivery was fast. Thanks. 
23521 3 decent case 
23522 4 It does what it s supposed to do. It works great 
23523 4 Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised. Very high quality. 
23524 4 The device works the same as the 4 port system, With a few additional settings and options. Had it setup and running in less than 10 minutes. 
23525 4 Works as advertised. Will allow having filters mounted. 
23526 4 Bought as a gift for my son. He loves it -- fit perfectly. 
23527 4 love it! 
23528 0 will not hold a charge. do not buy 
23529 4 Unbelievable photo backpack. Took it to Europe for two weeks and it was so easy to carry my Canon 70D with 18-135 and 24-70 lenses. Lightweight and sturdy. Best camera bag for traveling. 
23530 0 I would not recommend it I do not like it 
23531 4 Excellent camera rolling backpack, it is everything I expected, liads of room for camera bodies and various lenses. 
23532 0 I got this camera and it got stuck trying to turn on, I got a replacement and it also won t even power up. 
23533 4 Does exactly what it s supposed to do at half the price of Manfrotto s version. 
23534 4 Perfect, exactly as described. 
23535 3 I got this tripod and it fell apart but the customer service reps were responsive to my needs and sent me one that is very study and awesome. Thanks guys! 
23536 3 Great point and shoot with some more customizable options. Large to fit in a pocket 
23537 4 Two excellent working batteries for a Very reasonable price. \m/ 
23538 1 I have a Sony HX9V. It says it´s good for the camera, but I´m afraid it will break my lens. When turned on, it fits to tight, and the case pushes the lens to it´s sides. 
23539 4 they worked well 
23540 4 Very good product,best you can get for an instant camera! 
23541 4 It s my personal &#34;photography assistant&#34; that holds the reflectors, and the flowers, too. 
23542 4 All metal, well made. It does not think down too small though. 
23543 4 Easy to install. Does what it should. Delivered new, in perfect condition and on time. Priced right. 
23544 0 This is incredibly flimsy, with weak clips that hold the hood on the lens. I honestly can t figure out why people are writing positive reviews for this item. 
23545 4 great camera 
23546 4 Well made and as compact as can be for a mirror less camera. Fits my NX500 with kit lens and flash as well as two batteries in the pocket. Much nicer than carrying a bag everywhere and worrying about putting the bag down 
23547 0 I returned this product. It did not fit my Sony NEX-5T as advertised. 
23548 3 Haven t used it yet but came as advertised and fits fine. 
23549 4 Fits my Canon S120 perfectly. Zips up both side making quick and easy to remove. Sturdy build. 
23550 4 Product as described, and function at least as well as Sony batteries. I haven t measured the capacity claims, but they do seem plausible. 
23551 4 This is the coolest camera. Takes pictures with easy and a clear shot. New to it but it has a lot of features I have to try yet.\JIM 
23552 4 Great camera 
23553 4 great item. I have not been disappointed by any of the Vortex optics and here again they did great. It is a bit heavy, but compared to binos this are way lighter unless money is no object. 
23554 4 Great item for a great price! and awesome service from eco-Fused to boot! Will definitely buy again! 
23555 3 good 
23556 4 Works great no complaints. 
23557 4 Best bang for the buck speedlight. Sync @ 1/8000! Rivals if not surpasses other pro models priced more than double of this. Plus it is a master flash to control other speedlights. 
23558 4 awtnu47533tutrerytutreyu nyteyrste5y 
23559 4 Worth the $$ as an alternate to Macro lens.. 
23560 0 Doze not respond well on the PTZ controls. Long delay. Keeps show up ofg line in my dlink. I try two different units and both have the same problems 
23561 4 Let s you control multiple GoPro cameras remotely. Great for controlling that camera on your head, selfie stick, tripod or other equipment. 
23562 4 I really like it 
23563 1 It is better than nothing. 
23564 4 Does the job. 
23565 4 Thank you Very much 
23566 4 Great camera, I have purchased 3 of these already to record our Church services. They are great in low light and have a quality image. 
23567 2 The DVR needs to be reset after a week of two. Eventually replaced the dvr 
23568 4 Nice, cheap, and works well. 
23569 3 great camera, has very nice video quality, very compact. easy to do vlogs and whatever else. 
23570 3 Short version: There are some definite quality control issues with this product, but on the whole it does what it says on the tin at an unbeatable price. Definitely a buy if you have Prime and so can return your first one if that particular unit is of poor quality. 
23571 4 This camera is really an awesome camera for the money. Yes it is mirror less but still works very very well. I am extremely satisfied with it. 
23572 4 its pretty good but smaller than expected I thought i was getting a larger bag than I already have to hold all my stuff , this bag barely fits nikon d7000 
23573 0 The pen will not take a charge and cannot be recognized by the computer. When i press the record button, it stops in 5 to 7 seconds. 
23574 3 Excellent productos, very responsable the seller upon delivery recommend 
23575 4 These work great and last longer then the one that came with the Camera. 
23576 4 My second GoPro remote and it s better than my first one (GoPro 3). This one works well with my GoPro Silver and also works well within the App. Comes with a wrist strap unlike my first remote! 
23577 4 Amazing lens good deal 
23578 0 I had this battery overnighted to me to record my sons 9th birthday. It wouldn t take a charge. Very disappointing and very bad business. Get your S#%T together or close the doors!! 
23579 4 Just one word.......awesome! 
23580 3 Good stand. 
23581 4 Good fit:) 
23582 4 I really like my Canon battery grip. It does a great job. 
23583 4 We purchased this as a gift and it was perfect! My husband loaded a memory card to make it easy for the recipient. It is a smaller frame which makes it easy to transfer to any room you like. Affordable and it was well received by the recipient. 
23584 0 don t work camera. Please if you change this one. 
23585 4 Very nice item, Exactly what I expected to receive. 
23586 4 Works perfect with my 1D Mark IV, charges quick, hols a charge and is recognized by my camera. This is a perfect replacement for the OEM battery. I just purchased a spare battery for a fraction of the cost of a Canon battery.. 
23587 4 I used this on my new sony a7rm2, a great way to protect LCD from scratches. 
23588 4 Its a snug fit which is reassuring however the access panel is not accessible unless it is take off prior to placing the camera in the mount but as I m typing this I m realizing its an intentional design and I ll change this to 5 stars. 
23589 3 Getting amazing full zoom shots! The mega OIS got me hand held shots at full zoom that I would have needed a trip-pod for previously. Appreciated the lens accessories that came with it. Taking it with me to Yellowstone & Grand Teton NP s next week! 
23590 4 My first purchase on amazon and very very happy with it. I am an amateur photographer. The photos attached were taken with the 36mm extension tube on my sony a58... 
23591 4 good 
23592 4 I love this lens! Great quality/value. 
23593 4 Great camera. Excellent condition. Everything arrived as expected. 
23594 4 Great camera. Can t beat for waterproof shooting. 
23595 3 Not a bad deal for a starter. 
23596 4 Purchased this camera for my husband. He loves it. 
23597 4 Works great, easy to install, had a previous D-Link which was very erratic and difficult to install. I returned the D-Link. 
23598 0 TERRIBLE. Two of these snapped and flew apart within two hours of clamping a backdrop to a stand. Almost injured crew. Do not buy. Potentially dangerous. 
23599 4 We like our first NIX digital frame so well that we purchased a second. This model has a 15&#34; screen versus our previous 12&#34;, making it easier to see photo details from across the room. Easy to setup, great image clarity, Very pleased with the frame. 
23600 0 Strap BROKE with my Panasonic Lumix FZ1000 on it,after only a few weeks.I’d give it a negative 10 star rating if possible. 
23601 4 Great!! 
23602 4 I have two CAMERAS not working i need to send back. I have 6 cameae install and they are work find 
23603 0 Not excellent 
23604 0 it broke within 3 weeks.... 
23605 4 great 
23606 4 Fits in a bag, easy to store or carry, perfect for large cameras with zoom lenses or flash attachments. Works on anything flat, take Maine every where, fits in the bottom of my camera bag 
23607 4 Bought it for my husband, he loves it!!! 
23608 0 This camera is a point and shoot that tries really hard to be more than that. Too many options. In addition, the battery life is super short. I would not recommend this camera. Buy a SLR digital or a cheaper point and shoot. Not worth the extra $$. 
23609 2 not as good as i expected should have got the 70-300mm 
23610 2 Decent stick not too stiff at full extention but good for the price. You wont be jumping off cliffs with this guy but i m sure i will have uses for it 
23611 0 This does not work at all with the Panasonic LUMIX DMC-FZ70 I bought at the same time. I want to return it. 
23612 4 easy to install and great picture. 
23613 2 Worked good but needed some info on controls and no Customer support available! 
23614 4 So much brighter pictures inoors 
23615 4 It has a good handle and the tip is sturdy but gentle enough 
23616 3 Fast delivery. Use it once and works. 
23617 1 I needed these canisters for an experiment in my class, and a lot of the lids didn t snap on tightly. 
23618 4 Works great! This was originally a gag gift for my husband s birthday, but he really likes it. 
23619 3 Works just like advertised. Cannot expect more. 
23620 4 came with bundle don t use head strap 
23621 4 amazing, arrived within a couple of day,s 
23622 4 great product 
23623 4 Wow! This light is very bright and exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to get a very specific light style for products and people shots and this light was perfect. 
23624 3 good value,too bad the camera is broken, but it did charge the battery... 
23625 4 I received mine in the time that said it would arrive. Very happy with my new drone. Great power. 
23626 0 Product was broken, the phone holder to be exact. Managed to glue it my self. I guess you get what you pay for. 
23627 4 Fast and reliable. Overnight shipping a success! 
23628 4 Great! 
23629 0 This pan, in my opinion, was very poorly constructed - it broke on me after two hours of use. On the bright side, my ability to understand Chinese translated to English is getting much better. :-) 
23630 4 This is really really good and I recommend it. However, I am 66 inches tall, and this is only 50 inches tall. 
23631 4 Love it 
23632 4 Easy to set up and it works perfectly 
23633 4 Work great. 
23634 4 Cheap and totally does the job 
23635 3 Fairly easy to install. Seems like a fair price for this good product 
23636 4 Everything works fine. Battery capacity is about the same as the original Olympus battery. 
23637 3 It was an excellent item delivered on time and intact. Thank you. 
23638 4 A little too small. 
23639 4 This is a real 808 #16 v3. Arrived in 7 days of purchase. Everything worked as advertised. 
23640 4 Great budget flash with plenty of features and solid construction for the price. 
23641 4 I ordered. They sent promptly. Product good. I am happy. 
23642 4 Such an awesome camera love it 
23643 2 No instructions included 
23644 4 It was exactly what I was looking for in this price range. 
23645 4 I love it,, the price was very reasonable the camera works as expected,, picture is clear and I do not have any complaint 
23646 4 This is a super easy to use digital frame. I love the video option. I previously had a Kodak pulse frame and loved it, but this one is equally as good and a much larger size! 
23647 4 Had no idea GoPros were even bordering on affordable. Between the camera itself, the items that come in the starter pack, and even GoPro s own FREE software you get to edit videos... this thing is simply amazing!! 
23648 3 Love the features of this camera. However, the battery life leaves much to be desired. 
23649 4 My daughter had enjoyed it so much. She was completely satisfied and extatic with the case. 
23650 4 camera takes great photo s, not overly heavy. camera has worked really well for taking photo s as just an enthusiast. 
23651 2 I use these batteries in a Nikon 1 V3. The battery life is degrading significantly with each use. If you have a Nikon battery, these are good back-up batteries. I would not use one of these batteries as your main camera battery. 
23652 4 Great batteries, exceeded my expectations... 
23653 4 great invention 
23654 4 Just as described..works well with a steady hand. Does not feel cheaply made. 
23655 2 good basic point and shoot camera. in some lightings, the pictures get an odd orange glow. if the light does not work well, i just switch to black and white and that fixes the problem. zoom works well. over all, i am very happy with this camera 
23656 4 Five out of five stars 
23657 3 It s ok for it s price easy to use 
23658 4 Sony recommended website product for a6000. Fits and protects hot shoe. 
23659 4 I use this mini tripod all the time. It holds my webcam and my cameras. This is the perfect size for small spaces. 
23660 4 Package met all expectations. Wifi works great. Good quality pictures. 
23661 2 make static noise but good images. 
23662 4 good replacement for a broken one I had 
23663 4 We are very happy with the product and the excellent service. 
23664 4 Works fine on my Sigma 150-600 S lens. Fits in my two RRS ball heads and clamps. Price is right, no flexing. 
23665 4 Works like a charm! 
23666 4 Very useful when you need a backup battery. I highly recommend! 
23667 4 More shots with the Nikon that with the less-expensive after-market batteries. 
23668 4 good product 
23669 4 Have used it with sunrise and sunset to enhance the color, works fine. 
23670 4 Best camera I ever had. Pictures and movies are crystal clear. Great battery life. Used it on charger to record memorable motorcycle rides in all kinds of weather. Sound is great too. 
23671 4 Loved this product! Was perfect for making personal postcards and was super durable and easy! 
23672 1 Temperature sensors on the unit don t seem to be working right. 
23673 2 ok 
23674 4 Good 
23675 4 the chroma key green screen is a great item. Its working for me and I am having fun with it. Thank you for the great item. 
23676 3 Takes awesome photos 
23677 4 Very easy to install and fits PERFECTLY. 
23678 4 A lot of things I will not use but the price is great. The case does not fit everthing so well but it works. 
23679 4 Great camera for the price. Easy to use and produces quality pictures. 
23680 3 Nice camera, good price but the accessories are very modest 
23681 4 Good for sealife...all tipe 
23682 3 Bought three of these, two worked and connected well, one was a bit tricky and I had to move it closer to the controller to get it to work. A bit pricey for what it is, I am now building my own with mysensors. 
23683 4 Works great, but wish it fit my head. A tad to big big. Would it be to late to send back for my size with measurements? 
23684 4 Work great to clean sunglasses camera ect. Awesome product 
23685 4 Fast shipping and charger works great! Thanks 
23686 0 This camera is cheap , its ok to use 9 years old 
23687 3 Nice camera system 
23688 3 ALL WENT WELL 
23689 4 This rig is just what I was hoping for ... compact ... easy to use and store ... puts me right on the hitch ball with ease. 
23690 4 It s great for webcams or cameras! 
23691 3 Worked fine, the price was good, but too long to get here. As a back up its what I needed would buy again. 
23692 4 Just what my GoPro needed! Strong!!! 
23693 4 Awesome product 
23694 4 Overall The Best Video Camera I Have Used. Amazing 1080p Video Quality 
23695 4 worked. serves its purpose 
23696 2 Really wish this had more area for my extras. I will need a bigger bag, but this does secure my camera well. 
23697 0 One of the plastic clips broke the first time I opened it. 
23698 4 I love it! Lightweight, sturdy, and so easy to set up and change placements. Would recommend! -Canon Rebel T5i user 
23699 3 It was a present for my teen son, he really like it. 
23700 4 Awesome camera Such an improvement over my old t2i. I never realized how much better my pictures could get. Works great in lower light even without a flash. Accessories are a nice add on 
23701 3 Great case!!.... My Canon fit into it nicely....... 
23702 4 I like it very much. It is pretty discrete too. However if you use the two camera feature the video quality drops. 
23703 1 Almost impossible to get on....you have to remove the hood, put it on and then reattach the hood. 
23704 4 Full featured controller for your Canon. 
23705 4 Great Thank you 
23706 4 Used this mount to record videos for my soon-to-be Youtube Channel. 
23707 4 Terrific for a DIY security system. 
23708 2 I should have done a little more research before buying. I found picture hangers that are almost exactly the same for only $2. Otherwise it does okay. 
23709 4 I m really enjoying this scope so far. Very easy to assemble. Saturn and the moon look amazing. If you re new to amateur astronomy and you don t want to spend a lot initially but you want nice optics, you should get this scope! 
23710 4 9/3 update: Used for a week on photo sessions on Appledore Island, ME. The strap was GREAT! Easy to carry camera with this attached (Nikon D5300 with Tamron 18-300). Looking for neck relief on upcoming trip to Italy. 
23711 4 I love this compact camera 
23712 0 Definitely wasn t new like it stated so I returned it and went to my local Best Buy to get a NEW one. Love the camera. 
23713 4 Perfect! 
23714 4 Looks great on my strobes, Works great, Priced great~ 
23715 4 Very nice flash. Works very well on my d3300 Very quick on the recharge between shots 
23716 1 Resolution so poor that it was virtually useless. Horrid video and photo quality. Get the 12mp and save yourself a headache. 
23717 4 Very pleased with this purchase 
23718 4 Arrived on time, so far the functionality of the product works good as described in the mfg spec 
23719 4 Outstanding!!!! They are super clear and bright. Unless you like to throw money out the window, there is NO need to buy the German brands at double the price. These are VERY VERY GOOD. 
23720 2 works well for the picture but finding a way to feed it not so easy finnally taped it to an electrical tape so i could run it in the pipe 
23721 3 Great case. Fits the Nikon Coolpix S9900 camera well. However, it doesn t leave a lot of space for an additional battery and cables. 
23722 0 It was used -- scratches on display and buttons. Clearly previously owned. 
23723 4 ok 
23724 4 Cable came quickly and works great! 
23725 4 Everything you need and more. 
23726 0 Trash !!! Terrible !!! Bad image !!! 
23727 3 Great camera. 
23728 4 This kit is a good all purpose kit and will fit most needs when used with a camera that has the standard screw posts such as the contour. Everything worked as advertised and meets the required needs. I would recommend this. 
23729 4 As Expected 
23730 2 I thought this would be good to hold my thumb drive but the strap is too stiff. 
23731 4 This kit contains all that you ll need. 
23732 3 it s a great little camera. A bit difficult to get the exact settings you want. 
23733 4 Great piece. Fit my non-Nikon MBD-10-Like battery grip as well. Great with the ENEL-4A with the D700 for faster frame rate. 
23734 4 awesome! 
23735 4 Awesome I like how it locks so it won t just keep turning. 
23736 3 Manufacture has delivered as promise on both product and specification. One camera crack; but, was immediately resolved by manufacture. Great service!! Replied all inquires and questions. Keep up the good work!!! 
23737 0 I didn t receive exactly as what shown and described, The dual battery charger replaced with a single battery charger. The wall charger which has 2 usb slots is not included. The usb cable not included. More description about what I received can be shown in the attached photo. 
23738 4 Product received as expected 
23739 4 I was so excited to find this product! I have a Sony NEX-C3 and needed some better lighting for my pictures. I ordered this and the Chromo 216 LED CI-216 light and they paired perfectly together. 
23740 1 too complicated. software glitchy or not working. useless piece of crap. 
23741 4 Fit great 
23742 4 Works great! 
23743 4 Excellent light meter. I use it mostly for landscape and wildlife photography and it dies everything I expected, and more. 
23744 3 Quite easy to use and was a present.... 
23745 4 Sturdy and nice 
23746 0 Do not work 
23747 4 Here is a shot from the camera on my last trip! 
23748 1 its not what i was looking for but it will have to do. :( 
23749 4 very bright LED light, works great when natural light is less then desirable. 
23750 4 work like my oem canon ones in my 5dmkiii. no issues 
23751 0 very poor quality, the picture is not clean, wasted my money !!!!!!!!!!!! 
23752 4 This is a good starter pack of all different accessories for the GoPro. All good condition 
23753 3 As noted in previous reviews, this setup is great for the money. There isn t much for instructions, but enough to puzzle it out, The stands are a bit shaky, so be careful. 
23754 4 Great item, delivered on time. 
23755 4 This makes using the camera outside in bright sun soooo much easier. I can actually see the viewfinder screen. It fits on the screen just fine and stays on. I folds up to fit in my bag nicely. Recommended for anyone who shoots outside a lot. 
23756 4 This works great on my monopod and was so inexpensive. 
23757 4 Very accurate delivery time 👍🏼 Thank you! 
23758 4 Great fit. Customise interior to suit. Holds 5 batteries, spare props, ipad, prop guards. Feel confident my P3P could arrive safely in spite of the best efforts of airline baggage handlers. Will put it to the test this winter. Similar quality to Pelican. 
23759 4 I love it! Material and appearance was just as expected, and I like that I can double it as a purse :) 
23760 4 perfect 
23761 4 Fits well you need to cut to fit 
23762 4 Works as stated. 
23763 3 Screen was a perfect replacement. A little assistance from a YouTube video and fixed my camera in 15 minutes and at a fraction of the cost of taking it to a repair centre. 
23764 3 Only fair. 
23765 3 expectations were met for this order. 
23766 3 Great product! 
23767 3 Not hi tech 
23768 4 Great camera; easy to use. 
23769 3 Appears to be good quality, easy to apply. I m not very good at applying stickers however it still looks great 
23770 4 Amazing.. I loved it!!! 
23771 4 nice 
23772 4 This is a terrific cord. I especially appreciate te short length of it which helps with the camera to flash on a bracket problem without havig so much extra cord that it gets in the way. All functions on the flash work perfectly. 
23773 3 Nice camera and good pictures/video. Needs more accessories. Camera does not fit into clip 1 so the only way to hold the camera is with the waterproof case. That makes it inconvenient for using it as a dash cam or such. 
23774 4 Great price for what I was looking for. Fast shipping. 
23775 4 Just the right size for my camera and travel gear. Very well made and sturdy enough for expeditions and such. Case Logic is a company whose quality has always been top notch in my opinion and this camera case is no exception. 
23776 2 Not quite as pictuerd, There is no drain on the one I got and there is a folding center handle and also the lable that was on the lid was very dificult to remove and left glue residue 
23777 3 Steppers functioned properly and included specifications were helpful. Included PC board makes mating with Arduino quite easy. 
23778 4 Excellent batteries 
23779 4 This camera is so easy to use. I purchased it mostly to take pictures of my children, but I have since expanded. Ive had a canon t4 rebel, and this is definitely better and more convenient. 
23780 4 charges my camera up right 
23781 4 great 
23782 2 Mine leaked as well. Still floated, but worried about future use. Free diving in 15-30 deep water. Great tool and easy to point and shoot, but again worried about the seal and it filling with water and sinking :( 
23783 4 Not disappointed 
23784 3 great case for a camera and your essentials. great quality. Just a tad on the small side. Still not sure if I m going to keep or return it. 
23785 4 Does the job. 
23786 3 This was a gift to go with the phantom great combo... 
23787 4 I am happy with the drone. it works great 
23788 1 cheap / should have brought the real thing 
23789 0 No good 
23790 4 These are great lens cloths, you can t beat them for the price. I keep them all over the place to make sure I never find myself without one. Plus, they rep the best Nikon users forum on the internet, how could you possibly go wrong? 
23791 4 Fits in place very easily, blocks out most of the unwanted light and made of soft rubber so very comfortable. 
23792 4 Worked as expected. I passed this one on to my Grandson. 
23793 4 Works just as expected, charges my camera batteries quickly. Great deal for so many accessories, and now I won t get caught with a dead battery all the time. 
23794 3 Nice system for the cost. 
23795 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23796 4 Good battery, good fit for canon camera and battery life is on par with factory OEM battery. 
23797 3 good product 
23798 4 Great product, Thanks. 
23799 4 this camra does a great job. I love it 
23800 3 Camera stream is awesome! The only issue so far is getting the video to record on motion. 
23801 4 Fit good 
23802 4 Not much to say.. Does its job, seems to have a comparable life span to the Nikon counter part. :) 
23803 4 Perfect 
23804 3 Works fine. Took off a point for lack of clear instructions. I had to find video instructions from Orion on YouTube. I was able to figure it out from that. Well made. 
23805 4 I film a lot of events, and this lens helps me get those emotional close up / shallow focus shots without having to move my gear all over the place. 
23806 4 Received all ordered items promptly; everything works well. 
23807 4 Shipped quickly. Seem to be just a tad wider that the originals. Still work though. 
23808 4 Works perfectly. Haven t had any issues with this adapter 
23809 2 Not as expected, but great to learn on. 
23810 4 Works well, good suction to smooth surfaces as long as they re clean. 
23811 0 No web interface for configuration or viewing. Realize solely on mobile Android or iOS app. Camera goes offline several times a day and you must power cycle the camera to bring it back online. When the camera does operate, it works well with good image quality and speedy PTZ. 
23812 3 Film worked as intended, wish it was less cost effective, remember to not shake the photos and to place in the box the film came in to help develop them faster. 
23813 4 The battery was exactly what I needed 
23814 1 This item was returned as it did not support continuous streaming. I also found their customer support to be subpar. I returned it and paid the extra money for a nest camera. 
23815 4 Excellent 
23816 0 battery consumer and sucks the flash doesnt turn on at all times 
23817 4 Good Back Up Camera or for indoor. 
23818 4 Perfect. 
23819 3 Works great #GFGENT 
23820 3 Very clear in quiet areas. However when there is a fan near by or loud ac, it causes interfence and you will hear static throughout the entire recording, or sometimes not even record sound. 
23821 3 great purchase 
23822 4 this is my fourth manfrotto bag they are just grate lots of customizable things and great weight balance when you have your laptop + camera overall a great product 
23823 4 Works great! 
23824 4 Perfect replacement for original D750 Eyecup. 
23825 4 Perfect if you want to pack in your suitcase. 
23826 4 I love this camera. I wanted one that takes batteries and this is the one. I m still learning all the possibilities with this camera. It s very nice. 
23827 3 great seller - delivered as promised! 
23828 4 Works great! 
23829 4 looking forward to using in belize. 
23830 2 Inability to set shutter speed below 1 second makes it less useful for my application. 
23831 4 Love it Way to go with go pro 
23832 1 It s not very stable but thankfully it worked for what I needed to do. 
23833 4 Great mount got to 100 mile per hour on my motorcycle it the camera didn t flinch a bit Is great to take great shot and can be used on almost any helmet. Go pro outdid themselves 
23834 4 All sorts of FUN crafty items to dress up the photographs. Bright colors and designs. My granddaughter just loves this. I gave this pack of accessories as a birthday present along with the Mini 8 instant camera. (Everything old is new again! Remember the old Polaroids?) 
23835 3 Does what it said it would. 
23836 4 I love this hand grip, it was so much easier to carry my camera around with this grip. I am not a big fan of having my camera dangle around my neck. 
23837 4 Works great! Love the attachments...it is a lot easier than the 3..not as dramatic for the counter balancing 
23838 4 Awesome camera and great customer service from Calvin 
23839 4 I used the RFN-4s kit for the first time last week and it worked flawlessly on every shot. Set up and installation was easy, I am very satisfied 
23840 2 ok 
23841 4 NIce quality 
23842 4 Work great d5300 in vello battery grip. No errors. 
23843 3 Tricky to power on. Hold the power button for more than 4 sec. 
23844 1 When I got his camera it looked like the package had been opened and when I turned on the camera it had 3 photo saved to the camera of a person and his house. It sketched me out so I am taking it back and getting a new one. 
23845 0 The first time I used it, one of the prongs stayed in the wall socket when I unplugged it. 
23846 3 What I like 1) distributes weight well 2) camera always at the ready 3) camera is in a comfortable position for walking 4) strap attaches to the cameras strap lug securely and does not obstruct use of my tripod - great strap 
23847 4 Camera is great good working condition, actually its like brand new 
23848 4 Excellent. 
23849 4 Exceeded our expectations. Work great and I got these 4 for the same price of just ONE at Best buy. More like &#34;Worst buy&#34; if you ask me. Thanks CamKix! 
23850 2 Resolution is good if the camera does not move - takes a while to fill in detail. Wifi is very difficult to set up. I use DHCP reservation but the IP does not renew properly without multiple power cycles. 
23851 3 I like them alot 
23852 4 perfect replacement for the original 
23853 4 Fits great, functions as advertised. I love it and I m happy that I saved so much money. 
23854 0 If there is a product deserving on 0 stars then this is it! It does not even do basic magnification let alone night vision! The material looks deceptively metallic when in fact its only a very cheap plastic. 
23855 4 I was so impressed at the quality of these batteries. They are as good if not better than my Canon and Wasabi Power batteries. Well worth the price! 
23856 4 excellent 
23857 4 Cheaper and quicker than ordering from china 
23858 4 compact sized yet versatile. i can use it on my portable cameras and accessorizing with some attachments, also with cell phones. 
23859 4 It was larger then I was looking for .....had to return....but looked like a great camera. 
23860 3 This NVR is perfect, comes with 4 x 100ft Ethernet cables and the cameras are very nice. Hate the software interface, hence 4 stars. The software for viewing and replaying recording could be more user friendly. 
23861 4 best idea ever... 
23862 2 Battery is slightly smaller than my original, causing it to fit uneasily into the battery charger provided with the Camera, but it did charge OK and does fit into the phone without difficulty and seems to work OK. 
23863 4 The battery fits, and worked right away. 
23864 3 the only down side to the kit was the selfie stick...it spins upside down under the go pro s weight, otherwise excellent. 
23865 3 Met requirements 
23866 4 I was amazed by all the extras I got with the camera. The pictures are outstanding. 
23867 4 Dresses up the GoPro 3. Need a wrench to tighten thumb screws. Can t get a grip on them with fingers to tighten the GoPro so it won t move. 
23868 4 Camera is great for the first time DSLR user! In my case that happens to be a 13 year old - and she is now taking incredible photos and having fun. 
23869 4 At the price point this works great for off-camera flash power! I m a wedding photographer and can use it almost all day with rechargeable batteries before I need to swap in new batteries. 
23870 1 It is a little slow with regards to synchronizing with the phone/app. 
23871 2 Very easy to use....not great quality picture 
23872 3 Nice looking leather case. Good colour. Seems sturdy enough. 
23873 4 Love this camera.. Easy to set up and easy to use.. It notifies me right on my iphone and I just click on the app and I see everything. I love the fact that I can look back and see stuff.. 
23874 4 Its geniune Pelican Case. Very duriable. Been every where with it since I bought it and it is still good as new.... inside. 
23875 4 i love it...as expected 
23876 2 Pretty sturdy for the price, nice direct lighting, although to need all four up to get a well lit scene, and it s almost impossible to iron the wrinkles out of the supplied back drops. 
23877 4 Seem to work just as well as the one that came with my camera 
23878 4 Got these in perfect condition. Great for off camera flash and works just as good as Pocketwizard but a fraction of the price. You can use them for fill flash outside or to help compensate low light at wedding receptions. added bonus- was here 2 days after I ordered them! 
23879 4 My granddaughter enjoyed using the stickers on her photos. 
23880 3 Cheap and plentiful microfiber cloths. I wear glasses, so I like to have access to these things in various locations throughout my apartment. They re also good for cleaning laptops, computer screens, and phones. They re useful and effective. 
23881 4 Super Sweet! 
23882 3 It s simply fit and well. I don t know how good the one made by Fuji, but this one just works no problem at all. And the price is something that you don t even need to have a second thought. 
23883 3 Looks very good! Fits my canon g7x just fine. No space for anything else! 
23884 4 The product, packaging and supplies are all wonderful. The camera is easy to use and light weight, highly recommended. 
23885 3 Definitely too expensive but it s never let me down 
23886 4 amazing camera! 
23887 4 Leo was very knowledgeable and able to set it up very quickly for me via remote setup! 
23888 4 Excellent value for backup power. 
23889 1 Doesn t fit - and was returned 
23890 4 Works just like expensive version 
23891 4 Haven t used it yet, but sure it will do the trick 
23892 4 Fabulous for the price. The moslins are a little thin, but what do you expect for the price. Also, ironing them was a bit of a pain, but that s the nature of the beast. 
23893 4 Love the it😀 
23894 4 Good Film that s all. 
23895 2 Had to make a few alterations for horseback riding but overall not a bad little system. Only bad point is that I had to get a locking washer for the screw for the camera, it would back out very easily before hand 
23896 3 Good fit on 70 to 200 f 2.8 zoom lens 
23897 4 Very convenient and light to carry around 
23898 4 awesome and very compact 
23899 4 just the best 
23900 4 Great Backpack! Plenty of room for everything. Deep pockets and tons of padding to protect your valuable equipment. Protects my laptop as well in a separate compartment. 
23901 4 excellent extremely good; outstanding. 
23902 2 A bit heavy but sturdy. 
23903 0 I don t like the legs because the bottoms always falls off. However, when I tried to return, it charges almost $7, so I guess I will keep it. :( 
23904 4 My favorite camera. This is the third one I m buying in a row. 
23905 4 Fab 
23906 4 Great photos, waterproof. Tough casing. Get it. 
23907 3 Light and comfortable against the eye. Fit s well but doesn t &#34;click&#34; on and can come off easily. 
23908 3 Nice set, affordable price! 
23909 4 Good 
23910 4 thank u 
23911 4 All Good A++ 
23912 4 Go with camkix Unless you want it to say gopro on it 
23913 4 I bought these as replacement batteries. The work perfect and now I don t have to worry if my battery goes dead when I am taking pictures because I have a backup. 
23914 3 Very cool little frame, it doesn t have the quality of a computer monitor but it is pretty good. 
23915 4 Camera was in great shape.instructions were easy to read. 
23916 3 Fits everything for my camera. The parts do not fit perfectly, but they are all in there and safe. 
23917 4 I am very happy with this camera. Looks like new. Came with a carry bag and two 16 GB memory cards. Those memory cards are good for pictures but too slow for video with XAVC S format. 
23918 4 Can t use my camera without this... 
23919 3 Great bundle, all components work well and very much with the money! In the down side the backpack was not as big as it looks in the picture and the. Inserts are very thin, it took some maneuvering to get my cameras to fit. Still a great kit 
23920 4 I was having a problem getting my new F19828P camera to work on my laptop, even though it worked on my desktop. I called Foscam and spoke to Calvin and he made some adjustments to the laptop and now everything is operating fine. Foscam tech support is great. 
23921 4 Battery grip Arrived as promised, best 3rd party battery grip out there. I would recommend this company and grip as excellent. 
23922 4 on time and well packaged .Still playing with it but so far works great .I may get an extra battery for convience 
23923 4 Suprising picture quality 
23924 0 Didnt even last a week the product was so poorly made out of cheap plastic 
23925 4 I love my new camera 
23926 4 It did exactly what I wanted it to do. Did not need recharging very frequently. 
23927 4 A real good add on camera with night vision. Great price too. 
23928 4 this is a great camera for the average photographer. my wife takes thousands of pictures a year of our grand kids and she then puts them in a shutterfly book. great camera. 
23929 2 Its ok and could hold all my accessories, but after two few months, the stitching at the zippers came apart. I guess this camera bag insert should not be used without its backpack - [[ASIN:B00J3YFW16 Jill-E Digital 15&#34; Jack Laptop Backpack Case (Brown) with Camera Insert Bag + Cleaning Kit]]. 
23930 0 didn t work 
23931 3 They were good and I ll make it so you can reach out and get your camera 
23932 4 Great product-delivery and service. Very happy with the charger and it arrived hours earlier than expected. Thank you. 
23933 4 nice 
23934 3 Good 
23935 4 perfect!!!!!! 
23936 3 I love the design and compactness 
23937 4 great 
23938 4 It s all ok! 
23939 3 I used it once and it appears to have charged the batteries that I ordered along with the product. 
23940 4 love it - 2nd one 
23941 4 Nice device and yes, it does have an internal single AA battery that can be changed. 
23942 3 Works as advertised.. 
23943 4 Handy 
23944 4 Very satisfied 
23945 4 I got it 
23946 4 Excelente 
23947 3 good 
23948 3 Battery is working good, but du not have capacity of original ones. 
23949 2 they work but some of them were already dried out 
23950 0 The software doesen t recognise the camera and after an hour of capturing videos a transistor exploded and the camera stopped working. 80$ burned out. 
23951 0 had to return it it didn t have a way to secure the battery for charging 
23952 4 Love the camera, takes great pictures, and easy to download to print up pictures too. Thank you, 
23953 4 Is a great camera and does the job very nice. Would absolutely recommend it. 
23954 4 It really works well, a lot of stuff to figure out but who needs to know everything. 
23955 4 Perfect fit! 
23956 4 Camera still doesn t work 
23957 2 This &#34;small&#34; harness is almost too large for my 60 lb pit bull. Fits my barrel chested boxer pretty well though. 
23958 4 Works Perfect ! 
23959 4 Love it !!! Works great !!! 
23960 4 I m very happy with this item I will buy more 
23961 4 Very good product at low cost. 
23962 4 ok 
23963 4 The Huge grip and feel of this Grip makes me partial to Kupo C-Stands. 
23964 4 Excellent 
23965 4 Pelican - what more can one say. Used for a GoPro. Still fitting in accessories. Allows custom fit cut outs. The foam is notched so you have some cutting guide lines. Use a long slender knife to cut the foam along the perforations. 
23966 0 This product is terrible. It says the product is new strait out of the box but it must have came broken. wouldn t turn on even with a full charge. really upsetting and a waste of money. confusing to use and cheaply made. 
23967 4 Great camera love it! 
23968 4 Awesome! 
23969 0 Well my review is it just don t work well, no instructions, no video, very little sound. For the price it is headed to the trash can. Sorry 
23970 4 Great price, battery works......I m very pleased with this company s services and I highly recommend Thanks, Annemarie C. 
23971 0 They work great....until they stop working. Slow recycling time on 1/128 power and when fired by the 560 TX is fires full power then shuts down. 
23972 4 It is very orange. I love it. 
23973 4 These strobes work great. I am happy with purchase. 
23974 4 good 
23975 0 Battery would not charge from the get-go, I have been unable to access the warranty policy, or a phone number for help..... 
23976 4 This pouch set is well made, protective and stylish. Small size is adequate for pancake lenses and, medium size is good enough for Canon 18-55 STM kit lens. I m still not using the large one but it s nice to have it already for a future lens. 
23977 4 Works perfectly, shipped promptly, good priçe, 
23978 4 For the price the product is not bad. 
23979 4 Great 
23980 0 Horrible. Does not work well. 
23981 4 Haven t had to use it but it s there if something goes wrong with my Samsung camera. 
23982 3 Perfect! Bought these for my sis s wedding and the ones leftover I took with me on a Europe tour! 
23983 3 wasn t listed that a gender changer was needed 
23984 4 excellent 
23985 4 Very Happy 
23986 4 The camera is great. It s very easy to use and is wonderfully compact. The pictures I took are superb. I highly recommend it. 
23987 4 im head over heels in love with this camera. And the whole kit for the price is just amazing! Everything is of good quality even thought they re &#34;extras&#34;. I m so happy I made the leap and bought this kit! 
23988 4 Good product over all. Feels very sturdy on my monopod. 
23989 4 Does the job for a low price. 
23990 4 Great camera 
23991 1 would have been better if i didnt have to buy a hard drive for it... 
23992 4 great product 
23993 0 difficult to handle, it is not functional 
23994 2 Told I needed these for my camera. Seems to help. 
23995 4 Perfect fit. 
23996 4 I am totally impressed with this camera. Even the battery lasts indefinitely when it sits without being used. I HIGHLY recommend this camera! 
23997 4 Great product! 
23998 3 Cute camera but veery small view finder. Got as a gift for 11 years old. 
23999 4 Perfect. As promised, but I was surprised at how small the velvet bag was. Didn t know what it was for anyway, so it is still perfect for me. 
24000 3 Good flash for the price. Plan to use as a second flash when shooting portraits. My only negative is that the user manual is written very poorly. It s difficult to read and sometimes misleading.This flash has 8 custom function settings of which 3 are not mentioned in the manual. 
24001 4 THIS LENS IS AMAZING. If you were only to have one lens, have this one. The shallow depth of field and low light capability can t be beaten. 
24002 3 Ok+ 
24003 0 Thank I used it as soon I get it works very good, thank you! 
24004 0 DO NOT BUY FROM BESTPRICEAM, PIECES MISSING, NOT WORTH THE TIME TO SEND BACK. 
24005 4 great one but doenst snap it will keep on turning 
24006 3 Doesn t work so well in shady areas. Maybe it is the IR blocking filter. So if you re going to be flying through the woods, this isn t the way to go. 
24007 4 Works like a champ! 
24008 4 I am very impressed with the results. The product has a great price. and just the Tripod alone was worth the price. Big bang for the buck. 
24009 4 Fantastic Camera for Construction sites. Easily programmable and takes great time lapse videos 
24010 4 Extremely fast shipping. Quick and easy installation and programming into my existing 2gig system; all at a fraction of the purchase/installation offered by a security systems installer. 
24011 1 I ordered a dark brown frame and received a black frame 
24012 3 Looks very realistic. Cheaply made, but once they are mounted, that should not be an issue. 
24013 4 Great Product 
24014 4 Actually my wife loves it. I just carry the camera bag. 
24015 4 Great drone. Yes its an older model but I have already captured some amazing vids and pics with it and will be using it for my upcoming school project. 
24016 0 didn t work with any of my speedlites. 
24017 4 very good material 
24018 4 Wonderful bag very nice to have a large compartment that doesn t collapse. 
24019 4 Easy to direct ligh, hold shapes 
24020 4 This product is great hooked it to my go pro and love it! 
24021 4 Very good experience! Would recommend this seller always! 
24022 4 Works well, makes for a solid base and is easy to get on-off. 
24023 4 Great product. Fast shipping. 
24024 3 Bought this to pair with my Sony a6000 and it works well! I ve been taking pictures of plants and insects and you ve got to get realllllly close, but the detail is fantastic. The only drawback:The aluminum casing scratches VERY easily. 
24025 1 This camera was ok but does not do well in low light conditions. 
24026 4 Love it 
24027 4 Awesome. Great price. Fit my sons camera perfectly. Durable and long lasting. 
24028 4 This is exactly what I hoped it would be. Fits everything in for the drone and a few extras so I don t have to lug another bag along. 
24029 4 Very loud and light weight ! I ll take it on all my runs and everywhere I go. I won t leave home without it... 
24030 4 excellent 
24031 4 I ordered the expert shield and it was delivered in three days, that was with standard shipping, great service. the shield fits perfectly, couldn t ask for a better fit. the price is very reasonable for this kind of quality. racinsailor 
24032 2 the trade name was not neewer. 
24033 4 The product arrived on time and it was just what I needed. Would buy again. 
24034 4 On time. As described. 
24035 4 Works fantastic! I love controlling all my speedlights from one place. 
24036 4 My dropcam pro stopped working and the Nest company replaced it for me free. Very supportive and reliable company and the new cam works brilliantly. The company was very responsive and quick with their service. Thanks Nest! So I have bought another cam. 
24037 3 good camera for its purpose 
24038 4 Very satisfied 
24039 1 I m unimpressed with the feel of this. It doesn t hold he phone straight for a larger phone. It s very expensive for what it is and doesn t seem it will last. 
24040 4 Purchased to go with the Uniden system I purchase from Costco that only had two cameras. This synced perfectly with it and works really well. Good night vision too. 
24041 4 So far so good. GoPro Hero black consumes batteries to fast so it is good for moments where you cant find any other ellectrical source. 
24042 3 I bought a total of 4, I like them! 
24043 0 It really is an awful piece. The camera itself is OK tough the stand is bizarre and difficult to use as is the focus on the camer. The Software is junk 
24044 3 Great lens, amazing for landscape and night time photography 
24045 0 terrible quality cloth 
24046 4 This camera is great for action shots and has a lot of extras for enhancing pictures. The extra battery pack and SD cards were a bonus that was great to have. 
24047 4 I love this, I basically wanna take it everywhere. READ HOW TO ADJUST YOUR ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING BEFORE TAKING YOUR PICTURES. If they come out horrible, it s cause you did it wrong. 
24048 2 expected better resolution. 
24049 4 Works perfectly and came on time. 
24050 3 Ok 
24051 2 Nothing is broken so far, havent set it up yet but will whenever i have time 
24052 2 Cool 
24053 4 This camera has a very nice option you can select, I think it s called the &#34;beauty or beautiful&#34; mode, basically a soft version of portrait photo shop. People always say before your ready to take their, &#34;make me look young and beautiful&#34; this camera does that. Very nice. 
24054 0 Piece of junk. Does not work. Do not buy. 
24055 4 Just replaced one failed WANSVIEW CAM after two years with this one. Image is much better. I have not tested memory card yet. Hope it will work and last longer. 
24056 4 Great bag, fits a lot of equipment. Handy for water environments. 
24057 4 Great I will buy more 
24058 3 Well made. Would buy again. 
24059 2 hard to figure out how to use for the average person 
24060 4 As advertised 
24061 0 To start with, the canvas boxes in which they come are the poorest quality posible. The packege i got, did not include the bateríes. 
24062 4 works well for good price, sellers contacted me immediately after to let me know there is a warranty and to make sure there were no problems. 
24063 4 Excelente... 
24064 4 fits perfectly, as to be expected from OEM items 
24065 4 Keeps the GoPro clipped in and the mount is tight. It is not going anywhere. 
24066 4 Brought this to use w/JOTO 6-inch Waterproof Case pouch, for family & everyone LOVED THIS GIFT!!! 
24067 4 Very good item! I will purchase another soon...it s worth the money. Pictures are clear, I added a ring light to increase lighting and it help too. 
24068 4 We ll see. I purchased this to replace a unit that fail from a different manufacturer. So far, so good. I will update in time if needed. 
24069 4 This has been a great camera which is very easy to use and takes great pictures. Larger than the ones that slip in a pocket but that s not a problem for me. 
24070 4 Great tool for converting slides to digital images. Get one and pass it around your family. You ll probably only use it once but the time it saves and the memories you recover are worth it. 
24071 1 Much of the film either didn t develop or developed very, very slowly (we re talking hours). Kind of a bummer for the high price. 
24072 4 Fits all the standard GoPro Accessories. Worth the money. Good construction an good foam. 
24073 4 This item is a excellent piece of equipment,the size was perfect to fit my camera and cellphone. 
24074 4 love it 
24075 3 Very good picture quality, just a little overheat when u transfer picture to smartphone 
24076 2 What can one expect for so little money. Recommend spending the extra cash to purchase a higher quality tube kit. 
24077 0 It did not work. 
24078 4 These microprism screens are wonderful -- I put them in my EOS 1N/1V, and I love working with them. 
24079 3 A good solid camera for our son (11). He has used it at home and at camp and it s lasted through it all! Great pictures and lots of memories. 
24080 4 I lost the center column of my 190 tripod on a shoot and needed to replace it and this was the perfect solution. Works great. 
24081 4 Very easy to install, great video quality, strong wifi connection, love that it zooms in and out and pans smoothly, totally worth the price. Been through two other wifi monitors and I was so upset with those but now I m happy with this! 
24082 4 LOVE IT!!! 
24083 3 Seems as though it will work well though no real trial use of product yet. 
24084 3 Good concert binoculars. Some might find them a little heavy after awhile but I paired them with a Monopod and there perfect. 
24085 4 Worked and fit great for my camera. Best underwater photos taken...No filmy look on the images from the case. 
24086 3 Foam doesn t seem to fit the drone perfectly, but good enough. 
24087 2 Terrible terrible menu. Borderline retarded. Very expensive prime lenses. Fast. Hunts for focus while doing video though... 
24088 4 This is a Great Tripod! I put my Leica T62 Spotting scope on it and at the range or in the field it is great. I have killed many Coyotes and Rabbits using it to spot or as a rest. It is Killin Machine! Get one!! 
24089 4 Works just like the Nikon battery. 
24090 4 thanks 
24091 4 Image and construction quality are great! 
24092 4 Patrick Good service from Patrick and 5 stars rating for this service good quality of camera 
24093 3 Great for the price. 
24094 0 arrived and didnt work. 
24095 4 Bought a new camera with two lenses. For one I had a bunch of filters from my old 35mm, but the other was incompatible, so I ordered this pack to help in the field. So far, great results. 
24096 4 This is an excellent addition to the pro 40 - 150 and given the price and weight, makes for a 420mm f4 in a small package compared with anything else available. Optical quality is also excellent. 
24097 4 Great 
24098 2 Versatile, but not intuitive. Tendency to not be able to fully capture batteries. I have to secure then to the charger with a rubber band. 
24099 1 Worked for two years, then zippers ripped out. 
24100 4 Great when I m shooting concerts. Two thumbs up. 
24101 4 I m enjoying my new charger for my camera. No more dead batteries. 
24102 2 Good quality, great value. We ve been having difficulty charging the batteries and have to keep them plugged in almost constantly. We will likely be contacting the seller for assistance in the near future. 
24103 4 All hail the D-76, King of the developers. 
24104 4 The tripod doesn t fit in the camera case, that why it comes with its own carrying case. I like the whole kit. No complaints. 
24105 4 Fast service great product 
24106 3 Very good camera, fast shooting in any luminosity, easy to configure, small and confortable to handle. The only problem is the lack of a lens cap. For this we have to be always careful not to touch or let the lens touch anything. 
24107 4 love it. husband wears glasses and can bird watch from his chair, 
24108 3 Great Product 
24109 4 Excellent product and excellent service. 
24110 4 Does the trick. Protects the lens. A must-have for a nice lens. 
24111 2 It s awesome 
24112 3 Great for action videos such as bike riding skateboarding, etc 
24113 3 Sharp broad field of view. A little pricy but better than the cheap zoom models. 
24114 4 The cap works great. I would buy again. 
24115 1 broke after 3 months 
24116 4 Great product, has never scratched any lens I have used them on. 
24117 4 I have enjoyed using my Canary and watching it evolve. Customer satisfaction is paramount to these guys, so it is not done evolving. I am thouroughly satisfied and can t wait to see some of the up and coming features! 
24118 3 Does not come with clip accessory to put gopro on, need to buy that separate. 
24119 4 I wanted something I could strap my gorpo too that would float so when I brought it to the beach it wouldn t sink. So far in the pool it does just that and the added wrist strap is awesome so it doesn t float away. 
24120 4 Did the job, the price was right. 
24121 4 I needed a sports wifi cam asap for a trip and I got this camera on time for my trip. The camera works great, no issues. Will order again from this seller!!!! Great job :) 
24122 4 Very useful. 
24123 4 Pretty awesome product. Lenses fit perfectly. Couldn t be happier. 
24124 4 Since I live in a more urban area, these come in handy as I m always trying to sneak in a small or regular. They are very water proof, so the logs will stay dry without a baggie. Overall, really great product, I would buy it again! 
24125 4 High end feel. Protects well. Never loosens, much easier to keep clean than other UV filters that I own. 
24126 4 great tripod 
24127 4 Great 
24128 1 Horrible video quality not practical 
24129 4 Works as expected! 
24130 3 Tested it right away in water for an extended period before using it with camera. I hope to take it snorkeling this fall. 
24131 3 Spy camera. Looks pretty nice. The output is alright, not that great but I am not choosy 
24132 3 Good ++++ 
24133 4 Fast service. Satisfied. 
24134 4 I love it 
24135 4 4 years later and I still love this camera 
24136 4 Very good versatile lens. 
24137 3 Item delivered on time, was as described 
24138 2 Love my camera except for the fact it came with instructions in Japanese, or chineses, or Korean..... they were everything but English 
24139 4 Fast service, quality items 
24140 4 very pleased with both the charger and the batteries 
24141 4 Love! So adorable. 
24142 4 Photographs great, doesn t wrinkle. Wish I was a little bigger 
24143 4 Have not used much other than the batteries and chargers. Others have said hard to get out of charger. I found it quite ready. Love having the extra chargers while away from outlets. Great luxury to have! 
24144 4 Strong and versatile. A must! You can, of course, combine it with various camera, tablet or smartphone holder. My regret about this one: not getting one or two sooner. Seriously! 
24145 0 Three of the items were NOT what was pictured, and were of significantly lower quality. I returned it. 
24146 4 Great lens for the money buy now before the price increases. 
24147 4 blast 
24148 4 Works just as good as the original. 
24149 3 Great. 
24150 4 This works well for my son s Sony camera. 
24151 0 terrible. I do not recommend. the flash is late and doesn t supply a clear image 
24152 4 Perfect camera replacement cord 
24153 4 Great, 
24154 4 Works as advertised. For long exposure photos, you would want to use in lower light conditions. But the colors come out good and it works as it should. 
24155 4 It was as expected. Worked fine. 
24156 1 Won t keep the right setting very hard to get programmed very disappointed with this item. 
24157 0 The cameras offer a very poor picture during daylight hours. The cameras also get hot for some odd reason. I removed them from my system to prevent any issues. I have other HD-CVI cameras that offer a better picture. Do not spend you money on these. 
24158 4 Great camera - replacement for ZS40 on which we shot about 40,000 photos! 
24159 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
24160 4 I bought for my daughter for Christmas and she seems to love it. 
24161 2 Good value for cheap price, works fine, but while the flattening is space efficient, the assembly is fussy. 
24162 4 Very cool product. 
24163 4 I have both the small and medium bag and love them both. 
24164 0 Don t waste your money on this one unless you can live with terrible video quality. There is no way this is a 720P camera. Spend the extra money and get a 9805P that has excellent video 
24165 4 Good 
24166 4 Great macro for my GoPro Hero 4 Silver. Awesome quality and comes with a little tether and Amazing bag for it. Perfect 
24167 4 thanks 
24168 4 Was very shocked at first that it held very well to my windshield, just have other problems with various suction mounts. Will buy another one soon to mount in the back of my cab. 
24169 4 I love this bag! Fits my camera and accessories perfectly!! And it is bigger than I expected, bonus!! 
24170 2 I Found my own ways to Hook the gopro onto my bike comfortably and stable. They seemed like a solid idea. 
24171 3 Its a great tool but has to be treated with great care as the top rotating part can easily break off. 
24172 4 I used this for my g3 wireless mics. It s an affordable case that adds protection and professionalism. 
24173 3 Camera was easy to operate and waterproof. Picture quality was good, but not great. 
24174 4 works great! 
24175 4 Very great batteries! They last for 6 hours each on my Sony CX900 
24176 3 I have not had the opportunity to use much yet, but happy with what I ve done so far. 
24177 4 good thank you 
24178 4 got this for my girlfriend and she loves it. if she s happy with it, i m happy with it. 
24179 3 Very good for price. 
24180 2 When it is finally set up it works great. But Foscam had to screen share my computer to get it set up. Way too complicated! 
24181 4 Excellent! 
24182 3 Case was as advertised,strong,roomy,except for the prop guards,but I m satisfied! 
24183 4 Very nice monocular , I like it and clear and a lot better than the other one I have which is a 10 power and 42 mm Thanks 
24184 3 Works great! 
24185 3 You can carry a bunch of stuff not related to the camera. Passport, money and other documents. I see it as kind of a man s purse. 
24186 4 Works like a camera lens should 😏 
24187 3 The strap is short, wish it was longer. 
24188 3 good deal 
24189 4 Shipped and arrived quickly. The product is exactly as explained and fits my lense perfectly. Thanks for the great buy at an affordable price! 
24190 4 So far so good! We ll see how the quality is and how it functions underwater when we take our upcoming trip. 
24191 3 It s cheap, it works. Doesn t have the non-reflective felt lining that the genuine Canon hood has, but I can t complain for the price. 
24192 4 The best camera addition I have purchased. The grip holds two batteries. I love it 
24193 4 very tight first few uses, but improves to sturdy fit as flexed to the shape of your speedlight. super cheap and effective - thumbs up. 
24194 4 This is great 400 speed film and very reasonably priced. I like it in TMax developer. 
24195 4 There s not much to say about this battery that hasn t already been said. It works as a great replacement for the more expensive batteries and I can t tell the difference. 
24196 4 Power 2000 ACD-235 Replacement for Casio NP-40. This product rocks!!! I take a lot of pictures with my camera and now no matter what I have a charged battery ready to go. The charge stay longer and it is easy!Thanks 
24197 4 This kit is AWESOME! I can t believe how well everything works. Everything fits into the pouch and it slips onto the strap of my camera bag. 
24198 4 Lost the little black piece to cover the SD card... the rest helped too 
24199 4 Was exactly what I expected 
24200 4 The camera looks amazingly real, with red flashing light and the wires coming from back. 
24201 4 Very prompt fulfillment. Tremendous deal vs. normal retail. Very satisfied 
24202 4 exelent 
24203 4 This backpack has changed my level of orginization, and comfertablity with my equipment. All around best bagg out in the market. Its a must have. 
24204 4 Very good deal for all these items... Everything works great! 
24205 4 Arrived earlier than expected and product is as advertised. 
24206 4 This is awesome product 
24207 3 The really is a great starter kit. Using the tripod/monopod with my intro Canon DSLR worked great. I never worried about the tripod falling over or anything. But it is definitely for beginners. 
24208 4 We bought this for a gift and pre-loaded pictures of the kids on it. We liked it so much that we re ordering one for ourselves. 
24209 3 Good solid bag, got it on sale so it was a good buy... 
24210 4 I have 3 of them since 2013. They re all still working. On 2 of my car and 1 of my motorcycle. 
24211 0 Limited field of view. Past event vowing very cumbersome. Night vision useless. Merely just a webcam if that 
24212 4 Very nicely made case. We have not put it to use yet, but will soon. 
24213 3 clarity is great the hood can be a problem ,it can go on crooked which show up in the photo 
24214 4 Great 
24215 4 Really bright. Don t look into light. Get the diffusion cover. Must get Sony type battery separately to use light. Bluer than sunlight. Works well with reflector umbrella. Brightness is adjustable. 
24216 4 Works perfect on my Nikon DSLR 5100. 
24217 0 They didn t provide how to sync the device. I called the manufacturer and they wanted to charge me $50 for the answer. 
24218 4 I love this pack. It does all I wanted it to do. 
24219 3 Recommended 100 % excellent product 
24220 4 Perfect. 
24221 3 great but instructions were in chinesse 
24222 4 Cheap and good quality 
24223 4 so far so good

24226 4 Excellent product. 
24227 4 Very good. Easy to unpack and easy to install. 
24228 4 Great security system doing the job that we need it for 
24229 4 The CMS software too complicated,I don`t know how to use,can you updated more easily and simply version? 
24230 4 I like GGS products, so I m fully satisfied wit this one too. It fits my camera s screen perfectly. Easy installation and great look. 
24231 0 Don t buy it! Waste of money!!!!! 
24232 2 It works good but broke after 3 events. Good temporary solution though. 
24233 4 The product was amazing everything works perfectly nice and intact shipping was almost immediate ! 
24234 3 Sturdy clips. 
24235 3 I have a Kodak Pixpro and lost my original case. Tight inside but it works. This is definitely for small cameras. The zippered pockets are also tight and cannot hold much but it worked for the charger cord during my recent vacation. The price was also very good. 
24236 4 I was a little wary at first buying this for my Sony nex 3n but it works fine! I use it for my 18-55mm lens and it s great! 
24237 3 For the price I paid, it s excellent. I like it and have no regrets. I recommend it 
24238 4 At this price point this is a great filter. I have severals B+W filters and I think this one has the same quality. 
24239 4 Outstanding!! 
24240 4 I have purchased several accessories this year for my new Nikkon d3200 camera this year. Each item s quality has been excellent and functions as described. Also, each item included a lens cloth. Would not be concerned at all about purchasing items from this seller. 
24241 4 500 slides in 4 hours and works as advertised, now its a paper weight. I will sell it for 80 bucks! 
24242 4 I bought this to use as a baby monitor and could not be happier. An underrated feature of the Nest Cam is the night vision. It s amazing and the set up is incredibly easy. 
24243 4 Perfect for theatre, clear and easy to focus. 
24244 4 Excellent item, poor internal Memory, but all good. 
24245 4 Great case. Pelican or nothing. 
24246 0 This unit was bad from the start, would not hover, always moves down or up and to the side 
24247 4 good kit 
24248 0 Didn t have the correct parts with this product 
24249 3 Great, affordable, professional variable filter. The slider ring is a bit wonky, but for the price a great buy. Use it on my Sigma 18 - 35 f/1.8. Helps me stay wide open when I need it. 
24250 4 Excellent 
24251 4 Just what we needed! 
24252 4 Perfect.... Easy to fit everything needed... And keep everything protected! 
24253 4 Worked perfectly. I recommend it. Top craftsmanship. Bought several rolls, All rolls performed at 100%. Quality Control at 100% too. I will buy again from this vendor for sure. Happy customer = repeat business!!!!!!!! 
24254 3 charge doesn t seem to last very long. 
24255 4 Excellent kit has all advertised items and seem to be very good quality. The case is perfect, all items fit in it and looks to be excellent quality. The kit has just about everything a person needs to keep camera and lens clean which will provide very high qualtiy photos. 
24256 4 Excellent, works like a champ, fits my camera (Thank you to all the other buyers who answered all my questions) and I received it so fast I was able to take it on vacation! 
24257 4 This is a great item to have on hand 
24258 1 so so 
24259 4 Freaking awesome! Love this product! 
24260 3 Good 
24261 0 I have ordered a new one. But the box was opened, display was dirty and user manual was missing. I have returned it on the same day. 
24262 4 It works perfectly! I am very happy with it!! 
24263 3 my daughter loves this camera 
24264 4 Works in my old Kodak C743. I am thrilled. It arrived quickly and as described. 
24265 4 looks exaclty as it is pictured here. havent used it yet but cant wait to. looks very heavy duty. 
24266 4 Excellent and excellent customer service. Highly recommended. 
24267 4 I know FLIR makes some amazing products but a thermal imaging unit for an iPhone??? Who would believe it? Well this actually works - and quite well. Software easy to load. Easy to set up and use. You can change the image coloration for different situations. I am truly amazed. 
24268 4 Haven t been able to use it yet but for the price you can t go wrong. 
24269 4 Just got these for my Nikkor 55-300 Lense and they are a great value and were quickly shipped. 
24270 4 Well made, I took my ripped neewer sandbags that came with the boom are and just stuffed them right inside. No complaints. 
24271 4 This is awesome for indoor photography. I can take photos indoors without using flash. What else would you want? 
24272 4 Really love d it! Something in what you can really make an investment. 
24273 4 Breathed new life into my Canon 1D Classics! unbeatable price and quality! 
24274 4 Worked as expected 
24275 4 I love it. 
24276 4 covers the lens just fine. 
24277 1 Shut the camera on and off and starts and stops the recording well. Zooming starts at one speed than goes super fast for the second half of the zoom. Why? Cheap electronics. Spend little money and you get cheap crap. Look for another. 
24278 4 Very fun to play with 
24279 0 My iPhone took better pics. Not kidding 
24280 4 Price is right, and it works fine. 
24281 2 Was too large and bulky for my purposes - it was a nice bag and well done but not for my situation. Returned with Amazon no hassle return. 
24282 4 lovely 
24283 4 I bought this for my 17 year old for her birthday. She loves it! It s retro, but easy to use. The Fugifilm Instax Accessory Bundle Set is a Must Have ! It s also easy to get film for. 
24284 4 Does what it s supposed to do! 
24285 3 Case is a little big for my camera, but it is well protected and has compartments for the charger and anything else you might need. 
24286 1 tried to get in touch with company know one answer the telephone. tried 3 times. my uniden wireless video surveillance will not record just brought it in MAY THIS YEARhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/41GID61XwkL._SS300_.jpg 
24287 4 Love this light, works great, well built! 
24288 4 This little thing will change my videography experience completely. 
24289 4 Good Fast service and as advertised. 
24290 3 Beware the firmware updates... mine fell out of the sky after the most recent update... moral of the story is if you have a firmware that works just stick with it and don t update. Worked amazing before that though... 
24291 4 Best purchase I have ever made :) I ve used it in so many vacations already! Perfect underwater pics! 
24292 4 item is as described by seller, reach on time. no problem so far...recommended seller and product 
24293 4 Works well, however if you zoom into scene, this doesn t show you your new &#34;frame&#34;. 
24294 4 Everything fits perfect in the bag. 
24295 4 Very comfort, very good size if you have children and need to carry their stuff and your slrs. 
24296 4 love love love my green screen! 
24297 4 Very high quality product. It has a cover for the LCD screen AND the control panel. Difficult to tell that it is even installed! 
24298 4 A great buy! 
24299 3 Good size for all you spare parts and gear. My 2 go pro fit great and plenty of cut out. 
24300 4 Great clarity and viewing anglle. Works wonderfully at night as well. IR have even assisted an older camera I have as a backup to this one. 
24301 4 So far this has been a great replacement battery. I will probably buy another one. It charged up just fine and so far has been flawless. 
24302 4 Just getting to know this wonderful camera. So far it is flawless. 
24303 4 We use these to watch birds at our feeder. My wife just loves them. They are easy to focus, use, and store. I am glad we made the purchase.. 
24304 2 Red light never stops blinking, but works as intended - A deterrent. 
24305 0 The battery was exhausted after using it two times. Learned this while on vacation. 
24306 0 No memory stick was included though it is listed!! Very bad 
24307 4 Excellent product! Very satisfied with the quality and prompt delivery. 
24308 4 Great filter, exactly as I expected. Most likely will buy a couple more.... 
24309 4 Great Service! Great Price on a very good camera! Arrived ahead of time 
24310 4 Great bag! wish the top was big enough to hold a laptop though 
24311 4 I like the design of the camera. The packing is very safety, without any damage to the camera. 
24312 4 Good Product 
24313 4 nice product, quick delivered, good description 
24314 4 Works excellent keeps my cam from fogging up. Fits well without messing up the case. 
24315 3 I like it because you can fly inside without hurting the house, kids, pets, or quad copter itself, too badly. 
24316 4 Batteries work really well. :-) received products timely. Thanks 
24317 3 All is well. I am happy with with the items purchased from this seller. However, I didn t catch the writing that said that it only extends 8&#34;.... I was under the impression that it was 18&#34;....guess there was a smudge on my eye glasses!! 
24318 4 nice bag for camera 
24319 4 Excellent beginner camera! 
24320 3 works great, but hard to close cover and can t see display on GoPro 4 Silver.... small block should be moved to other end of line than it would be perfect 
24321 4 Excellent product. Excellent transaction. 
24322 4 This camera is in perfect condition and works great. 
24323 0 I bought 3 pairs. I have tried to use 2 so far. Each box had a faulty locking mechanism on one of the stands. It would not support the Arlo in a fixed position. I am going to have to epoxy the ball in order to make it work properly. 
24324 4 Received a day early, thanks. I know where I will shop for my security needs in the future. 
24325 4 Works great. Auto open feature is nice. It fit my NX Mini very well. It is perfect for protecting the lens when not in use, and you don t have to take it off to take photo s. 
24326 4 I brought this on a road trip out west and it performed beautifully. It s funny how close you have to get to the subject to &#34;zoom&#34; in on them. I adore this lens! 
24327 4 I really like the trigger I have a Canon 600ex and a Yongnuo 600ex flash. It works great with both and has a added a new dimension to my flash photography. 
24328 4 I love the camera. It does everything they promised. Very clear picture and set up was very easy!! Loved it!! 
24329 0 I used this for one day,then this thing broke 
24330 4 The price couldn t be better for this all-manual flash, especially if you re new to using off-camera flash equipment. Being forced to use manual settings will teach you more in 10 minutes than anything. I love this guy and ll be buying more! 
24331 1 Product did not connect wirelessly at all. Worked with hardwire but free web viewing was primitive. I expected a whole lot more from Samsung 
24332 4 Excellent does what it says. 
24333 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24334 4 Very helpful to tighten and loosen the camera mount. Recommended! 
24335 4 Really enjoying the camera. Optical zoom is incredible. 
24336 4 Smooth as butter once you learn how to handle it. There will be some delay in response when the spinning wheels have to change direction, but once you get used to it, the smoothest tracking shots will be yours! 
24337 3 Very good bundle. 
24338 4 Great telescope&#34; 
24339 4 They work perfectly fine for my cam. Needed a charger and extra batteries and nice that the bill for the price they are awesome. 
24340 0 Waste of money. The ink does not disappear, it just loses color, from blue to light grey, but everything can be read. 
24341 4 No trouble, its working, every thing its OK. 
24342 4 works well and has nice features 
24343 4 great! help a lot 
24344 4 I asked if this battery would fit the Geekpro cameras and received 2 responses, one person did not know and the other stated that it would NOT. Well, it fits perfectly, works great and came about 90% charged! I would (and probably will) buy more! 
24345 4 This flash is equivalent to the canon alternative at a fraction of the cost. I have used it for events and weddings and may never bu Canon flashes again. 
24346 4 So much fun to share these pictures w/ friends and family! 
24347 3 It s great in the sunshine. it can t perform well under low light situation... I can t even take photo in a japanese sushi bar with this lens.. I use my f4 lens instead in such situation. 
24348 4 I bought it together with Eye-fi mobi 8GB SD card for my Nikon D300. It works and I am happy with it. 
24349 3 Did fine under water 
24350 4 Buy genuine always if you want it to last for 3 years with no worries. 
24351 4 Incredible camera, prints very good quality photos. Doesn t come with an SD card so can only store about 16 photos at a time, but fantastic besides that. Ability to change exposure / etc really makes this a step up from an instax 
24352 4 Both batteries hold charge and were delivered quickly. 
24353 4 Great binos. I ve used for both for general and bird watching. These are very good for lower light situations. 
24354 4 a 
24355 4 It s a battery. It works. Charge seems just as good as the Canon batteries 
24356 4 Very cute print, doesn t look cheap. Very trustworthy on my canon rebel 
24357 4 Works as advertised. 
24358 0 These plastic &#34;filters&#34; I knew would be on the margins of uselessness, and I was not disappointed. They attach poorly to the camera, increase distortion and reduce light transmission, and don t really filter out the wavelengths that they are intended to filter. Don t waste your money. 
24359 4 An amazing lens that every camera owner should have. A great value because the price includes lots of extras. Speedy delivery, nicely packed. Thanks! 
24360 4 Great film, but I wish it was a bit cheaper for returning customers. 
24361 4 No issues does the job. 
24362 4 An excellent companion to the FZ-1000 
24363 4 Super light you can throw it on your shoulder and forget its even there. Not the most comfortable but is the most convenient. Would not recommend for sitting a long time. 
24364 4 Love it! This lightening has changed my professional look to the too of the list. My videos want be the same without it! Thanks :) 
24365 3 Very nice and comfortable sling bag. As described. Improvements could be a rain cover and a large pocket at the back to fit my iPod mini. I use my mini to review my pictures so it s always with me. 
24366 4 Closes tighter than my original gopro case. Works great with the cut out for my mic. 
24367 4 Great Great 
24368 3 just as described,,thanks 
24369 3 it works 
24370 4 Excellent oversize MagicFiber screen pack. Perfect for my huge laptop screen, multiple desktop monitors and also for our HD TV screen. Would gladly buy again from this seller! 
24371 4 Love this product. The camera and cable fits perfect. The directions were simple and installation was a breeze. I was concerned about the sound quality, but much to my surprise, it was outstanding. I love it so much I just ordered a second case. 
24372 3 I think that these batteries might be better than the Pentax originals. 
24373 4 Worked great for reversing the polarization of the lcd display on my motorcycle. Now it s black with white numbers. Looks awesome! 
24374 4 Excellent product with great service response from the vendor. 
24375 4 I used the head strap while climbing a mountain. I really got some great shots, allowing me capture the entire event seemlessly. 
24376 4 nice camera great price 
24377 4 Great camera especially for the price. Had lots of accessories with it too. Have been using for a few weeks and have not had any issues. Not sure why people would spend 10x s as much for the name brand version. 
24378 4 Quick response, product quality is excellent. 
24379 3 Good product. 
24380 4 I love this camera. very easy to operate. 
24381 4 This is awesome for teenagers and super simple to connect. I wish it would come with more paper. I have not priced how much it is to get extras but my teens loved this!!! 
24382 4 Fit was perfect and a great replacement to the original. 
24383 0 2 bulbs and 1 stand did not work. Very cheaply made. 
24384 4 Great and quality product. I have been using it for years now. 
24385 4 Item worked perfectly! Great pictures and video. 
24386 4 I dive very often and this filter system is extremely handy. The photo/videos are much more vibrant and having the option to switch to a different filter ensures your photos come out amazing. Two thumbs up and a 5 star from me. 
24387 3 Just wished there was an updated version of this with VR. Other than that it works fine. 
24388 4 Very smooth operation. For the price it is as good as it gets 
24389 4 This combination of two batteries and a charger was less than half the cost of one battery from a conventional store. 
24390 3 Very good products, but the floating handle is not completely sealed. On the last trip some water has entered inside it. 
24391 3 Not bad for the price 
24392 3 I have not flown it yet but all put together it feels very solid. I would rate five stars but there was no instructions and I had a little bit of difficulties putting g it together mostly my fault also there is no Allen wrench included which sucked. 
24393 4 VERY happy with this camcorder! The video and the stills come out clear. Amazing package for the price. Will recommend it to my entire Video class at school. 
24394 4 This bag fits everything I need it to fit. Very durable! 
24395 0 I had them for couple of month and started to fade. Not a good buy 
24396 3 Handy camera. Great Zoom ability. Its easy to switch from still to video.

24401 4 The carrier is well made, it holds the film flat with little loss of the image. 
24402 4 Works great! 
24403 4 Love, love, love! Cute and easy to use. Took a bit of practice to get used to the settings but I love the surprise on how the picture turns out.

24410 4 Great camera! Excellent underwater photos. 
24411 4 Charged up great and have been using them with no difficulties! 
24412 4 The hood works great. Awesome lens hood, fits perfect and tight on the lens. I would recommend this hood. 
24413 4 Fits well! That s all you need really. 
24414 2 This is a decent remote. It just is really really small and feels kind of chintzy. But the price was right, so it ll do! 
24415 4 best half-case ever! grippy, lightweight, well-crafted! J.B. is the best...just when I thought the bamboo & walnut grips were great! 
24416 4 beautiful made and great results 
24417 2 Didn t love the results I had with this, but to be fair, I didn t test it out for very long before deciding I didn t want to keep it. 
24418 4 A+++++ 
24419 0 Not worth it. Daughter was excited to get it but after a few hours lost interest. 
24420 4 Perfect for our news show!!!! 
24421 0 does not fit! 
24422 4 Good quality and value. 
24423 4 So nice. All the items made the gift even bettwr 
24424 4 Batteries work great and saved a ot of money over the Canon brand. I am hoping the maintain their current change ability in the future too. 
24425 2 I have had issues with the stand in this set. The rest seems to be ok, but the stand keeps falling apart. Not high quality 
24426 4 Excellent APS-C sensor paired with a beautifully crafted 28mm (equiv) lens results in fantastic images. It s compact and unobtrusive. Perfect for street photography but it performed well on a cityscape sunset photoshoot. I d certainly recommend this product. 
24427 1 Very cheap. Broke on first use 
24428 3 Lasted about a year. Worked great in the meantime! 
24429 4 Excellent for sending power + video to remote cameras using cheap cat5e cable I got cheaply at a thrift store. 
24430 4 Perfect 
24431 4 Very good!!! 
24432 4 For a photography maniac comes in super handy. Charges fast. Has been in use for about 3 months now, and i charge them about once or twice a week. So far have not observed reduced battery lifetime. 
24433 4 GREAT PRODUCT 
24434 4 Excelentttttttttt 
24435 4 Use for protect my NX500 camera, looks amazing, pretty vintage and always at hand. Remember my grandpa s camera. 
24436 4 Great product 
24437 3 Have a Nikon D3300. Only received one of the two lens cap keepers, but even if I received the second one, probably wouldn t use it. Fell off rather quickly. Need better adhesive. Lens cap fit perfectly, and the HeroFiber cloths are amazing. 
24438 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
24439 4 doesnt hurt my neck at all 
24440 4 Great! 
24441 2 very hard to adjust 
24442 4 Gift for husband, he loves it! 
24443 4 Held like iron. Pleased. 
24444 4 These are great, hold two light stands, and other bits inside. The only thing I don t like about them is they take a couple I weeks to get them, but I have ordered them twice now. I think they are worth the wait. 
24445 4 Perfect 
24446 0 I bought this camera for vacation, I went threw 3 sets of batteries within 75 pics. The camera will not power off unless the batteries are removed. Not the best picture quality either. Keep shopping. 
24447 4 Had them now for two and half years and they are working great, they keep the charge capacity very good. 
24448 1 Sun shade is visible when not zoomed. 
24449 3 Sticky tape doesnt last. Otherwise the picture quality is great. Using it for USPSA shooting matches. Works awesome. 
24450 4 very happy with product 
24451 3 I like these cameras, they are doing their job. I already had 2 so I bought 2 more from amazon 
24452 4 Exactly like the one that came with our camera. Now we have a spare. 
24453 1 This only worked briefly before it just quit working. It was a cheap option I went with and ended up having to spend more money on another one. I should have not skimp on quality just to save money 
24454 3 It s great for nigh macro photography. 
24455 4 Nice cheap replacement to old camcorder had laying around 
24456 2 I didn t like not like this product very much. The material felt in-considerably cheap for the cost of the item., the album is very hard and stiff which makes it difficult to flip through the pages. Additionally, the pages after regular use start to detach. 
24457 4 Great batteries for the price 
24458 3 Just perfect! Thank you! Works great! 
24459 4 Fits and chatges perfectly 
24460 4 Used this for a wedding guest book alternative and the guests loved it! 
24461 3 Understanding the manual is not easy. 
24462 4 Works perfectly 
24463 0 Listed as a micro 4/3 adapter but when I revived the item, its for T2 adapter. 
24464 4 Can t be beat for the price, this is a professional grade monopod for the videographer on a budget with a very smooth pan & tilt...great product!!! 
24465 4 this works surprisingly well with my P520 camera. I m just mad i didn t buy it sooner. 
24466 4 Excellent quality, fast charger, they fit snugly but perfectly. 
24467 3 Quite expensive but works really well. 
24468 4 Awesome !!! 
24469 3 Small, but mighty. I carry it in my pocket when on excursions. 
24470 4 Really works well can t tell the difference 
24471 3 Excellent little camera but a bit difficult to program. Went online for help and found different opinions mostly negative to the programing. After many atemps, finally got it to work and I am happy with it. 
24472 4 Great service and product. 
24473 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
24474 4 Works very well & I would purchase again from this company. 
24475 1 don t try to recharge these with an auto charger cord or adapter plug! it will actually drain the battery. 
24476 2 After two years, still can t access remotely. One of the cameras went from color to black and white after a year. 
24477 4 I used it in the Caribbean and I m totally happy that I bought it... 
24478 3 Wasn t happy with the camera at all 
24479 4 Great! 
24480 4 Will return to seller. 
24481 4 Free charger and battery, what a deal, why buy &#34;GoPro&#34; when you can get same product for a fraction of the cost. 
24482 4 Quick delivery and excellent products 
24483 4 Simple design, easy to use, and saves me money. I had two different people ask me to look at it because both had lost their GoPro s in the surf and had to buy new cameras. 
24484 0 Not what you expect.....very cheap and honestly should have a recall!!!! How do I return this? 
24485 3 It s a good charger everything came in great. The car charger is awesome as well. Overall great product. I was a bit skeptical buying it but it met all my expectations 
24486 4 This lens hood fits perfectly on two lenses and seems to good provide good protection from stray light, preventing flare. Works great! 
24487 4 loved it.....specially the sensor....my guests enjoy it very much! 
24488 3 works great when you remember to take it with you. LOL 
24489 2 Works fine. 
24490 3 Works great for what it is. 
24491 1 I was excited to get but I was a little disappointed when I got it When I put my phone and hold it, it doesn t feel sturdy. It feels like it is missing something to hold it together. 
24492 4 Only got one like everyone else s review... and my roommate purchased these through my recommendation and she only got two.. But they sent me the 4 pack right away! 
24493 0 There are alternate option available for lesser price when you compare the quality of this product 
24494 4 My son s a photographer and he loved this product! 
24495 4 Awesome, better than what I could have imagined!!!! 
24496 0 Didn t work with my d3200 
24497 4 Thanks 
24498 4 Fits the camera all right, comfortable to use. 
24499 4 Love it 
24500 4 It was perfect ,arrived extremely late lol but product was new and I m happy with it. 
24501 4 Nice product, all is well 
24502 4 Bought for my little cousin. She loves it. Film can get expensive though. 
24503 0 It did not work at all 
24504 3 Smaller than I expected. Work great for a variety of projects. 
24505 4 great transaction. Product as described 
24506 4 Very hood 
24507 3 Bright, floaty, and easy to use. 
24508 4 For the price it is a great little camera. 
24509 3 Nice 
24510 4 This was a great price. Want to add more shooting time? This is a must have. This also adds stability when handling the camera. 
24511 4 Wearing glasses can be a curse, especially when dealing with the eye piece on a camera. The Hoodman has proven extremely useful in easing that issue and now that I have it, I m not sure how I did without it before. 
24512 4 Camera fits. Not much room for anything else. 
24513 4 Good 
24514 3 I really like this camera very much, shoots good pictures! 
24515 4 Easy to use for my first digital camera. Pictures I have taken are very nice with the effects I wanted. 
24516 0 It malfunctioned and I m actually trying to return it and get a refund 
24517 2 Good basic wifi ip camera, The down side, are the installation instructions, i had to use a third party IP Camera viewer to use. Not in English, 
24518 4 Took very good underwater pictures and videos! 
24519 3 ok 
24520 4 great 
24521 4 Awesome 
24522 2 Works well just tough if you don t have the proper TV. 
24523 4 Just have received this and it works just as advertised. Blue tooth connected quickly and my iPhone6 fit just right. 
24524 4 Have a Canon EOS T5. Fits pefectly. Holds all accessories plus some. 
24525 4 Made a fire in 15 seconds, first try right out of the box! The magnifying lens works great too! 
24526 4 This camera is fantastic, quick and small enough to carry all day casually, yet it has plenty of features for when you really want to dial in those amazing shots to remember. Works great for everything I ve thrown at it and has good battery life. 
24527 2 Bulkier than expected. Difficult to get focused. Researching the YouTube tricks to adjust the internal stuff adjusted 
24528 3 good 
24529 4 Excellent system. My husband bought it for a client, and he says it has excellent resolution! Unfortunately he couldn t test the remote viewing feature as the location where it was placed does not have internet option. But other than that, a very good system. 
24530 4 Works perfectly with my set up. Great deal! 
24531 4 Best small camera I ve used. And, it has an interchangeable lens!! 
24532 4 Good camera, be aware of sellers, some send Chinese version and there is no way to change OS 
24533 0 I bought 2. Nice resolution when working. My unit failed within 8 months. This is not an outdoor camera. 8 months later it failed due to water inside the camera. The one mounted indoor is still working. 
24534 4 Simple, works well, and nicely priced. 
24535 2 I purchased as a gift. Please don;t bug me again for a review. 
24536 4 very confortable and useful 
24537 4 I wanted a frame for my GoPro and saw this. For the price I thought it was a great deal. I wanted the frame for better sound quality as well. I am pleased with this frame and it holds my GoPro very well. A great product. 
24538 4 Bought this for my husband--he loves it-stilling learning with it-something new each nite. Very happy with it ! 
24539 4 Thanks so much all products are in good conditions 
24540 4 Had lights with pull string and what an improvement this has made, no more trying to find the string in the dark. Walk in and the light turns on and can adjust the time the light stays on with no motion. 
24541 0 Plastic d ring that the strap attaches to broke after a week when the bag dropped from my shoulder to the crook of my elbow...now I have no strap, and I drop my camera :( 
24542 4 Very good. Great price and value. Will Recommend. 
24543 3 Not super ultra precise and perfectly accurate, but they do the job and they are certainly affordable. 
24544 2 Great little camera for the dough, great video. Batteries do not last very long, however bought some spare. The case cracked at the hinges with very little stress, so I only give it 3 stars. The accessories are great. Not bad for the price. 
24545 4 Works great. car charger adapter a real plus!! 
24546 4 Good for any water goer! 
24547 3 The lenses are very snug and require a bit of force to get into the holder. Otherwise, they are really nice and I love the &#34;wallet&#34; holder. 
24548 4 INCREDIBLE Camera... best I have ever owned... exceptional in every way... as advertised... arrived on time... NO surprises... THANKS, J 
24549 4 Works fine! Great price! 
24550 4 I love it!! It is most definitely the best camera I ve ever owned. It is easy to use and takes great pictures. 
24551 4 They fit perfectly, work great, and don t take too long to charge. 
24552 3 Overall great material made. I don t have the original one but happy with this one. WORTH! 
24553 4 Vast improvement over the other ones I have tries. The eye shield stayed attached the whole day out in the field shooting. 
24554 4 I m looking for the same bag just a little bigger, it works well made very well. 
24555 4 Works Great! I highly recommend it if you need so see how the colors will will look in print before you print. 
24556 4 GIFT FOR MY 12 YEAR OLD. OF COURSE SHE LOVED IT...LOL 
24557 4 I use this as a kitty cam when I am traveling and it is by far the best investment I ve made. I love being able to check in on my babies when I am away. 
24558 4 very good 
24559 4 This is my son s first real camera and he loves it. He has taken some really fantastic shots. 
24560 3 Works good. A little loose on the swivel but it does the trick. 
24561 4 For the GP4, the back cover is useless, but everything else works excellently and fits perfectly. Don t even but a GP4 without this kit to protect the housing and lens glass elements - it s just not smart. 
24562 4 As expected which is nice 
24563 4 Great product for the money. The kit got me off to a good start and the lens works perfectly. The more I learn the more use I have for each of the items in the kit so it was a wise purchase. 
24564 4 Excellent! Thank you!! 
24565 1 Heavy, difficult to open but worst of all. the micro SD cards do not stay in the cut outs and fall out when the case is opened. The foam that should hold the cards is too hard and the cards &#34;wiggle&#34; out 
24566 4 Came with batteries, worked inside through the walls & outside from a distance. Simple on/off buttons. Great product, highly recommend. 
24567 4 Charged up quickly, lights stayed on for 6 hours which is what the maker of the lights specified. I m happy. 
24568 3 Stable as stable gets, but heavy as hell. Seriously it is extremely heavy. 
24569 4 great battery for go pro last long and has pretty affordable price 
24570 3 For the price I think it works great!!! 
24571 4 should be in everyones bag 
24572 4 This replacement for my camera worked just fine. 
24573 2 It s ok for the price I paid for. 
24574 4 Delivery and product were excellent! 
24575 2 The viewer needs to be on a direct 90 degree/ perpendicular angle to see the true image and color. From an angle the image appears washed out 
24576 4 Awesome addition to my boyfriends warehouse where he shoots and is constantly moving around!!! 
24577 3 gets stuck when trying to remove the lens from the body of my camera but does the job otherwise. 
24578 4 Thanks so much. Fast shipping and great product :) 
24579 2 Got this without looking closely. It s made from soft low quality plastic... was expecting fabric. Worried it will get brittle over time and crack. The Gels very in quality and thickness. Honestly it feels pretty cheap. 
24580 4 I love looking at clusters and this eyepiece is awesome. I use Celestron X-Cels and this eyepiece is a great addition for the money. Very good optics for the budget astronomer like me. 
24581 0 Did not fit our camera. 
24582 2 Met expectations. 
24583 4 Love it but the velrco is AGGRESSIVE. Protect your curly headed kids and poodles from it s grasp. 
24584 4 Fast and easy transaction. Camera set up very simple. Happy with purchase. 
24585 0 Says wireless but won t connect to it. 
24586 0 Dangerous design. Cam weight causes it to tangle in lines causing kite to lose control. 
24587 4 Was useful in looking at some old slides. 
24588 4 Have to take &#34;innards&#34; of eyepiece out if you want to maintain the original view in the viewfinder - not difficult to do 
24589 4 Very good optical properties, perfect fit. 
24590 0 Legs won t stay extended. Ball head works well, but there is really no point to the extendable legs if they can t be locked in place. I will return this product. 
24591 0 Cant even record in daylight. Need I say more... 
24592 4 Really great asset if you are attempting to use available light and the light isn t cooperating. re-direct and use for fill or to enhance exisiting light 
24593 4 good quality 
24594 4 I like that the cord has an adjustment button. Other camera floats are sort of one size. Works well for it s purpose. 
24595 2 Little disappointed in the frame the picture it s self is smaller than I realized it would be. Also didn t get the remote, only good thing the company refunded me because of that & let me keep the frame so I guess I did come out ahead. 
24596 2 The on button is hard to push to get it turned on, video is fine, thank god for its remote. 
24597 4 It does the job. enough said. 
24598 4 Good items! 
24599 3 Good product but too big for my needs. 
24600 4 Works better than the original battery and the charger is great 
24601 4 After having my IRIS a month I really needed it. This is a perfect with. You do need to remove the props. But probably a good idea anyway. 
24602 2 This lease is a macro lens, but it lacks vibration reduction, so clarity suffers for close ups unless you use a tripod. 
24603 4 Fits the Nikon very well 
24604 4 We bought this for our wedding for a our photo booth. Works great. Takes nice pictures. I love that you can save the photos to an SD card. Very impressed. Would recommend. 
24605 4 Excellent...! 
24606 3 So far, i ve only used it a couple of times, and it s very user friendly. Great product for me! 
24607 4 Excellent product, I used the filters easily and the results were as expected. I recommend it 100%. 
24608 4 My son likes this for his camera. 
24609 4 case#c6725292 Agent AR004611 Excellent Customer Service and very helpfull. Nice product, nice quality and easy to use. 
24610 4 nice light case 
24611 4 Works better than I ve expected. 
24612 3 Amazing Stand. It s very strong. 
24613 4 Exceeded my expectations, perfect lighting for streaming online. 
24614 4 Perfect for my camera! 
24615 0 I have only used them 2 times. And 1 transmitter doesn t work. And 1 receiver the connector piece broke off and my flash fell off into my softbox luckily that caught it. 
24616 4 Good Bag! 
24617 4 Worked great thanks. 
24618 4 Excellent camera, great shots, crisp and beautiful...worth the purchase 
24619 4 Works well world wide or at least in Europe. 
24620 4 Excellent, couldn t be more satisfied... 
24621 2 if you are beginner with filter I would recommend it, because is cheap. it gives cause glare and you see the rim of the plastic holder. 
24622 3 Good case 
24623 3 Works fine. A little cumbersome to take on and off, but this is minor. Be careful not to over-tighten. 
24624 4 Works great. 
24625 3 It could hold a charge longer but it s good enough. 
24626 4 Perfectly fits Nex5-R 
24627 4 This was for my daughter and she really enjoyed it. Shipped right away so I enjoyed that. 
24628 4 Fits my new Canon 50mm lens. Works great, Price was great. 
24629 4 I love this lens. The optical capability is phenomenal for the price. I use ti with my K-x. Its great for potraits, and just street photography. Even some scenery. I love Pentax! Thank you!!! 
24630 4 I love this. Easy to use and light weight 
24631 2 Its okay. Fun to fly once you get the proper trim because otherwise it has a mind of its own. Also, the camera SUCKS! its worse than stand definition so if i keep it, I absolutely must find a higher def (real HD) camera for this thing. 
24632 4 Very good 
24633 4 Great batteries for Fujifilm camera.... They last long... 
24634 4 The best! 
24635 0 Did not met my expectations... 
24636 4 Great and reliable strap 
24637 0 This is a replica it does not work, I ve downgraded over 300 ps3s amd this clip is giving errors no matter what. Do not buy it s is not authentic 
24638 4 Fit perfectly on my hd ghost. 
24639 2 It s a total piece of crap but it works as a minimal travel tripod to throw into a bag and jump on an airplane for a shoot. 
24640 4 Awesome product. Works great in wet, hot, dry, or cold climates. Would recommend this to anyone that has a Gopro. 
24641 4 Fit great, last longer than the original! 
24642 0 DISSAPOINTED!!!! Only after a few shots, the battery went dead. I had it replaced but then I was greeted only with a blank screen. A total waste of time and money !!!! DO NOT PURCHASE !!! I gave this a 1 star only because NO STARS is not an option. 
24643 4 Great product, great price. Shipping was quick and everything was as described, very high Quality. I bought them for my Anart and they are perfect! I would buy them again and certainly recommend them to anyone looking for a back up or replacement battery. 
24644 3 Great filter. It is larger than 82mm(the threads to lens are 82mm) on the top half which makes it impossible to use with lens hood. 
24645 4 Great Tripod--Can collapse or extend to a good lenth. 
24646 4 great 
24647 0 Unfortunately it was DOA, display didn t work and it would not program. The process for obtaining a replacement is smooth as silk. I hope that it works so I can rave about it. 
24648 4 Very good camera. Works great! 
24649 4 easy to install 
24650 4 The bag was perfect for my equipment. Plenty of room for my lenses and camera bodies. I even managed to squeeze in a Metz CL-1 flash and various other accessories. The strap for the tripod is a must for bike riders. Good quality bag with plenty of padding. 
24651 4 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
24652 4 I couldn t stop reading. Loved the characters. This prompted a lot of discussion with friends. Totally recommend it. 
24653 4 Best thing ever i got for my flash. It work very good. Makes a difference!!!! Good material, you cant go wrong with this. 
24654 4 Great product and they perform exactly as expected. Much better than the permanently attached prop guards for ease of use with a carrying case. Comes with all the tools/parts needed to fit a variety of Phantom quadcopters as well. 
24655 4 Great value. Lens worked perfectly and nice extras 
24656 4 Great I didn t expect this kind tripod but I love it 
24657 0 The product description says that this is a &#34;Pre-made 125 foot RG59 and power cable&#34; Received and installed these only to find that is not RG59 as required by my security cameras. Laview says these are RG58 and they will not work. Buyer beware. 
24658 4 The battery has worked as advertised. 
24659 4 excelent 
24660 3 You cannot beat this lens as an end in itself, but if you attempt to stitch a pan at close range, you will discover some interesting distortion realities. Even long range shots will give interestingly distorted cloud formations without attempting any stitching. 
24661 3 Everything was as promised and the batteries are a life saver when traveling. I love the tripod it works better that trying to take selfies. 
24662 4 awesome. like this battery it s nice to have a spare 
24663 3 Decent quality for the price. Works well. Case fit perfectly onto my S4 (T-mobile). 
24664 3 Fit my A58 perfectly level comes in handy when not using tripod which has 2 levels. 
24665 4 Fits perfect on the new third generation 50mm STM 1.8 lens. Only difference is the price as this was about 25% the cost of the real Canon Lens hood. Camer neatly boxed with lens cleaning cloth. What a Deal!!!! 
24666 4 Light and durable 
24667 4 A must have for any lens! This keep me for loosing my lens cap. It was easy to stick it on the cap, no additional glue need. 
24668 4 Great price for a double item which solved me not having to find each one by its self. works great for what it was designed for. 
24669 4 good 
24670 4 Works well 
24671 4 Great price and perfect fit. 
24672 4 We love it! And we are ordering 2 more cameras. Night vision is perfect. 
24673 4 Wonderful keeps everything together. 
24674 3 great! 
24675 4 great products. Thanks 
24676 4 A good product. 
24677 4 Love this strap it was more of a blue than a green but still great 
24678 4 Love it! Takes beautiful pictures and is very easy to use. Small and lightweight. 
24679 0 I did order 2 of them..one for me and the other one as a gift..for my surprise my friend told me he got an empty box..with no pen inside..and was not able to replace it because it was after one month..and the box was outside US... 
24680 4 My original charger broke and I was luck to find this charger. It worked every bit as good as the original. I was very pleased in every way. 
24681 4 Works great with the app. The sound cuts in and out sometimes so it s hard to hear on the camera side. It might be when two people are watching it at the same time though. Pretty good quality to 
24682 4 This is a great camera. Could make due with a few advanced features, but I love it anyway :) 
24683 4 great product. helped immensely with my old slides. 
24684 4 Even brighter than I thought. Great deal. Thanks! 
24685 0 Not very good, it is loud and obnacious and it isn t very good quality. I DIDN T LIKE IT!! 
24686 3 Very nice lens. Used at sons baseball game standing at outfield fence 200 to 220 feet away. 
24687 4 Works GREAT 
24688 3 Works well 
24689 4 It s great thanks 
24690 4 Works great and easy to install. 
24691 4 Keeping my Nikon cameras powered on all my adventures! 
24692 4 I haven t got much use for it yet but I can see how it adds extra protection and would make it more visible if I were to ever drop the camera in the water, snow, etc. Good quality product. 
24693 4 great little camera, comes with all you need to use it. 
24694 0 Terrible. DO NOT BUY. Most do not even work. Pretty sure most of these reviews are not real. 
24695 4 The battery was exactly as described and arrived on-time in appropriate packaging. 
24696 3 Great strap for half the price of the black rabbit. I have used this on numbers of shoot and not have any issue with this strap. Stays in place all day even with a long lens on the camera. Again, can t beat the price. 
24697 4 The first really thin filter that lives up to expections. Recommended. 
24698 4 Actually used to give my pinhole USB webcam a wider field of view since clip held lens over it good. It also worked on my cell phone so I plan to get another. 
24699 4 Great product 
24700 4 These are too big for a back pocket but if I move lighting equipment I have them with me and they help a lot. 
24701 3 We ve had this product for 1 week. The charger and batteries work well. Only think that was a bit challenging was I really had to push to get the batteries to fit into the charger the first time. 
24702 4 Perfectly cute for a party or for photography props! They came with popsicle sticks to stick on to them which is way better than the small sticks that come with other paper photo props! Even came with chalk! 
24703 3 Battery inserts are a bit fumbly, but so far this device has performed great. As advertised. 
24704 4 Very good pictures and video quality. Price right for the product, very happy with the purchase. 
24705 3 So far so good.It took me less than 15minutes to get the camera up and streaming to my IPhone. The picture was crisp and colors were true. 
24706 3 I wish this was more robust, the top keep coming off when I use it.... 
24707 3 I have noticed no difference as far as I can tell at this point. I received them a week ago and have used them all this week shooting. Time will tell if they hold up. But the price is right! I have to say that. 
24708 4 Good batteries. I think they lose charge just a teensy bit faster than I d prefer, but they re good, solid products. 
24709 4 Perfect airline case for tripods, light stands, chargers, clothes, and umbrellas. Never gotten charged oversized either! 
24710 4 As advertised. 
24711 0 network browsing not possable due to ie 8 not supported unless you mak your computer less secure no updates avlaable 
24712 4 Perfect replacement for our dead mic at a great price. 
24713 4 This is the second on and still very happy, have purchased more to add to system. Good clarity and color. 
24714 4 Omg this lens is awesome I love taking nature pictures. I got it today couldn t wait to get it out of the box 
24715 3 I have used them for a year now & like it! 
24716 4 Excellent item for the cost 
24717 4 Works great 
24718 4 AS expected 
24719 4 Super versatile! Great product! 
24720 4 Came in the mail quickly and did not disappoint. 
24721 4 Fast service, product as described. Would do biz, again. 
24722 4 was a gift for a family member 
24723 4 Excellent product. Received the product faster than expected and the video and picture quality are great especially for the price. 
24724 4 Holds the GoPro just right 
24725 1 The bag is nice, but the top strap broke a few days after I started using it while on vacation. 
24726 1 They are what they are but the video quality isn t that great compared to my shorter cords. I thought my camera was going so I swapped it and same thing. 
24727 4 Very happy with it! Charges my nikon d3100 like a dream. 
24728 0 After 1 month of use, the anchor loop that the shoulder strap attaches to tore from the bag causing it to drop. Luckily none of my brand new gear was damaged. 5 starts to Amazon for processing my return and refund. 
24729 3 Can be difficult to use but definitely a great buy for the money. just takes some getting used to 
24730 4 loved the package deal 
24731 3 Compact lens and a must have addition for EOS M owners....makes the camera really portable. 
24732 4 Great set has everthing you need to keep your camera clean 
24733 3 The top is slightly crooked but maybe that s just me. Other than that it s really good. Especially for $15 
24734 3 Works as advertised. I installed most of them outdoors under my eaves and more than one year later all work just like new! 
24735 4 Great! Thank you very much....... 
24736 2 return 
24737 3 Quadcopter mount-- a bit heavey for flying--great photos--just under Mobius quality. 
24738 4 Gift for my granddaughter. She loved it! 
24739 4 It works well! 
24740 0 Neat idea, but this camera kept shutting itself off. That makes it useless. I contacted Polaroid, and they said that the problem was with the brand of SD card. That may be, but the camera should work with any card, especially a top name brand. 
24741 3 Liking this camera.... For the price I am impressed... 
24742 2 Getting shadow from this so still on the fence. maybe ill actually learn how to use it some day. lol 
24743 4 The picture quality is excellent, even with the night vision, FTP on wireless works very well too, love the camera and would like to recommend this to anyone. 
24744 4 Absolutely fell in love with the 6D the moment I had it in my hands. Just what I needed to enter into full frame. A great upgrade from the Canon Rebel Series. 
24745 4 Given as gift, recipient loved it. 
24746 4 Its a nice little lens, great under dark light but does not extend as far as I want that is why my 18-50 is probably what I will stick with. 
24747 4 I like it 
24748 0 It was the wrong charger. 
24749 4 NICE CAMERA WITH VERY CLEAR PICTURE. INSTALLED EASILY. GOOD LENSE FOR GENERAL &#34;AROUND THE HOUSE&#34; PLACEMENT. 
24750 4 Works great. 
24751 4 This kit has everything I need to have many options when using my go pro Hero 3 Silver 
24752 4 This set brought everything I need to introduce my students to electronics. 
24753 4 A birthday gift for my husband. He really enjoys the camera. Shipping was on time and in good shape. It was a very successful purchase. 
24754 0 Poor quality product, was broken when received. 
24755 4 Great product, it worked great! I recommend it highly! 
24756 3 It would be nice if the instructions made any sense. 
24757 4 Sensitive as it should be 
24758 4 Works great with my canon video camera 
24759 3 The bag was not the same as in the picture nor the ones previous buyers had. Besides that and the bag being a bit snug for my Canon, it is a good case. 
24760 4 Works great and shipped in a timely fashion! 
24761 4 We love the bag it is able to carry all the things for our camera. Shipping was awesome. 
24762 4 excellent 
24763 4 Much more durable than other third party eye cups! 
24764 4 Very efficient and they charge fast. Definitely a great comparison to the name brand of Canon. 
24765 0 I got to use it ONCE and it completely stopped working. Needless to say, I m a bit pissed about that. 
24766 1 The strap is neoprene. I have no confidence in it not wearing and breaking suddenly. I replaced it. 
24767 3 Cameras are useless without extra light at night. 
24768 4 Great little tripod. Even supports the weight of my Canon T5i with a large macro lens attached. Very handy for those quick shots that don t work well hand-held. 
24769 4 Battery came in fast and it works great. Ordered another one and that one works great. Would recommend the seller and the batteries. 
24770 4 Works well with the most Acra-Swiss mounts... nice compact design doesn t block battery door on most of my cameras. 
24771 4 This is an amazing camera bag. Its thick and durable. It has lots of compartments for your camera and lens. Great space for extra batteries and accessories. My fiancé loves it. well worth the extra few dollars. 
24772 4 Fits my camera perfectly. Very compact and high quality. I love the gray color! 
24773 4 Nice set 
24774 2 Can t get it to work. Long hours on the phone with D-link. It functions, but not as Dliink advertises. 
24775 4 Great replacement 
24776 4 Great lens! Takes nice sharp photos. It s a heavier lens so it takes some time to get used to. Using a tripod or upping the shutter speed will eliminate any camera shake. I use this lens more than I thought I would. Very happy with this purchase. 
24777 4 Worked awesome great extinsion for my rgbw led light strip. It s supposed to be for cameras but this power extinsion works like a charm for what I needed for great purchase 
24778 4 My old cord was giving me trouble this one seems real nice no trouble 
24779 4 Everything I wanted and more! Very good deal for the price. 
24780 0 I ve played with it a bit and I honestly can t say i notice a difference between my internal and external on my Mark II. I heard the Rode Video Mic Pro is the way to go if you want an honest good sound. 
24781 0 Did not work, gave my money away :( 
24782 4 Excellet 
24783 4 Great deal on this system. Very easy to set up and use. Very easy to set up the mobile app on iPhones. Just download the app and scan the QR code.... It instantly connects! Very helpful support forum on the Amcrest website. 
24784 4 Works perfect 
24785 4 A gift for my wife and she loves it. 
24786 4 ar004214 Great customer service, they walked me thru the set up and got everything working like it should. 
24787 4 Sick!!! 
24788 4 So happy with my new hard to find battery for my Nikon Cool Pix Camera! 
24789 4 If you have a gopro you need spare batteries. I ve used Wasabi for a hero3 and now for my hero4. I don t really notice any amazingly longer runtime, but they work and are dependable. Best part is the charger that comes with, very convenient 
24790 2 For the price they are fine, but they don t really fit exactly. If you are easy on them the work fairly ok 
24791 4 Super well made item. Great price! 
24792 2 just okay some lenses are usless 
24793 4 work great 
24794 4 Just as expected 
24795 4 Perfect! 
24796 3 Great Product will buy again. 
24797 4 All work perfectly with my new go pro hero 4. Every bit of kit feels nice and solid and well made. This would certainly meet the needs of most thrill seekers. 
24798 2 The bag holds my camera equipment but just did not expected to be so big 
24799 4 Good price fast delivery 
24800 4 Great piece of equipment, well built and filters as it should. 
24801 4 Nice product! Great for hiking. Just attach to bag while you hike and charge your batteries. I would recommend it to anyone. 
24802 4 NEEDED SUPPLIES 
24803 4 Got this camera for my son who is studying photojournalism. He loves this camera. 
24804 1 Seems way less than 52. 
24805 4 I am always pleased with the Sigma filters. 
24806 3 Worked as expected, easy to install. 
24807 4 Perfect! Hold flash, diffusion dome, spare batteries and has a belt loop. Nice, solid, sturdy durable fabric. Expect to use it for years to come bgs. 
24808 2 very convenient in certain situations. 
24809 4 I purchased two of these and bought a third one today! Great product. 
24810 3 Good product, delivery on times, I like it ! 
24811 0 broke after 3 months and i can t find a warranty 
24812 4 This was my first reflector purchase and it looks just like the picture. I don t think the material is flimsy, but I am not hard on equipment either. 
24813 4 This is a very nice storage case. I would repurchase again. 
24814 4 Came rapidly and on-time. Exactly as advertised. I am impressed with the instruction material that came with it. There is little else that you might want to head out prospecting. 
24815 4 Perfect as shown, thank you. 
24816 4 tks 
24817 4 A+ great doing business with you. Great product. 
24818 4 worked great on raining days in canada 
24819 0 Advertised as wireless, but only works when hard wired to the other speaker....useless. I returned it. 
24820 4 as expected 
24821 2 Not very good quality batteries. Don t hold near as good a charge as name brand batteries. 
24822 4 For the a7rII. Fits perfectly. No compatibility errors with the battery. Both battery icons appear on top right corner. Looks and feels like the camera body and grip. All custom buttons, wheel, and AF/MF buttons function correctly. Meike Battery Pack. $340 cheaper than original. 
24823 3 Service was great, arrived on time but after a day of use it broke, it could ve been that I was over using it but my advice is just be careful with it 
24824 4 These little pieces make a big difference, great experience from seller! 
24825 4 Great product and good price 
24826 0 i can t get the thing to record. some how when i got it to work it won t play on my computer. i find it junk. 
24827 4 Thank you 
24828 4 Easy to install. Easy to use. Great pics! Will buy another. 
24829 4 It works so well, I love this. 
24830 4 I LOVE this lens! Not great in low light without a tripod because there s no stabilizer for shake but if you re outside, it s great for the price! 
24831 4 Great stand sets up quickly, and supports large modifiers well. If weight is a consideration, this beast is heavy. 
24832 4 Great price and fast shipping. Works fine with my Nikon D3200. 
24833 4 Great for party use you don t have to be a professional to use. Takes excellent pics with little effort. 
24834 4 Very NICE 
24835 4 This film is beautiful and I could not be happier with it! 
24836 4 Loves that it doesn t twist once the gopro is attached 
24837 4 A++++++++ 
24838 3 Good 
24839 2 probably just wasted money on this. 
24840 2 Had to tighten spring clip to hold wire in! 
24841 4 Very easy to use and clear. 
24842 3 Perfect was what i need 
24843 3 Love the camera works great outdoors. Love the WFI to send pictures to my tablet or computer. 
24844 3 Works great but sometimes freezes and has to be restarted - great value for money! 
24845 4 works great ,fast shipping 
24846 0 Didn t even work... WTF 
24847 1 Not as useful as I thought it was going to be. 
24848 2 It s good to have these for Cloud functionality. However, I thought this can be used as a NAS. It s basically a personal cloud storage if you re trying to find one. 
24849 4 Good battery at a good price 
24850 4 Holds up just like the one that came with my D5300! 
24851 2 turn nob past first click to switch on, but the light only comes on when turn 1/3 of the way on. so the range is only 2/3. 
24852 4 Got for my Canon Rebel T3i. Works great!! Great price as well! 
24853 0 Even when moving the lens around to optimal placing over the camera, the photo quality is terrible. 
24854 3 I bought a 7mm one and find myself using my 32mm omni much more, go figure. Eye relief is better than regular omni plossl eps at the shorter focal lengths.but it is quite large and heavy, be ready to rescue and rebalance your rig if needed. 
24855 4 Perfect, exactly as described. 
24856 4 Good. Does the job 
24857 0 POS, will not even show up when plugged into computer. Garbage 
24858 4 Super incroyable 
24859 4 Nice one I use it for birding to get easier focus in which part in suspect i want 
24860 4 Gives me the extra battery life I need when using my GoPro while traveling. I also love all the adapters and the car charger. I travel internationally frequently and this gives me the ability to take my GoPro anywhere. Thanks, Wasabi! 
24861 4 Works great and Good price 
24862 0 Mine worked fine for two years and then out of the blue they both quit. Will not reset or connect to wifi anymore. Philips tech support couldn t do a thing. 
24863 4 Excellent quality and super fast shipping! 
24864 4 one of teh best thing i ever got!! 
24865 4 Very Good 
24866 4 It se a grate camera!! 
24867 3 The lens lid barely fits with the filter on, so I have to be really careful not to lose the lid. 
24868 4 Great replacement and very affordable 
24869 4 Love the camera! 
24870 3 Like the frame picture display and thickness (so thin). Still work OK except once a while it shutdown by itself and I cannot turn it on except unplug and plug in again. Like the motion sensor and USB flash drive support. 
24871 0 This is not made of leather! 
24872 4 Good product for the $$ 
24873 4 as advertised 
24874 4 convenient product for system setup 
24875 4 Love this purchase! heavy duty tripod, is perfect 
24876 2 The housing feels weak and I have to constantly adjust specially on roller coasters. 
24877 2 These batteries seem to last about 2/3 s of the time the original camera battery does. 
24878 4 good stuff saves lots of time 
24879 3 Very Nice piece of equipment. Although refurbished it works as new. 
24880 3 very nice telescope but if you are not gonna leave it put together somewhere, setting up can be a pain. 
24881 3 Nice camera. Did need some Tech Support to get my remote set up. Vincent at Foscam Tech Support is AWESOME! He definitely knows what he is doing! 
24882 4 Good range, good picture. For the price the was a pretty good setup 
24883 4 It s a good protector for the lens, I use the camara for motocycle ride ando for car racing, so it is indispensable to protect your lens.it s crystal clear. 
24884 4 This is amazing I love the one of the best purchases I have made in a while! 
24885 4 Just as shown 
24886 3 Camera was very easy to set up. The image is clear. Features operate great. I now have 5 of there. The only drawback is that my computer slows down to a crawl when I have all 5 cameras up and running. Otherwise they nice and give me peace of mind. 
24887 4 This one is OK 
24888 4 As advertised. 
24889 4 Love this case. I bought it to carry my Panasonic Lumix FZ200. It fits perfectly, and I love the side compartment s. They fit an extra battery and memory card. 
24890 4 It s awesome. 
24891 4 Great quality quick shipping! 
24892 1 It s not so steady. Head strap and chest belt both. 
24893 3 Received it and works so far 
24894 4 Awesome. I use with BlueIris via wireless connection and get perfect video with no packet loss. (4000K, CBR, 20fps, 2048x1536, audio) Lot s of features for the money. These can hidden fairly easily into various nick-nacks around the home. 
24895 2 good 
24896 4 arrived before shipping estimate. good product 
24897 4 Nice lens! 
24898 4 Great 
24899 4 exactly what I needed. 
24900 4 I love this camera so much. I was a little worried when I ordered it cause there isn t any reviews but im glade I did cause its an amazing camera! you can take action pictures and they turn out great I love it! 
24901 0 Camera do not match photo. IR leds are not black like they are in photo. they are white. quality was bad. cheap joints and felt very poorly made. 
24902 2 I ve only used several of the accessories but they seem to perform reasonably well. 
24903 4 Got this thing for my hero3+ and was not disappointed. I really love the locking feature and the color makes it pop. Pretty sturdy for a gopole. Price is reasonable too 
24904 4 Product arrived promptly and exactly as described. 
24905 4 Works great 
24906 3 The batteries last as long as the original battery. I have found that having 3 batteries is plenty for most recordings. This gives you 3 hours of recording time with the Go Pro Hero Silver. 
24907 1 The stick itself is ok, but after a few uses during diving, appropriately cleaning it of saltwater and letting it dry, it s so rusted at the pole extension points and the screw that it leaves rust all over my hands, and is almost impossible to extend out now. 
24908 4 They work great with the Canon EOS Rebel camera 
24909 4 best idea ever 
24910 1 Not good, lens didn t focus well, most times it will go back and forth without focusing. When it did focus the pictures where ok, not great. The motor is slow and left me not impressed. 
24911 4 Purchased as a gift for a talented young photographer. No complaints from recipient. Request for IS lens important to him for taking video captures with unit. Canon or Nikon. Lexus or Infinity. Same argument. I have been a Canon user since 1972. 
24912 0 WORKED GOOD FOR 2 WEEKS 
24913 4 GREAT PRICE, GOT IT FAST! 
24914 4 Worked as advertised. Saved $. 
24915 0 Pros: Roomy, room to fit mroe than 1 tripod. Cons: Zipper broke after a year. Rating of 1 star because with a broken zipper its basically useless Would NOT recommend based on my experience.. 
24916 1 poorly made, first 2 broke when putting on lens 
24917 1 Fast Shipping but Zmodo is bad quality :( 
24918 3 Good in low light conditions. Nikon still needs to improve the lense covers. 
24919 4 Wonderful!Great quality! 
24920 4 THE best camera for vlogging. The wide angle (although fisheye) is very good quality and has many options when it comes to filming. The best part about this though is the AUDIO. Perfect sound 100% of the time, it is crazy how well the microphones work. 
24921 0 very nice way to view your photos.but the adaptor needs to be replace.it will stop the photo slide,the clock will also stop running.,the frame is very nice with a nice matting. 
24922 3 The RX 100 CAMERA is excellent. Some of the items that would come with the camera were missing (tripod), I have received 3 batteries instead of one, and a kit for cleaning the lenses that was not listed in the package I have bought. 
24923 3 good 
24924 4 great for photography back up. 
24925 0 This didn t work for me. The corners of the photo was shaded. Destroyed use of pictures. Be forewarned. 
24926 0 Glare... useless! 
24927 3 The battery can be overcharged? If you charge longer than 1 hour at 15 minutes, it seems to burn up the battery. 
24928 4 great gift! 
24929 4 I really like the timer and the resolution was so good, I ordered an extra pair. 
24930 3 a bit thin .. 
24931 4 great 
24932 0 First time out of the box...lines through the screen. SO disappointed with this product. 
24933 3 does the intended job, however would have been better if came with the actual bolt/screw so not having to swap out everything when needing to swap out 
24934 1 Flimsy. Can t hold my camera. 
24935 4 No problems 
24936 4 fits my camaer and woks as expected 
24937 3 A gift- but much appreciated. 
24938 4 Does what it s supposed to go, however if you take your Micro SD card and plug it straight to your laptop it makes transferring photos a lot quicker than just plugin the camera to your PC via usb. 
24939 3 i received with good condition and I m surprised because I find extra flash with it .....thank you 
24940 4 for a bearing slider at this price you can t complain. holds well, little bit of a drag on heavier cameras but overall great buy! 
24941 4 Works well, easy to install, kept track of home and horses while on vacation. Great to have peace of mind while not at home!! 
24942 0 Readout of battery levels different from camera screen indication. 2nd battery stop charging and become unrecognised after a while. 
24943 4 This is about the 4th or 5th one I have purchased. I love the price and it s the only camera I can find with an actual view finder for those sunny days when you can t see diddly on the screen. 
24944 0 Camera looked NIB but would not power on. I have ordered this twice and had the same problem with both. The first one worked for 10 minutes and then never again. Not the camera for me. 
24945 2 Its has little pouches on the inside for extra SD cards or at least 50$ in singles with out bothering the camera or making it difficult to close 
24946 4 Good product!!! It is working good, I m going to continue using it for a few weeks, so I ll can do an interensting review 
24947 4 These worked great 
24948 3 Great camera. Lots of features. One thing to remember: You only use the provided hardwired Ethernet cable to hook to your modem in order to setup the camera and then you disconnect it for wireless capability. Can be placed anywhere. Needs electrical outlet. Works great with android Samsung S5. 
24949 4 Nice tight fit. 
24950 4 Wish you could take off the strap. Otherwise works great. 
24951 1 Exactly a replacement for my old one. Delivered in 4 days, Excellent 5 Star 
24952 3 Easy to install, an happy with this purchase 
24953 1 I DO NOT KNOW WHO TO USE THAT ITEM meca1456@netzero.com THANK 
24954 4 Bought this to full my 8 ch Sannce DVR and work great 
24955 4 great product 
24956 4 AAA 
24957 4 Works well 
24958 0 This product is pure garbage. Would not work for me on android app or windows desktop app. Instructions are in broken English and the windows desktop app set off Korean language warnings from my firewall. I recommend not purchasing this. 
24959 0 Junk item! Didn t work, had to get Amazon involved before anything was done about it 
24960 4 Used them several times on the standard camera tripod mounting screw. Works well and I expect they will last a lifetime. 
24961 3 Very useful. 
24962 4 Works great, with the A6000 
24963 4 This is great! I found a YouTube video to show me how to set it up because it doesn t come with clear instructions, but it s a great product. 
24964 4 good value 
24965 3 Would have preferred a slightly larger interior. only holds one lens. But does hold all other gear - extra memory cards and batteries. 
24966 4 Great quality, mounts on tripod with tripod adaptor for ease of viewing distant objects or the stars and planets. 
24967 2 So far only 2 of the batteries hold a charge. Will update later. 
24968 4 worked great 
24969 4 Holds up well , good usage 
24970 4 Fits the camera well. Not much room for extras. Maybe an extra battery and memory card. Should pack well and protect camera. 
24971 2 Not a L series that s for sure... 
24972 4 Really great little mount for 3m roku projector. Durable and flexible, I only wish it were slightly longer legged. 
24973 4 I bought this remote for my GoPro Hero4 and it works great! Lost connectivity under water if you are more than a foot or so away from the camera but otherwise it was awesome! 
24974 0 Item start up the first time and would not start since. Have to return for repair/replacement. For the price, it should have this kind of of problems. Does not recommend until problem is solved. 
24975 3 The only problem I ve had is you can t get everything back in the case. Everything else has been great. 
24976 4 great tripod!! I highly recommend it!! 
24977 0 Both tripods broke, remote does not work, HDMI cord would not work, camera bag is big enough for the camera itself (no lens included) and batteries each lasted a good 45 minutes. 
24978 4 good 
24979 4 Awesome Attachment to my DSLR 
24980 4 This item is exactly what I wanted. 
24981 4 Took them to Yellowstone and loved them. Looking forward to using them this fall in the woods. 
24982 4 Everything you need is in this pack 
24983 2 Im ok with perfomance not as clear as I would exspect but they do work good. 
24984 3 This item was just what I was looking for. 
24985 4 Construction is a bit flimsy but for the price...WELL WORTH IT! 
24986 4 superb product. as described and perfect fit. 
24987 4 installed without a hitch. video segments for each system part is clear. appears to be a great system for the price. 
24988 4 As expected and loving it! Due to the padding you may run out of room if your using it as a camera/laptop bag. 
24989 4 works great 
24990 4 This is GREAT! Great Battery and I LOVE it has 12v USA Household Plug and has a Car Charger Built-In Option too! High Quality! 
24991 4 Fantastic! I love that this is mechanical and I don t have to worry about yet another battery running out. 
24992 3 good, 
24993 4 Everything I wanted. Great product for the price. 
24994 3 Worked as well as original Canon battery. Holds charge for a shorter time, but was expected and was long enough to not cause any problem. Worth the price. 
24995 0 More faded looking in person Top picture was taken without flash on an overcast day Book was taken with flash inside. Also was my first picture taken. Would like to know if I m doing anything wrong A real waste of money. was not happy with this product 
24996 4 Really well made and charges my batteries very fast. Had to have a second charger for the road when taking a lot of pictures and need batteries fully charged over a short time. 
24997 4 No complaints. 
24998 4 Kenneth at Foscam was very helpful in setting up my camera. He set it up via remote access in just a few minutes. very pleased with their support. 
24999 4 Perfect replacements for the battery that came with my camcorder. Could not ask for better. 
25000 4 So good 
25001 4 It was perfect, I did 3 weeks in Europe and I loved this bag every minute I used it. It held everything I could carry from passports to wallet to cameras and there was plenty of space for extra things. 
25002 4 They seem to work fine. They come in a nice box. Great Buy 
25003 3 Wonderful flash for the money. Serves my purposes perfectly. 
25004 4 Excellent but you may need a fitting/bushing so check the specs 
25005 4 LOVE this lnes! Amazing effects, wonderful quality & clarity, such a great range and extremely affordable compared to the Nikon 300MM 
25006 4 Love the strap. Comfortable and much longer than one that comes with the camera. 
25007 4 Works great with my copper river cleaning swabs! 
25008 4 ordered it august 10th and received it 3 days later. the shipping was obviously very fast. i love this camera so so much. i bought the used one and it is in amazing. the camera looks like its new. i just love this camera! 
25009 4 Nice package, needed battery for a camera. Ordered it since cheaper than batteries alone, happily surprised to find a charger that runs on 110v and 12v Even freebie minitripod and kens cleaning kit. All very practical and welcome. Batteries work as well as factory batteries. 
25010 4 Works great! 
25011 4 Received the filter as described and promptly. Fits perfectly and is good quality. 
25012 4 Delivered on time. Perfect fit for camera and lens. 
25013 4 It s sturdy, good quality and how it floats in both fresh and salt water makes all the difference. 
25014 3 Great light for the price! Super bright! 
25015 2 small, can not fit 2 full frame camera with L lens 
25016 4 Got these as spares. Can t be happier! 
25017 3 Works well, great price. I m pleased. 
25018 4 I like it very much. 
25019 4 Can t beat it for the price. It works and setup is quick and easy. 
25020 2 Works good! 
25021 4 delivered as promised. great condition 
25022 4 This strap helps carrying the weight of my camera. Having it hang as a cross body is much more comfortable. Great idea!! 
25023 4 This camera is for my granddaughter & she loves it. It arrived promptly & it is just as advertised. The picture quality is great under water &. Well worth the price. 
25024 0 Hate it...threw it in the trash, actually. It kept falling off and I was gonna lose it anyways. Save your bucks for one made by Cannon. 
25025 4 Works like a charm!!!! 
25026 4 Met my expectations fro protection of the camera body. The flash rail protection flap doesn t seem to stay on but other than that it fit well. 
25027 1 didn t fit my camera! 
25028 4 Great fit 
25029 4 For working on a studio, it make sense to have it connected. However, when working on portraits, it would turn cumbersome. I would recommend it for product photo. 
25030 0 I ordered a T-ring to Micro 4/3 adapter. One side is T-ring, but the other side is NOT Micro 4/3. It s for some other lens mount but it isn t labeled so I don t know what mount it actually is for. Definitely not Micro 4/3 though. 
25031 4 Very good 
25032 0 This lens cap was attached by a stick on button which can easily be dislodged. 
25033 2 The case is nice but it arrived smelling terrible, like it had been in a damp basement for many years. I was able to watch some of the smell out but I will probably just throw it out at this point. 
25034 0 Not nothing like you say it was. 
25035 0 The case is not a convenient way to store the GoPro and all its accessories. It is not versatile enough to allow everything to fit in an easily accessible fashion. 
25036 4 Good item 
25037 4 This product is perfectly suitable for a GoPro HERO 3+ Silver Edition which I own. It fits all of my accessories which include: a selfie stick, chest mount, head mount, charging cable, teather, surfing mounts, and other small accessories. 
25038 4 Great, no lag, you can see what you are capturing. 
25039 3 Took it with me on vacation and it was very easy to handle ....light weight....and kept my camera in good condition 
25040 4 Works well as aa standby battery.. 
25041 3 Have not figured out all the buttons yet but seems to be working well. My photos are very nice. 
25042 4 The picture is crystal clear and couldn t have asked for more. Great quality. 
25043 4 This is cool little camera 
25044 3 Great system for the price. I wish the zoom function was better. The over all picture is not the greatest but it will do. 
25045 0 Works once in a while 
25046 2 One of the camera is out of service 
25047 2 It wasn t as easy to set up as I thought. But, seems to take good pictures in the Easy Mode. 
25048 1 too complicated, it is a 2 piece lens hood 
25049 4 I was so excited that this was the exact cable I needed to download my pictures. It came quickly and was very reasonable. 
25050 3 Cameras work great. Would have been 5 stars but one of the power cords was defective. Had to contact company through Amazon. They did mail a new power cord so now all three cameras operational. Been using for about three weeks, no problems, very pleased with picture quality. 
25051 0 I got one of these ! It s only lasted one year before the DVR stopped working So I m going to return it and see if they will replace it ! I will change my review if they replace it! 
25052 0 No charger and no battery came with the item I order. 
25053 0 Not happy that I got it and it s broken - seriously needed it for holiday and I m leaving the next day !!!! 
25054 3 Makes the grip on the X100s far more secure and comfortable. I feel like I am using a Leica again! Stays permanently mounted on my camera as I don t use an external flash or other things in the hotshoe. For me it is a must-have for this style camera. 
25055 2 Ok not very practical 
25056 0 Not a good product. I sent it back 
25057 4 Very well price for the unit. Thanks. 
25058 4 Great set at good price 
25059 2 Somewhat difficult to access software, and difficult to find setting to NOT automatically &#34;share&#34; your pictures with all online applications upon download. Still have not figured out how to find the auto-focus setting. 
25060 3 This is a great camera for the price. Almost endless possibilities. 
25061 4 Just like the Orig. canon cap 
25062 4 Works great. 
25063 3 This is my go-to strap! The clip that came with it ended up breaking but I purchased a swivel to attach to my body and it works great. Have used this one for years. Highly recommend. 
25064 4 This hard case is well protected my Instax printer. Like it. 
25065 4 So far so good after a couple charges 
25066 4 Thoroughly pleased with the binoculars. Equally happy that I got them at a great price! 
25067 4 Very good item. 
25068 4 Fits our new little camera perfectly! My husband carries it on his belt. Very convenient! 
25069 4 Must have! Great addition and easy to install. 
25070 4 Battery works great with my Lumix G6. Similar performance to original branded battery. Fast charging also. Great Product so far. 
25071 4 Very good product. Had to wait a couple weeks and they came from So. Ca. I m just upstate. 
25072 1 captures motion only occasionally. 
25073 4 Adorable well packed great books included to give advice can t wait to use it 
25074 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Jha2Vzh7oU Have a look see These pages are so inspirational they have motivated me to write so many new songs and create many new videos which I post on Youtube I m only sorry you don t have a larger selection. 
25075 2 It is what it is 
25076 3 works ok but too much surface area for wearing on top of motorcycle helmet. It pushes the head back at anything over 65 mph. 
25077 4 Old school - solid made, great price. Worked on my Novation kit perfectly. 
25078 1 Its almost two weeks and I still do not have it working..directions are terrible 
25079 4 It works, so I can keep using my old nikon. 
25080 4 Very well designed and durable construction. 
25081 3 Easy to use wth lossless image quality. Trying to adjust features is difficult so I d recommend shooting in AV or Shutter priority. I d recommend for those that are looking to shoot underwater without breaking the bank. 
25082 3 The digital photos look great. Initially I had a remote control that did not work. I notified Aluratek and they sent a replacement remote control right away and now it works great. Not a bad photo frame for the money. Looking forward to adding more recent vacation photos. 
25083 4 WORKS LIKE A CHARM. When on vacation, I keep an extra battery in my bag and has come in handy. 
25084 4 Great thanks 
25085 4 Exactly what was needed - thank you 
25086 4 Fits perfectly at a reasonable price, recommended. 
25087 4 great replacement 
25088 4 Works as advertised. May not be quite the quality of the real thing, but for the $$$ it works good. 
25089 3 Haven t used yet, but looking forward to it. Makes setup a lot easier. 
25090 3 I would give 5 stars if it had blue tooth. Very nice camera for the price. 
25091 4 Works well. No problems. 
25092 3 I needed this for a baby monitor. It seems to stay put on the crib well and is easy to use. My only complaint is the top part with the screw moves around, making it hard to stay in place. It works fine overall for my use. 
25093 4 fits exactly on my canon s110 makes a good job 
25094 3 I Like it. 
25095 4 Works greeat 
25096 4 They are all great. 
25097 4 I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! SEND ME MORE HOLY CRAP IT WORKS GREAT! I STARTED MAKING VLOGS AND THIS CAMERA WORKS GREAT FOR IT 
25098 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
25099 3 i just received this is in the mail, so far testing it and playing with the camera it looks to be in good condition. it looks nice and neat. i haven t tested with film yet. when i do, I ll edit this review. 
25100 4 great quality! 
25101 4 I got my camera super fast. It s in awesome shape and does take nice pics. I haven t really used it very much yet. I just ordered an sd card so I ll be using it more and I m sure will have great things to say. 
25102 3 We love the picture. The only thing which is different from what I read from the reviews was that the flash needs be manually instead of manually activated. 
25103 0 My camera arrived without a sad card. Your product information did not specify that I had to supply one. Stephen K. 
25104 4 I have been purchasing Lexerd screen protectors for my various cameras over the years and did so again recently for my new Canon PowerShot G16. Once again, the screen protector applied easily and served me well. I highly recommend Lexerd. 
25105 4 exactly what i needed. very happy with the purchase. thank you! 
25106 4 Very nice LED variable intensity light for tabletop, video and many other uses-runs very cool. If brand name would cost much more. 
25107 4 Ordered this for a birthday gift and it was perfect!!! Fun to be able to take pictures and share them too!!! My granddaughter loved it!!!! 
25108 4 Works great with the Manfrotto MK055XPRO3-3W! 
25109 3 Well built. 
25110 3 Awesome! however It would be better if I could host the images on my own website rather than having to share through facebook that then links to Ricoh website. 
25111 0 Very expensive, the material is fragil and one leg was stuck. I really expected more for this price. 
25112 3 Simple, but roomy and usable, especially for the price. 
25113 4 Had trouble with Motion Detection setup. Quick call and with remote connect, Walter had me going in no time..GREAT product and support.! 
25114 2 Don t trust this on the outside of a moving vehicle. I had it set up on the inside of my windshield and the suction cup falls off even during normal driving conditions. 
25115 4 Great deal. I ll never run out of batteries. 
25116 2 wish I had researched a little more and got the next level up. no user friendly when it comes to moving videos to computer. 
25117 0 It gives you a web site that throws you off you CAN NOT connect. The instructions a joke. you pull the company up on the web everything is in Chinese, I will never order from ELEC again. 
25118 4 Works awesome, charges fast and the best part is I can charge my batteries in the truck and in my camper when we area camping. Love it! 
25119 3 Used tis to mount my KK2 board on. Works great for ante-vibe 
25120 0 Tripod I received is not the one pictured 
25121 3 Nice little point and shoot. Some buttons on the small side but once you find them it takes great pics! 
25122 1 Was broken when i got it. Cannot control setting. Wheel was missing 
25123 4 wrong size 
25124 4 Great product. Worked exactly as described. The video is very good, also tech support is very good and helpful. Picture quality is great even at night. I can view the live screen on my iPhone/iPad with 4G network when I m away from home where no WiFi is available. 
25125 4 The PZ0420M camera is lighter and smaller than the more prevelant 32mm board cameras. Quality is excellent and RunCam/SecurityCamera2000 supports it well. Camera is very durable used on a 250 racing quad that crashes frequently. 
25126 4 I LOVE IT 
25127 0 Item does not work at all. Came with no directions. Complete junk 
25128 4 Item came as promised and contains a number of useful items. I would buy from seller again. 
25129 0 Camera will not work for more than 24 hours without needing a power cycle 
25130 4 Love it!!, really big props!! 
25131 4 Perfect for my needs as a wedding cinematographer, it s a shame Sigma company don t make them anymore for Nikon. I was very lucky to find it here on Amazon. 
25132 4 I love this product very easy to use. I reached out to tech support and spoke to Walter who was very helpful setting up the camera 
25133 3 Great product! Light weight and durable. Love the water proof carrying bag! 
25134 3 Works great with real Gopro however it is advertised to fit the DBPOWER camera and the batteries are not the same. No sweat off of my back as I returned that piece of junk and got the real thing! 
25135 4 Favorite camera 
25136 0 Could not program the alarm had no instructions to program it 
25137 4 This lens is a beast. Plus it came two days before expected. 
25138 4 It performs as advertised and as expected. 
25139 0 WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME, YOU CAN SEE BETTER WITH THE MOON LIGHT ALONE ! 
25140 4 Great lens. 
25141 4 great value and excellent product 
25142 4 Love it. 
25143 3 Seems to be overpriced for what you get, but it works quite well. However, it will not remove some stubborn dust particles. Also, you may need to use it a number of times before the sensor is clear of dust. 
25144 4 Great add to my lighting setup 
25145 4 Great buy for the money. 
25146 4 These are excellent devices. I mounted my cameras and now I feel quite secure because I can see 180 degrees around the place. 
25147 4 exactly what i needed 
25148 0 not 2000w and terrible to put together and put away. 
25149 1 Small for sony alpha a6000 + lens 
25150 4 PERFECT, just what the parents wanted….bought for a baby shower 
25151 1 This does not work. It was an unfortunate buy, and I was too lazy to return it. Bye-bye money. 
25152 4 great price. Primary batter ran low at the OC Fair.... could have been a nightmare but having two addition battery let me enjoy the cutting. 
25153 2 Worked well should ve gone bigger 
25154 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE they work great!!!!!!!!!!! 
25155 4 After ordering it I found my original charger and the new one is of the same quality if not better! I now have a spare! ( always good to have on hand...) 
25156 0 Didn t work the minute it was plugged in... crap product. 
25157 4 works great i will be getting more for my other cases 
25158 4 haven t use it yet but yes, its a good buy 
25159 4 It works well, the image quality is good, and the night vision is super.I love this camera. 
25160 1 Worked intermittingly. 
25161 4 It is a nice carry case but I have no use for it now. 
25162 4 Excelente. 
25163 4 Shoots very great images, no problem thus far. 
25164 4 Perfect size to fit spare batteries, charger, cables and a few small accessories for a quick on the go shoot. Good quality, will buy more of these products when needed. Highly recommended for the great price. 
25165 0 It never worked. 
25166 1 Poor quality pictures most were blurry and didn t come anywhere close to the beautiful ocean life colors 
25167 4 Item works perfect, but Amazons idea of Guaranteed delivery dates really leaves a bad taste in your mouth. 
25168 4 Works well with Canon Camera. 
25169 0 batteries to large for camera kept popping out couldn t close case 
25170 3 Used the batteries and charger on recent cruise and everything functioned very well! Delivery was fast as advertised, thanks. 
25171 4 awesome camera!! my kids love it :) they really love getting the picture immediately and so do I. the picture quality is great for an instant camera! 
25172 4 very good.... but the shipping is very slow...... 
25173 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
25174 0 It came folded not rolled could not get creases out very nice quality other than that. 
25175 4 holds my cannon and the charger. great! 
25176 4 Just perfect replacemment. 
25177 4 Highly visible and cares weight of camera. 
25178 3 Useful. Produces a low hiss. Watch out for the battery, if it becomes low, the mic will make these small pops during your recording. You have to change out your battery if this is the case. Low battery indicator won t help because it doesn t meet the threshold. 
25179 0 Product worked for about two months and then refused to work even after new batteries were installed. I m not sure if its the receiver or the transmitter. Never the less nothing works after a very short period of time. 
25180 4 Sturdy way to hold my flash!! 
25181 4 very pleased with the batteries. shipped on time. 
25182 4 Great fit... 
25183 4 Great price for what it can do. Works great as a back up to original charger. But it does get a bit hot. The added bonous is the ability to charge my battery in the car. I do not know how I lived without this feature before. 
25184 4 This is a good bag. I m using it for a Nikon camera. Everything fits in perfectly. 
25185 4 excelent 
25186 4 good quality 
25187 4 I love it... 
25188 4 Great product and great delivery. 
25189 4 Works just fine! 
25190 4 Works great with the battery from our camera. Delivered on time 
25191 4 Very satisfied with this tripod for the price. Quality is good, I m not sure if the bubble levels are accurate. Easy loading mount, ball head moves well - doesn t seem too cheap. Definitely recommended. 
25192 3 Great value, very pleased 
25193 4 very good 
25194 1 needs an adaptor 
25195 4 I have a canon t3i which I use with a 150-600mm lens. Was looking for a tripod that would handle the weight of the combination of camera and lens. This tripod can handle the weight. Very happy with it. 
25196 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
25197 4 These batteries last forever! I like these better than Sonys rip off batteries at $80 a piece, seriously what were they thinking. 
25198 3 Works well so far, plastic camera mount could be a little more robust, but the quality does match the price-point. With careful intermittent use it shouldn t be a problem. You get what you pay for with this one. 
25199 3 Nice 
25200 0 s***!!!!! doesnt slide smooth. 
25201 4 the best ever! 
25202 4 Can t beat this price. Recharges the Wasabi and the GoPro branded batteries with no issues so I always have two available. 
25203 4 fit perfect on my canon EOS 70D! 
25204 4 Good price for peace of mind. Glad I haven t had to use it. 
25205 4 In combination with a recently purchased pistol grip tripod, it has provided excellent viewing / stargazing. 
25206 3 Very happy with the camera. Only problem I have is that it did not come with the memory chip. Other than that I was very satisfied with the purchase. 
25207 3 a little overprized but still love it! 
25208 4 Perfect....was exactly the device I needed. Like finding an old friend. Thanks. 
25209 4 Clearly a winner. Heliopan was my first, but seeing the quality, this is now my choice 
25210 4 These are useful! Happy! 
25211 4 An Excellent replacement for the one I lost. Rating: 5 of 5 The item was well packaged and came quickly. Arrived on time and was as described. Very good quality and excellent value for the money. 
25212 4 Hands down best little strap I ve used. Construction is flawless and materials are top quality. I ve used them for a year now in my wedding work and the have not left my fuji s side! 
25213 4 Nice reflector, it s me first one, but it was of a great use on the wedding day , can cover at least 4 people if used to diffuse the harsh light on a sunny day. The quality seems good. 
25214 4 Works fine, arrived in plenty of time for a vacation trip. 
25215 4 I mainly bought this kit for the UV filter, but I will use the other filters also. I keep a UV filter on my lenses all the time, mainly to protect them. The filter is cheaper to replace if damaged that your lenses! 
25216 3 It s not very high quality when handling, but once installed you can t tell it s fake or that it is cheaply made. I would buy again. 
25217 3 So far so good, working well. 
25218 4 Just happy to have a backup battery for my camera.. 
25219 4 Everything good! 
25220 3 Nice but a bit pricey, only gripe is the case only fits the iPad mini. Should have a cutout for iPad or iPad Air. 
25221 4 Wonderful works with my Sony Hdr-mv1 
25222 1 Poor quality. Adhesive last maybe a month. I took my camera on trip to Alaska. Some days were misty and protector will not stay on in that weather. 
25223 4 I use this light with my ENG Camera and Film Camera. It is a great tool for handheld cameras, especially in field production. I enjoy the product. 
25224 4 Works great. Lasts for 3 lacrosse games (on & off) no problem. No issues with the camera not recognizing it. Useful review? Let me know! 
25225 4 Very nice camera. Works as advertised 
25226 4 Great price super easy to locate controls. Only downside is there is no external power input. 
25227 4 bought it for a Nikon D90 that I use as a backup. actually wanted an SB-600 but Nikon no longer makes it. works great. 
25228 4 Like orig. 
25229 4 Perfect mate for the one I had in the battery expansion. 
25230 1 This item stopped working soon after we got it, and kodak has stopped making this product. Now I have a product that is broken and I cant get a replacement. 
25231 0 BAD picture, bad sound, cant go far...I would NOT recommend this product. 
25232 4 Super sturdy and we love it! 
25233 0 It sucks. I try instslling them but right after i turned then on they would start going off after like 3 seconds withought separating them 
25234 4 We installed this at the door in the garage, and it s motion-sensitive, so when we come home after dark, we can always see the keyhole for our deadbolt! 
25235 1 Met expectations. Nice. 
25236 4 I like this strap very well. It is of a very good quality. I highly recommend this! 
25237 3 Nice light case. 
25238 4 Solid product. Several adapters to attach things. And the legs are made well. 
25239 3 works as needed 
25240 0 Did not work as specified. WiFi from device to station would only work when within 20 feet. Would not work with Verizon FIOS landline. Returned it and purchased an alternate system which worked fine. 
25241 4 Set up was a breeze - it took about ten minutes. Picture quality and features are amazing. User manual needs to be shipped with the camera. GREAT VALUE$$$ 
25242 2 I have owned several Samsung cameras and thought this one would be work just as well. It does not. It is much slower and the flash acts like it takes a while to &#34;warm up&#34; and snap the picture. Would not order this particular model camera again. 
25243 4 Great! 
25244 4 Perfect for those long trips 
25245 4 Excellent bag for traveling with my Canon T3i along with two lenses and charger. 
25246 4 Compact Sony kit lens for the NEX series that works very well - sharp enough. 
25247 4 Great. 
25248 4 I used this with a Stellarvue eyepiece that comes with their 13x80 finder. I liked that it had a broad range of brightness down to the point where the red crosshairs were extremely faint. 
25249 2 REALLY WORKS 
25250 3 Got these on time. It looks exactly as it is in the photo. 
25251 0 This is AWFUL!! Live Video Failed after 2 days worked. Any Model All models of this brand camera I bought failed. 
25252 4 A very good lens fro macro photography 
25253 1 Although it serves my needs I was misled in the description of the product where it said it was an aluminum case it is really made of plastic 
25254 0 It hasn t worked since the day I took it out of the box. 
25255 2 kinda cheap. but so is the price. 
25256 4 Solidly made, threads work smoothly. Good craftsmanship. 
25257 0 not as expected 
25258 2 very good 
25259 4 Works well 
25260 0 never did work 
25261 4 Everything came as expected and in time too...looking forward to buying more of your products. 
25262 4 Nice little pouch! Lens slips inn nicely. Plenty of padding too. 
25263 4 Was not sure about this speedlight but I took a chance and I am glad I could. Works in manual only but the output is easily adjustable, and has good powder. Will purchase another. 
25264 4 THIS CAMERA BUNDLE IS A GREAT VALUE IT LOOKS LIKE AND HAS THE FEATURES OF MORE EXPENSIVE CAMERAS. PLUS THE BONUS OF AN EXTRA BATTERY AND ANOTHER CHARGER AND CORDS. VERY GOOD BUY!!!!!! 
25265 2 Not that good. Barely holds the camera in place. 
25266 4 best duster ever 
25267 4 excellent product , work good , easy install , good sound 
25268 0 didn t work with any of my speedlites 
25269 4 Fits all my go pro items in one little pouch 
25270 4 works very good for my cannon 10d 
25271 4 a great Little security camera loaded with exceptional features 
25272 4 Use it to carry .223 shells on my sling. 
25273 3 Having a really hard time understanding how to work it, the manual is way to small to read. 
25274 4 Great on time! 
25275 0 After the first week night vision stopped working. Now it connects when it wants to. Zero customers service!!! 
25276 3 Works good - but switches from color to black and white for some reason. 
25277 2 Batteries are good but they dont last as long as the one I got with my camera 
25278 4 The best quality fish eye equivalent for the price. Highly recommended. 
25279 3 Nice camera. I m still learning how to use it. 
25280 4 fast shipping. i love the design and very fit. if you are looking for a protector for your camera, this one is recommended. 
25281 3 This item works well so far but it is NOT the US version. Based on other feedback I m afraid to do the firmware update. No problems so far but beware. 
25282 2 freezes up sometimes and i have to unplug it 
25283 4 Keeps the camera dry and is great to keep sticky fingerprints away. 
25284 2 Money s worth. 
25285 3 Good images but a little on the weighty side for off hand viewing. Defiantly need a tripod. Good buy. 
25286 3 Not the sharpest lens I have, but it works very well for what it is. 
25287 4 They fit perfectly and work great. Definitely worth the money to have a few extra or to replace any in need. Shipping did take a while but that s expected when coming from another country. 
25288 3 Great protection for your investment. 
25289 4 Really Good mini backpack for beginners! I love it! 
25290 4 NOW I CAN VIDEO AT PARTIES LONGER LOVE IT 
25291 4 The Vivitar batteries I ordered work perfectly in my Sony a58 camera, for a fraction of the price I would have paid for Sony brand batteries. The cleaning kit was a great bonus. I was especially impressed and delighted by the size and power of the dust blower. 
25292 4 Macro is crazy detailed get an exernal light source and you re good 
25293 4 Fun for grad nite prizes... 
25294 4 Great lens! 
25295 3 Great lens filter kit 
25296 3 Admirable piece of engineering. Almost everything perfect, but a proper quick release should be fantastic 
25297 1 Too wide for my neck. 
25298 4 Excellent hdtvi dvr system. No complaints what so ever. Easy to setup. Has the best free ddns service available (hiddns). Video quality is amazing. My customers love it. Shipping was a bit slow but worth it. 
25299 4 So far so good Used a couple of times. 
25300 4 Love it 
25301 4 No complaints 
25302 4 My mother wanted me to search for something for my brother-in-law s birthday. He s really into astronomy. She got him the same model binoculars for Christmas. My sister said that he loved both of the products. 
25303 3 Used these on a construction site to mount a time lapse camera. Solid. Stable. Works well. The screws are showing signs of rust, but it was outside for months. The mfgr could use stainless steel screws if they wanted to improve the design... 
25304 3 The package is too simple, for UV lens 
25305 4 Great product. This case fits our Nikon Coolpix S33 camera just right. There is a pocket inside for an extra battery and or memory card. Heavyweight construction. Comes with a long strap. Double zippers, and a Velcro belt loop. Not much else to be said. It s a great case. 
25306 4 Just what I was looking for. Excellent lens bag, sturdy, lightweight, looks amazing! Highly recommend! 
25307 4 Great product- works better than expected 
25308 0 Much smaller than pictured, it looks like the sticker wraps around, but it doesn t. 
25309 4 One of the sharpest prime lenses on the market. 
25310 4 Great battery, easy to install fixed my problem. Came super quick, easy to install, at a great price!! Will use this seller again!! thanks td 
25311 4 They were very nice and strong but they didn t work with my vision. I could see black on the sides interfering with my vision. I tried to adjust but I have a wide bridge and my eyes just wouldn t focus enough. For someone else, I highly recommend. 
25312 2 Too large for the camera styles listed in the description. I never use this carry case. 
25313 4 Purchased this camera for our honeymoon in Tahiti. We banged it around on the paddle boards, took it snorkeling, and on our 1st diving trip ( which was only 5 or 6 meters). It took great pictures and video! Definitely TOUGH as well. 
25314 4 A++++++ 
25315 3 Perfect grip when using this as a handheld mount but an excellent desk mount for your cameras. 
25316 2 I can buy real glass protectors for this price 
25317 4 Great batteries and great for back up batteries 
25318 4 Works well for connecting mic 
25319 4 I have several really good tripods but I found myself in a place without one. I ordered this just to get me through a simple photo shoot. I was really pleased at the quality and compactness of this tripod. 
25320 4 Love it. I use it for insurance inspections. It has an amazing zoom! 
25321 4 Great to be able to charge a second battery not in the camera. 
25322 4 Easy to load and shoot. The picture develops quickly and it is nice to have a &#34;physical&#34; picture to place into an album. 
25323 0 Terrible, came with a bolt that was too short, do completely unusable. More importantly, it wasted my time because I had to find an alternative + return this poorly kitted product. 
25324 4 Works well! 
25325 4 Happy with items!! 
25326 4 This fit my Tamron lens just as described. Great price and exactly what I needed after losing my lens cap. Very satisfied and the seller was very fast with shipping. 
25327 4 Perfect addition to the Canon Rebel package I received. 
25328 0 could not make it work, sent it back 
25329 2 Wish it would start recording when power was applied to the micro usb. Originally wanted it for dash cam but keep forgetting to start or stop it. Pic quality good kids had it in pool still works. 
25330 2 One of the screws for the attachment is already stripped out 
25331 3 Works pretty good. Few of the buttons are labled wrong 
25332 4 This bag is amazing. The color is a little uninspiring, but not at all bad. It s very well built. I have been using mine every single day for over a year and it is still showing no wear whatsoever, and I m not a great owner. 
25333 3 Worked 
25334 4 Nice basic mount. Does the job. 
25335 3 the item was exactly as pictured and described. it works perfectly on my camera. I am happy to have a charger so that I am able to use my camera once again. thank you for this listing 
25336 4 Just what was needed. 
25337 2 Great kit for the price, more than I will ever use. Some pieces are cheaply made though. 
25338 3 not bad it really works quite well.. even my 5 yr old grandson can operate this..!! The record button is really easy to use !! 
25339 4 Awesome camera great pictures and features 
25340 1 THE WIRELESS VIDEO SURVEILLANCE HAS STOPPED RECORDING 
25341 4 Works well, better than expected. 
25342 4 Very well made!! Great product!! 
25343 4 ok 
25344 4 Got the propellers within a few days. They are great 
25345 4 A low cost solution to start your photography hobby. Many position options and adjustments. Great for any beginner. 
25346 4 Great! 
25347 2 Let s see what this amounts to when the time comes. 
25348 4 great transaction. Product as described 
25349 4 We used the Sony HDR-CX3800 to make a product review video of this pet fountain. [[ASIN:B00YDFMQ8M Five Star Pet Fountain for Improved Pet Health. Cats & Dogs Drink More Water When It s Oxygenated & Filtered. Easy to Clean, Quiet Operation, One Gallon Waterer. Simple Solution for a Healthier Pet.]] 
25350 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
25351 2 When the backdrop arrived it was as pictured but NOT as described It should have been green/black according to the description. Also, because of the design, it is difficult to create/maintain a flat background. 
25352 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works on camera as described. 
25353 3 Great first microscope. 
25354 3 Works well. 
25355 4 Great! Just what I needed for this lens 
25356 4 Just as good as the name brand batteries. No problems at all. 
25357 0 Worked for about 2 seconds and with new batteries !! 
25358 1 the platform is plastic and will not hold any camera inline enough to get a decent image. you have to make changes to have it work. 
25359 4 Works very well, good quality pictures 
25360 4 good 
25361 4 Works well indoor and outdoor. I have not tried the Shutter release but the GPS works well on my Nikon D7100 
25362 3 I really like it...very versatile to carry laptop and camera 
25363 4 great 
25364 4 Great product. 
25365 4 this is the best and most stable tripod I have ever bought. 
25366 0 Not my best buy. 
25367 0 wayyyy to small , i thought it would be wider - can barely put the lens cap on 
25368 4 Good Price, great value should give me enough pwr for some long recording 
25369 1 I experienced quite a but if distortion around the edges with this on. 
25370 4 This bag is exactly what I was looking for. It has room inside for my laptop, camera, and all associated gear without being overly big. Great travel carry-on bag for all your electronics. It comes in different sizes so get the right size for your laptop. 
25371 4 I like this case,well padded, room for extra stuff, etc. 
25372 4 Love, love, love it. 
25373 4 Goes on great and protects a plastic (ugh!) screen. Much better than others I have used. A must have. 
25374 4 Works great. A nice and better replacer fid the original battery. The position of the battery on the charger can be confusing though since not all three prongs connect. 
25375 4 Got this for my son s GeekPro and everything in it worked great! We had a lot of fun with all the attachments on our vacation. Great product! 
25376 4 So far so good. Great service 
25377 3 For the money it is a very good deal! 
25378 3 Great can b used for number of things.Thx very much. 
25379 3 Takes great pictures, but i wish it wouldn t run out of battery so quickly. 
25380 4 A nice size card that fits in my gadget bag nicely. 
25381 1 There shouldn t be any functionality problem since it is just air blower but I couldn t stand the strong odor from the rubber pump. I can t use or store it because of the smell. 
25382 4 The protector works great, after 8 months it is still on the camera! Great service would use seller again! 
25383 4 Good 
25384 4 Love it 
25385 2 The video quality is poor, otherwise it is a great system. I use it for home security and I am impressed with it thus far. Just wish that the video quality was better. 
25386 3 Great camera case used with high quality fabrics. 
25387 4 Quality product. I love it. 
25388 4 Good quality cables, great price. 
25389 3 Love the tripod and blue tooth clicker. It made family beach pictures so much easier until the screw got crossthreaded, or something, in the plastic hold to hold the camera at a tilt. I m not sure how that happened b/c I hadn t messed with it. 
25390 1 Flimsy and falls off too often. 
25391 4 Great buy works perfect very happy 
25392 4 Fantastic!!! 
25393 4 Works as described I recommend.Be sure to have it plugged into your router with an Ethernet cable when you first configure it. Once configured it works fine over Wi-Fi. It just can t be initially configured over Wi-Fi. 
25394 4 Received on time.. Product quality is good for the price.. Thanks.. 
25395 4 Did what it was supposed to; arrived in a timely manner. 
25396 4 Very Nice & well made & Really like the way it Works ! Great ! ! 
25397 4 Great package. Great product 
25398 3 good not great 
25399 4 Great bargain. Quality product. 
25400 4 i got the shots i wanted with this filter. no problems. 
25401 3 too much on this thing, but an idiot like me can take goods pics it must be ok 
25402 3 Might be a little to petite for a professional that relies on many mounts and casings, but for a single case and knowing what mount you were to use this is practical. Hard casing helps to protect but hard to pack into a backpack if limited space. 
25403 4 Easy, fast, safe and comfortable! 
25404 3 Interface could be better, but it works well enough 
25405 4 This bag has replaced all of my bags. I literally take this everywhere I go now. Trust me, it is worth it. 
25406 4 Very happy with items. 5 STARS AND great product. 
25407 4 Everything was as promised. Thanks! 
25408 4 I lost my spare battery somewhere between a session, an event and home. Thankfully I was able to find the exact battery and have it delivered quickly. 
25409 4 This kit was everything I expected. It fits my camera great. I ve used most of the body gear parts and selfie stick already. I m having a blast putting together my videos. The case makes it easy to keep things together. 
25410 4 My granddaughter loves it. 
25411 4 Nice price 
25412 4 Henry was a great help with the wifi connection! Not having access to the router definitely made things difficult, but not impossible. Happy to be able to watch the pups from home and not having to worry. Glad its connected finally. Thanks to Henry! case id# c6721161henry AR004273 
25413 1 Not compatable to a mac 
25414 4 The battery worked just as expected, and you CANNOT beat the price! I did not notice any degradation in quality compared to the one I have that came with my camera. 
25415 4 I recommend. 
25416 4 This camera works great and the picture is clear. This is a great product and hopefully i get my moneys worth out of it, if it has any problems. I highly recommend this camera 
25417 4 great price holds charge like dream 
25418 4 VERY HANDY LOVE IT AND THESSE ARE ALLOWED ON ANY DISNEY RIDE 
25419 3 Decent protector. I have used this brand before and have been happy 
25420 4 Nice and sturdy 
25421 4 Works great! 
25422 4 Case Number: C6725987 Tech ID: AR004273 Description about my service experience with the technician was extremely helpful in setting up both of my Dlink cameras. He was the best technician I have ever worked with over the phone. 
25423 2 Not the greatest design but adequate 
25424 4 Wow! Great printer and great color! I take lots of pictures on my phone and DSLR and having a portable printer is super convenient and fun! People are amazed at the quality of the prints and Ive had a lot of questions about where I bought them! 
25425 4 thank you for this order 
25426 4 Works great! 
25427 4 I replaced a Sony A350 with this camera. I am very happy with the Sony A58 camera. I am more about taking photos than using the video that it has... I guess one day I will try that out, but for now, it s all about good photos. 
25428 4 Everything is in excelent condition, it came with 32 gb sd card and sony bag. One of the best deals ever! 
25429 3 it is a great one specially for quick and easy shots. video is great except battery life is too short in that case. I used it during my vacation to London and i had a great like processional photos 
25430 4 Arrived promptly, in quality pkging. All worked, no issues. 
25431 4 so far great price and performance. 
25432 4 I highly recommend this item. 
25433 4 Product arrived quickly. Batteries work great in my Samsung camera. The charger & 2 spare batteries give me more options than just plugging in my camera and waiting for a recharge. Order from this company. You will be pleased and amused. :) 
25434 4 did exactly what it was supposed to do 
25435 4 Works very nicely with my my scope. 
25436 4 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
25437 4 Brief comment is really all that s necessary. I bought the product, and it works perfectly. Furthermore, it s way cheaper than buying the branded battery from Canon. Definitely recommended. 
25438 4 Exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy construction, fast setup/take-down and I get the results I expect with it. And love the ball head mount - much better than I expected for this price. Couldn t be happier. 
25439 4 Everything was there and in good shape. Very happy with order. 
25440 2 Not sure I understood utilizing this product with my 85 Carl Zeis lens would leave it in manual. Frustrating sometimes. I will prob just use my Sony body. 
25441 4 Works awsome 
25442 4 Just what I needed for a short notice event. All the basics for low drama preparation. 
25443 4 Good Buy 
25444 4 works very well just what i wanted 
25445 4 works well, delivered quickly. no complaints. 
25446 3 ok 
25447 4 Very versatile works as expected. 
25448 3 High quality video, audio is very good. Had a few times where the video/audio cut out, but that was most likely due to a dodgy internet connection. Just make sure you ve got a WiFi extender and you shouldn t have any streaming interruptions. 
25449 4 Product was as described. Transaction was smooth. 
25450 4 Love it!! 
25451 4 Love, Love, Love, Love, Love!!!! Really nothing else to say...I have NO regrets about purchasing this camera!!! It s a blast to use and footage is amazing in and out of water, on moving vehicles, on moving pets, for stills, and anything you can imagine. 
25452 4 Came as promised. A lot of great accessories! 
25453 4 Love taking pictures with it for the first time. For an amateur, I like the speed for taking pictures. I still have to explore the many features of this camera. 
25454 3 Coool 50mm prime... use it all the time to create unique perspectives 
25455 0 Broke after 4 uses 
25456 0 Bought for my friends trip to Africa & didn t even work, Says needed Battery or something:( 
25457 0 Horrible product. I haven t even had this bag for 3 months and the zippers already broke off. Also to inforce that I have not used it often. The worst bag I ve had. 
25458 4 Great camera....love the Jpegs right out of the camera. The film simulations are spectacular! Use this camera and a Pentax Kiis....combo give me full photo flexibility.. 
25459 4 I can focus it at trees leaves and random daylight 
25460 3 rec d as promised and as advertised 
25461 2 Work OK little low on life of battery 
25462 3 A little smaller than expection. 
25463 4 metal and good fit for filters 
25464 4 Great unit for the money, easy to operate 
25465 4 Soft and girlie, loved this neck strap for our honeymoon in Ireland. Much better than that Nikon strap! Held my Nikon 3200 perfectly in place for the entire trip. 
25466 4 use it for the fujifilm xp70 
25467 4 Great lens cap, great value. 
25468 4 Love the colors and the price. Fits around neck comfortably. I got a compliment on the color while taking pictures on the street. 
25469 4 Great 
25470 0 I bought this cap for a Fujifilm Finepix S9200. It s well made and very nice, and I received it quickly. However it does not fit the lens. I need to send it back. 
25471 3 very good quality. love the carrying case! 
25472 4 so fun and cute! 
25473 3 Did what it needed too. 
25474 4 Richard Excellent support setting up the camera for remote viewing. Thank you. Camera is great. Doing exactly what I wanted. 
25475 4 It s an excellent product that beyond I expect. 
25476 4 Good size bag. Pretty comfortable to carry around. Not too obvious that it is a camera bag. 
25477 3 works well 
25478 2 It prevents good sound recording but keeps the water from getting into the device 
25479 2 Great on planets but blurs more distant objects 
25480 4 These are so nice and easy to take off and put on. 
25481 3 admitible 
25482 4 love it all. No problems. 
25483 3 Arrived quickly. Good illumination control from the dial. Little heavy with the batteries. Good product. 
25484 1 Saw double not in adjustment 
25485 4 Easy to fly. Would like to see longer range. 
25486 4 works well. 
25487 4 Bought this GoPro Travel and Carrying Case for my son s new GoPro4 and he loves it. 
25488 4 Works as expected batteries seem to work good so far as well. This charger is nice because you get a charger and two batteries. If you tried to get canon original batteries and charger this same deal would be over 150 dollars, so this is a no brainer. 
25489 3 I was very pleased with my purchase. I bought it for my nephew for his 18th bday and he loved it. Very well made and has plenty of padding and straps for carrying. Would recommend. 
25490 4 You can t beat the price,not bad video. 
25491 4 It provides good IQ and it reduces the size of the whole set so it fits into my pocket now!! 
25492 4 So far so good. 
25493 4 Works great! Just the right size, too. 
25494 1 I tried to use these according to the instructions and I still can t seem to get the quality out of them that I was hoping to get. They are made well so I ll give it two stars, but I really don t like how they work. 
25495 4 Thanks 
25496 4 NOTE: NO LEGS It would be unfair to mark it 4 stars. It is exactly what it claims to be, but it really needs some fold out legs for indoor usage. 2 stands and clamps work for a quick setup. 
25497 3 Wide viewing angle. Night vision is good but can be better ( compared to the camera I have from ADT). Overall, it is a good camera and worth the price paid for. 
25498 4 A OK..... 
25499 4 works well 
25500 4 Great price fast survive 
25501 1 Takes a long time to &#34;charge&#34; for each flash. 
25502 1 It came deformed... Not very helpful when it shows up in the frame due to its deformation. I would not recommend this. 
25503 4 richard helped me with setting everything up. its soooo simple and easy and now i can watch my apartment from my latop or my phone for free! i love this camera. the quality is amazing 
25504 4 Excellent 
25505 4 This item was better than what I thought it would be and I am very please. This looks very elegant and made of a thick cloth not like the thin ones that I have seen. 
25506 4 fits perfectly 
25507 4 Very easy to set up , only thing is that it only records at 960 not hd , so no need to buy hd cameras 
25508 4 Amazing price. Good camera fit with a couple of extra pockets. Sharp looking with Nikon emblem. 
25509 4 Perfect! Exactly as described! Thank you! 
25510 4 Given as a gift, recipient was extremely happy 
25511 4 Awesome product! Everything is perfect! 
25512 4 Perfect fit for my new Panasonic FZ-70. Charged perfectly and have tried both batteries, everything is good. The lens cloth and brush are nice bonuses too! 
25513 0 Don t buy 
25514 4 Great camera will buy again 
25515 4 Remote release cord functions perfectly; replicates the shutter release button on my D7100 in every way. 
25516 1 I have to change my review....I just returned the frame....when I was sitting right by it, the pics were great....once I moved it across the room and at a different level....it was hard to see ....a lot of black spots. Our original nix was not like that..... 
25517 3 Works fine but still need a stand. 
25518 4 Great product, prompt delivery. Love the clear pouches for storing the cleaning cloths! 
25519 4 So much better than changing batteries. Motor runs faster than with battery power 
25520 3 Good little pack here, but the mono pod stick isn t all that great. I ve seen better ones, no control button on the handle end. But you get what you pay for 
25521 4 Good materials and exactly the right size I needed, for a nikon d3200 + battery grip + 55-200mm lens. 
25522 4 Very easy to use. Great video quality, in a very small package. Would definitely recommended to anyone looking for a camera that is easy to conceal. 
25523 2 This case adds protection and a nice look of refinement. The con is that it makes it a little harder to get the SD card out. 
25524 0 only they used, and they are broke or not working where I can send it to the fix, since it has a one year warranty I am looking forward to your response Thank you nelson 
25525 3 arrived as expected. Works well. Good product. 
25526 3 Pretty good. Works as described. I wish there was a way to reverse it 
25527 3 easy to use and great quality. 
25528 3 Does a great job when used with the zeiss lense care cleaner 
25529 4 This is an excellent &#34;bean bag&#34; for photograhy use. Is made to last and the Neoprene surface prevents slippage. Filled mine with one bag 32oz (907grams) of Fairfield Poly-Pellets Stuffing Beads which are sold by Amazon. The bag s maker LensCoat has a line of first-rate products. 
25530 4 Perfect Replacement on my Canon Rebel. 
25531 0 Poor product! When I play back my videos it glitches hard. Over heats too 
25532 4 Works great- all functions very compatible and highly recommend 
25533 0 I installed the update from their web site and the unit does not work now. I have tried to contact them about the problem and have not received a reply. Sent them another email today I hope to hear soon. 
25534 0 Very cheaply built. This tripod is very flimsy and barely supports the weight of my camera. The level feature doesn t even have any liquid in it. Please do not buy this tripod. You will only end up disappointed. 
25535 4 Nicely fitting case. 
25536 0 Doesn t charge 
25537 3 Impressed with Value, Quality and quickness of shipping. 
25538 4 This is a great rolling camera case. Holds everything I need for photographing weddings. 
25539 2 awesome, sure took a lot of pics under water 
25540 4 Perfect 
25541 0 I returned mine. The rain bag is HUGE. Not usable for a mirrorless ILC camera. The quality feels cheap and would ve been cumbersome to use even if it did fit. 
25542 4 Fits perfect, and works great. 
25543 4 Vincent Did a wonderful job on getting the camera working properly in a short time!! Wish I could get him again if/when I need help!! 
25544 4 Excellent product at a great price. Plugs into the wall, has a car charger, cheaper than the Nikon branded charger. I don t see why you would opt for anything else! 
25545 2 Very nice well padded camera bag but to large for my point and shoot camera. 
25546 4 Perfect 
25547 4 it floats - easy to see in water, pool, lake and ocean! must go with bright orange colors! 
25548 3 Yes it is what it is. 
25549 4 Great camera! 
25550 0 Terrible product. They do not fir American cassette players 
25551 4 As advertised 
25552 0 They do not fit the camera at all. 
25553 2 it is okay for the price. Accomplishes the purpose of keeping an eye on my dog outside. After four months I ve had some wifi connectivity issues where i have to reboot the camera. 
25554 3 works just fine, but the batteries seem to have a short life 
25555 4 Product Arrived on time and intact.Thank you........Mike 
25556 4 excelete 
25557 3 A really great buy! So reliable, reasonably priced. Really keeps everything organized and protected. Wonderful for having a lot of equipment and yet wonderfully simple. My only downside is that I wish it came in different colors or designs. 
25558 4 it was perfect 
25559 3 like the size but doesn t always stay in one place.. 
25560 4 Good quality and good price. Very satisfied. 
25561 0 El19 charger adapter does Not even come close to fitting el19 battery!! Who built this a three year old? Worthless device!! 
25562 0 Wasn t able to get it to work with my Canon 5D at all. Tried all the troubleshooting tips I could find online, YouTube videos, etc. Finally ended up returning it. 
25563 4 This prime makes you work for the shot. The bokeh is crazy and depth of field is very narrow. Perfect for dreamy, ethereal work made from afar. Minimum focal distance is about 6 .... 
25564 4 Works great!!! 
25565 4 Good as described 
25566 2 great it was well worth the purchase, the camera is now outdated needs to be replaced 
25567 4 Gift - recipient loved it! 
25568 4 Excellent 
25569 4 5 stars for the price 
25570 4 I have not used all the lenses yet so really can t give a fair review, however, I love the kit and carry it with me in my camera bag, I especially like the microfiber cloth for cleaning my camera and the lenses. It does a great job! 
25571 4 good clear picture. will use as a security camera when I go on vacation. 
25572 1 fukky The plastic ring that is attached to the hand string on the extension pole broke and my go pro fell 35 feet down. Thankfully one of the catamaran workers was a crazy free diver and went and got it. 
25573 1 Whenever you use this lens for Indore shooting with standards flash you get this lens shadow on pictures captured at below 35mm focal length. You have to use external flash light or capture without flash. Useful only for outdoor shooting without using standard flash. 
25574 4 A well made quality camera sling. At first, it can be a little tricky in using the optional armpit strap, but once you become familiar with it, you are good to go, without slippage that you get from other camera slings. 
25575 3 I got these in the mail and all of the Capacitors were bent over. after Testing I carefully moved the capacitors back into place and tested again and they all still worked. Rating would be higher if packaged a little differently but for the price I couldn t complain. 
25576 1 Always buy this products do is good , for some reason this time picture where no good, we waist half pack, picture never look good :( 
25577 4 Love it. Takes great pictures at a portable size. I love being out door, hiking, boating, jet skis, four wheeling, etc and this camera is great for travel. I can slip it in my pocket and go go go and get awesome pics too. :) 
25578 4 Perfect 
25579 4 perfecto 
25580 3 It is what it is. I m still learning how and where and when I will use it , but it serves my originally intended purpose very well and is fairly sturdy. 
25581 4 great item and fast shipping 
25582 3 GOOD BIRD 
25583 4 This is the best slider I ever had. It s short to carry, extends on a tripod, super smooth ride for awesome shots. Wide rails can hold heavier load. Inexpensive, well built, and it s pleasure to work with it. I rate it A+++. 
25584 4 This will make it so much easier to take pics. works great 
25585 3 Thank You 
25586 4 Fits great` 
25587 4 Excellent value. I have a GoPro but this excellent value allows me to place a camera in more dangerous locations with less concern. Mask works great also. 
25588 4 It worked so well that I bought two more. 
25589 4 excelent 
25590 4 Wow! I am really impressed with the quality! It is very sturdy and solid. The tripod is heavy, so I don t see myself lugging this thing around on a nature walk, but I knew that from the other reviews. 
25591 4 Exceptional quality, performance, and guarantees. The filters from this great company are now the best ones I m using. 
25592 4 Great purchase! Just remember you need to manual focus...no big deal for me. 
25593 4 worked grate 
25594 4 Awesome camera & bundle! 
25595 3 A unique solution that was very much needed. Been using it for months now and it hasn t broke. Very surprising given what this thing is 
25596 4 Works great 
25597 4 Excellent bulbs. Very bright, doesn t get very hot & no buzzing. 
25598 4 Solid case. Tight seal. Fits Gopro, battery charger, plug and two batteries easily. Carabiner is cheap, but I swapped it out for an s-biner. Clear lid is nice if you have multiple boxes that are the same color. 
25599 3 Good product and fit at an affordable price. Only negative is it took over a month to ship from China. 
25600 2 Doesn t hold a charge as well as the battery that came with the drone. 
25601 1 Didn t fit the Canon Mark II as advertised (requires an adapter). Misleading BS and it s overpriced. 
25602 2 Does its job 
25603 4 Wow great item for great price 
25604 0 I received a tripod that has been used and has scratches all over. I didn t return it yet because I feel lazy of going through the return process. 
25605 1 There is a big problem to installing it without a detailed English instruction manual; for example: the function and connecting the J1,J2 and J3 terminals. 
25606 4 Hooked it up prior to installing and everything looks good 
25607 4 10 points. everything was as expected 
25608 4 Good camera, especially you don t need remember about battery charging. Just keep extra 4 AA with you. Quality is great for this price, well you are not buying a $1000 camera, so don’t expect more for this money. 
25609 4 Exactly what I need for pictures 
25610 4 cheap and good 
25611 4 In case your camera lenses are vampires like mine. 
25612 4 Nice addition to the camera bag. This along with the STK aftermarket batteries have been extremely reliable (just as good as the factory units). 
25613 4 This is such a cute camera!! 
25614 4 A good product. 
25615 1 It s so small so it s kind of hard to focus in on an object. Not very pleased with it. 
25616 4 I ordered this because I ve always wanted a polaroid. Best purchase I ve ever made! It came very quickly, and is so cute! Definitely worth the money I payed for it! 
25617 4 as advertised 
25618 2 Does the job, but very hard to find the right focus. 
25619 4 It s perfect 
25620 3 Bought this for my Pentax k-50 with 18-55mm lens. Fits snugly and works just fine. Note: This is for the weather resistant form of the lens, from what I understand this will not fit the non-WR lens. 
25621 4 As advertised. Works great for sunsets. 
25622 4 I absolutely love these little lenses... I have had fun playing around. My favorite is the macro lens and here is an image where it was used. My phone is iPhone 6 plus... 
25623 0 it does not fucus well, bought it for fy son s 8th grade promotion... and ended it taking pictures with my phone, they came out better with my phone :( 
25624 4 I love it.!!! 
25625 4 My Daughter love this, I gave it to her for her 11th birthday 
25626 0 fake leather.screw not work on tripod 
25627 4 I received my camera today and was very pleased with it. It arrived earlier than anticipated, it was the best priced camera and had the most accessories included. I can t wait to try it out this weekend with the family! 
25628 3 Lights up the area I wanted it to 
25629 4 Plenty of room for my scope and camera with several lenses 
25630 1 Shows black and white and no wireless. 
25631 4 Really happy with this case. It holds my Samsung point-and-shoot. Has a small pocket for cords or cards. Just perfect. 
25632 3 I ve had this for a few years now and it has never given me a bit of trouble. The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a feature to reorient an individual picture. 
25633 4 the best choice for pro photo shoot 
25634 3 Works good in my Canon VIXIA HFR20. Gives battery time remaining on the screen. So camera thinks it s a Canon battery. 
25635 4 Good price-good product-fast delivery. 
25636 2 My videos and images are of poor contrast and lots of noises even in good light, don t know if this the case with others or not. 
25637 4 Great selfie stick, I love it 
25638 0 well after using this the first time I needed to order a new Panasonic ZS40 to replace my ZS20 Youz can guess the rest anyway hate to upgrade that way 
25639 4 If you re gonna drop the money for the T5, get this bundle. The extras are good quality, and the extra lens makes this an awesome deal. 
25640 3 a gift 
25641 3 Pictures were nice and functioned under water. However some of the pictures look blurry. 
25642 4 Works perfectly. Helps get the best shot and is super sturdy! 
25643 4 Works great! 
25644 3 I did plenty of research and this was a great deal. I was also happy the bag was Canon brand. Although the 16 gig memory card was corrupted after just 4 uses??!! 
25645 4 The real deal! 
25646 4 very happy good product 
25647 4 Everything Ok! Thanks 
25648 4 Great little package, easy to mount and install...Thanks 
25649 4 Workout great 
25650 4 Exactly what I needed for my Tamron 70-200 mm 2.8. Fits with lens hood and collar. Nice quality and protects lens well. 
25651 3 not bad for the price, not the best quality. 
25652 1 did not fit 
25653 4 Amazing! My husband love stargazing but doesn t like to pull out our big telescope all the time this has been perfect for him. I would definitely reccomend a good tripod with this to get the clearist view. 
25654 2 This tripod is great for a point and shoot. I used it in a pinch to set my dslr on, but don t trust it. 
25655 4 Good 
25656 1 Leg support came apart after a few weeks and the little handle broke. 
25657 3 Good veiw 
25658 4 5 stars because you can t beat the value for price. I filmed a time lapse first chance I got and loved the results. Using the wifi mode a huge plus. 
25659 3 Very nice product.....! 
25660 0 First of all, don t advertise a specific color when it isn t available. If I wanted a pink one, I would have ordered a pink one. I didn t even bother checking quality because I m so disappointed with the color. 
25661 3 I got this so I can be able to load up my photos on my computer. 
25662 4 Works great on my t3i. Love how the photos turn out with this lens. It s a lot heavier than I expected to be. Not really a problem though. 
25663 4 Our family loves hiking and this makes even the younger one to go on one Very comfortable on delicate skin of younger kids too 
25664 3 The memory card that it comes with is not a micro card. 
25665 4 great Quality and great Service it fit my Camera perfect give it a try. 
25666 2 This is the gift for my mom and she loves it. But the automatically turn on/off function is not working. 
25667 4 This was everything I needed it to be. It is a great small Tripod good for webcam or still digital camera. It holds the camera steady and is easy to adjust. 
25668 4 Does the job. Takes quick photos and prints them out. So glad I have this camera. :) 
25669 4 Great value!!!! 
25670 4 love it It makes my camera larger and easy to hold... 
25671 1 waste of money 
25672 4 Got exactly what was advertised. Fit like a glove. Now I have a replacement!! Great deal! 
25673 4 Great item! The set is definitely worth the cost. 
25674 2 I give this product 3 stars because the tripod broke after 2 days I had the tripod, I read the reviews about it and they were true. The other reason why is that the quality of the camera isn t too good but I still like it. 
25675 4 Works as intended. Fast delivery. If you need a portable light, you can not go wrong with this one. 
25676 3 Very nice case. Only reason it didn t get a &#34;5&#34; was it needed to be a little bigger for me. Fine quality case though. 
25677 4 Perfect gift, daughter loved it 
25678 4 Perfect fit. 
25679 4 It s very very good, buy it !!!! 
25680 1 I am going to send the product back. It will not do what I bought it for. I wanted to use it for surveillance looking through a window to the outside and the picture quality just is not there. 
25681 4 Product is as advertised. 
25682 4 Fine! It s just a charger! 
25683 0 BE CAREFUL! It is good, if you have little camera and you need it just sometimes at family meetings and don´t want to spend money for expensife stuff, but for middle-sized cameras it´s absolutely terrible. For active photographing it´s too weak! 
25684 4 The product arrived right on time. I used the charger to charge the old battrey, and it worked great. The &#34;charging light&#34; and &#34;fully changed light&#34; worked as they should. Good product so far. 
25685 0 Product broke as soon as I opened it. The part the camera sits on comes off now and I can t seem to fix it.. 
25686 4 I ordered several lenses from Digital Goja. Everything was great. I wouldn t hesitate to order more from them in the future. 
25687 4 Awesome product 
25688 4 What can be said about a mobius that hasn t been said already? Great picture, light, and easy to mount in a variety of locations. Wish I hadn t waited so long to buy one. 
25689 4 it works o.k. thank you dan 
25690 4 This is a must buy for observing the moon. The moon is incredibly bright. Good quality filter fits right on any 1.25&#34; EP. 
25691 4 Awesome camera for the price! I snorkel with it twice a week. Underwater shots are amazing! 
25692 4 I love this camera, exactly what im looking for. I used so much for street photography, my travels and partys, everything in one camera. I just I love t. 
25693 4 It is perfect for my camera! Great and fast service! 
25694 4 Good for the price - works well 
25695 4 Seem very durable. Wish you could pick the color. I got the white ones. 
25696 4 Excellent. Works great for my camera! 
25697 0 the light doesnt work 
25698 4 Arrived quickly and fits my Sony @6000 perfectly. 
25699 3 This is great for a day trip and if you don t want to carry a lot of lenses. very comfortable to wear. 
25700 4 Everithing was as I expected 
25701 4 Fits tight, but that s how I like it. Case comes with a shoulder strap, main pocket for the camera, and outer pocket for memory cards and batteries. Works great at a great price 
25702 4 Very happy with my product and fast shipping 
25703 4 I really love this filter. It is so much better then stacking filters. All you have to do is dial in the darkness you want and shoot 
25704 4 GOOD! 
25705 1 Dont have batteries 
25706 2 Kit was ok, but bag was smaller than I expected. 
25707 4 Works great! Easily charges my GoPro battery. 
25708 1 Received shattered screen twice. Amazon/seller was quick to refund my purchases, but it suffices to say, I will not be ordering another one. I wouldn t classify this item as &#34;ultra durable.&#34; 
25709 4 This is a great camera. I take it everywhere with me. It takes great pictures and has an easy to understand layout for us novices. 
25710 3 Does what it s supposed to. 
25711 0 If you re 3 inches away from the &#34;camera&#34;, the motion detector works great. You get what you pay for. I bought 2 and only one works. 
25712 3 nice 
25713 4 Saw comment from someone else that charger was cheap plastic....so big deal. It works great and the batteries charge fine. I am absolutely satisfied for this battery pack and charger. 
25714 4 Fits my Pentax K50 perfectly. No issues. 
25715 4 The product arrived quickly and works very well. I have a three-story town home, and it keeps me from having to climb up and down the stairs to talk. 
25716 4 I think this might be the best lens money can buy, if you only have $50 to spend on a lens. 
25717 4 This gopole is lightweight and durable. Has held up from many high impact falls. Collapses small enough to pack in a backpack. 
25718 3 Nice LITTLE LED light for cell phone, good value and good price. It was made for iPhone 4s, included a 4s case. You will probably use the lights only and throw away the case. 
25719 4 Perfect 
25720 4 great value 
25721 2 It s ok. 
25722 4 Excellent quality, feels very solid excellent picture. Easy to set up. A word of caution: make sure you restart your router and camera after making changes to your router and camera settings. It will make your life easier. 
25723 4 Absolutely love this lens. Got it for a Canon Rebel T3i and it is amazing! LOVE it. Would definitely recommend. 
25724 4 Works with Piper system... took a while to get connected but it finally got up and running and works great! 
25725 3 This is a great buy but if you haven t got your Phantom yet buy the Phantom kit with 2 batteries and save some money. 
25726 4 Compact size, perfect. 
25727 4 So far so good. it really need a powerful memory card tho. 
25728 4 Works well! 
25729 4 Excelent 
25730 4 Great for weddings 
25731 3 Works fine. Like most products it could use a better manual. 
25732 3 Seems to successfully charge the Ricoh GR also, for those that may be wondering. Your mileage may vary but it seems compatible with the otherwise difficult to find proprietary in-camera charging cable. 
25733 4 Coolpix indeed. Great 20mp pix with Nikon simple (if you read instructions) focusing. 
25734 4 Does what I expect a tiny tripod to do. Holds my T3i well, but usually it sits under my GoPro or Contour+2. Feels like pretty solid construction. 
25735 4 Great 
25736 3 its good for what it is but I should have bought a longer zoom 
25737 4 My husband and I are professional photographers and we both love these. They leave camera lenses (and eyeglasses!) lint free and the price is awesome. Great product. Excellent service. 
25738 4 Drone is fantastic! The seller did a great job in shipping it quickly. This being a 4K camera you ll have to put it in JPEG or some other format for others to view your video. 
25739 4 Extremely impressed by the quality of the drone and the images we have been able to capture. HIGHLY recommended! 
25740 4 Works good so far. 
25741 4 good 
25742 3 Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found that it fits fine. One star off because it s not quite Canon quality, but then again it s not Canon Price either. Good looking and works, for a reasonable price. 
25743 4 Amazing for the money! 
25744 4 Love it! 
25745 4 Nice camera and its construction looks and feels solid. I like its features and although I am an amateur photographer it helps me to take nice pictures. 
25746 4 good coverage. user friendly. good quality video. 
25747 4 Great piece of equipment, got it for my wife. 
25748 4 Great camera. Comes with lens cap and neck strap. Great photos. This really takes great pictures and really looks and works like a brand new camera. Would definitely recommend. 
25749 4 great modifier, good quality 
25750 0 Worst kit ever!! Because of those accessories I lost my gopro! 
25751 4 If you don t want to spend the big bucks for name brand batteries, these are definitely for you. Great price, great packaging, and no problems at all with either of the batteries. 
25752 2 Cut to the chase, you pretty much get what you pay for here, the quick release plate lever is very weak and flimsy... 
25753 3 Good one 
25754 4 I had previously purchased a T5 from The Imaging World and was very pleased with the service and fast shipping. I am still breaking in my new 70D and the purchase experience was once again excellent. 
25755 3 Great for a low cost alternative. Most useful in the sun. 
25756 4 Bought to keep as a spare. Arrived just before I broke a bulb. 
25757 3 I am really enjoying my camera but the best part is the service in setting it up. 
25758 3 very happy with this, nice upgrade from my Spyder 2 
25759 4 Greatt 
25760 4 Does what it s supposed to do and does it at a cheap price. Can t go wrong. I use this on my Nikon D3300 
25761 4 Exactly what we needed and works great! 
25762 0 Images are faded not sharp and clear. I should have bought a spotting scope with a camera attachment. 
25763 4 everything was great!! 
25764 4 These are worth every penny, I also shoot with alien bees and Einstein. These will perform perfect for anyone starting out that does not want to spend a lot of money right away. 
25765 4 Works great, no fuss. Standard 2-flat-prone connector for the US as well as car charger and EU adaptor as stated. 
25766 0 The grip does not match the photo. It does not have the &#34;thumb joystick toggle&#34; or the other button. It feels poorly made and is clearly not a quality clone of the Canon vertical grip for the 7d mkII 
25767 3 I would have given it 5 stars if I wasn t missing the thread adapter I have to now go get one from Home Depot myself :/ other than that the build quality is superb for this price 
25768 3 Takes good pictures 
25769 1 Flimsy, tons of bubbles (and i applied correctly), not very strong adhesive 
25770 3 Not bad. Does the job. The pin hole for the video is more obvious than I would like but no one has noticed it yet. 
25771 4 They are the best comparing to any price point. The 15X50 are ideal all the way to as close as 15 feet. Not heavy as some have said. You can read reviews all day long as I did, you will not find a better pair anywhere! 
25772 4 Complete package deal! 
25773 4 Works and fits very well. Wayyyyy cheaper than really right stuff brand that is similar. Fits all really right stuff ball heads and mefoto heads 
25774 4 Works great! Thank you! 
25775 1 Everything was good but it did not contain the yellow float, so we had to go buy one for another twenty dollars. 
25776 2 Works good, but is flimsy and bends easily, if your camera is over a pound or so the tripod becomes unstable. 
25777 4 The cameras are great. They do exactly what I needed. 
25778 4 This is a great bag,just what I was looking for! 
25779 3 Good 
25780 4 A great purchase. If I bought it again, though, I would purchase the larger one. It is difficult to fold up, though. Look for a tutorial on youtube and plan to take a few times before you figure it out. 
25781 4 I ve used this lens with a d3200 and it makes the pictures look stunning. This lens produces sharp and detailed images. This is a bang for your buck because you can t beat the price. 
25782 4 Highly Recommended !! 
25783 4 Very good camera 
25784 3 Works great. Only drawback is that it is a large heavy piece of equipment. 
25785 4 Great camera, great pictures, easy to use. 
25786 4 Excellent 
25787 4 Awesome unit. The technology this has is amazing! Should cost thousands more! Does everything it says it doeas and more. Pics are beyond belief! Don t be scared, my 5 year old grandson can fly it! 
25788 4 Better pictures with this. Should have had one long ago 
25789 4 thicker walls than original. fits great. 
25790 4 The waterproof housing is foolproof. The picture quality is excellent. And, it s easy to use. 
25791 4 Excelent product 
25792 4 The glasses are awesome. The video and audio are exactly what I was hoping for, and the simplicity of using the glasses a huge bonus. 
25793 4 I was recording a video of me plowing my driveway and this microphone recorded even when I was inside the truck and more than 60 feet away! 
25794 4 Excellent lens! 
25795 4 These are just as good as the original GoPro batteries and seem to last just as long if not a little longer. I ve been using these for about 2 months now with no problems to date. 
25796 0 Panhead broke in just one use. VERY weak. I can t purchase the panhead alone. But what do you expect for $16. 
25797 4 Worked great. Needed for a speech class in college and worked without a hiccup. 
25798 4 I love this pack. Its very well built, fits my Phantom 3, Canon 7D, 24-700, 70-200, 50 1.2, and all needed accessories. So nice to have everything in one bag. Great product! 
25799 4 Batteries arrived on time and fit into my D90 perfectly and are just what I needed 
25800 2 ITS JUST A a bigger version of a micro usb 
25801 4 Love this little album. It will be perfect for a guest book at my daughter s Jamaica wedding.!!! 
25802 4 Great bundle! Especially awesome considering I was headed to Europe with it and it already had a converter! 
25803 1 Somewhat usable, constantly have to make adjustments and re tighten parts of the rig that easily become loose. Rig is very front heavy when assembled with any serious camera set up. I need at least 10 pounds on my shoulder to balance it. 
25804 4 Very Powerful, but heavy 
25805 3 Great lines. The low light performance isn t the best but that s not really what it is for. The zoom range is excellent. 
25806 2 For the price its a decent value. Only wish O could afford better glass 
25807 3 Used these for a DIY Photobooth we put together for our wedding. Everyone loved them! Really easy to put together, but I recommend using a glue gun versus the glue tabs that it comes with. 
25808 4 Works great. For all the reviewers that complain about it only facing one direction: try turning the pole..... 
25809 4 Very smooth and solid !!! The slider is very smooth, didn’t need any adjustment. You can use the screw(package included) to connect your dslr camera, but i recommend you to connect with a ball head. Cause it will be more flexiable to operate. 
25810 4 Replaced the pick and pluck after a month. Went with the padded dividers for on set use. I can put the pick and pluck back in when I fly. 
25811 4 Great cable 
25812 3 Gave this one as a gift and it was well received. 
25813 1 These are not bad but the fit with the clips is very very tight. I have had to grind off a few high points to get them to work. My next order I ll spend the extra money for the gopro clips. 
25814 0 Did not work!!!!!! 
25815 3 Works, awesome for it s price, if you zoom out completely u will have dark edges,and I don t bother made a lead many great picd 
25816 2 cheap for what it is 
25817 4 I have shot some of the most amazing videos with this camera. Excellent quality, and very, very durable. 
25818 4 Got it on time. Has everything I need. Looks and works great on my bike. Great value for the price. Very happy! 
25819 4 Best 50mm lense ive used so far. Its really quite. Takes very sharp pictures, great addition to my Canon 70D! 
25820 4 This is a present to the world. 
25821 4 thanks!) 
25822 3 my nephew live it! thanx 
25823 3 Quality product, just as described. 
25824 4 Works great for small things to photograph. 
25825 4 I wanted something very minimal for a very small camera (Fujifilm X100 series), and this fits the bill perfectly. The swivels work as advertised - no more tangles! 
25826 4 love it! 
25827 4 Everything went ok with it ! 
25828 4 Works find for my 72 lens. for the price can t beat it. T 
25829 1 The 3 prongs are too tight, so it s really hard to get the camera in there. Also the plastic around the ball is really cheap and looks like it can break at any time. Overall not good. 
25830 4 A+ 
25831 4 Excellent backup to the provided fastener that came with my black rapid camera strap. Now I have a fastener for both if my camera bodies 
25832 4 Works great in my old 35mm cameras! 
25833 4 Love the colors 
25834 4 Good buy. Very happy with this. 
25835 3 Very sturdy and light weight. Easy to carry around 
25836 0 The glue was not sticking 
25837 1 A lot shorter and narrower than I expected 
25838 4 Great value for the money. Wonderful views of the skies. 
25839 4 i CANNOT BELIEVE HOW GOOD THE PICTURES ARE COMING OUT FOR A VERY MODERATE PRICE. 
25840 3 Great case for the price. Camera is a little loose in the case but the case will serve my purpose 
25841 3 Useful, really water resistant, not so good underwater color photos 
25842 2 It s good for the money. Wouldn t say it s 720. Also only 30fps, not 60. 
25843 4 Quickest shopping ever! Best camera ever! 
25844 1 These clips worked well when attacking the camera to them, but when clipping them to actual mounts (like gopros adhesive mounts, or a chesty) the clips were to tight and impossible to remove without breaking them. 
25845 4 Great tripod with smart phone mount! Good construction, easy to use, nice storage bag and lens cleaning cloth included. The low price and convenience of front door delivery makes this the deal of the year! I love it! 
25846 2 Great camera good clarity, never seen software with so many issues. Different results in different browser. Worked only on windows 7 
25847 4 This is my third case and I m more than happy with them. There is no better way to keep my photo gear protected, perfect for storage and travel, can t go wrong with this case, highly recommended! 
25848 4 LOVE LOVE LOVE! If you re still doubting, STOP and JUST PURCHASE! You won t regret it! 
25849 2 It s not exactly what I ve expected but it s ok for other uses. A little to much of a toy instead of a pro kit. 
25850 4 Works great. 
25851 4 Love-Love-Love this camera. It makes me feel like a real pro! This package deal was definitely unbeatable. 
25852 4 Great 
25853 4 Always buy factory batteries. The other brands are pretty poor. Great quality battery. 
25854 4 Nice product, quick delivery. This backpack does a great job of storing and protecting my Phantom 3. 
25855 4 This fit my hero 3+ underwater housing very well. 
25856 3 I don t really find the gorilla pod useful for my DSLR, it s not able to handle the weight. Note.. make sure your camera supports infrared snapshots unlike me. 
25857 4 Could be a hair larger, but does job for me...I stuff it with filters, and two to three old med format folders... 
25858 1 Rarely works. Sometimes I need to click continuously for two minutes until it works 
25859 4 For an older camera this one fits the bill nicely. great pictures and still has tons of attachments available. 
25860 4 I was displeased with the photo quality of GoPro cameras, and decided to try out a waterproof camera for snorkeling and shallow dives instead. I couldn t be happier - it takes phenomenal photos above and below water, and I have had no problems with leaking or humidity. 
25861 4 Son loves his case. 
25862 4 Great Lens! Beautiful pictures! Not a bad price for an L glass. 
25863 2 The camera runs down batteries really fast when doing any video. Tried using 2300 mah rechargeables worked a little better but still ran them down quickly 
25864 4 I am so in love with my new lense. It fits my camera and I can t wait to start shooting! Very excited ! Thank you! 
25865 4 Love this! Beautiful. Can t wait to get some awesome photos! 
25866 2 Pretty cheap and flimsy. Will do the job in a pinch, but I would not recommend buying it for a full camera. Maybe if you only wanted to use it for a small digital camera. 
25867 0 Broke on day 1 when used with a ful bag. Perhaps it s the bags fault (2nd strap to break off of this bag) but its now attached with carabiners. 
25868 4 tried it out, was as expected. a bit on the heavy, you ll need a good tripod. mine was a bit light. the tripod was great for heavy camera, but tripped over when I attached the Celestron. so now Im buying a tripod, enjoyed the Celestron view 
25869 2 It served as a replacement unit. 
25870 2 Works good. had to download 2cu app, but instructions suck. can it be viewed from a computer web browser using windows? No port information in manual. 
25871 4 Perfect fit for my Gopro hero 4, it is amazing that you don t need to carry your camera to capture the picture or video while your hand busy with other stuffs. I m definitely looking to buy other accessories for my Gopro. 
25872 4 this is a great kit at a great price...exactly what I was looking for. 
25873 4 Product was as advertised. 
25874 3 Depth 
25875 3 Downside is the screen is very small picture qulity prfect i like it. 
25876 4 I love that I can check in with my pups anytime. Also love that I get alerts to when there is motion and noise in certian areas. 
25877 4 Worked well. Held up to the salt water snorkeling and jumping into the water. 
25878 3 very good batteries. 
25879 4 Not one of these thing I ever cared to buy but I got tired of loading my ad cards or forgetting them in my pockets and sending them in the laundry. Case works great and is pretty solid. 
25880 3 Very nice, you can use it as a table cloth, curtain or camo cloth...I just don t use it much i have wall paper that looks similar and i dont need a stand or have to iron it but its good to have 
25881 4 Stronger material and stitching than I expected. 
25882 4 Just what I needed for my new camera........ 
25883 4 Great product. Exactly as described. Thanks. 
25884 3 The quality is adequate for the price. 
25885 4 This lenses everything I wanted. Clean and Chrix 
25886 4 So so so happy with the entire kit especially the camera. Was exactly what I needed and I m having to much fun with it! 
25887 4 Works well. Very happy with purchase. 
25888 3 Love the quality of light but wish it was more powerful. The charge is pretty poor too. I paid too much for this item but having said that I do use it regularly..... Just wish I had waited for the new one. 
25889 4 Good product good quality Very good seller 
25890 4 Easy to use, fit directly into d7100. The cons I see is that it can easily pop out of place. Good product 
25891 4 works fine 
25892 0 eh 
25893 4 My 17 year old daughter loves the features & smaller size of this camera. Great gift! 
25894 4 WORKS I THINK BETTER THAN THE GOPRO ONE 
25895 4 THIS IS MY SECOND ONE-----THE OLD ONE ( 4 YEARS OLD ), STILL WORKS GREAT, BUT I WANTED ANOTHER BEFORE IT BECOMES UNAVAILABLE. I HOOKED BOTH THE RECIEVER AND THE SENDER TO REMOTE X-FORMER SO I DON T NEED TO DEAL WITH REPLACEMENT BATTERIES. 
25896 3 Works great 
25897 4 Very easy to hook up brought 2 both took a total of 10 minutes to get working, finding place to plug in Cameras took the longest. Not a bad video image 
25898 4 Perfect ! 
25899 4 Grate 
25900 2 excellent item, very useful for whatever you want, 
25901 4 Very Good Product 
25902 0 The moment I plugged the charger + battery in, the circuits were tripped. I don t trust this product. I asked for a refund. 
25903 4 this POE NVR system is good constructed,nice package,NVR is real 1080P,cameras with nice image and POE function, real plug&play,no need more setting, when my monitor is on with this NVR, all the 4 channels are on also.very nice and price is also very good. 
25904 2 could be brighter 
25905 1 It drains the batteries to fast. 
25906 4 perfect 
25907 4 Perfect battery for my camera! 
25908 4 Works great! 
25909 0 In the ad they said it fit Leoca Q models however it is not 
25910 4 Great product 
25911 4 Everything was as I expected and works great. 
25912 4 Very nice case 
25913 4 Amazing product!! Very precisely cut glass for that perfect fit!! I was about to buy the screen protector that is much more expensive but I m glad I found this one. It s great value and fully protects my NEX-6 no problem. You won t regret it!! 
25914 3 Relatively easy to install the software which allows use, and the image generated is of reasonable quality (I am using to confirm authenticity of signatures and vintage documents). I would recommend this product. 
25915 4 Canon is great 
25916 4 This is a fabulous budget buy for umbrella s. Setup is minimal, and since they are used mostly indoor, I have no issues with wind, pets, children, etc. If you are just starting out with flash photography, you cannot go wrong with this setup. Highly recommend it. 
25917 4 good i like it but in night view it is not clear 
25918 2 Hard to install 
25919 4 This is a nice entry level tripod. The carrying case is a great touch. Perfect for the price! 
25920 0 It is too small for a regular camera -- probably works best with a smart phone. 
25921 4 works like a charm. I was having trouble hearing anyone at the door, and often found notes that someone had assumed no one was home. I get a lot of merchandise deliveries, and now know when someone just leaves a package without knocking. 
25922 3 Needed charger that works car. Works.as.advertised. 
25923 0 The product is crap. Don t buy it. Waste the $25 some place else.The tripod plate came apart the first time I touched it and is always loose. 
25924 3 It does the job, but honestly, I got better results as a point-and-shoot from my iPhone 4s. This camera is better for video, so there s that. 
25925 4 The spare battery and charger will likely never get much use, but it is reassuring to know that I have a spare battery, and the ability to recharge anytime independently of the camera. 
25926 4 cloths work very well 
25927 4 I absolutely love it! However, the instructions are entirely in Japanese. Wish me luck! 
25928 4 Awesome little camera! 
25929 4 Great product 
25930 4 excelente producto 
25931 3 A great variety of accessories for the money, including a solid carrying case. Great purchase for anyone with a GoPro. 
25932 3 I like it but I must return because I already was given a new system that I can use. 
25933 4 LOVE it... strong and strudy, durable, fits my 18-135 (with cam), and 50 mm and still have LOT of room with my canon D70 
25934 4 Very handy lights. I bought several, and I love the feature where you can attach them to one another to make a bigger,brighter light source! 
25935 4 While my Nikon CLS system will operate a remote flash with the pop up on camera flash in bright sunlight the cable is reliable. Works well and a very good price. 
25936 3 great product, but missing the camera strap in the packaging 
25937 4 Great battery arrived on time. 
25938 0 nothing special just basic low end lens 
25939 4 Insanely good image quality and bokeh. I was on the fence if I needed an 85mm for portrait work on my DX-format Nikon, but I m so glad I bought this. 
25940 4 We are happy with the system. 
25941 4 Fits the camera as expected. Reasonably priced and comfortable. All in all a good replacement for the 7D. I am considering ordering a spare as I live abroad and cannot get these delivered fast. 
25942 4 Wife loves it. She uses it at work for her evidence. Thanks. 
25943 4 Great camera! Clear photos and easy to use! 
25944 4 As advertised. Good quality and shipped quickly. 
25945 4 great 
25946 4 I received thisis a very timely manner. It works great! 
25947 0 After owning this for 3 months I can say the hours of tech support are not worth it. It is unreliable and finicky. If you are an advance tech person then buy it and enjoy your time troubleshooting. 
25948 4 Good camera for the quality and price. This IP camera is full of features and can become a real toy if you are a good player and try to get into all the functionality. 
25949 2 Case Logic 
25950 4 nice 
25951 4 Wife loves her new gift. Brings those far away shots right up where you want them in a nice clear display. Very nice. 
25952 4 Thank you 
25953 4 just have to manually positon this unit to the desire position. the plastic housing feels that it will break if not handle with care 
25954 3 Fits Mobius with no issues, just like one that came with camera. Bubble level good idea but nice if a bit thinner. 
25955 4 Great fit!! Perfect length. Not flimsy. Great buy. 
25956 4 For the price you can t go wrong. Takes a little bit of time to set up as it s universal but for the price it works pretty good. All the reflectors you ll need for any kind of ambient lighting on your outdoor portrait shoot. 
25957 4 👍👌 
25958 4 thanks 
25959 4 Perfect fit. Good feel. Can t even tell it s there. 
25960 2 Good investment, although be warned, the filters don t really do anything. Save your money for an Orion telescope. 
25961 0 Terrible product - cheap - couldn t get it off my lens after I installed it! 
25962 3 I was expecting a little more quality food on the camera (comes out grainy with no flash indoors even when well lit). But for the price this is a good camera. 
25963 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
25964 4 First carry-on case that s big enough to handle all I want to pack. I especially like the removable insert section that fits even in commuter jet overhead storage. That allows me to carry on the most fragile components, even when the outer shell has to be gate checked. 
25965 1 Nice at first but fell apart at the plastic joints after a year. pay a little more and get a better quality tripod. 
25966 4 Arrived quickly and complete. The converter for Europe will come in handy! 
25967 4 Very good value. A lot of bang for your buck. Very well made. Images are very clear. 
25968 4 I love the way it look and small enough to carry around 
25969 4 Great product. Fits just right, protects the screen and you don t even know it s there. 
25970 2 was ok just smaller than we imagined. It was true to advertisement. 
25971 2 it was ok 
25972 2 It had light leaks though 
25973 4 I have a lot of wrist issues and this really helps with support. I don t worry about dropping my camera now! Shoot with a Nikon D600 
25974 4 as expected 
25975 4 Inexpensive, fits well and secure, gives you some room for grip. It clears the battery trap but because of the extra 1/2 inch, you ll need to pinch the battery out. 
25976 4 Very happy with these lights. Powerful, they display the color temp in Kelvin, they don t get hot, and they can run off batteries. Excellent. 
25977 4 I use it at the shooting range and it holds pretty steady. The focal length adjuster is a little too tight for my liking but this monocle does it s job pretty well. I can easily see my shots at 25 yards. 
25978 0 Sorry not good, returned item 
25979 4 This works beautifully for supplementing natural light with more natural light. It is large and very efficient. 
25980 4 I bought the kit to use with my new GoPro on a trip to Florida and was very happy with performance and the quality of the items in the kit. It was a great alternative to the higher price accessories I am completely happy with kit and with the seller. 
25981 4 It fits g7x screen perfectly. 
25982 4 great buy 
25983 4 Good 
25984 4 Its great camera float to the top, Very pleased with it 
25985 4 Cute throw at least that is the purpose I used it for and this does the job. I put it on the back of my daughter s mod chair and she loves it. 
25986 4 The camera is wonderful and the company is amazing! 
25987 4 Exactly what I was looking for. 
25988 2 adequate 
25989 4 It works OK. 
25990 4 Lasts longer than generic 
25991 4 Bought for a friend and he likes it. 
25992 4 Great value, better than my expectations. These last as long as the originals. 
25993 4 Great quality and Great Price. 
25994 4 excelente 
25995 4 Show 
25996 4 Very lightweight and easy to grip. Just what I needed. 
25997 4 Great camera 
25998 4 The product met expectations. 
25999 4 Love the driveway alert doorbell, we actually use it for our apartment to know when someone is coming down our steps because we live in the rear of the building. 
26000 1 Can t tell yet. Camera arrived defective and had to be returned. 
26001 0 not easy to operate 
26002 4 This helps when I m playing paintball so I don t have a shiny camera on my helmet 
26003 2 Very heavy, clumsy. A sturdy base/light stand is needed--not a folding stand. 
26004 4 A great inexpensive filter. 
26005 4 Typical DJI quality. 
26006 3 Great product. Fits like a glove - almost too tight. Definitely protects the camera. Just a little work to get the camera in and out. 
26007 4 Fast shipping, great price! 
26008 3 It fits in very nicely with my new Hero 4 Silver. 
26009 3 Daughter loves it and takes her selfie stick everywhere. Everybody comments on how pretty the crystals are. Came fast and was a pleasure to buy from this seller. 
26010 1 If you want HD quality, don t get this. Sound wasn t great. Bought for a wedding and then a rock show, and was not impressed. Returning ASAP. 
26011 1 Pole grip moves and ended up ripping after about 6 months of use. GoPro s are suppose to withstand a any type of activity and weather and this did not. 
26012 3 It was what I expected. 
26013 1 Received in good time however the screen contrast is poor and quality not great. Price was good though so at least I can see the controls again! 
26014 3 Nice - works well - foam insert just a hair too small so it comes out easily. 
26015 4 Good stuff!! Quality aftermarket product. Pretty happy with my purchase. 
26016 3 good product. The format is AVI and doesn t work with I-Mac s unless you download a third party program that reads the AVI format 
26017 4 Good 
26018 4 great camera. read the instriuctions 
26019 0 heavy 
26020 0 Extremely bad picture quality. Not sure if it is just this particular camera but its pretty bad. I ll send it back 
26021 3 Only used this once. No start up instructions, finally figured it out. 
26022 4 Really like the clarity and features of the image and frame. Would recommend this brand to anyone! 
26023 4 Good as the OEM. No complaints. 
26024 4 Took this camera with me on recent trip. Great videos and photos. Easy to use. 
26025 0 batteries discharge VERY rapidly!! Nowhere as good as my orginal Sony batteries. 
26026 4 As described. Fast shipping. 
26027 4 Love it - use it everyday to monitor activities of my pets. 
26028 4 Excellent fit! No messing around with loose fitting connectors. 
26029 4 I fell in love with the quality and all of the tiny pockets. Such an awesome bag!!!!!! 
26030 4 I bought it to offer some protection for the lens on a Sony HDR-CX430V video camera. It s wide angle so the hood never shows in my video, which was a concern. 
26031 4 Thank you! 
26032 4 It is so cute and so well made. I love it! 
26033 0 This does not fit the a6000 properly. It is missing a lip at the front end to slide in, which causes it to protrude from the back. 
26034 4 love the product it fitted my xa20... 
26035 4 Ordered this for a friend after they saw the one I bought earlier for my home. Easy to setup and use. 
26036 1 Looks good but could not find 8gb sd card at all 
26037 4 Didn t sink that s forsure! thanks! haha 
26038 4 Camera is quite realistic. 
26039 4 Works great. Plug & play like an original cable release 
26040 3 The Canon brand batteries seem to last longer than the cheap copies. The only reason I didn t give it five stars is because of the price. 
26041 4 Nice case at a great price. Genuine Samsung product. 
26042 4 Cane right on tiem for my trip with my new waterproof camera ! I was concerned the thin string would pop and it didnt n it went through alot lol. Thanks again. 
26043 0 Used the mount on my mountain bike. After a few uses the tightening screw cracked. 
26044 4 Great product and super shipping. Thanks so much. 
26045 1 didn t work with my Alpha 77 / Alpha 65 camera i dont know what s wrong , maybe it s defective or maybe it s a battery issue , i have no idea 
26046 0 that wasn t working 
26047 4 Works great and the price was less than what we found locally 
26048 1 Does not have the extended end tabs that help you align it perfectly before touching it down. I missed badly when trying to position it. Wound up throwing it away. 
26049 4 Well made nice padding 
26050 4 A great upgrade to the f/1.8 version 
26051 2 Very Manual - It s fun to play around with, but I feel like you have to use a tripod because any movement you make will cause blur. It s very manual, but fun if you are just killing time and taking photos of birds. 
26052 4 Fine product, great service. 
26053 2 This came with zero information or instructions on how to use. I m trying to decide if I want to send it back. 
26054 4 Great kit! Fast shipping! And you can t beat the price! Nothing has broken yet! :) 
26055 4 Fast delivery and product is exactly as advertised. 
26056 1 I expected much better quality photos with 20.1 MP resolution. It could be that I relied too much on the &#34;Intelligent Auto Mode&#34;. Unfortunately my pictures turned out grainy and out of focus even when I used a prop to hold the camera still when shooting. 
26057 4 Works as advertised. Nice to get everything together, especially one charging block that can be plugged into the car charger or into a 110V outlet. 
26058 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
26059 3 Excellent 
26060 4 Great we love it! 
26061 2 Good,but not reliable,it works but not what I was expected 
26062 4 Great value. Good for someone without smartphone or tablet. 
26063 4 It s cool camera and amazing performance! I could take beautiful pictures and movies 25m depth under water. 
26064 4 Overall the product is very good for the price. I would definitely recommend this alarm. 
26065 3 Works fine. But the black len will be in the picture. 
26066 3 As advertised 
26067 3 Great camera for the price. Im using it more than my 18-55mm. 
26068 4 As advertised! Not a lot of experienced yet as how will it behave, but looks great and charged well so far. 
26069 4 No issues. 
26070 4 I was very happy with my X1 UV MRC4 77mm that I bought 67mm for another lens. 
26071 4 Great product. Extremely satisfied with it for the price. 
26072 4 Just what we needed when our other battery kept dying on vacay. Now we ll have a spare fully charged. 
26073 4 Too Much Stuff and not enough time to use it. 
26074 4 I got 2 of these for my girl and myself. They both worked great we had no issues. Thanks for the product! 
26075 2 Worked great until..... The ring that holds the lens in one of the pieces (macro) fell out, thus allowing the lens to come out of the mount :( 
26076 4 Exactly what I was looking for to replace my original Olympus C7AU that I lost in a move. Works perfectly. Great for when the camera is on a tripod because the battery compartment gets covered by the tripod attachment, which makes it annoying when batteries need changing. 
26077 4 We are using this as a baby monitor and it has been great. Only problem is that it used to send me notifications of movement, but it doesn t anymore, and I can t figure out why...but I still love it! 
26078 4 Sick case 
26079 4 Great product, thank you. 
26080 4 An inexpensive way to soften off-camera strobe. Does what it s supposed to do. Appears to be made well, especially for the price. 
26081 4 The mouth mount from Ho Stevie is an extremely comfortable mount!!! It is great for surfing. I would recommend this product to anyone that enjoys hands free videoing!!! 
26082 4 Works perfectly with my Canon EOS Rebel T3i, was easy to set up, and it s very easy to use. No complaints at all for this product, it s a pretty straightforward wireless remote control. I use it to start and stop recording for video wireless and it works great! 
26083 4 Items came in a good package. All items fit my Gopro very well. I will be buying another one with for the touch bacpac in the future 
26084 4 Just as described. I use this for shooting over babies as to not lose my grip. 
26085 4 I will keep this as a spare. 
26086 4 I love this case. It keeps anything smelly (cigars and the like) from stinking up my purse. I spray painted the lid white before using it so the contents wouldn t be easily visible. 
26087 4 I use them for the lake and football games. They are a excellent value a little long but they are manageable without the use of a tripod. Wish I had bought these sooner 
26088 4 Quick shipment and good value! 
26089 4 Cool price. It s republished but good work. I can access easily by internet & my smart phone. 
26090 4 Fits on the Nikon 7100d camera 
26091 0 Stopped working after 3 months. 
26092 4 fits perfect, very easy to use. I plan to purchase one for every lens I have. 
26093 4 Speedy delivery, chest strap holds camera in place when shooting video on motorcycle. Happy with product. 
26094 4 received the pen in only 2 days. looks very simple to use. charging now and going to use it right away. does not look cheaply made. and the pen even writes. 
26095 4 This was a present for my wife to replace the Cannon she has had for many years. She loves it and the great pictures she takes. 
26096 4 As its suppose to, it fits my lens. John 
26097 0 Only work once 
26098 4 Perfect love it 
26099 1 It scraped by lens body, leaving a permanent mark of scratch. 
26100 4 Just what i needed an extra charging cord. 
26101 4 Great surveillance system. Cheap but does the job perfectly. 
26102 4 It s well made and my service dog enjoys it 
26103 2 It is 1600mAh vs 1060 in the original battery, but the original battery is heavier and lasts longer. 
26104 4 Thanks, it was on time delivery and the pro woks well 
26105 1 the top part of the tripod where the go pro screws on broke off the first time i used it. the plastic just stright up broke. if it hadn t borken so easily the concept of the wraparound legs is great. 
26106 4 Fits camera great. No room for nothing else. 
26107 4 good color with light, good night vision with IR enabled. Never thought my families are so closer with me and it 
26108 2 hard to get on the computer 
26109 4 Hoya makes good filters for reasonable prices. This one is great for making longer exposures of outdoor subjects such as waterfalls. 
26110 4 Was an outstanding birthday gift at a fraction of the price you would find at a big box retailer store such as best buy 
26111 2 A little small 
26112 4 Just what I needed great 
26113 4 Awesome little bag especially for use around the house and short trips with cannon camera 
26114 3 good product 
26115 2 everything works great except WI-FI, luckily at my business it was easy to connect to modem by cable, which works better with no pause for movement,need better instructions and problem solving, still worth it. 
26116 0 Very crappy material. Won t last long. Poor Poor quality! It s also very light and the slightest bit of wind will have it down the street. 
26117 4 Perfect for football season. I m going to pick up some extras. 
26118 4 Works grest 
26119 4 Great price on this great lens for getting that long shot of birds. Plus the super fast next day delivery was amazing. Thanks big mikes great service and products. I m sure I will buy more products from you. 
26120 4 Excellent product!!! 
26121 4 This camera is great. Telephoto shots are amazing. Love everything about this camera and cannot beat the great price! It is everything I need for London. You need the extra battery. 
26122 4 Used this with my Action Cam 200 and was very impressed with it. Very versatile as well. 
26123 4 This Camera was a used replacement for an identical camera I already had and it is great. My favorite when it comes to picture taking, so much so that I will be ordering another before this one wears out like my old one did. 
26124 3 They work, but it took a buncha effort to make the lighting and everything work, and even after that I needed to Photoshop it. 
26125 4 Works just fine. No frills, just does exactly what it says on the tin. 
26126 2 as a battery grip its great. but after 1 month the connection port for the grips shutter button broke. 
26127 4 I love this selfie stick good quality pretty sturdy 
26128 4 My favorite camera bag thus far. IT has plenty of space for my sony alpha 600 and go pro 4 gear. It is stylish and rugged. I am extremely happy with this purchase :) 
26129 3 decent but not great 
26130 3 I love this camera, works great for business and personal use 
26131 2 Does the trick for the price. Bottom plastic pieces are weak. 
26132 4 Arrived ahead of schedule. Great price. Works well. 
26133 0 Piece of crap 
26134 4 Excellent cameras and buyer was also available for a question. 
26135 4 Fit exact to AW130 givin aditional scratch protection and a waterproof toy look 
26136 0 Cameras need a small magnet and if u lose it and the camera loses power u have no way to reset the camera leaving it worthless wouldn t recommend this product 
26137 4 Just one word...Excellent!!! 
26138 4 Excelent 
26139 0 I though can be pair with any smart phones,android including Nokia Lumia that s why I bought it. But won t be able to used it the Bluetooth doesn t work with my phone otherwise have to used the timer. Little bit Disappointed! 
26140 4 The item was better than i expected. The fact that it had 50mm objective lens, the &#34;resolution&#34; is awesome! Easier to work with than binoculars i.e focusing on the object, looking through the eye piece, etc. definitely recommend! 
26141 3 It seems OK, I have not as yet used it myself, but my son said it seems OK 
26142 4 Amazing 
26143 1 i was expecting at least the cd driver for it 
26144 4 Functions exactly as intended 
26145 4 excellent service and product 
26146 3 Over all so so product. You get what you pay for. For this price it is a good bag for normal rough usage. Plenty of pockets and space. I dont like the strap but you can always attach a better one. It arrived on time actually same day. 
26147 4 I love the flexibility. It s better than the tripods that don t bend. 
26148 4 great transaction. Product as described 
26149 4 It is incredible, also amazon has packed me very well the lens, in an excellent State lleog and besides having excellent optics lens. 
26150 1 Honestly, I wasn t expecting much. But the picture quality is not good. I am very disappointed. Battery life is horrible. Slow to respond. Flash has to charge and it takes a few seconds. Just all around not much bang for your buck. 
26151 4 Lov 
26152 4 Great value. Individually wrapped for convenience. 
26153 4 Meets all my expectations for my digital images!!! 
26154 3 Very good 
26155 4 Came as advertised. Sharp focus and easy to handle. 
26156 3 good for bikes but wont fit on bigger pipes, railings 
26157 4 Love Moose Peterson s polarizer - works & warms as it s supposed to- hoya has been around forever 
26158 4 Yet to use this bag but my Canon SX-520 and accessories fit in well. 
26159 4 It s great to have backup batteries for the camera. 
26160 4 They work great and they are a fantastic price. 
26161 4 Worked like a charm! 
26162 4 Finally got a deal on it. I had a 102 before and loved it. Gave it to my in law and get this one. It is big for sure. But same high quality as 102. 
26163 4 5 star, bigger than advertised- it is 9.5 x 6.5 x 3 inches- well padded, and easily holds my canon SX110 Is camera and a charger. 
26164 4 Just as described, on time delivery= happy customer! 
26165 4 I absolutely love this camera! It takes beautiful pictures. 
26166 3 Bought this for my husbands birthday. He loves it. Light. Easy to carry. Stable. 
26167 4 works great 
26168 4 I love this lens! Thanks so very much! 
26169 2 plastic feels okay not the best 
26170 1 Be nice if this actually fit. P3 s need a lot of cutting. Still does not fit correctly. Phantom sits way to high which is now prone to damage and controller does not fit. Not impresses. 
26171 0 False advertising as it said 1000tvl on the description. Never buy anything under 1000tvl! Huge picture difference from my experience. 
26172 4 Very nice lens for my Nikon Dd3100 
26173 4 Works great 
26174 4 The product is way more then I expected. 
26175 4 Fit very nicely and did what it was suppose to do. For the price, I def recommend this product! 
26176 0 SUCKS Sucks sucks sucks Don t waste your money. Can t even get it to work!!! Waste of time! 
26177 4 Shipping great. Perfect gift 
26178 4 Left our charger at home on our trip. Was able to order this and get it shipped to where we were staying. Werks perfets and was just what we needed with great shipping. 
26179 0 Did not meet expectation and returned for a refund 
26180 3 Very Good product , not bad at all , the hand grip is very short , that s the only down side for me thus far , it s not suited for huge Cameras , of course , other than that , works very Good for me :) 
26181 1 slow in charging. My Nikon chargers are twice as fast. With the power supply I still have two pieces except with this charger only one plug is needed 
26182 3 Bought this on a whim. There are many products. Would advise getting something which gives more control over white balance. The filters are not ideal The color tones on face is variable. Price is okay. 
26183 0 Item failed to work properly! 
26184 3 It mounts the nvd on the head. No need to give it the hose again. 
26185 0 I did devolution of this product... 
26186 4 Very nice. 
26187 3 I researched many types of home security solutions and Canary ended up being my choice. I m happy with what I ve received for my investment. 
26188 4 I love this camera!! Underwater and not even in water it gives really good HD quality. I really enjoy using it on all the adventures I have with my family! 
26189 4 I added an electronic dead bolt to my alarm system. This key fob turns off the alarm and unlocks my front door. Very handy when coming home with an arm load of grocery etc. 
26190 4 Worked as hoped for. Prompt delivery. Good price. Thanks a million. 
26191 4 I m very pleased with my product. I traveled for 15 days and not failed. I m very happy with my Selfie Bluetooth Shutter Wireless Remote Control. Thanks Noot. 
26192 4 Easy to install and the iPhone app is Fantastic. Been very happy for the last two months. 
26193 4 Little on the heavy side But good camera 
26194 4 So I ve been walking with this every morning and it makes me feel a bit safer. It s small enough I can hold it in my hand and love the chain I can wear on my neck when needed. Hopefully I will never have to use it! 
26195 3 works great. 
26196 3 No complaints with the product. FYI - it does not come with a memory card, you have to purchase one separately. I wish I had know ahead of time since this was a gift, and I could have purchased one at the same time of my original order. 
26197 4 I take it to water parks and rivers. It s taken a beating yet looks great and functions as expected. 
26198 4 Love this bag. It fit my camera perfectly, I love how it has so many different compartments and pockets to store all the accessories or gadgets I want to bring along with me. 
26199 4 Great way to go OTA and still be able to record favorite programs etc. 
26200 3 So far works for my needs. The apps need improvement. Four stars is due to long wait time for customer support 20min to an hour on average. Danny was very helpful in assisting me with the product set up. 
26201 3 good and cute camera. Very good quality photos, and pretty easy to use 
26202 4 This battery works like a charm. My first impressions were that it had a nice fit, very good power capacity, and works exactly like the OEM. I can t really tell the difference between this and my Canon battery. Good buy for a budget professional! 
26203 4 Works well and we used it underwater with no problem. 
26204 0 Poor quality. Not worth the money. 
26205 3 Camera works well.. in and out of the water. Was very pleased with this item 
26206 4 works very well with our GoPro Hero2 
26207 4 Fantastic, works great 
26208 3 it s alright 
26209 3 Very good 
26210 3 I ve been looking for this waterprrof action cam. This is very great! 
26211 4 Excellent product delivered on time. 
26212 0 It doesn t fit what it says it fits very clearly, did not fit my lenses and according to the info, it should have fit them. 
26213 4 Does the job 
26214 2 Ok little setup grief. Quality decent. Worth the $$$$ 
26215 0 The attachment strap unraveled after two uses. Don t count on it as a sole means of attaching anything to your wrist. 
26216 3 Smaller than I anticipated but I like that it can fold up easily for my camera bag. I was a little surprised it said that it expires in two years seeing as it costs a lot for a small item. I look forward to using it. 
26217 4 Quaity product as expected. 
26218 3 It does the job well. 
26219 4 My wife needed the hoods and lens cover, this kit provided all and more! Timely shipping, too. Thanks! 
26220 4 Love the props! 
26221 3 Cut and dry it s a great case, and is well made..does the job nicely... 
26222 4 Good so far for the price! 
26223 4 Great product, great value 
26224 2 Just ok but nothing great. Fisheye can be better. 
26225 4 These batteries seem to last slightly longer than the stock battery that came with my gopro hero 4. 
26226 4 I do a lot of kayak fishing and this works perfectly to keep my gopro safe and in view if I ever lose it. Definitely helps ease the mind in case I m clumsy or if it takes a dive. 
26227 3 This won t completely get rid of wind noise, but it will cut down on it considerably. 
26228 4 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
26229 0 DOA 
26230 3 Functional but wish there is a LCD screen to see what is being recorded. 
26231 4 It fits the camera and is basically like putting sunglasses on your lens. 
26232 3 Paired easily with SmartThings and works great. My only problem is you can t control the timeout reset. It s default is 4 minutes to reset as other reviewers have stated. You can change the jumpers to test mode and this allows it to reset as soon as motion stops. 
26233 3 It is not Hero but ;-))) 
26234 4 Great 
26235 4 Amazing manual focus wide angle. Super sharp and great color rendition. I use it on my D810 for long exposures. Would definitely recommend it if you don t need the autofocus. 
26236 0 User manual was the size of a stamp. Too much complicated for the user. 
26237 1 The bar looks great and sturdy with rollers inside to glide and slide. Unfortunately, it came today with a broken screw necessary for adjusting the tension for sliding. Pretty much an important piece... 
26238 4 Great price, very fast shipping. 
26239 4 What s not to like? A solid performer at a great price, you can t go wrong. 
26240 0 Received a Chinese PAL version of this camera, yeah, like THAT should even be sold to a US customer... Contacted Dahua support for assistance, they told me to go to the supplier for firmware.. First and last Dahua product I ll buy... 
26241 4 Works just as described, great option to buying OEM 
26242 2 This pair of binoculars performed adequately but the family much preferred the Pentax Marine Boat 8 x 25. The strap never functioned properly. 
26243 1 no as good as they said the wood be 
26244 4 This is my second DLink. And EVEN BETTER than the last one. I love the tilt and pan features. I highly recommend. But remember- if you are on a VPN from your company- turn it off to set this up. Speeds up the process! 
26245 4 they work 
26246 3 Works as described. The pinhole gives a very narrow view for playback. While recording one of the lights continues to flash, no car remote does that and its something that will bring attention to your undercover work. Putting your finger over it works 
26247 4 excellent quality and size, perfect for mirrorless camera! Looks so cute too. 
26248 4 My son asked for this along with a gorilla pod for Christmas for his Fuji camera and he loved it. 
26249 3 legs are no as stable.. ok for the cost range 
26250 4 Nice camera! 
26251 4 Awesome Flash at such a budget price. Features and controls are easy to access and ETTL worked just fine. 
26252 1 Film took too long to expose and pictures were not as clear as compared to old pack of real Polaroid Film. Would not buy again 
26253 4 If you need the size, you can t beat this case. Expensive, but well worth it when needing to protect something. 
26254 4 Great batteries, hopefully I wont need them anytime soon. These will be backups for one of my rifle optics. 
26255 4 Excellent quality and price point compared to other similar multi-mounts bars. The two end threads are 3/8&#34; only and not interchangeable, so just be aware. The two TOP threads are 1/4&#34; and 3/8&#34; interchangeable. 
26256 4 Fulfills all of my FPV needs. Highly recommend a Shade also... 
26257 4 Purchased for my wife as an extra safety when she has to walk to her car in the dark after she gets off work. A quick test showed it is good and loud - and will be one more thing to make here feel safer. 
26258 2 it doesn t show battery amount in a flip 
26259 3 Pack is amazing, Camera it self a good gadget 
26260 3 It s very roomy and versatile. 
26261 4 Ridiculously easy to set up. Everything works. I love it. 
26262 4 Good in all sense. 
26263 4 Very satisfied with the quality of the camera and zoom 
26264 4 Works well as expected! 
26265 3 Only sharp with ideal lighting. Other wise not so sharp. Save your money and buy a carl zeiss or l lens or 50mm f1.4 by canon. 
26266 2 Disappointed with the video quality but for the money what would you expect? It has now become my dash cam. 
26267 4 There is a lot of confusion regarding which props should be used on a P3. This listing, the information and shipping speed made all the problems go away. Just what I needed with a minimum of hassles. 
26268 4 Lot of softbox for the money...why complain about anything with value like this...I use a manfrotto umbrella adaptor to attach it with led panel...led sits up high but it works...the diffusion is fairly strong, but it s soft--clean light 
26269 4 This camera is perfect for capturing memories in picture and video form. We love it! 
26270 4 Very satisfied! Product as described! Charged my Nikon P330 camera battery completely. No complaints. 
26271 4 Great buy and it works very well. Recommend this product. 
26272 4 Worked great with my Foscam indoor to angle it out a window. 
26273 4 I mean... I THINK I ll love it as much as my mindshift 180 back-pack.... I m just waiting for some rain to test it out!? 
26274 4 This is my second pair.. bought them for my wife..excellent binoculars! 
26275 4 Perfect with the Celestron Skymaster 25X70 
26276 4 Great product Will be purchasing this again 
26277 4 works ok, it s a battery 
26278 4 Great bag. Have had it for years and it hardly shows any wear. Very versatile. 
26279 4 Outstanding image quality, excellent low light capabilities producing minimum noise, compact but powerful. Incorporates many features normally found in mid to high level DSLRs, three video formats producing high quality 1080 HD video. However, due in large part to the camera s extensive functionality, it is somewhat complex and complicated. 
26280 4 Great product and less cost than Nikon. 
26281 4 This works well. 
26282 2 Great 
26283 2 worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks. 
26284 2 Not sturdy. Just OK for a very light camera! 
26285 2 Worked great for about a month until it randomly broke. Very upset about this product. It would have been a great product had it actually been reliable and not easily breakable. 
26286 4 Perfect 
26287 4 Great Kit, lots of extra items that I don t have to purchase separately. 
26288 4 I love the camera Lafavre camera in the world 
26289 2 SD Memory card slot not working had to send it back. Got a new one that worked 
26290 4 Eccellent 
26291 3 Great Product 
26292 4 Excellent use on motorcycle. Good quality already dropped them and it didn t even phase them and the recording ability...tough and durable 
26293 0 Extremely poor quality, Lens covered with scratches, would not recommend. 
26294 3 Works good 
26295 4 Works 
26296 4 This is a neat little gadget - surprisingly effective and dirt simple to use. A lot of bang for the buck. Should be fun for you kids or grandkids, but also useful for an adult as well. Provides detail well beyond that visible with a magnifying glass. 
26297 2 I find that is diffuses the flash more than it softens it. for the price it is great, but does not produce soft box quality 
26298 4 VERY Nice Product and Shipped even Faster that Promised! Thank you! Its a Plus that this cable has fittings attached..Great Quality Product! 
26299 4 Creates a great curve for close objects but back up a few steps and you just get the world around your subject.. 
26300 3 nice priced small camera 
26301 3 Clear pictures and great value. Night vision mode reflects the IR light off the window pane and washes out the picture. I m sure there is a solution to remedy this issue, but haven t had the time to look. 
26302 4 Super fun! Take it every where! 
26303 3 great light 
26304 4 I get compliments on this case all the time. I m glad I purchased it. It looks so classy. 
26305 4 Fantastic case. Fits the camera perfectly and very nicely made. I highly recommend it!! 
26306 4 Less expensive allowed me to buy two for the price of one gopro battery. 
26307 4 Not sure if it s a knock off, came in a package labeled gopro, took about 5 min to change and it s like the damage never happened 
26308 4 as described, no issues 
26309 4 The camera not only has the good quality,but also offer the best services,besides the price of the product is reasonable. 
26310 4 This little camera is so much fun and my daughter has absolutely loved using it. It takes decent pictures, is quick, and easy to operate. Lots of fun to have with this! 
26311 4 Great product. Easy to insert and takes great photo s! 
26312 4 Perfect for use 
26313 0 This does not work with my T3i, they said that T3i and 600D are the same... this is not correct. this does not turn on my camera with the batteries or even the Li-po batteries 
26314 4 Very pleased. Great price, quick shipping. 
26315 4 Is exactly what I need. It fits perfectly on my fuji x-t1. Highly recommend it to fuji x-t1 owner. Great product! 
26316 4 Works great, now my youngest son thinks it s his camera and gets greatly offended when we try to take it back. Bobber does exactly as intended, let the big kids go down slides holding it and taking fun videos and don t have to worry about the camera disappearing. 
26317 0 It didn t work so i returned it. refund was back on card before it even made it back to rma site. Thank you 
26318 4 Golf product 
26319 4 Very good,I likes it..... 
26320 1 A total Waste of $money$ for anyone who cares to not get ripped off. They are playing with your imagination by marketing this product as worth the savings. Flat out lies. Cant say you weren t warned here first. Good Luck 
26321 4 All of the accessories are great. I tried all of them on the day the camera was received. Great! 
26322 4 Great mirrorless digital canera 
26323 4 works good 
26324 4 we use these in our beach condo. perfect for dolphin watching 
26325 4 This tripod is exactly what I wanted. The legs can be moved but securely hold their position. Besides that, it is very stylish looking:) 
26326 4 Works great 
26327 4 nice, even have a you-tube video to tell you how to use it 
26328 0 Does not fit pictinnay rail as it should but nothing a few zip ties couldn t fix. 
26329 1 THESE ARE REAL CHEEP , BATTERY SWITCH DOES NOT WORK , THEY DO LOOK REAL 
26330 3 I carry it with me as a spare in case the one I usually use meets with misfortune. It has a lot of useful features. 
26331 3 Quality is good and quick delivery. 
26332 4 It s a nice little protector of the elements. 
26333 4 Just as described. Received very timely. 
26334 4 Great strap. Very happy with this purchase. Now I can wear my camera across my body, so my neck does not get sore. 
26335 4 I received this device free-of-charge for the purpose of testing and publishing this review (Netgear s Friends and Family program). It s a beautiful product and very easy to setup and config. I like it! 
26336 1 Bought the camera and it seems like its well made. Called customer service; they are a joke. 44 minutes on hold. overseas &quot;specialist&quot; had the nerve to tell me that it was past their closing time and told me to call back tomorrow. Unbelievable. Their customer service is a joke....... 
26337 4 Excellent both in value and quick delivery. The six pack is perfect for purse and traveling. I use for my readers, IPad, IPhone and flat screen TV s. Washable as well with just water. 
26338 3 Quality is Meh, but it works well. This particular one is extremely difficult to attach to the pelican lid, as your screwdriver must reach the screw THROUGH the mesh pockets. If that sounds dumb, it is. I wouldn t have a pelican without this, but the design is lacking. 
26339 4 Ready to use straight from the box 
26340 0 Photos and description of the product led me to believe this timer had connectors for multiple camera types. It does not. The pictures show an interchangeable connector. The model I received does not. It will only work with one of my cameras. Very disappointed! 
26341 3 The tripod holds my Nikon camera pretty well. It s not as sturdy as I imagined it would be but if you re on a budget it ll do the job! 
26342 4 Seems to be of very high quality and screwed into my 18-135mm Canon lens without fuss. Clarity is perfect, and, protects the front lens as well as reducing UV light. 
26343 0 I couldn t get them to work. 
26344 4 Great price!!! 
26345 4 Excellent product 
26346 0 Cheap in price and in quality. The cameras did not last even a year. It is better to pay a bit more and get a quality product. SHould have known when the warranty is only for 3 months. 
26347 4 is so nice... good quality 
26348 4 Really nice camera for the price. I did not need the WiFi feature of the GoPro so this was a great alternative. 
26349 4 Good fit and made especially for my lens 
26350 4 Very good! 
26351 4 Good Deal! 
26352 0 These brackets are poorly made! The swivel mechanism does not hold the camera securely in place. Therefore the camera will just hang loosely! Save your money and buy better quality brackets from Netgear! 
26353 4 Use it to mount 80X spotting scope at the shooting range. Very stable with sturdy legs. Would recommend for spotting scopes and cameras. Well built tripod. 
26354 4 All I can say that this is the best filter case I have ever came across....It s padded well, and made well....I highly recommend this case to everyone... 
26355 4 Great! I use this often, it comes in handy when I need to bring only some of my equipment. 
26356 4 Henry assisted me in installing my app for foscam,the cameras are easy to set up and customer service was great. 
26357 4 Excellent higher quality selfie-stick - it s worth paying a few extra dollars. It clamps your cell phone firmly in place and is fully adjustable for length, camera angle, etc. I have only used it with my phone but it also has an attachment to secure a digital camera. 
26358 4 Great for Mid Size Camera and Enough storage Great Protection Just What I needed 
26359 4 Bien 
26360 2 I m still a novice, so I don t really know what this is used for. The product is ok, but, I ordered the wrong size. 
26361 4 I have used this so far in my pool. and it works fine Has a nive grip on on it , that doesn t hold water .. Feels like this will hold up for a long time 
26362 4 I love them! 
26363 4 So far they are working good. Holds a charge well 
26364 0 Glass was warped so it wouldn t seal about 3/4&#34; edge on one side. 
26365 4 This little camera fits in a shirt pocket so it is easy to take on a hike in the woods or anywhere else. 
26366 4 This case works great. It has pockets and compartments useful for all my gear. it even came with a cleaning cloth. 
26367 4 Customer service is great, and the product really sucks (to the thing you want it to.) Comes with a tether too for piece of mind for all those times you mount it to a moving vehicle (the entire reason I bought it) 
26368 0 The only Camara I have ever bought, over 20, that didn t come with a lense cap?!? Camera does NOT shoot RAW even though the listing says it does. 
26369 2 The tripod is flimsy, and the bag has an ugly logo affixed to it. But for the price I got what I paid for; the little SD card transfer thingie is definitely nice to have. 
26370 4 Fujifilm manufactured battery that is identical in appearance to the one supplied with the camera. Expensive (as are all OEM batteries) but expect it to last the course unlike a lot of the third party cheaper substitutes. 
26371 4 Very good 
26372 4 Came quickly and appear to be good quality. Will see as I use them 
26373 2 Good optics but heavy to hold long and hard to hold steady enough to prevent visual blurring. Should stick with the seven power. 
26374 4 These are just handy to have 
26375 4 Easy to use. Can attach to stands or hand hold. 
26376 2 resolution has alittle to be desired but functioned as descibed 
26377 4 A great bag to protect our Canon, with extra pockets for misc. 
26378 4 Perfect product! Nice price! Fast delivery! 
26379 3 Sturdy and works as advertised. Definitely not something to get though if you re looking for portability. 
26380 4 prefect size for a work desk! 
26381 2 The idea for this product is great, but the rotating peg comes off its base pretty easily. 
26382 4 I love the case. It came on time and it is perfect for my Fuji mini 8 camera! 
26383 4 working well as expected for 960h 
26384 1 Bought this item TWICE. First time one of the light fixtures would not work. Second time, was shorted the 2nd LED light bulb. Purchased to take pictures of product to sell online. Workspace is a little small, but takes up a LOT of room to set up. 
26385 4 Great product, great price and delivered on time. What is not to like. Highly recommended. This got here before the camera so I had the batteries all charged up ready for my camera which arrived the next day. 
26386 4 as described 
26387 4 Quality is good. It is tough to steam the wrinkles out of the fabric, but when used with good lighting and wrinkle free chromakey works perfectly. 
26388 4 Great product for the pric Ipurchased this camera for my 10 yr old daughter and she absolutely loves it. It takes good quality pictures and is easy to use. 
26389 4 Love this lens! 
26390 4 Outstanding!! 
26391 4 I love that little camera. It is amazing, and would ve been so at twice the price! 
26392 1 The boom is great, the clamp is great, the height of the stand sucks if I plan to use it to hold my hair light. It just doesn t go high enough. Until I find a taller stand, I m relegating this setup to who knows what. 
26393 4 Excelente. 
26394 0 Doesn t record when plugged in. It only recorded in 20-minute segments and the battery doesn t past long even after it has been fully charged. Don t waste your time and money on this. 
26395 4 Great!! 
26396 3 awesome slider, would ve gotten the full 5 stars if it was able to mount up to a tripod. but for this price you cant beat it! awesome for the type of shooting that i m doing which is car meets! 
26397 1 Not bad but not that good.... =) 
26398 0 very difficult to be used. I bought it for my father and he dosn t use it at all, because is very tricky. I will I can return. Not a good product. 
26399 4 I love this camera, I had it for a few months now and I keep discovering new things. The pictures this takes are beautiful! This is my first DSLR and I couldn t be more pleased. 
26400 4 It s a Canon. 
26401 4 Very good baby cam/security cam! Setup is a breeze, and picture quality is awesome 
26402 4 Super tough strength holding my cabinet in place. Easy to install but remember the two white wires coming from the front of the unit are not needed unless you are using an alarm system and want to be notified when the door is open. 
26403 4 works great 
26404 4 This is for Canon new FD mount. Old Canon mount with breech lock can mount, but it cannot lock properly. As a result, the aperture control does not work for breech lock lenses. 
26405 4 Does the job. Package arrived quickly. 
26406 2 works as expected. The chromium finish fades/scratches after some use though. 
26407 3 Bought this to use as decor for a friend s apartment (she s a film student) For anyone using it for actual productions, you ll probably have to superglue the magnets on the inside of the clapper, mine came falling out. 
26408 0 This product does not work with nikon d3300. After I plugged it into the camera, the camera will not power up. I checked the nikon battery EN-EL14a states 7.2 V, 1230mAh. This charger states 9V, 5A. You have been warned. 
26409 4 Excellent product. A must for anyone who owns a BMPCC! 
26410 4 Works great!!!! 
26411 2 Great feeling grip, batteries do their thing...but after a few days of shooting, the shutter button on the grip stopped working. It will work half-shutter, but not full. Will have to return for a fix... UPDATE: I just slapped it, and it started working again 
26412 4 great system 
26413 4 Fits perfect no problems at all. 
26414 4 Great product and arrived on time 
26415 4 Loved it and would recommend it. 
26416 0 Cheap and not at all like the photo. Looks like a sheet that someone tried to clean a paintbrush on with blue paint on it. Sucks, 
26417 4 This item arrived exactly as it was suppose to ! The lenses are great! Takes creativity to a new level ! 
26418 4 Thanks for the items, very fast delivery. 
26419 4 So hard to find 35MM film now, however, I still appreciate the quality of film. Digital is great, but I believe there is still a place for film - particularly with fine art. 
26420 0 I did not like we can use to many problem with installation 
26421 4 I think it is excellent for the price. Not super duty but will get the job done. For balance it is best to align the lights with one of the legs. I plan to lengthen the legs 5 or 6 inches with 1/2 inch aluminum rod for better stability. 
26422 1 The two batteries simply doesn t work! My Lumix 5 doesn t recognise it. Charger is fine. 
26423 4 Very Good. 
26424 0 never worked! 
26425 4 Makes everyone look beautiful 
26426 4 what do you say about batteries and a charger other than they work? 
26427 2 it s ok 
26428 4 Film was great! 
26429 0 USELESS! 
26430 2 So far its decent. No leaks. The remote function (connect to phone app) doesnt work. Color is lacking. But not bad for the price. 
26431 3 Nice case and set up for camera. Its a bit pricey is why I only have it 4 stars 
26432 4 Been in use for years with 0 issues whatsoever. Even beating the hell out of it on ATVs, swimming at the beach with it, etc. 
26433 3 Tons of parts all work great! Broke a bolt trying to fit it through some pieces are tight and case is floppy. Not as sturdy as i expected 
26434 3 Not excelent quality but very useful. 
26435 4 😀 
26436 0 Crooked, won t seat straight. I have another soft release that will. So, yeah. Not great. 
26437 4 Excellent 
26438 0 too small and broke immediately 
26439 4 The resolution is good; sometimes I connected it with my pc. It can be mounted on a wall, or dash or wherever too, and it has a screw to tighten it at that angle for good viewing. 
26440 4 Very useful. Thx. 
26441 4 Works great thank goodness it s all metal unlike some other items I ve ordered 
26442 4 Perfect 
26443 4 Nice Product 
26444 0 No memory card , no reader, used battery, mismatched case, No instructions, no tripod, Camera seems used also 
26445 4 Works as advertised, I love it 
26446 3 Perfect size and quality product!! 
26447 1 Tried this as a replacement for my broken latch, this one broke within a week. 
26448 0 Can t get it smooth. It s like cardboard 
26449 4 The charger supplied with my new Fuji X-T1 uses a full size power cord, taking up way too much space in my camera bag. This one is much smaller and can be plugged into A USB Charger. Works great at a very good price. Recommended. 
26450 4 Quality and Good Price! 
26451 3 Works great! I use this for my Canon 5D Mark II all the time for film production. Doesn t last as long as a Canon battery of course, but does the job perfectly! 
26452 3 Fun Item, but GPS is not working properly 
26453 4 I loved that I bought this combo in less than a week I already finished the pack but I had some amazing pics instantly 
26454 4 works great with my 67mm lens. 
26455 4 Price was very good. 
26456 3 book needs a lot of work. We are not all professionals. 
26457 1 Excellent picture on the two I purchased, but one of them stopped working after two days 
26458 4 A gift and she truly loves it. 
26459 4 Jest what I wanted 
26460 4 They are so awesome! I will order as soon as they are gone, Great value and great items! 
26461 4 Hands free, comfortable, well made. I fits me well- 5-11, 195 lbs. I just hiked half dome and wish I had this, I couldn t film the cable climb because I needed both hands and didn t trust my head mount. I highly recommend. 
26462 0 It seems hard plastic , but glue use to keep the pole falls apart out of the box, i needed to use epoxy to put it back together again in the first try 
26463 4 Good price 
26464 2 Fits well but scratches easily! Better products out there! 
26465 0 Battery does not last.never used but no power after 1 month.original gossen pro meter battery lasted many years. 
26466 2 the up/down swivel does not work on the product i received. The product also does not come with instructions. So you have to guess which knobs to tighten and which latches do what. 
26467 4 Lets me use 77mm filters on my A6000 s kit lens. Thanks for making this in this odd size! 
26468 4 For the price you pay for this it s an awesome product. Here s a link to my personal test. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xbO0BYp2qk&sns=em 
26469 4 Easy to use, Not big for travel, good quality picture 
26470 4 thank you 
26471 2 Its ok for the price 
26472 4 This works great. Glad I got it for my NexStar 4 
26473 4 I Love it.. cant wait to start taking pictures!! Thanks 
26474 4 Excellent, as described in the publication I received, the delivery was fast without mishap, satisfied 100% 
26475 4 Just as described and quick shipping. 
26476 4 Works like a charm. Lost the charger this fits and works 
26477 4 Quality is great! 
26478 4 Good Value for the price. i like the texture of the bag. 
26479 4 It was fast I received my pen before Sept 10th I love this thank you 
26480 4 like the cameras alot, did need the tech support it was very helpful.thank you terry morgan 
26481 4 Works well! 
26482 0 No good doesn t work 
26483 0 did not detect motion outside, even if it did the sound was to low 
26484 2 I don t like typing 
26485 4 This item was replacement for a damaged screen. 
26486 4 Attached to my selfie stick for my gopro. Floats work great, easy to attach, and when tested, didn t even get close to letting the stick sink. 
26487 4 i love it! perfect size and everything! and the film doesnt cost too much either. i chose the free standard shipping and it took like a week and a few days to come but other than that it is great! 
26488 4 very nice i like it ! 
26489 3 powers the equipment I bought it for 
26490 0 Had to return product - did not work. 
26491 4 Worked out. 
26492 1 It is kinda expensive for only 10 but it came really fast 
26493 4 Great camera takes great pictures. I have to say I was influenced by all those Ashton Kutcher commercials. A really great value ! 
26494 0 Didn t hold a charge 
26495 0 No where in the description does it say refurbished. Guess what I received? A refurb. No paperwork. No instructions. Nothing. Its going right back out today. 
26496 4 Works great. 
26497 4 Reliable mount at an affordable price! 
26498 3 Durable. The middle insert that raises will sway if not held, so u need a shutter release to use it that high. Other than that, I m happy with the tripod. 
26499 4 perfect. 
26500 4 Very happy with this item. Would recommend to friends. And to the people who gave it a negative review, if you re looking for thousand dollar results,,,,buy a thousand dollar system! I am extremely happy with all functions of this system! Arrived before scheduled delivery date, works great! 
26501 4 I connected this camera to my phone and Wifi very easily. Very clear picture. 
26502 4 yup 
26503 0 works ok, but you can not use it with a tripod unless you anchor the bottom with a rubberband. That is what I did and it works pretty good. 
26504 4 I bought this for my husband who had all his go-pro stuff strung out all over the house to try to get it in one place. I was very impressed with the quality and it really does hold a lot of go-pro accessories. 
26505 4 It purchased for a friend and he is really enjoying the quality of the pictures this lens takes. 
26506 4 Nice glass! I m happy with my purchase. 
26507 3 This little camera is lightweight, takes great pictures and is very reliable. 
26508 4 Hi- Haven t used mine yet, but bought on the strong recommendation of my Marine Science major / scuba diver son and West Marine in Santa Barbara Harbor, who sells them but did not have the color I wanted. 
26509 0 What a scam plz read the fine print before buying 
26510 4 Excellent lens. Works well with my Nikon d3200. 
26511 4 perfect 
26512 4 The cost is great. 
26513 4 The seller sent out the camera really fast. My two kids took no time to put it together and learned how to take the videos and photos. The camera looks nice, compact, and well made. Look forward to using it in our upcoming trip. Thanks. 
26514 4 exactly what i purchased 
26515 4 Perfect 
26516 4 I love this lense. I am not a pro but I think this is a great lense. 
26517 4 What i expected 
26518 4 The product arrived quickly and within the time frame that was given. Everything was in clean working order and worked great for the shoot I needed them for. Thank you! 
26519 3 Fantastic,easy to install 
26520 4 Item is as described. Works great. 
26521 3 This is a great entry level camera. I received it sooner than I was told (a big plus) and with everything listed. As a newbie to DSLR cameras, I m really glad it came with the book. I d recommend getting an extra battery. 
26522 4 Thin and light but appear very strong - easy setup with just about any standard camera strap from thin to wide. 
26523 3 Very nice camera for my daughter 
26524 4 Perfect! Highly Recommended ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks! A+ 
26525 4 Does the job. 
26526 4 Great security item for my yard 
26527 4 Just got back from a vacation that included Yosemitie National Park and Sanfrancisco. Great Photos, and still learning how to take advantage of this great lens. Make sure your tripod can handle this glass lens. 
26528 2 It s ok. I m looking into getting another battery with a larger mAh capacity. The trick is to make sure all batteries are fully powered before leaving for an event. 
26529 4 Loved this backpack and the color. I took it on my month long trip to Europe and now Puerto Rico. Great quality! 
26530 4 Great purchase! Perfect for anyone that does outdoor activities! Good to have the lcd screen to playback footage! 
26531 4 Excellent quality for this size camera! I use it in my classroom...the students enjoy capturing important moments. Bought one for my grandson with the camera case, and he loves using it as well. Great camera for the price. 
26532 4 Absolutely love this background. 
26533 4 Awesome product and gives much needed rigidity to the cameras frame. Would highly recommend this to anyone shooting with the sony A7 line. 
26534 4 Perfect fit 
26535 4 great locking holder 
26536 4 excellent product, arrived on time, works great. i would purchase from this merchant again.very happy with this product, would recommend it to friends. 
26537 4 Just as good as the factory original. 
26538 4 Great price on a multicoated filter to protect my lens. 
26539 2 I bought 2 batteries. 1 battery holds average charge for 1600 mAh for about 1.5 hours, another just half of that. 
26540 2 I use it as binoculars for which it is ok, not enough power for star gazing 
26541 4 I installed this system very quickly. The setup instructions could be a little clearer to understand but what s there is adequate. the system performs as advertised. I would have liked the master unit support wireless between it and modem. Other than that the system performs very nicely. 
26542 4 The products are awsome. The cases are very nice and protect a lot the filter and close-up lenses. 
26543 1 Couldn t get it to work with my system. Don t know if it was a problem with the product or just compatibility issues. 
26544 4 Was very impressed with this case. It will definitely protect the camera. The slinged holder also will absorb any bumps if it should happen. The light weight also is a great plus. Would definitely recommend to a friend. 
26545 4 Flawless. 
26546 3 good fit for camera. 
26547 4 Awesome POV! Camera is easy to access and out of the way! 
26548 4 Henry, he is Professional tech, he help me to set up the camera. 
26549 4 Product was exactly as described. Product delivered on time. 
26550 4 So much good and fun footage... check it out on youtube as 5280sky Enjoy!! 
26551 4 Love this camdera and love the price. Still learning all the features. Happy so far. 
26552 4 I got my case quickly and it was exactly what I wanted. 
26553 4 great quality. works well with screen cleaners/sprays. 
26554 0 Looks pretty, but it comes folded in a small envelope. It is basically the material of a thick shower curtain and I was not able to get rid of the fold creases. 
26555 4 Extra duration and less dollars is an excellent combination. This battery is more fragile than sony so I recommend you be careful when carrying it and keeping stored. Also works fine with neewer and yongnuo led lights 
26556 0 Applicator would not release from the film making it impossible to apply without creating air bubbles. Product arrived much sooner than predicted and was properly packaged. 
26557 4 One easy to use camera, great size, the zoom is more than great. Try it you won t be disappointed 
26558 4 Battery arrived promptly and works as expected. 
26559 2 Bad apps. Two way sound is poor quality. 
26560 4 Better than the ones with rubber band 
26561 4 Great product 
26562 4 Love Wasabi Power. They just know how to get it done. Works perfectly for my GoPro Hero 4 Black just like the OEM from GoPro but half the price. Get this, it s a no brainer. 
26563 4 Arrived on time, great film 
26564 4 Excellent quality as expected. Used to view archery competition and needed to be able to see fine detail. Bright and clear with little to no eye fatigue with long periods of continuous viewing. Used bi-pod support which I highly recommend with this power level. 
26565 4 Great! 
26566 3 This product is very good for those who are amateurs in Gopro film 
26567 4 great bundle! great compact camera! can t put it down. 
26568 4 Great grip for vertical photos without adding a lot of weight. 
26569 4 it works 
26570 4 I like it 
26571 0 instructions are microscopic and in very poor english. its being used as a real clothes hook because i dont want to throw it out 
26572 1 the charger worked great but the batteries do not work at all 
26573 3 So far so good! The burned smell really kills it though... 
26574 4 the best 
26575 4 Best deal online, was well packaged. Fast delivery, so far all of the pictures came out great, have not had any blanks or problems with the film. 
26576 4 Great product and prompt shipment! Thanks!! 
26577 4 Quality camera at a nice price. I bought the wide-angle for my quadcopter. Will get another Mobius soon with the original lens for everyday use. Very easy to use and quality video! 
26578 2 As others have noted, slides keep getting stuck inside and have to be removed with tweezers. Since that is the only moving part, I had hoped that they would have solved the problem. They have not. 
26579 0 Piece of junk. Shifts on it own. Lenses loose. Rattles. 
26580 2 Picture is OK. I would spend the little more and get the 1000tvl. That s what I did and I m very happy with the higher quality picture. 
26581 4 works just as stated 
26582 0 still trying to install instructions are useless. not very happy. may return 
26583 4 The kit has really everything I need to capture a video in any situation, very useful and complete. Excellent product. 
26584 4 Used this for a macro lens conversion and it worked perfectly. 
26585 4 Love it! awesome camera with awesome quality of video and also can make awesome stills! 
26586 1 It came with an old leaking battery, I had to buy a battery in order to start using it. 
26587 3 Very good to see camera screen clearly on daylight. 
26588 4 Very satisfied with the delivery and quality of the product. 
26589 4 Works great with the kit lens for my Nikon D7000. Highly recommended! 
26590 4 Works great. A real time saver. But as others have mentioned, it s loose so a little masking tape to shim it out is necessary 
26591 4 Great product for a great price. Thanks again. 
26592 3 Works well, not really great for dark objects though. 
26593 4 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AX12XTC/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_11 
26594 2 The case itself is very nice. But the interior foam does not last long. it falls apart, fragments. If you re going to be using it frequently, consider getting hard foam for this case. 
26595 4 Awesome awesome awesome charger for my digital camera, absolutely love it and the replacement batteries work just as good as the originals!!! 
26596 4 c6722085 tech ar004273 Henry Thank you, my tech was great in helping me set up my new camera! 
26597 4 All good. 
26598 2 It works but not very easy to use. 
26599 4 Fits perfectly. 
26600 0 bad bad bad product , do not buy , is of very poor quality , lost my money , see the photo. 
26601 3 good 
26602 0 Don t buy this battery, it s a waste of money, loses battery life very quickly, It is a fake battery, so don t bother buying from this user. 
26603 4 ok 
26604 4 Took a minute to get used to......love the old school! 
26605 4 Prompt delivery. Work great. 
26606 4 These work very well. You can get a tone when door or window is opened, set them to alarm when away and even get the temperature graphed out for a day, week, month or year. Cool. These are only $15.00 at Lowes though. 
26607 3 Lens itself works like a charm and pictures are sharp and nice, but mount does not lock to my 400D. 
26608 4 Very good 
26609 4 works good 
26610 4 It was a good buy for my GoPro Hero4 
26611 4 These Wasabi batteries hold power just like the original Olympus battery and the charger has an integrated plug unlike the one Olympus provides (i.e. no need to carry a power cord). After 6 months of use I have nothing to complain about. 
26612 4 great camera with a really good zoom 
26613 3 Great product water tight, but WIFI button can t turn off or turn on while camera is in case 
26614 4 Bought this as a starter camera for a teenage film student. He s able to use all the functions easily. Takes great footage indoors and out. Also got him the Ultimate Accessory Kit to go with it and he s loving it all. 
26615 0 main connector to the camera broke in 10 seconds. do not buy this poorly built device 
26616 4 Sometimes a generic battery works, but I prefer to buy the Nikon battery for more assurance of durability and lasting power. I always carry an extra for extended photo shoots. 
26617 1 They are not as clear as my other D-Link set and the sound is terrible. 
26618 4 great product- smart design! 
26619 4 Excellent glasses for birding. Light weight, easy to hold on image without shake.... Can t imagine spending any more for good field glasses. 
26620 4 Great case and great service! 
26621 4 Got here in a day and and a half, great shipping, and... it s a battery..? Lol. Going on a trip in September so I ll test it s limitations then. 
26622 4 These batteries are, so far, performing every bit as good as the &#34;brand&#34; batteries that I have bought in the past at 4 times the cost. They are definitely a good deal. 
26623 4 We live in a zone where there are gangs that love to graffiti in our alley and on our house and inside the carport. Since I have installed these and sings, there has not been any graffiti. Very happy. 
26624 4 Wonderful product!!! they give you a lot of product for a cheap price. It worked instantly for all of my lens s. I recommend these! 
26625 4 Nice and good for gopro. Is very easy to fit all the accessories and the camera 
26626 4 It works as it should! 
26627 0 The camera image is blurry and is very slow in capturing motion, a sometimes I am not able to look at image because camera image was all black 
26628 3 Works as advertised. Great for vacations where the camera battery might run out & need two to get thru day 
26629 3 Slides on with a friction fit. Fits nicely. Very light weight. Glossy finish so will reflect light into lens, so I will use some steel wool to roughen up the surface. 
26630 4 My son has a lot of Camera s .I didn t think I could fine a bag big enough buy WOW this is the Bag.He thought it was great and so did all his friends 
26631 4 somehow, my husband managed to misplace his battery charger for the camera I bought him. I got the idea to order a replacement from my best friend, and I m so glad I followed through. Now camera works after a year of a missing charger! 
26632 4 Very nice and powerfull lens 
26633 4 Works great! 
26634 3 Good. Sturdy. Great Quality C Stand 
26635 4 Definitely helpful as you start to stack up the photos. More pages than I would ve imagined, as it can hold quite the amount of film! Arrived in good condition, good quality, a great buy if you re to use the Instax camera. 
26636 3 more than what i expected for the price 
26637 4 It is perfect, inexpensive and does exactly what it says it will do. Arrived on time 
26638 4 Great product. Great service A++++ 
26639 1 Product was returned. Camera itself seemed to work well but app is not friendly with older foscam cameras and old / most recent foscam app does not work with this camera when you have other old cameras as well.. Foscam needs a single app to control all cameras 
26640 4 The lens caps arrive quickly and fit my camera perfectly. The strap will keep me from losing the lens cap. The bundle is great because I have two lenses and two caps for backup. 
26641 3 The clip fits my phone, but the only that that stinks is taking the cover off the phone so it can fit in the clip. Other then that it is a good buy. 
26642 0 Too expensive! Same quality as generic but you pay 4x more for this one. Lose yours? Buy a 4 pack genetic for a dollar less than this single cap. 
26643 4 I purchased this for our upcoming trip. This is a great device for night time pictures when you want to minimize camera movement. Works well with my Nikon D3100. 
26644 0 I ordered 2 sets and only one unit out of the 4 would make connection with any of my flashes. The other 3 units would not react the pins on my flashes to trigger them. I tried all my SB-900 s, SB-700 s and 1 SB-26. 
26645 4 Great product my boyfriend loves it ! 
26646 1 First of all the lens advertised was a Samyang lens but what actually ships was a Rokinon lens.They both had a F6.3 rating though.Go figure. I couldn t get the T-mount to attach and fully lock unto my Sony a-37 camera. A partial attachment just won t cut it. 
26647 4 Fast & sharp, less color and image aberration on borders. It is definitely an upgrade of its predecesor. I recommend it ! 
26648 2 nice but you realy need an optical viewfinder 
26649 3 There are several cut outs in the foam, but none of them are very clear of their intention. However, the case is great otherwise. 
26650 4 I use this to protect my laptop screen for the oils on the keys 
26651 4 Fast shipping, good product. My old Canon A50 is purring once again in all its digital glory! 
26652 4 this case came earlier than i expected! it s adorable and exactly what i wanted! thank you so much!! 
26653 4 Excellent. 
26654 4 Great product delivered as advertised. 
26655 4 I m very proud of these items. 
26656 4 The best deal ever! Outstanding start up camera and accessories for a new DSLR person! 
26657 2 Pretty good, it sticks well. But the Aperture wheel and Shutter Speed wheel are not even as close as the original ones on the camera. So leaves a three star. 
26658 0 Would not work with remote. 
26659 0 It would not hold my Samsung Zoom. So I m not using it at all....gave it away. 
26660 0 makes the picture not sharp 
26661 4 Excellent lens for the money 
26662 4 Need it to keep my Dremel Tool charged. 
26663 4 Good style and very easy to use. with my EOS 5D and 24-105 Len. 
26664 4 I love it ! It is a great and useful product. 
26665 1 Great to use but stopped working after a year with light use 
26666 0 does not fit on the Go Pro 4 
26667 4 Works as it should. STRONG clip spring. Can t go wrong if you have a need for this kind of rig. 
26668 0 They display screen was broke 
26669 0 This product does not work properly, the software is out of date, and something I didn t know is that COBY went out of business in 2013, so there isn t a website or a customer service # to help troubleshoot the issues. DO not buy this product! 
26670 4 Built well and no slippage when locked! 
26671 4 This works great. The remote doesn t have to be pointed right at the plug in to turn the light on and off. It makes turning the light on and off super easy. 
26672 2 I wanted to like this so bad, but the fact that you have to watch a light blink to figure out what is going on is a major con for me. Too confusing. 
26673 4 Inexpensive, works great! Highly recommend if you need to replace your oem charger or if you just need an extra charger! 
26674 4 Was a gift to my mom. She really likes the camera and all the accessories that came with it. 
26675 4 Good quality. Comes with a case that holds all the parts--some others don t. 
26676 0 Hi!! I received my selfie stick with a problem. Thank u for pay attention to my coment. Sincerely Julio Mejia. 
26677 4 Great product 
26678 0 This product is not endorsed by Nest. It is a third party affiliate. 
26679 0 These are not original DJI. They caused my Phantom 2 Vision to fly anyway it wanted. It wouldn t respond to the controller at all. Put the original blades on and it flew normally. These blades cause me to crash my Phantom several times. 
26680 4 Nice little set for a great price. We mainly bought it for the float, which worked nicely while snorkeling, but we also put the selfie stick on it during a dive to get video of some harder to get places. 
26681 3 The ítem did come on handheld for me. It replaced my ítem guay no longer worked. 
26682 4 Great product. Good price. Fast delivery! 
26683 4 As advertised. Adjustable so it can accommodate larger hands. Very good quality. 
26684 4 So happy with my purchase!! The camera came earlier than expected, which is always awesome!! we ve had a blast using it this far, can t wait to take it in the cruise!! 
26685 3 Excellent 
26686 4 This tripod is great. I needed something to support a small portable projector and other mini tripods would not do it. They just collapsed. This holds it up without any flimsiness and the positionable legs are great. Highly recommend this tripod. 
26687 3 Arrived timely, precision cut and fit. It is a great product for new Go Pro users. Was unable to road test it, due to cancellation of trip due to weather, but it will be road tested. If it fails the test, you will be hearing from me. 
26688 4 Excellent camera, with all the features I wanted and more. 
26689 0 BAD QUALITY. Very flimsy plastic. I expected better. No instructions and I can t tell what goes with what! 
26690 0 System instructions are very poor. You are unable to setup the wireless cameras if you do not have a windows PC so MAC users do not buy this system. Returned to Amazon for a refund 
26691 1 I could not get it to link up to my smart phone. I tried everything I could. 
26692 3 Simple camera great forntakin pic of any and everything I wouldn t use it for photo shoots but serves its purpose takes great pics of my kids when they are silly and crazy lol 
26693 4 Great product. Easy installation and durable. Have had for my property for over 2 years and no problems. 
26694 0 I sent it back. It would not maintain a network connection well enough to be usable. Tried it with apple, Windows phone and android. Definitely a bust. 
26695 0 battery has very poor performance. it only functions a very short time before the battery is dead. I would like to return these two items. 
26696 4 Got it really quick. works perfect 
26697 4 Really nice and simple to use 
26698 4 Works great 
26699 4 NOT ONLY WAS THIS AN EXCELLENT PRODUCT, IT WAS ALSO THE LEAST EXPENSIVE OF ALL RETAILERS THAT I CHECKED. 
26700 4 Fits my JCV record 
26701 2 Had to send camera back to manufacturer within a few months. It came apart. They did send me a new one. It was just a hassle to have something brand new that fell apart. 
26702 4 helps keep stands from tipping over and easy to see 
26703 2 It s good for the price but the things look a bit cheap the selfie sometimes twists with my iphone 6 plus to heavy for it. One of the lenses is two pieces in one and it came apart. But over all for the price its ok. 
26704 4 Does the job. 
26705 4 works as promised. 
26706 4 This is my third Canon digital SLR. Amazing cameras for the price! Very forgiving. Be sure to check out all the special features and program the camera to your liking. 
26707 4 Fits great 
26708 3 not bad 
26709 4 works great, now we know when someone enters our yard 
26710 4 Works great for such an oldie I love the way the picture turn out and the assisted focus is really cool, and it s hipster, how many other people have an al-1 everybody has the aw-1 
26711 2 Much slower than I thought it would be. I miss the rapid shoot feature on my previous camera. Not a good camera for taking quick succession shots. 
26712 4 Im loved no more strees. Protects the flash falla and better movility 
26713 1 outside very hot is dropcam feel hot is broke i call nest support shipper new dropcam only inside 
26714 3 Works great, just as advertised. 
26715 4 Great price for all you get. 
26716 4 Fantastic sling and fantastic value for its quality. 
26717 1 No marker to know where to attach to lens and won t sit in the case like before. Plastic is very thin and cheap. 
26718 1 Under powered. Returned unit, then struggled with vendor to get refund. It did appear to be well built. 
26719 4 luckily I could get, I saved my machine lens 
26720 4 These are awesome cameras for the price. Very clear picture day and night. WAY better than my older Sony cameras. Very Pleased! 
26721 0 Doesn t work. Charged, but it wouldn t turn on, and then not charge after. Cheap junk. 
26722 4 Vincent was great, I love my camera, great product 
26723 0 doesnt fix, 
26724 4 It s great 
26725 4 Excellent quality. secure and comfortable around the neck line. 
26726 4 Great little camera 
26727 3 Very fast delivery. Satisfied with the quality, its just that the size is 1cm wider for a Samsung NX2000 screen. 
26728 4 awesome better stable shots 
26729 4 Nice clean low light primary lens. Auto Focus works properly with motor in camera. It is another great lens from Nikkor 
26730 4 Good Batteries - provide 2h 21m for Sony Handicam HDR CX220 
26731 4 Great package! 
26732 4 GREAT replacement for the original GoPro batteries which cost a crap ton more. These even hold a longer charge it seems. 
26733 4 Great for nature, light, water resistant. Comes with case and lense covers. 
26734 2 It s okay, quality is good but it is kind of hard to use with my camera. It makes it hard to reach the shutter. 
26735 4 I feel like it s priced a bit high but it does work very well and is probably exactly what you re looking for if you ended up here. It s solid and works much better than trying to hold your hand or something over the screen. 
26736 4 Good battery 
26737 0 Came without monitor I have to spend 200 more to get all stay away! 
26738 2 Nice pattern and fabric but can be difficult to fold down. 
26739 4 Best home wi-fi camera on the market. Simple to set up. 
26740 4 Love it!!!- 
26741 4 they are awesome 
26742 4 This is the real DJI parts, not fake like some others advertised! 
26743 3 Simple enough to put together. Don t like the little ring that can be seen on camera at night. Without that it would be 5 stars. 
26744 4 Very good quality 
26745 4 I can t say enough about this little drone. Flies so well!! So simple to fly I bought them for my 8 and 10 year old kids. They love them!! Almost indestructible. If your thinking about getting one... GET IT! You wont regret it! 
26746 4 As a newbie to Go Pro, there is more than enough in this kit to keep me occupied. I went through everything and tried out several. Fit and finish is great. The only thing that I would like to see is a compartmentalized case large enough to hold everything. 
26747 4 Exactly as described. Shipped immediately. 
26748 4 Lots of tech for not that much money. Loads of fun especially if you are looking for a different perspective on photography. 
26749 4 Product was fine. five star 
26750 2 Mount was hard to slip onto the mount. 
26751 4 Arrived early! And the paper works as advertised! 
26752 4 So far this is awesome. 10 minute setup Very good broadcast for a wireless camera. Going to get some more and see how they tie together. 
26753 4 Works great and floats decent enough 
26754 4 well made. The pop-out foam is not a perfect fit but not a big issue.mu 
26755 4 Great chest strap. you forget you are wearing the chest strap. This is the much better than wearing it on your head. 
26756 4 Great variety of mounts for temporary FILMING situations. Set it and forget it. 
26757 3 Another cheap alternative to GO PRO big dollar mounts works well I use it in vehicle don t know if i would mount it on the outside of car 
26758 2 satisfied 
26759 4 Good fit, finish and function. 
26760 4 The cameras are high quality with great resolution. I added this system to my garage to supplement the system I already installed on my home. The software is easy to use and I am pleased with the initial quality and use. 
26761 4 The products are working fine. Good quality. 
26762 4 Works like a charm !!! The Little dot in the center of the receiver turns on a BRIGHT BLUE when the unit is on which makes this even nicer than we thought. 
26763 3 Very nice Camera, I have had mine for 3 years and it still shoots very well. Animal shots can be very hard to get and its very lightweight and I can carry it in my pocket wherever I go. 
26764 4 pretty straight forward, they do what they re supposed to. these are nice. would buy again 
26765 4 Great binoculars. I didn t realize how much better they could be until I spent the money on some quality optics. I wished I had bought them sooner. Really awesome in low light. 
26766 4 Very nice small digital microscope. To maintain a clear image, the microscope must be held steady...even the slightest movement will affect the image and deliver erroneous measurements. If you intent to use this for measuring, definitely get the precision stand 
26767 1 They re buoyant and colorful but way too big for a woman s wrist- It can be worn on the upper arm 
26768 4 I have been using it for about a week now. The quality of the product is great. Very versatile as it can be adjusted in size (fits in my backpack). 
26769 4 Grate 
26770 4 This camera is amazing, I have a d610 that I really like, but the d750 has made it the backup camera 
26771 4 Excellent 
26772 4 Using it for my Fuji X1S. Cost one third of original battery but performs equally well. 
26773 4 Fits well, cheap 
26774 4 300 photos and still on a single charge. 
26775 4 Good lens 
26776 4 Great film. I develop it in TMax developer. I like Fuji Acros, too. The two seem pretty similar to my eye but I usually use Fuji. Gotta help keep Kodak going, too, though. 
26777 2 Batteries dont last very long like the name brand ones but overall worth the money for a back up 
26778 2 Okay, but not worth the money though. 
26779 4 Awesome 
26780 4 Arrived on time and as described. 
26781 2 This does the job, but occasionally hard to pan back to different angles and lags. 
26782 4 Excellent grip 
26783 4 Great product. 
26784 4 just as advertized 
26785 2 The camera is nice, setup was easy. The deal breaker for me was all the videos I tried downloading to my phone were so fragmented and choppy that they were unusable. Otherwise the live viewing was fine and the settings were easy to navigate. 
26786 2 wouldn t need so many if collar had an ON/OFF Switch thankfully I bought them 
26787 4 product does what it is suppose to, links my phone to my computer via usb. the choice of delivery personal ment it went to my next door neihbor though since obviously the delivery man(woman) cant read those big huge numbers that shows my address up on my house. 
26788 4 Excellent 
26789 4 I highly recommend this case. The EOS came ina red color such as the inside of the case... but is very helpfull if you want to carry your camera with an extra battery and maybe some extra memory. 
26790 1 Not very happy with the product. The quality of the products are little cheap. The tripod is very light and usable though. 
26791 4 Works flawlessly.. AMAZING night time video (night driver).. 
26792 4 Excellent camera! 
26793 2 Inexpensive monopod is great for alternative to paying top-dollar for an authentic pro monopod. 
26794 4 Works well, came charged. Like that they have a Canadian store 
26795 4 Original GoPro died after a year. The Wasabi s, after a year and a half are still going strong. 
26796 4 Good value for price 
26797 3 Picture quality as expected. Great price compared to retail store pricing. 
26798 4 Works awesome. Batteries last similar time to the gopro ones. Nice to have extra batteries and a dual charger. Haven t used the car charger yet, but I m assuming it works fine. 
26799 4 Extremely nice unit, stable, flexible, nicely packaged, folds well into small, light size with handy carrying case. 
26800 4 The product is great my son loves it. I would also like to thank Winston for his wonderful customer service. 
26801 4 I love this camera I have it behine the window its clear also not ir at nite indoor be awsome 
26802 4 I love this camera. And the setup help that I received from D-Link was excellent! The tech, Jasmine (AR00426) was so nice, patient and helpful. I would definitely recommend this camera and D-Links support service. This is case #C6719277 
26803 4 Nice product. 
26804 4 I ve used it a couple of times and its worked perfectly. Thanks! 
26805 4 Item arrived in about 3 days and it was as advertised and worked perfectly. Would buy from dealer again. 
26806 4 Handy solution if ou always lose lens caps 
26807 3 This pack is well made and nicely cushioned. It fits a T3i Rebel just right. The velcro &#34;shelf&#34; at the bottom is adjustable so you can use the pack when you have the kit lens on the camera or a longer one. 
26808 4 Just got the batteries and charger in the mail last week. It s working great so far 
26809 3 Takes awhile to set up on the software end of things, but the functionality is great once you re able to get everything up and running. 
26810 4 was the exact as the store bought. it fit everything I needed, and I still had room 
26811 4 Excellent kit, great seller, great customer service, great warranty offered!!! A mandatory kit for anyone with a Nikon DSLR!!! 
26812 4 It worked. 
26813 4 Works as well as OEM and much cheaper. 
26814 4 Batteries work great and is way easier than charging one battery at a time 
26815 2 Works reasonably well. It is lightweight and a bit flimsy. Not particularly compact or easy to travel with but it s a pretty solid choice for a tripod. Anyways, it s cheaper than other brands so I recommend this. 
26816 4 Received as new 
26817 4 Such a precious gift for our 6-year-old! She loves is and has had tons of fun making Instax photos in a flash! 
26818 4 Arrived on time, and as expected Placed in camera immediately! 
26819 4 Excelent product. 
26820 4 Great tough little bag! 
26821 4 The product came as advertised and functions just as advertised! It s a great product for the price! 
26822 4 Great seller ,product as picture 
26823 3 Great camera bag, sturdy, padded, lots of pockets, just wish it was a little bigger. 
26824 4 Probably the best purchase I have ever made. Love everything about it. Easy to use. Easy to transfer onto a computer. Great quality. 
26825 4 I prefer a wrist strap because it is less bulky and I dislike having a camera swinging around my neck. 
26826 4 Fast shipping, batteries charge extremely quick!! 
26827 4 Great Quality Product. Does everything that I want from a Circular Polarizer. Breakthough Photography is emerging as a big player in the photography filter market. I am Pleased! 
26828 0 Too bad 
26829 3 Battery meets with all my expectations and does the job. 
26830 4 Love it I have been able to use this to take professional pictures for products I sell on Amazon and on my website. It had to ison it out to remove the lines. 
26831 2 Takes a little bit time to set it up with SmartThings. Also the refreshing interval is too long and you cannot adjust it. 
26832 4 Great batteries long long battery life 
26833 4 I recommend this to everyone. This camera has night vision and motion detection. I use in my childs room and my business. You should order this. 
26834 3 Great binoculars for the price 
26835 4 Great underwater camera with good images with existing light. However, flash photos are not as good as standard point and shoot. 
26836 0 Camera is gray camera not warranted by Nikon. Products within kit are all low quality. Vendor poorly packaged product and it arrived damaged. 
26837 4 Great 
26838 1 there was no button on the bottom to click to take a picture and it is not 21&#34;, it is much shorter. 
26839 4 you will not get a better lense for 99 US-dollars. 
26840 0 If you have less knowledge about setting up such a cam then choose another product. The whole interface and simplicity of setting up this camera is far beyond dlink standard. Don t buy it. 
26841 4 Worked perfectly with my Nikon Coolpix. 
26842 4 Great 
26843 4 Ideal 
26844 3 This little camera bag has come in so handy!! I am able to fit some light snacks and some loose bills for our theme park adventures. Also, the inside is padded and I know our little camcorder is supported and safe. 
26845 4 Love it! Works great. 
26846 4 Great camera, very durable 
26847 4 Seems like just what I was looking for. Faster shutter speed and high quality pictures. 
26848 4 Extremely comfortable and versatile strap. I use it everyday and experience no pain in my shoulders whatsoever. I recommend this to anybody who carries their DSLR with them all day 
26849 4 Worth every penny and more. Operates at the same level and higher cspacity than $50 OEM battery units. No issues with my Canon EOS Rebel XT. 
26850 4 6 months passed but it still works well 
26851 3 I love these little things as hotshoe covers. 
26852 4 Is cool 
26853 0 Motion detection not accurate. It sends u a snapshot after the person is out of frame and still sends u notifications when that camera is not supposed to. The night vision is not good unless you are really close. 
26854 4 An excellent binocular at moderate price. 
26855 4 Phantom and accessories fit perfectly, and it s right size for carryon baggage. Went on a hike in the pouring rain with this on my back, didn t get to fly with the weather, but all kept dry. 
26856 0 Beware!!!! Do Not Purchase!!!! The Controller Does Not Pair With The Drone!!!! Total Waist Of money!! 
26857 4 Works well for an after market charger and the car charger was an added bonus. 
26858 4 great camera 
26859 4 Now, I never have to worry about having a dead battery. 
26860 4 More than i expected 
26861 2 It meets my needs. 
26862 4 I attached it to my camera. I went into the water. My camera floated. End of story. 
26863 1 Bad quality, for the price its bad. 
26864 4 Love it 
26865 3 For the price, it s a good quality filter, cheapest among the brand names purporting multi-coated surface. Build quality is good and screws on the lens smoothly. Does not degrade image on a consumer DLSR and lens and effectively protects the front element. 
26866 4 excelent 
26867 4 I got this for my son and it was perfect. It as exactly what he wanted 
26868 4 Works great. Perfect for traveling. 
26869 1 the handles came off the moment I put it on the camera. 
26870 1 Charges but came broken so I have to tie the battery in to make it stay. 
26871 4 SD cards fit great, Very good buy 
26872 3 Works as good as a new one. 
26873 4 Low price. Works great. 
26874 4 received item very quickly.....its works great!!!! 
26875 4 I think that it is such a great product for such a great price!! it s working great without any problems. 
26876 2 It s easy to use and transport. I d just prefer that it was a bit more powerful as I continue to have shadows in certain places while filming. 
26877 4 put this in a derby car over the weekend and it took a lot of hard hits and for it being plastic, I am amazed at how well it held. 
26878 3 This camera took a few attempts to get it hooked up to our wifi and phones correctly, but once we did it has been great! It seamlessly switches from regular to IR and the speaker and microphone work great. 
26879 4 Great experience with this order. Camera is as advertised and shipped quickly. I m already looking into accessories. Would use merchant with confidence. 
26880 4 Great quality...strong wifi signal! 
26881 4 This is the best 4k camera for the buck. Loving my new machine 
26882 3 The lens cap bundle arrived in a timely manner. The caps do the job required by our staff. 
26883 0 I received a wrong item 
26884 2 It s works as expected only issue is it discharges very fast when I use rechargeable batteries. Works best with disposable. Bought new rechargeable thinking the old ones couldn t cut it but same issue with the new. 
26885 0 Good only for about a year. When you warranty is up that s it. NO fixing or replacement. Really bad deal 3 out of 4 gone bad and the 4th doesn t work well 
26886 4 Very good ... 
26887 4 Just as good as the $100 version. Autofocus in most cases is not needed because the focal range is so small....although this product provides for autofocus in both types of Canon lens I have yet to use auto focus. 
26888 4 This is a great little air blaster. It gets all the bits of dust off my lens and camera, and it s small enough to squeeze into my camera bag. I specifically didn t want the larger models because they looked huge, so this one fits the bill just right. 
26889 4 Great space for camera and side pockets for batteries and USB cable. 
26890 4 DJI can do no wrong with me they make good product all around. 
26891 4 it was good 
26892 4 Works really well. Only thing is - You have to remember to turn on the microphone. I forget sometimes. That s on me, not on them. 
26893 4 Great quality and lots of extras but the case is a little flimsy 
26894 4 Very good product for the price!! Do the job!!!! 
26895 4 Gotta have it because the original battery power doesn t last as long as this. 
26896 4 Perfect for me who has 2 gopro hero 4s and a lot of accessories.. not everything fits but this helps a lot 
26897 4 cute! 
26898 4 I bought this for my Nikon D5200. It fits the 18-55mm lens perfectly, but will not fit anything larger. The little zipper in the lid is great for an extra memory card or my wireless remote. 
26899 4 Love it work real good and clear 
26900 4 I got this as a birthday present on August 27th, 2015 and I love it so much. I had the wide instax and wasn t sure if this would be too small a size photo but it s perfect. 
26901 4 Excellent binoculars which I used for my African Safari. 
26902 3 I live in the mountains and have a large front porch which is where I installed this. It s located high enough to where nobody can touch it without using a ladder. 
26903 4 grate i wish i can fine more seniors though lol. 
26904 3 Works well👍🏼 
26905 4 excelent 
26906 3 Not quite as solid feeling as my Canon 600 ex-rt. but it gets the job done. Would have gotten five stars except for the feel. Also less than half the cost of the Canon flash. 
26907 2 a toy 
26908 2 while shooting an event, some of my shoots came out warm colors and others very cold. Hope I can figure out this issue by next event, other than that, great item, easy to use, lots of functions, great price, fast delivery. 
26909 3 Excellent for the money. Use it for video work. 
26910 3 Works well, just as advertised. 
26911 4 Love this lens. It s great to have the wide angle option for my Canon digital SLR. And the price is right! 
26912 4 Absolutely great 
26913 4 Fits the LX100 great, opens up when the camera is powered on, highly recommended if you don t want to fiddle with the lens cap. 
26914 4 Great product, works great, thank you! 
26915 4 Holds all of my camera goods with space for more, I fit my camera and three lenses all in it, also cleaning supplies and straps fit well! 
26916 4 Fits my Go Pro Silver 
26917 4 Good 
26918 4 Excellent! 
26919 1 plastic and cheap feel, digital viewfinder was fuzzy and slow to catch up when moved. 
26920 4 Excellent 
26921 0 So tiny! 
26922 4 Excellent case keeps the gopro in place. Highly recommended, Purchase with confidence. 
26923 3 Very nice product 
26924 4 These power packs worked just fine. No problems. 
26925 4 go to the tube and see how to works.... first install the usb to ur pc.charged it? then follow how it works. just got it..meeennnn im going to bust this bastard dr s that take advantage of my spinal cord injury..the video is perfect.even the picture works great.tku 
26926 4 Awesome 
26927 3 Extremely well made. Comfortable to carry. The quick release straps rather stiff to start. Expensive but you can see and feel the quality. The chocolate color straps look more orange than brown in reality. 
26928 4 Easy to use, sturdy, comes with a storage bag. Well made tripod. 
26929 2 This will give you plenty of light for portraiture or any setting where you are not firing it over and over again. For serious event work. No. It will leave you hanging. The hvlf43m runs circles around this flash for event work. 
26930 4 nice 
26931 2 Picture Quality is horrible, Mic only works for the person holding the camera, the ones you are recording literally have to shout to hear you and there is no light other than that its ok... 
26932 4 good product, very fast service. 
26933 0 Stopped working after one use, and the sound was terrible 
26934 4 Very nice case. Much more utility than I expected. It also appears to be well made. I know I ll get years of service from this case. 
26935 4 This bundle is great. Everything works perfectly. And you sure Can t beat the price. Definitely recommend 
26936 4 Works the way they said it would Came when they said it would. 
26937 2 Very *very* slight fuchsia hue, but the real problem comes on cold mornings. On two occasions these frosted completely and were totally unusable since it was like shooting through opaque glass instead of clear. Put it away on humid and cold occasions, figure something else out instead. 
26938 4 Works perfect for my application. And it is relatively light which is a requirement. 
26939 4 Great product. Works perfectly on my Sony A6000. I highly recommend it. 
26940 2 Too many unusable pixels , too much noise beyond 400. 
26941 3 They work well was expecting some bigger cameras tho. And the night vision is good! 
26942 4 Worked perfectly 
26943 4 Fabulous pics..... 
26944 0 not match with D40.cheap made bad quality.not recommend 
26945 3 The glasses were wonderful but the strap was not good at all. The weight of the binoculars made the strap cut into your neck. 
26946 0 I ordered two of these photo frames and upon receipt one wouldn t even power on and the other frame s color on the screen was very distorted. 
26947 0 Very poor quality photo and video. Set it to he 1080p setting and tried everything to get the best picture; never happened. Not sure why in the world there are anything over a one star review on this. Returning asap to Amazon. Don t waste your money on this. 
26948 2 Noisey play in the follow knob, pics up on mics. It s a good cheap follow focus to get practice on in spare time 
26949 4 These are quality lights that I wish I had purchased a long time ago. Although a carrying case isn t included, the small boxes can easily fit into a duffel bag for easy travel. 
26950 4 excellent quality and helps when moving stands 
26951 4 Perfect lens for birth photography! 
26952 4 Wish I could find more. They seem not to exist! 
26953 3 This works. It does not work with Polar Pro filters attached though. 
26954 4 great 
26955 4 Love that it has the double cameras for a broader view. We want purchase two more for all our vehicles. 
26956 4 Great 
26957 3 Much appreciated, if sold at more reasonable price. 
26958 4 Excellent lens. It is a bit heavy, but to me that s what a quality lens should feel like. 
26959 4 This is exactly what it says it is, a lens cap for Canon EOS EF 18-55. I had accidentally lost mine, and this was the perfect replacement. 
26960 1 Meh, the video on your phone is better unless you live in 1980. Move on. 
26961 4 Got this on a ridiculous deal to use on our Honeymoon in Belize. No water ever got into the camera. All you had to make sure was that it was sealed and that the gasket was covering it well. 
26962 4 Great for the type of camera that I own. 
26963 0 This viewer does not work, and unfortunately, I will return it. Rounded cornered slides work fine, but squared cornered slides get stuck and do not eject from the viewer. 
26964 3 I don t use it for anything but landscapes as the focus softens anything with sharp detail is not up to standards. 
26965 4 Saving much money since I no longer need to constantly purchase lithium batteries for my dog s invisible fence collar. One of the best decisions I have made lately, and I will be looking into buying similar chargers for other battery sizes! 
26966 4 Great little camera 
26967 4 Great camera for the money for sure! I say you should buy it! 
26968 4 These lens cases are great! Good quality with a soft lining for extra protection. Definitely recommend!! 
26969 2 The quality is not the best 
26970 4 Just what I needed 
26971 4 Descent case , good price. No complain 
26972 4 Worked well and easy to control. Setup just takes a little bit of effort. 
26973 4 My daughter loved it, exactly what she needed for photo class. TY 
26974 4 Super bright and amazing. Great price. Very happy. 
26975 3 excellent quality, but the backdrops are wrinkled, so I brought them to get pressed, which costed me an extra $30.00 for all 3. 
26976 4 Excellent Product 
26977 2 Couldn t get it to work with my internet, never got it to show up in my computer or phone 
26978 3 love it 
26979 3 Decent quality case at a modest price. Bought for Canon G16, loose fit for the camera. 
26980 4 This worked perfectly for my camera. 
26981 4 Perfect quality!! 
26982 4 Great buy. Would defenely recommend it. 
26983 4 Good replacement 
26984 3 Very happy with this lens. Used it on a full moon shoot and was pleased with the results. For the price, can t go wrong. 
26985 4 I love this filter. Used it for sunset and beach shots this summer and the effects were stunning. Highly recommended. 
26986 4 Everything came as ordered and works fine. 
26987 4 DSTE is the best non OEM grip out there period! I ve tried 3 others and this grip is by far better. The build is spot on with the OEM and all buttons/knobs work just like the OEM. The seller shipped fast from China and it arrived 8 days early. 
26988 3 Good Product Works as expected 
26989 4 Does what it s supposed to do. Solid build. 
26990 3 Worked exactly as written. 
26991 4 good for the price 
26992 3 Decent for the size. Has some trouble with light correction but worked fine with my fatshark goggles and a hawkeye transmitter for 5.8 ghz fpv. 
26993 4 Great value! 
26994 4 Great product 
26995 4 This is tripod is cool, a good deal, and does exactly what it is supposed to do. I am specifically using it for my compact Nikon, CoolPix camera, and it holds perfectly. 
26996 3 for peace of mind a low cost worth every penny.. 
26997 4 Great Tripod 
26998 4 They do jut what you expect batteries to do, charge and discharge. 
26999 4 Work good I am so happy I could used my camcorder again I fix it my self. 
27000 4 Great products, would recommend for everyone 
27001 4 Great color and very sharp photos! Last of the great 35 mm film for my great film cameras. 
27002 1 @ 6 months - Defective Monitor ! shuts down! occasionally needs to be Reset? 
27003 4 Works as well if not better than originals for a fraction of the price! 
27004 3 Useful product! Liked it. 
27005 0 This is not compatible with a p900. I called Nikon to confirm. DO NOT PURCHASE 
27006 4 great clear pictures and easy to use beats my I-Phone for pictures 
27007 4 wow what a package and all of them are useful. but yes i havent used all of them yet. But i really liked everything and all are of good standard. Exceeded my expectation really. 
27008 4 Fantastic. Incredible picture. Incredible price. Great bundle - all good stuff. These people are fantastic. Excellent customer service, fast shipping. Great in all respects. 
27009 0 It s defective....but I did not know that at that time so I could not return and I wasted money... 
27010 4 AAAAAA+++++ 
27011 4 Great camera. 
27012 4 Love this camera, easy to use, love the look of the camera and the case! I would recommend to all! The mini photos were a hit at the party in the photo booth! Just wish I would have purchased the mini photo album book to put the pictures in! 
27013 4 Real solid one 
27014 0 The wifi is not working i tested this cam with ios and android 
27015 2 Didn t work with my camera so I cannot review it. Make sure your camera can do wireless 
27016 4 I got this for my daughter fro her 10th birthday and she LOVED it! Great gift! 
27017 2 I had to send it back because it was way too big and bulky for my needs. The leather was a really poor quality and the front straps that snap were cumbersome. 
27018 1 More pink than red not to happy 
27019 3 I m fairly happy with this purchase. The only complaint I have is the length of the quick connect straps is too long and looks ridiculous hanging off the camera so I never remove the strap. 
27020 4 The product is great. Lightweight, portable and easy to use. There was a delay in the shipping for some unknown reason but Amazon gave me a $20 refund for the inconvenience. 
27021 4 works 
27022 4 It s great for getting tubes on video 
27023 4 No problems with product and/or delivery. Works as described. 
27024 4 great 
27025 0 This camera isn t really that good. The Mydlink site has a time limit on continuous viewing. There are several more things, but why pile it on? 
27026 2 This arrived safely and as scheduled. It fits okay but acceptable with some adjusting; but not a perfect fit. 
27027 4 it works just fine, no problems at all :) 
27028 3 It is awesome! It is way bigger than it appears, I highly recommend this product, it s perfect for a camera and some small stuff. 
27029 4 Great Value, works great 
27030 4 Solid stand, no issues. 
27031 4 Good product 
27032 3 Love nest cam, except for 15% of the time when it says &#34;offline&#34;. I also have a thermostat which rarely goes offline, so I know its not my internet connection. Also, why is the subscription cost so high? I would get it, if it wasnt a ripoff. 
27033 3 Plug in didn t work well. had to adjust in all the time in the socket, still. good batteries, good price. 
27034 4 Haven t used every item as of late, but what I have used works as intended. 
27035 4 Perfect fit. No issues , great service and delivery right on time. 
27036 0 Cheap plastic 
27037 4 works great, good value, fast shipper. 
27038 3 I bought this little guy for my gopro. Its definitely not &#34;heavy duty&#34; as the product description states but gets the job done. Great little tripod for the price. 
27039 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27040 3 Great Price and easy to use.. 
27041 4 My daughter loves the product. Customer Service and product expectations where met. Love it. 
27042 4 I have dozens of rechargeable batteries that I use for photography. This is great because it holds them reasonably snug and with the two partitions, I can keep the charged and depleted batteries separate. There aren t many cases like this, so this was great. 
27043 4 Came two days early. Great surprise!! Excellent condition. Looks and feels brand new. Great buy!! 
27044 3 Not the exact copy of the Nikon part however the form fit and function is right-on. Excellent Service from the vendor. Ordered two additional sets of caps just in case one is lost or comes off again. 
27045 3 Great price for the cleaning set. The Purosol solution really cleaned up my lens after snapping pics at a teppanyaki restaurant. It would be nice to have an extra pack of Altura lens paper. 
27046 2 I like the camera but when using the fisheye lens underwater, water gets between the fisheye and normal camera lens. 
27047 4 Fits - timely delivery 
27048 4 Works great, the wifi remote with this adds to the value. 
27049 4 I was pleased with fast shipping and Lens is perfectly and I love it.:) Thank you 
27050 4 Fits well, easy to put on and take off. 
27051 4 I like that i can charge 2 batteries at the same time. Great buy 
27052 1 I ordered the black backdrop but received the white. It did come in one day though. 
27053 1 It is not quite comparable to Vera Hub 
27054 4 excelent extra life for your camera 
27055 1 For the amount of money this cost me the quality should have been a lot better. And now I can t get rid of the thing for even half that amount. 
27056 4 Great product 
27057 3 It s nice and big, but almost too heavy to hold itself up. The rod on the umbrella bends a bit. I m worried it may break eventually or bend too much. But for now, it works and gives me a nice big reflective surface at a good price. 
27058 4 Order came in fast and was well packaged. Easy to assemble and get operational. Home security even on the road. Which we tested while away on a long weekend. 
27059 3 Good 
27060 4 Cowboy studio has the best equipment for the price 
27061 4 Fit perfect! Serves its UV purposes but also peace of mind in protecting my lens face. 
27062 1 Fills up with water and then does not float 
27063 4 Sprays just enough air to make it work for small spaces. Perfect and no need to use nasty chemicals. 
27064 4 great! 
27065 4 I have more pieces of equipment than I know what to do with. But, I will figure it out. I look forward to more professional photos for my website. 
27066 4 The Oly Pro lens are great. 
27067 4 They arrived on time and they were great 
27068 4 Manual focus, manual aperture, and no image stabilization. I m using it on a APS-C SLR in AE mode. Creamy texture for landscapes and a wonderful lens for group pictures. I will be using this on my (all manual) film camera also - the advantage of older lenses being non-gelded. 
27069 4 Good replacement battery for my camera. 
27070 3 It was everything I hoped for 
27071 3 Great one! Should buy 
27072 4 Awesome for the price. 
27073 4 good 
27074 4 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
27075 1 lots of vignette 
27076 3 Nice album for instant prints. 
27077 1 Expensive for how long it lasted. picture quality/ auto-zoom mechanism deteriorated quite quickly (my family can be a little hard on electronics, but no so hard that it s unreasonable). Vast majority of pictures don t zoom quite right. Better with an iphone at this point. 
27078 0 It s too lightweight so it tips over with a heavy smartphone. 
27079 4 working as intended 
27080 0 This product doesn t let you face your camera forward which makes it useless to me if the only thing it s capturing is a side view. 
27081 3 Works as advertised. Compact and good workmanship. 
27082 4 It is light and protect the Phantom 3 and all parts. Really nice product. 
27083 4 Very quick shipment. Quality item. 
27084 4 Great experience. Very fast shipping. Thanks. 
27085 1 I bought 3 of this, 2 had to returned, its either the plug in adapter not working, or not working properly! and only the first one works within 4-6 feet! 
27086 4 got this camera when it first came out; love it. I have taken thousands of pictures with it; never had a problem with it. will keep this camera till it dies. 
27087 4 Great suction mount! A great buy with a low price. GoPro s version is like 4 times as much and just as good 
27088 4 The product is excellent and easy to use, it charges all my batteries without problem and since I read that some of the customers had problems with putting in or taking off the battery but I ve haven t experience that. Mine runs smooth for the Canon T3 bats 
27089 4 Great batteries and charger. I use them for my Nikon d90, and have never had a problem! 
27090 4 Great price. 
27091 4 Delivered as expected...works great!! 
27092 2 Works as advertised 
27093 4 The flash work beautiful with my camera. Have it professional output. 
27094 4 Great Cam! Easy to set up & use. 
27095 4 Perfect 
27096 1 Um.. Great case, but it s a square rectangular shape that looks a little boxy... also the purple comes out 5 times darker.. ok though 
27097 4 Can t beat the price. 
27098 4 Still got to test it more. It charged fully and seem to be running well. 
27099 3 The Teleconverter worked fine in my Canon. I did not realized that it would not automatically focus if the lens being used has a 5.6 apert.; but otherwise, focusing manualy is fine. 
27100 4 Calvin the tech was great. VERY KNOWLEDGABLE AND COURTEOUS He knew where to go and did things the other techs did not do! 
27101 4 all good thanks .. 
27102 4 These binoculars are very lightweight and easy to carry around. The visual clarity is much better than the older cheaper and much heavier ones we have. I am impressed with the view and focus. These are well worth the price 
27103 4 Bought this for my grand daughter to go along with her pink camera. Looked ALL over on line and in stores for a camera case with some design on it in pink. Very hard to find...well, this is perfect. She LOVED it. The colors pop and looks great. 
27104 4 works flawlessly 
27105 3 Super awesome and sturdy. 
27106 4 Perfect replacement for original charger. Additional batteries an extra plus. Packaging was excellent. 
27107 3 Simple, but works great for what i needed. 
27108 4 Good value, all parts seemed well made and fit well on my Go-Pro. More than I will ever use. 
27109 4 Works on the FZ-1000. Bright light that allows you to dim/brighten as needed. Excellent product so far. 
27110 3 Great item 
27111 4 Very good ball head IMO, especially the price. 
27112 4 Plug and Play with enough information to fly your Multicopter with TV Display or Goggles. 
27113 4 Great lens shoot very well! 
27114 0 Died after being used for 5 photos. 
27115 4 I love this unit it works great 
27116 4 Brand new and arrived quickly. 
27117 4 Great for taking vibration free photographs and time exposures. Although the release can t take timed photos, it is able to be locked open for long exposures with manual timing. 
27118 4 Great! 
27119 0 Moves way too fast for practically any video usage. If someone can show us how to slow it down I would probably give it a better rating, but as it is, it is pretty useless. 
27120 3 Good for the price. They lag a little bit connecting and they blow threw non rechargeable batteries. But easy to set up and use. 
27121 0 The display worked well but the remote controller did not work. 
27122 4 Very well made protection for my Manfrotto tripod.I use it all the time. 
27123 4 It was a perfect fit for my camera. 
27124 4 good so far. 
27125 3 Great upgrade for my old Q-see system! 
27126 4 Works as advertised and alot easier to install than the reglar cloth straps that comes standard with the cameras 
27127 4 One of the best out there. 
27128 4 Good job 
27129 4 nice pics cheap 
27130 4 Glad we purchased. A great addition to our gear. 
27131 4 Thank you thank you thank you thank you. Canon lenses + Sony body = happiness 
27132 4 fits perfect on the screen of my camera! 
27133 3 it is fun! 
27134 4 Great price. Works well. 
27135 4 Fast Shipping. Bought for our Daughter and she LOVES it. 
27136 4 Performed brilliantly. Got some nice pictures in the pool. Will be taking it snorkel I got next. 
27137 3 Good 
27138 4 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
27139 2 There okay, use them here and there.... 
27140 4 Effortless set-up and pack-up of all of these type screens. Saves a Lot of time for chromakey, etc. Recommended. They used to come in a really nice zippered heavy-duty blue case with handles, which itself could be put to use as a small Blue screen. 
27141 4 Great! 
27142 1 Poor quality, selfie connections did not work,returned you get what you pay for !! 
27143 2 2 out of 3 of mine don t lock to the lens properly. When you get the good one it stays that way. 
27144 4 As good as the real thing! 
27145 4 Great filters! They work really well, I love the look they give. The case to hold the filters is great quality as well. Would definitely buy these again in different lens sizes. 
27146 0 It did not fit my lens 
27147 4 Great 
27148 4 So far so good within a few days of attaching it to my Sony RX100 IV. Fits well, and changes the handle of the camera - in a better way. It adds a secure feel in handling the camera. Definitely a must have. 
27149 4 Cool 
27150 4 Bought this for my trip to Oahu, Hawaii. Real life saver. Not a drop got it. Floats in the water. Super convenient to store phones and wallets. Will probably buy one or two more as gifts! Great purchase, happy customer. 
27151 3 Exactly what we needed. 
27152 4 Still going strong since 2007 after hundreds of cycles. 
27153 1 The legs are extremely thin and unstable. 
27154 4 I cannot love this thing enough. For the price this thing is amazing. Can pull up live feed anywhere you have internet or a cell data signal. My friends always ask where I got it and how much it was. They can never believe how cheap they are. 
27155 4 The quality of the camera is outstanding. Never worry about it anymore. 
27156 1 I pulled it brand new from the amazon box, and the zipper sticks horribly! I kept it because I needed it for a trip, but very unhappy about it. 
27157 4 Great price 
27158 4 I love it!! thank you so so much! it works just perfectly 
27159 4 As advertised 
27160 3 Very easy to install and operate. I like it!! I also liked the price. It s a much better system than the one I ve had for years and couldn t operate. 
27161 4 Great protection! 
27162 4 Great item 
27163 4 Gift for my wife. Great product, prompt delivery. 
27164 4 Works good 
27165 4 Good one 
27166 2 FITS MY GIRL S COMPACT CAMERA PERFECTLY 
27167 0 It is great, but, am waiting for the camera to use this kit 
27168 3 Work as expected 
27169 4 Good picture, just as good as the expensive name brand cables. Well worth the price 
27170 0 Stopped working after couple months 
27171 4 Exactly what I needed 
27172 4 I have been a D.P. for 21 years....this far exceeded my expectations...if you don t need a large head to carry a big camera....this is amazing...not only just for the money...but I have heads worth 5X as much...this one really works well....paired with their carbon fiber legs....great 
27173 4 Great camera bag. 
27174 2 Charged as expected. Took a couple of hours. But the battery didn t last that long in Camera and battery life didn t show up on screen. 
27175 4 Excelente! 
27176 4 good camera 
27177 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
27178 4 Great quality for what I paid. I use it more than I thought I would. 
27179 4 works great photos in green shallow waters and glass lens is both a great protector for lens and scratch resistant. 
27180 3 Works and functions as expected. The downside is that the software is compatible with old operating systems like Windows 7. 
27181 4 Great product, good price! 
27182 4 This is just perfect!!! Nicely package and looks great. I will post a picture soon of what my cakes look with it and without it to show the major differences. I use it for cakes but it will also work well with jewelry or pretty much anything 
27183 4 They work pretty well and compare to the original batteries, so far no problems. 
27184 4 Meets my expectations fully 
27185 4 nice filters 
27186 0 item does not fit requested refund. Have not received approval. 
27187 2 dropped a 8mm fisheye that did not catch the holster. Needs padding inside the belt where the metal housings are. Lots of bruising. In the future I think I will combine one side with the Spider and one side with the Black Rapid strap. 
27188 3 Good ring light, bright LED s, good xenon flash as well, but as others have noted, it s difficult to get the light to stay on any given lens. 
27189 4 Can t get enough of this thing! I love the 4k quality and recently used it in a neighborhood cleanup effort in Detroit. The time-lapse feature is probably my favorite. It is very impressive. 
27190 4 As described 
27191 4 Great battery, great value! 
27192 3 Nice bag and fits a good ammount of gear. Only problem is it s a bit tight to zip and can get stuck 
27193 4 Great lens at a great price. I bought it used, but whoever owned it took great care and it s basically like new for a fraction of the price. Thank you! 
27194 4 Works phenomenally. Haven t had any issues with it fitting inside my camera. Would recommend 
27195 4 A must have for portrait photography! Clean Sharp images with beautiful bokeh. 
27196 4 works even better than the original that came with the camera 
27197 4 Loved having all of these back up camera batteries. 
27198 2 They sent me the wrong color, instead of white it s red... didn t know that there would be no sound when zooming in or out. Other than that everything works okay. 
27199 4 I am very pleased with it. Best thing I ve bought in a long while. 
27200 3 No significant drop-off from Canon batteries. Great to have replacements at inexpensive prices. 
27201 4 [[VIDEOID:9c439f3b04874cf69db357b20ad3fe9d]] My videos are typically short and sweet, but this product demanded a more lengthy video. I hope you enjoy it. I received this unit gratis in exchange for an honest review. 
27202 4 Great backpack for Camera equipment 
27203 4 Works fantastic , very good for the money , I am very happy 
27204 4 Thanks! 
27205 4 Good price. 
27206 4 Comes with everything I need 
27207 4 One word,amazing! ! 
27208 4 Awesome 
27209 0 remote won t work on canon t5i as advertised. Tripod is okay, you pay for what you get. not the best but decent for the price. 
27210 4 Batteries currently last about 5 hours per charge, far beyond my old camera. Only time will tell how they will hold up, but so far they are great. 
27211 4 A great lens!! 
27212 4 Works as expected 
27213 0 Battery did not fit in my camera. Had to throw away the product. 
27214 4 Great item. I ve used it for a while and had great video taken from this thing! 
27215 4 Very easy setup. Very useful in lighting up dark areas. I installed it next to my back door in garage. No more trying to find the keyhole. Very bright!! Motion sensor perfect 
27216 4 love these batteries and charger...I ve got several... 
27217 4 Beautiful pictures with this lens 
27218 4 This rig is dope! Don t set it up like dude had it in his video. Camera should be behind the handles. Also buy one of these to offset the shoulder pad. Way better if you plan on using a view finder. Sick rig for sure! 
27219 4 well packed and everything needed to use with the sony camera 
27220 4 awesome product great price would buy again 
27221 4 [[VIDEOID:e4369a1019f77856e8979118bb9ab375]] 
27222 4 Great product, it fit on any bag, no matter if it is a messenger or backpack.... I fit a Sony A6000 with 3 lenses.... recommended. 
27223 3 It was delivered quickly, it fit exactly what I wanted and for a finale they included a great (gratis) microfiber cloth. They even followed up with an e-mail requesting feedback. 
27224 0 didn t work for me 
27225 0 Lens cap does not fit once the lens hood is installed on 16-50mm kit lens for Sony A6000. Hotshoe cover does not fit either for my Sony A6000 ILCE. 
27226 3 Works good with my new Panasonic DMC-ZS50K camera. Pocket is good enough for a couple of extra batteries, and design is good. Seems to be built well. Zips easy. 
27227 3 A nice case to keep additional items such as an extra battery and/or memory card with your camera. The interior is soft and won t scratch your camera. My only problem is the Velcro and nylon strap material can/will snag most 100% polyester shirts. 
27228 4 Great camera in all respects 
27229 0 Not 900 tvl as advertised or atleast I got shipped 2 800 tvl cameras ? 
27230 4 I have not yet used the car charger but the home wall charger does what it needs to do and I am totally satisfied. Price was right, it charges the Nikon CoolPix camera I picked up on the cheap. Now I just need a proper USB cable. 
27231 4 Amazing. Lots of fun with this little camera. 
27232 4 battery works great 
27233 4 ok 
27234 4 I needed a spare for traveling. It works perfectly for my needs. 
27235 3 Nice kit and nicer price! Everything fits perfctly with my gopro. Delivered on time. Use the gopro screw insted of the one provided, it get oxid after first use. 
27236 4 Honestly don t know why anybody would get another tripod. Best bang for you buck. Granted it isn t as smooth in motion as the top of the line. But for those that need a ball head tripod this is the best. Solid construction and will last a long time! 
27237 2 Nice, you can see edges of the lens hood. 
27238 1 pain in the ass to use 
27239 1 This has a European style plug and you ll have to spend at least $5 more for an adapter in order to use it. 
27240 4 Good 
27241 4 This scope comes with a tripod and an eye attachment. Very good accessories and scope for the price. I have used this scope to look at stars and the moon, very pleased! 
27242 4 It good 
27243 4 The rave reviews of these binoculars are all right on the money. These are fantastic optics for the price. 
27244 4 Great charger, never had a problem with it. The travel and D cell kit comes in handy. Will be buying the higher end model next time and use this for travel. 
27245 2 works as expected 
27246 4 Using them for my twitch stream, they do exactly what I need them too. Seem sturdy enough for my use. Would not recommend using them outside. 
27247 4 Thank you very much. The shipping was really fast. I love the camera. It is the perfect camera for pictures and vlogging. 
27248 4 Pre-cut compartments that fits the GoPro PERFECTLY! Handy case to store all the go pro products while protecting it! Boyfriend loves it! 
27249 4 😊 
27250 3 It has a very clear picture during the day and the night feature is very cool. Never knew so many animals are running around at night. 
27251 1 Was really expediant on shipping , but this is not a minolta lens its an olympus OM. Should have done his research before posting .... but hey for $15 the oem hard shell case Is worth it sux I cant use the lens though. 
27252 0 I purchased this item,it did not work properly. I sent for a refund, i ended up losing 126. in restocking fee all because their equipment did not function correctly, very unhappy. I will never buy from this again..... I give zero star rating 
27253 4 Look professional. 
27254 4 Great quality at a great price …works perfect …good suction on the suction cup!! 
27255 4 My daugher loves this case for her point and shoot camera, especially the extra memory card slot. 
27256 3 works well. charges well. 
27257 4 No issues, works as intended. 
27258 2 ok 
27259 4 Great camera! Great price! Good response for my questions! Very happy with delivery! 
27260 4 Very clean, used body. have been pleased with the camera and fast shipping. 
27261 4 Best camera gadget I have ever purchased! 
27262 0 I tried one of these with a 76 MZ-5 and Canon 1dx. It did not work in TTL or ETTL at all. Pretty much just fired full blast all of the time. Could not find a fix so I returned it. 
27263 3 Could fit the P3 a little better. However, plenty of storage, very nice in general. Good build quality. Suits my needs. 
27264 3 This case is small & perfect to put in my carry on. It s sturdy construction should protect the camera well. If I have anything to add I ll return after my vacation and update my comment. 
27265 4 Such a conversation starter even if I m just wearing it. 
27266 4 be Careful, this unit is super strong. I threw it in my console and forgot about a laptop hard drive I had in there..... let s just say it s clean. Cheap way to wipe your HD! Seriously though, this magnet is ridiculously strong, an it doesn t scratch paint. 
27267 1 Getting this device to take video is complicated and the instructions are poor. I got the clock set, but have tried twice to get it to take videos. Have not yet succeeded. 
27268 4 ohh yea have already done some cool time lapse with this baby, and just waiting to experiment with leaving the shutter open for certain periods of time. 
27269 4 Great product 
27270 3 Works well to take pictures of rooms! 
27271 3 For beginner I think I chose the right camera for me more than enough stuff to learn how to use over the next 6 months to a year 
27272 1 Didn t fit my camera even though I was led to believe it would. 
27273 4 Cheap, but only of the price. 
27274 0 i need np-fp50 please 
27275 3 its like canon 580 ex II...takes bit longer to charge...and it is not recognized by the canon CAMERA...so ettl works partially...example...increase power dont work from camera 
27276 3 Canon PowerShot SX700 HS Digital Camera 
27277 4 Wonderful! Amazing for the price. Shipping was slow by Amazon standards but I couldn t be happier with the product. 
27278 1 Does not stay on well, wish there was a camera store near me. 
27279 0 Another lemon I brought! It doesn t work with Canon 70D! 
27280 4 Better than the original charger. 
27281 4 GR8 Seller, loved my items and received them in record time, can t wait to take some pictures! A+++++ 
27282 4 Love my flash. I love how it automatically works great with burst shots. 
27283 4 This is the best deal ever for a non-professional photographer such as myself. 
27284 4 So much cheaper than buying the GoPro brand accessories! We basically saved hundreds of dollars and they are good quality products. 
27285 4 Works great! 
27286 4 You can t go wrong with this one PLUS it came with a car charger and a wall charger with are awesome! Thanks for the extras! Have yet to have to use both batteries on the same shoot with my GoPro. 
27287 4 delivered promptly, item was as described. charged the two batteries and am ready for a day with my camera. will shop with vendor again. 
27288 4 I should have gotten this sooner, if you want to get more versatility out of your camera this is completely worth it. Its great for capturing wide landscapes and taking pictures half above water half underwater. 
27289 0 I just got them and noticed that they drain really fast. (I have the go pro hero 4 silver.) My gut said get the go pro brand but i got cheap. You get what you pay for 
27290 4 Product as described. Would do business with again in the future. 
27291 0 Strap is well made but the small strap that go under my armpit is loosen all the time, can t lock it, the plastic buckle is the problem. 
27292 3 works just as described. only for indoors. not weatherproof but I covered mines with plastic for outside gate. remote works fine from 40ft. 
27293 0 RETURNED....this is NOT for a Nikon D3100 as it indicates 
27294 4 It is just a simple box...but GREAT in wet conditions !! 
27295 4 Great, love it 
27296 4 This battery has more capacity and lasts longer in my Sony Camera than the original. The price was great, and it arrived very quickly. This is a very good choice for replacement of this camera s battery! Thanks, jon 
27297 3 Good job 
27298 4 The padding is nice and thick and the case is light weight. Fits my camera perfectly. 
27299 4 I have two of these, but his is the one I use. I had a little trouble figuring out how much water to put in to make it neutrally bouyant but it works terrific otherwise! Would highly recommend this! 
27300 4 all ok 
27301 4 Very nice 
27302 4 It fits my Olympus Tough-1 camera perfectly. 
27303 2 It came fold so it has wrinkles and I roll it to see if it goes away I m waiting to see. Color it nice but I can t use it since it has wrinkles 
27304 4 Luv my new selfie stick this works much better than other s I ve used. The built in blue tooth switch and rechargeable battery make is very easy and fun to use The Rotating clamp and extended arm make for great angle shot s 
27305 3 Great product.. 
27306 4 Very pleased with this product. 
27307 4 Works great haven t got it wet yet I ll mount it on my racing jet ski this weekend so far really good deal 
27308 4 Great product! 
27309 4 It is the same as the original battery and charged and worked just like the original battery. 
27310 4 Just what I needed. 
27311 4 Works great. Really easy to setup! 
27312 4 fun copter to fly easy and stable but the FPV is really bad, see the RC forums for more about this. I recommend DO NOT buy this for FPV you will be disappointed. But for a fun quad to fly this is fun!!! 
27313 4 Great product! I will be purchasing again. 
27314 1 Loved what I received but the measurements were off from the description. Did not fit my Olympus. 
27315 4 This is a superb camera. Does so much for its size. Excellent for low light use! have always loved Canons but had to break away on this one... 
27316 4 great 
27317 2 there is no instruction or any package infomation in the package. 
27318 4 does what it says its gonna do --sometimes the tightening screw comes undone but it has never fallen out 
27319 4 I m very happy with the batteries!! They arrived quickly and they work great! 
27320 2 The case for my phone recesses the phone s lens and the lens clip doesn t compensate for it. This makes for a cumbersome removal of the case and I usually don t bother. 
27321 4 Super Fast Lens, buy it. 
27322 3 thank you for every thing. It is excellent. 
27323 4 Fast service, great price and happy customer. 
27324 4 Product was as advertised. 
27325 3 It s has only one fail , when not tight all the way it wobbles ... 
27326 3 decent enough digital camera. You just need to get a rechargeable battery 
27327 4 Arrived on time and works perfectly. 
27328 0 I ve received just 1 component. Add is not correct.... or the store trick us .... Do not buy it. 
27329 2 Fits all equipment but not very comfortable. 
27330 4 excellent product. 
27331 4 Good sale 
27332 1 I received this camera Monday. Extremely excited about taking pictures. I bought film for it as well, opened the camera put the film in and it didn t work. I watched several youtube video and read instructions and still isn t working? What s going on here ? 
27333 3 Quality was okay. But acceptable for the cost. 
27334 4 Excellent product and service 
27335 3 as described, got it fast 
27336 4 Works fine and cheap. 
27337 3 My daughter loves the camera. She took it to camp this summer. The picture quality is similar to the old polaroid pictures. The film is a little pricey, but fun. 
27338 4 Good 
27339 4 Love this and the convenience!!! Thanks! 
27340 2 not compatible with our Xfinity system. Returning 
27341 4 I am totally pleased with the 2 batteries. They arrived quickly and were a very good price. 
27342 4 Works great, we love it. 
27343 0 it was fine. just what I expected. 
27344 0 I ordered this case in the yellow with white dots. It came in the mail-it s the brown one!!! 
27345 4 Nice product arrived on time 
27346 4 Great service and product. Loved the ease of installation and helps greatly to see my camera screen in bright sunlight. Very inexpensive protection and photo taking assistance! 
27347 0 Very bad quality. In a two days one motor died. Bought new and replace. In a week another one died. 
27348 4 Great product. Exactly what I needed at half the price. 
27349 3 Good fit and decent build.. 
27350 0 No directions... Lists my camera, can t figure it out 
27351 4 The filters are amazing quality for such a low price! Bought them for my wife and she loves them! Fast shipping as well 
27352 0 Didn t fit the battery that suppsably it fit, didn t find out till the day I needed, 6 months later 
27353 4 Works really good with my Nikon D5500. I completely recommend this item. 
27354 4 Very hipster and ideal for a photo bug. 
27355 4 Was very helpful 
27356 0 Awful. Something appears to be wrong with the film. All pictures are either under or over exposed or don t turn out at all. Have tried two packs. Prior to this, the camera was working fine. 
27357 3 could be 2 inches bigger all the way a round than it would be perfect 
27358 4 My father asked for this as a birthday gift. He absolutely loves it and made a point to buy the extra battery and parts to keep it running. 
27359 0 Instructions are vague at best I have not gotten it to work at all as of yet 
27360 4 As described. No issues. Fits well onto the diving housing for a hero 4. 
27361 4 These batteries and charger was just what I was looking for. 
27362 4 Works with the Sony HX300 well! 
27363 4 Exactly what I expected. 
27364 4 Excellent product....fit every need of mine and came when scheduled. :) 
27365 3 The piece fits my D7100 perfectly but the magnification is virtually unnoticeable compared to the stock eyepiece. 
27366 4 Worth every penny! 
27367 4 Great as I expected! 
27368 4 It s a bright portable light. I would advise getting the li-ion battery & keep a spare set of AAs for backup. It looks weak around the shoe mount so be careful handling it. It s not Nikon or canon! 
27369 4 love it and easy to use 
27370 4 excelllent 
27371 4 Exactly what I expected. 
27372 2 I didn t believe the non-auto-focus would be an issue, but its a huge issue for me. I m keeping it for rare use but won t use it as much as I had hoped. 
27373 4 excellent tripod. I am using it with my pochade box. It is stable and works well. I love how small it folds to and fits in my backpack. 
27374 4 My 13 loves it takes it everywhere! Works great underwater! 
27375 4 Great product! Love it! 
27376 4 Just as expected, thank you 
27377 4 A great blogging/vlogging camera for beginners. 
27378 4 Very good, quality item.Love it. 
27379 0 not that great 
27380 4 Excellent!!! Full of room for all your gear!!! 
27381 3 cool... wish more came with the package 
27382 0 I bought this selfie crap it broke at the base where my hand hold the grip this is not a well made product don t buy it not worth it! 
27383 4 Shipped quickly, as described 
27384 4 My very first DSLR Camera...easy & fun to use & I can take better shots now. 
27385 4 Great price works better than expected 
27386 2 These cameras perform ok for what you pay. I know there are better options for color, clarity and resolution. This cameras does its job ok for such a low price tag. 
27387 4 They worked pretty good. 
27388 3 I would give this battery 3.5 if it was available. My Sony battery being very old still charges up to 235 min. This battery gets up to 190 min and discharges to 10 min of charge in about 80 min. But as a spare battery it could work. 
27389 3 Better than extensions not as short of a space to get your subject in focus. 
27390 4 Works! 
27391 2 Noticed some color fringing in the corner of some images. 
27392 4 I;ve been using this for about a year now. It was easy to set up, great picture and nice to see outside where there are no windows. Just added two more cameras. 
27393 4 Very nice present for my son. 
27394 4 holds all my camera and lens 
27395 4 Great case. This will easily protect our camera 
27396 4 very good for the price 
27397 4 Gift for my husband - he was very happy with this gift! 
27398 2 Telephoto did not work with my camera. Seller was prompt to make adjustment. Not happy with the product, but happy with the service. 
27399 4 Worked great, very happy we did not need to by a new tripod! 
27400 4 Can t use my camera without this... 
27401 0 I don t understand how this product has such good ratings. Almost every joint in the box did not fit with my gopro hero 4 housing (see the attached photo). There were a few exceptions, but I wanted a bundle, not a few working items. 
27402 4 Son in law was happy 
27403 0 Broke in 2 days. Not worth using 
27404 4 Perfect for camping flash light. 
27405 3 This came in a different color, but it s cute anyways. 
27406 4 Nice. 
27407 4 Great price and worked great for my nikon d40 plus lens, battery charger cables and more! 
27408 4 Very happy...very inexpensive replacement for the Nikon. 
27409 4 Very nicly made holds alot. Canvas looks good and it is a nicr quality bag 
27410 4 great! replaced the one I broke that I loved. 
27411 1 Added nothing special lighting wise 
27412 4 I have yet to get a bad Think Tank product despite many orders and many years. It does what it promises and does it well. 
27413 4 Love this little camera 
27414 4 Great stuff and on time 
27415 4 Great pole, easy to extend, gives me comfort we won t lose our GoPro while jetski-ing. Have purchased another, as a gift. 
27416 0 This product is identical to two others that I bought for about $4 each on Amazon. On all three the ball joints loosened up after 2 or 3 uses and it can t be used after that. Don t bother. 
27417 4 This strap worked exactly as advertised, and it works great because it allows freedom of movement rather than having the camera sit at chest level. The clasp is very secure and well done. Very happy with it 
27418 4 Good 
27419 3 Looks and feels like high quality leather.......probably because it IS high quality leather. Fits the Sony RX100M III perfectly. Leather, adjustable shoulder strap. Would like to see a small pouch on the back side for a small lens clothe. 
27420 4 Perfect! 
27421 4 Great Product!! 
27422 4 Great Product and Excellent Quality. 
27423 3 I like it,it does its job with ease. 
27424 0 misleading 
27425 4 It works and matche dmy len. Pinch caps are the best. 
27426 4 fits perfect with my camera 
27427 4 sturdy and comfortable:) Love the cute designs and the attractive color ^^ 
27428 4 This is a extremely useful dolly and I love using it when shooting shallow depth of field. 
27429 4 perfect 
27430 4 It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again 
27431 4 As advertised and fast delivery. 
27432 4 Customer support is fabulous. Worked on my issue and continued until problem was fixed. 
27433 1 Not near as cushy or comfortable as I had hoped. Looks nice but just doesn t have enough padding. 
27434 4 Very beautiful bag 
27435 4 a gift 
27436 3 Delivery was fast and it works great. Some of the accessories were not worth having but the package is still a good value for the beginner. 
27437 4 Fits my nikon d5200 perfectly. Cute and sturdy. 
27438 4 Love it! 
27439 3 Good product so far, 
27440 4 Super replacement. Highly recommend!! 
27441 1 Pretty flimsy when extended. Can t support the weight of the go pro and will spin around. 
27442 4 nice set 
27443 4 I recommend anyone beginner or expert to own one. Can t go wrong for the price. Overall a great camera. 
27444 4 Works great! Still on my first protector 18 months later! 
27445 0 The CD with the software is full of viruses, detected in different PC running Symantec and McAffee, could not yet find the software to download from the realand.com website. So far useless. 
27446 4 Great Lens for travel and walking around. The focal range means you can shoot up close or wide without changing lenses. The pictures I get are tack sharp. Great lens at a great price. 
27447 4 use all the time-it works perfect so I always have backup when I m out on the road taking shots 
27448 4 great! 
27449 3 Great little lens for beginners to try macro photography. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of shots. Give it a try. 
27450 4 It s pretty sweet! I used it last week when I went diving and its great especially with the variety of lengths you can choose from! I like that it had a padded bag and parts to connect my camera too! 
27451 2 First one died after 10-15 pictures. Amazon was great and sent a new one and I returned the old. New refurb unit has worked very well for what it is, a point and shoot camera. I like the wifi capability and it works well with my IPhone 6plus. 
27452 3 It converts nicely, but I wish the screen was a little bit larger, so I could see what I needed to adjust. 
27453 2 Bulky 
27454 4 Good 
27455 4 Henry was very helpful to fix my modem issues. Camera works great Thank you 
27456 3 It works perfectly! Your only problem will be to change the battery as it is hard to pop open the port. Other than that an excellent product. 
27457 4 Works great. 
27458 4 great for my a6000 
27459 4 I purchased this camera as a gift for my son. His remark about the camera was &#34;awesome!&#34; The camera takes great photos and the zoom is amazing! May purchase one for myself! 
27460 4 Excellent Camera and an excellent package and price 
27461 4 Got the job done! 
27462 4 Very positvive this battery. In perfect status. 
27463 4 Great product for the price. the Lense cap was bit tight for my Nikon camera but it works fine. Will certainly buy from this seller again. 
27464 3 Looks good. Sent back bc i don t have internet 
27465 4 Henry Campbell is the best. So helpful! 
27466 0 Zipper jammed, and I destroyed the zipper trying to fixed that..... 
27467 0 It s listed to fit the Fujifilm X-T1 but doesn t. 
27468 4 great seller - delivered as promised! 
27469 4 I just wanted some easy to use quickly lens, and these are perfect.They are good if you are on holiday and want to take some nice shots or if you have some pictures planned. Especially good with the iPhone 5s as it has the very good camera quality! 
27470 4 Works perfectly. Safe, secure and attractive. The elastic function around the lens acts much better than the typical through-the-eyelet keepers 
27471 4 Thank you! 
27472 4 Perfect for what we need them for. 
27473 4 Arrived on time. Fits the charger and the camera as promised. Arrived with a greater charge than the battery provided with the camera. 
27474 2 Batteries are a bit larger. Tight fit 
27475 4 Excellent package 
27476 4 NONE 
27477 3 Love these things. I wish they were cheaper because I need 3 more. 
27478 4 GREAT PRICE,FAST SHIPPING, I BOUGHT THREE OF THEM. 
27479 4 Excelente 
27480 0 Pretty tinny cloths 
27481 0 I had to return these cameras due to the terrible connection to our wifi. The image quality was nowhere near 720p. I ended up purchasing a hardwired security camera set that works better. Save your money on this product 
27482 4 thx 
27483 4 was my husbands birthday present for his gopro. he loves it we carry it everywhere. 
27484 4 Excellent product. I use this for my spotting scope at the range. This allows for easy fine adjustment at extreme distances. Very intuitive. 
27485 2 Good for what I payed for it. 
27486 4 The battery was only $7 including shipping. Has quite a bit more milliamp capacity than the original. Made a great replacement battery. 
27487 4 GOOD DEAL 
27488 0 Complete garbage 
27489 4 great. 
27490 0 I purchased this shutter release for my Nikon D3300. the button on this release has a tendency of getting stuck and if you have your camera set to bulb mode this may lead to over exposure. I d recommend looking for something of better quality 
27491 4 Awesome camera for family! Super intelligent mode, a lot of scenarios and effect for more professional look. And also fully manual mode for more professional job. 
27492 0 most disappointing,worked for one day, total lack of support,phone calls were endless loop,emails returned.sending it back will be another irritation. 
27493 4 great product thank you 
27494 4 These are made pretty well, very happy. 
27495 4 works great easy to use 
27496 3 A LITTLE HEAVY, BUT IN THE TOOL BOX. 
27497 4 We bought these for a trip to Aruba...I was concerned about the quality of picture it would take but was pleasantly surprised that the underwater pictures turned out great!! Also, they were available at the gift shops on the beach for $22.00 EACH!! 
27498 3 The stick extensor is a little flimsy not for any major X-sports ,just casual pics all else as expected 
27499 3 Cheap, comes dirty, scratched up, but what can you expect for a cheap Copy Stand. Definitely got the job done though. 4 star because it came beat up. 
27500 4 This cute tripod does just what it should. The iPhone is held firmly in placen no wobbles. And I love the remote shudder control. I would purchase from this company again. 
27501 3 Super prompt with delivery. .great items for on the road photo shoots. 
27502 4 Works just like it is supposed to. Not sure why the other one died but...... 
27503 3 very nice 
27504 4 So adorable, looks like a purse but holds the cutest camera ever. 
27505 3 Great idea however it does not close completely. It saves time and hassle of removing the &#34;standard issue&#34; lens cap. 
27506 4 Great buy I love all the features it has, especially transferring photos straight to your iPhone. 
27507 4 Its a perfect size for my camera. Not too big, but holds everything. Love it! 
27508 3 A bit difficult to lighn up with the camera lens but other than that works great! 
27509 4 Love it, best mount I have bought so far. Easy to use and not in the way. It is as if you were riding the bike while watching the video. 
27510 4 take some getting used to but overall but works great. 
27511 4 This works well. 
27512 0 terrible sevice will not refund item keep saying nrver got item 2nd return both item don t work keep away kenneth 
27513 4 It was exactly what we need and it came with a string that connects the lens to the camera to prevent loss of the cap in the future. 
27514 4 Fast shipping !!! Had Everything my Boyfriend wanted. Great price 
27515 3 Works as expected. Nothing fantastic but allows for a lot more use than the tiny battery. 
27516 4 I am extremely pleased with my Sony DSC-RX100M III Cyber-shot Digital Camera and its accessories. 
27517 4 love it 
27518 4 Great! Wow I love it. 
27519 4 These radio triggers are simple, rugged and reliable. I use them for weddings, location and studio work. I especially love that I don t have to deal with cords anymore! 
27520 0 I does not work properly and need to return Garbage 
27521 3 Very pretty colors inside the film. We liked the transition from one pictures Frame to the next 
27522 4 Very good 
27523 4 This camera was a birthday gift for my husband, who takes pictures of things like Venus and birds a quarter of a mile away and continues to be amazed at the picture quality and features. Best gift ever according to him! 
27524 4 good 
27525 4 Quick service. Everything arrived as expected! 
27526 4 Great service and great product!! I could not be happier and am having lots of fun playing with my new toy. Thanks so much 
27527 0 It s so hard to press the button on the stick don t buy this buy a selfie stick with seperate camera button to take the picture. 
27528 3 works wonderful as a white black and gray refinance i would recommend this to any photographer from hobbyist to professional 
27529 0 Only one worked. The other never worked at all. Shortly after I received the package (2 weeks) the second battery stop working. Not worth the buy even for a short period of time. 
27530 4 Great System , easy to set up. 
27531 3 Works, big and bulky 
27532 4 good 
27533 4 Performed as expected. I like the way it folds to a compact size. Seems to be made well and for the price, it is a great product!! 
27534 4 Thanks! 
27535 1 Didn t stick well to my kayak at all. 
27536 0 it suks and thay all broke after 2 days 
27537 3 good size! 
27538 3 Came as ordered. Looks slightly different than the one I was replacing, but works the same, and fits the same! 
27539 4 So pretty~ suitable with nikkon coolpix p900.. And color is amazing...... 
27540 4 Simply perfect. Works great, Provides protection and does it s job well. 
27541 0 Too big, too wrinkly, doesn t come with stand. 
27542 4 I needed the extra length cable to go under the eaves of the house from the furthest point. Had a little left over at the DVR but no problem. The camera worked perfectly. 
27543 3 Great little camera 
27544 4 Item was as described and arrived on time 
27545 2 Buen producto 
27546 3 The screw is a little long. Did not fit my application. Quality is better than expected. Have to return however. 
27547 4 small, efficient, and the hot shoe can be unscrewed so it can be mounted on a threaded screw. 
27548 4 Perfect fit.. 
27549 4 Great set of lenses, inexpensive, and they definitely do the trick without spending a fortune. 
27550 4 My friend recommended this camera to me. She said she likes this model over the newer model. I don t know the difference, but I sure love this model. It s user friendly and works great, indoors and out. 
27551 3 will see if I need it 
27552 4 Go seemless or go home. I switched from canvas this and wow. Editing is a breeze now, and if there is a mess tear off the sheet and pull more down. 
27553 0 Useless if you d like to shoot anything at a down angle. Works ok straight on, but if you attach it to something and point it down at an angle, the top just starts drooping down. It can t hold the position. So, kinda pointless.... 
27554 4 The batteries are working great. 
27555 4 works great 
27556 0 Does not work looks very odd way 2 big took forever to come. 
27557 4 I needed the battery charger and it was a much better price than what was at a local store. I was pleasantly surprised to receive so much more than just the charger. 
27558 4 Great camera! 
27559 4 It was a great addition to my go pro! very easy to use! 
27560 4 Plastic fantastic. 
27561 4 Nice to have a bunch of these lying around. In the desk, in the backpack, in the car, with my sunglasses. Keep our screens and glasses clean without scratching! 
27562 4 Good 
27563 3 Easy to use. Did a good job of converting 35mm slides to digital. 
27564 0 The camera filled up with water 5 minutes into the snorkel trip. 
27565 2 My tapes get stuck in the door while trying to remove them. Have to jiggle them vigorously, then they can be removed. 
27566 4 Works perefext. 
27567 4 Thank you, it was exactly what I needed. 
27568 4 aaaaa 
27569 4 This camera is great! It s sooo cool and cute. And really easy to operate. The directions and manual answer almost ever question you could have. I LOVE it!! 
27570 4 nice product 
27571 4 Brilliant!!! Great customer support...completely intuitive to use. 
27572 4 simple to use with great outcomes 
27573 4 very good 
27574 0 Product is not compatible with Polaroid Zip Printer. I only get &#34;Paper Mismatch&#34; error. 
27575 0 I flew great then about the 5th flight it broke. Took it to hobby show they said it came with a burnt out motor. 
27576 4 Very nice set for the price. I am new to digital photography, and these filters are very helpful. They arrived in good condition, well-packaged, and I am pleased with the purchase. 
27577 4 Great item! 
27578 4 Amazing lens!! Very good quality and it s affordable! 
27579 4 incredible camera. 
27580 4 Love the bag but would like a little more room 
27581 2 It works, but there is no real way to get it tight because of the elastic. It bounces mad moves a lot if you have it set on the top mount making the video almost unusable. 
27582 4 This is an excellent clip. It stayed on my backpack shoulder strap was easy to adjust and went all over Europe shooting video constantly. 
27583 4 Got this a deal of the day for a great price. Its one of the best sling bags I have used. 
27584 3 Very durable product. Withstands a great deal of intensity using the product. 
27585 2 I want to love these, they are good, but if anything knocks them over, the umbrella boning bends so easy! My other issue is if you can t attach a reciever and use the umbrellas. I had to buy a new attachment that allows me to use it. 
27586 4 Great little-power house of a camera. Looking to add other glass on the camera. 
27587 4 Works great, love it! 
27588 3 Good resolution 
27589 4 All good. Thanks! 
27590 1 Only after using it once, the battery door broke. 
27591 4 Love it 
27592 4 Excellent! 
27593 4 great compact bag you will appreciate during travel 
27594 4 When used with various Lowepro bags and their utility belt, this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
27595 0 The Internal Foam is not useful. Size doesn t fit the GoPro well. 
27596 3 The item was delivered earlier than expected. The quality of the product isn t the greatest but works as expected. 
27597 4 I was very satisfied to see that this replacement was exactly the same as the one I lost. 
27598 4 it came with everything promised and it works great 
27599 0 The filters have internal mounting treads and are for a Polaroid. They will not work. My Minolta AF200M Zoom 28 - 100 needs filters with external treads, 55mm for may D7 Maxxum; which is what I ordered for. I will never us Amazon again for my photographic needs... 
27600 4 This item was exactly what I needed and came right on time. It arrived the day before my trip, which couldn t have been more perfect. -TD These are The Last Days of Dark. 
27601 4 simply amazing. not the best in low light. but when it performs it is the best in it s class. 
27602 3 Great product for price. Easy installation easy to save data 
27603 4 Excellent quality for price 
27604 4 Just What I Needed. 
27605 2 Hard to use and didn t work for what I needed it to do. Not good unless you are working outside in wide open environments. 
27606 4 Excellent! 
27607 4 techhelpla.com approved 
27608 4 Good 
27609 3 This glasses is good I love it 
27610 4 I use this all the time. My Go Pro is always hooked to this! 
27611 4 I like the fact that it tightens well and doesn t move from your desired setting. Lots of applications and options with this. I will buy a few more. 
27612 3 No disappointments. It does exactly what the product description says it does. The only consideration is that it is, as advertised, &#34;light weight&#34;. As long as you handle it with attention that doesn t seem to be a problem. It s certainly worth the price. 
27613 2 The batteries get hot. Not so good 
27614 4 Bought for the wife and she loves it. 
27615 3 I haven t used it much yet but it doesn t seem to polarize as much as I hoped for. 
27616 4 I am soooo happy to get this and it works wonders, Thank You! 
27617 4 Very good product. Good price especially compared to the Nikon model. Fast delivery. 
27618 0 Flimsy. Can t hold my Canon 6d. 
27619 4 Perfect fit to Yi Sport. Charges quite fast. Haven t check how long it lasts but will update the review once done. 
27620 2 Some different precut compartments than shown in the picture. As a newbie not vital for me, as I m trying to figure out what I need/want, but if you re buying this for exactly what s shown, you may end up returning it. 
27621 4 Nice set! Everything here is usable and quality product. I would have liked a better case to store it all in together. Glad to see such a combo set available. 
27622 4 Good 
27623 4 Works like it suppose to! 
27624 3 Compared to the pricier monopods like Manrottos, this one seems a good bit smaller in size, which might be good. It s sturdy enough, and great for the cost. 
27625 0 It is a great bag, but way too small for any dslr camera and lens kit. I should have listened to the other reviewers. Now I am stuck with it or buy a bigger bag and lose the money I spent on it 
27626 4 Works as expected 
27627 0 1 star because 0 is not an option. This is not compatible with a sony A230 
27628 3 The product is good, but does not fit in my speedlight. I´ve just bought because of recomendations who bought together. 
27629 4 Easy to install and use. The longest part was the camera installation. ..running the wires through the attic and into the On Q panel. 
27630 4 really nice I got it to use for police harassment that s right!!! I recommend it for anyone who is being harassed imagine for the people who are supposed to protect you. But sadly its the truth. God help this new America. 
27631 4 Nice little case that goes well with my new Nikon mirrorless camera. 
27632 0 This thing will only provide power to the camcorder. It will NOT charge the battery. The red light blinks as if the battery were being charged, but it s visual trickery ! No charge in the battery, regardless of how many hours it is left plugged into the wall. 
27633 4 Worked great. No leaks. 
27634 3 Good 
27635 4 I love this background. Great for packing, stretches well and for this reason no wrinkles. Recommended. 
27636 4 Works exactly as described. Somewhat slow on auto focus, but other reviews mention that. Very pleased for the price 
27637 4 Good quality, simple product, easy to use. Does the job well, no setup involved. 
27638 0 The photos appear too light. I tried several times to adjust the setting, however; the photos still remain too light. The same photos were installed on another name brand, and they look beautiful. My wife and I are not happy with our Micca purchase. 
27639 4 Great charger at a good price 
27640 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
27641 4 Works 
27642 4 It s super gucci i love it it makes my pictures look gr8 
27643 1 Uncomfortable to use... 
27644 2 work great. 
27645 4 works great thanks 
27646 4 Just Great! 
27647 0 It was horrible and does not work. The film turns blue.... Do not purchase this film. 
27648 4 Great extension to my cannon camera. 
27649 4 These little inexpensive triggers work killer. Great purchase. Will be buying a couple more 
27650 1 Could not get it to work on iPhone or ipad 
27651 0 The insert for the pole was no issue. The problem was that it was somewhat transparent and I had a client ask me if it was a sheet from my bed. Not professional. 
27652 2 Very lightweight and easily tilts over...overall a good value tho...lightweight and decent quality 
27653 3 Works good. 
27654 4 Just what I needed for my new Nikon D7100 
27655 4 Camera is just as described and works fine 
27656 4 Excellent 
27657 3 Camera mounts are standard 1/4-20. I use the suction mount on my kayak (with safety line), plenty of holding power so far. the helmet camera straps are basically useless, I had to replace them with the pull to tighten kind. Everything is great otherwise 
27658 4 This drone was outstanding! I could preform flips and fly very high. The drone does not handle wind very well, and is currently stuck in a tree. 
27659 4 It s great I bought this for mountain biking and it has held up through many bumps and some crashes and records great and stays tight. 
27660 4 Great price for quality videos. Easy to use. On time delivery. 
27661 4 Love it 
27662 4 Works great, and the extra dry storage is a bonus. 
27663 4 Glad you offer this plan. 
27664 1 Materials expected to feel better 
27665 4 Very adjustable. Easily get a perfect and comfortable fit. Mountain biking videos are much more interesting from this perspective vs. a handlebar mount. For $13, this is an absolute steal. Quality is very good. Stop looking and just buy this now. You won t regret it. 
27666 4 Good condition! 
27667 0 This filter was delivered SCRATCHED. Not just slightly scratched--it looked as if it had been scraped along concrete. Not exactly what you want to put on the end of your camera lens. THE WORST product I ve ever purchased online. 
27668 4 Good buy 
27669 4 Excellent for the money 
27670 4 Have never had a problem with Hoya. It works as it should. 
27671 4 Worked great! Used it for whitewater and climbing! Adjustable and Seems to have more adjustability than the gopro brand chesty mount. Love the blue also, makes it pop! 
27672 4 I hope not use it. but none one knows it. 
27673 4 YAAASSSS 
27674 4 This is a heavy duty case great for demos! 
27675 0 Worth the price. Maybe 
27676 4 These are nice 
27677 4 This was just what they say it is. I like this because it blocks the sun from hitting the camera so that you can see the shot a whole lot better. Great when shooting from a tripod. I love it.... 
27678 4 Great experience with purchase and a great camera. 
27679 4 I like it. seems sturdy, easy to use, bluethooth connect intantly. will recommend this product to a friend. 
27680 0 This was the recommended size. It did not fit my lens 
27681 3 good .works but a little too heavy 
27682 4 Excellent product for the price. 
27683 4 Delivered on time and fit my camcorder just fine. 
27684 4 I absolutely love this camera! It came with a handy strap and color of the item was true to description. Item was brand new and packaged really well. It takes great shots however just be aware that there s only 10 film per cartridge (not included in purchase). 
27685 4 Excellent product 
27686 1 Extremely small and lightweight das good. However, it pops off its rotating ball far too easy and does not support the weight of a point and shoot camera. Also what if this &#34;free gift?&#34; There was no free gift. Does the plastic bag count? 
27687 4 Great product! 
27688 4 Perfect, during night has a good view 
27689 4 Good adapter 
27690 4 Good! 
27691 2 Simple, plain, to the point, fast 
27692 4 Nice product so far. I ve been having it for a week now and I have no problem with it. 
27693 4 excellent very pleased 
27694 3 Not a bad purchase. It is a bit light and I wish the lens were thicker. 
27695 3 But now it don t work ! 
27696 4 Very nice. We got them to clean DVDs but staff all wanted one for their glasses, too! 
27697 3 Everything worked perfectly 
27698 4 Great filter... 
27699 4 Works great. Love having the extra power. 
27700 3 looks very good outside! very real 
27701 4 I matched this mount with a gorilla-pod tripod holder, and it works great not only for holding photographs, but for holding phones on headrests for in-car video. 
27702 4 Great item 
27703 4 This kit is exactly what I was looking for and needed. Set-up is easy. I know I ll get a lot of use out of this product. Should this not be durable, I ll be sure and let you know. Thanks! 
27704 3 Good for the price. 
27705 4 Bought his for my Canon Tebel T3i Does what it s supposed to! What else do you want? Charges perfectly, no issues. LED light indicates when charging is done. It s compact, no wires. Pins flip out to plug into socket. Very happy with my purchase. 
27706 4 This bag is the perfect size, not too small but super lightweight and easy to carry all your stuff in. 
27707 4 NICE product 
27708 4 Great product. Better than all other baby specific monitors. Will buy again. 
27709 4 IT S the best very BRIGHT strobe flash. 
27710 1 Very average photo s phone in a bag is better 
27711 4 Well made. Does what it s supposed to do, and will last. 
27712 4 Fantastic camera. Cannot tell you anything about the vide as I am a photographer and did not get this camera for video. 
27713 1 Nowhere near as large as described. I returned it since I could not get the gear stashed that was described. 
27714 4 Charger works great, and will definitely purchase another one in the near future. 
27715 4 Very good!! 
27716 3 Works well for the moon. 
27717 3 light, portable, works great 
27718 3 Takes a bit of trial and error adjusting the setting, and maybe a few film sacrifices. Other than that great camera. 
27719 2 The cameras have great video when connected directly to the NVR... unfortunately we could not get them to work wirelessly with my existing wireless network. Tech support responded but could not follow their instructions. The manufacture needs to provide a LOT better and understandable instructions. 
27720 4 great value 
27721 4 Richard 
27722 4 They really look like active cameras. 
27723 0 Could not get this to work with my Canon T5i. Sent it back for canon model. 
27724 4 a 
27725 4 great camera for the money 
27726 3 nice but not very durable 
27727 4 Can t beat the performance for the price. 
27728 4 Awesome lights 
27729 4 This is one of the best deals for this product! 
27730 4 Easy to install and look real. 
27731 4 I love this bag! So happy I bought it!. Its nice and big and I love the color. Great buy! 
27732 3 Lasts longer and charges faster than OEM battery. Using with a Sony AS-100V action cam. Update 5/30/2016: Do not leave the charger or car adapter in direct sunlight. It will straight up melt. If you leave it in your car cover it up with something. 
27733 4 Simple but nice product 
27734 4 A camera made for dummies like me. I love the zoom feature. And I like not having to carry a supply of batteries with me. 
27735 4 It s film and it works. What else can I say? 
27736 3 Great product and works like a charm.. 
27737 4 got a couple of these, i don t know if it deterred and burglar but so far no break in yet. 
27738 3 Does not last as long as I thought it would. 
27739 4 I have taken more pictures and not have to watch my batteries...Ready for my curse. 
27740 4 As Described, recommend 
27741 4 This strap works well with the camera I have. 
27742 3 easy to set up. 
27743 4 I m a beginner, very happy with this stabilizer. It took me minutes to balance it 
27744 4 I love it and wish I still had it. I had to through it away because the top fell off while I was running away from a lightning storm. Anyway, it was great but not durable but I didn t expect it to be for that price. 
27745 4 I really like this camera. It takes really nice pictures, including panoramic and other features. Only complaint is it goes through a lot of batteries. I suggest getting rechargeable batteries if you buy this camera. 
27746 4 I lost my lens cap. This one works. Not a whole lot to say about it. 
27747 4 Fits my DJI phantom 3 pro camera like a glove. Easy and quick to install. Not ackward and cumbersome as the camera stabilizer that came with the phantom. 
27748 4 As advertised; delivery on time. 
27749 4 Fit perfectly and great price.Could not find locally. Was glad to find on Amazon 
27750 0 doesnt fit my sony alpha. not sure what ass backwards connection i was given. dont waste your time! 
27751 4 Excellent !! 
27752 4 Good Price. Works as expected. 
27753 3 What is there to say? .... It seems sturdy for an important modern need. 
27754 4 Great flash bracket, simple an reliable. I will probably replace some of the knobs with something all metal and then these will be as good as expensive manfrotto brackets. 
27755 0 As soon as it arrived I opened it and it was completely scratched on both ends I don t know if they don t put much effort into making these or if I got a used one. Totally dissatisfied 
27756 1 too flimsy, needs to be stiffer 
27757 4 Works perfect! 
27758 3 Good product, but the resolution could be better. 
27759 0 It never worked. I should have sent it back. 
27760 4 Amazing 
27761 4 Simple to use and with the included pocket on the gel holder, the gels will not get lost and last a long time. It s also easy to cut your own gels out of material found at Office Depot. The gel holder fits perfectly. 
27762 4 This works great for taking photos for my online store. The light does suck up batteries so be prepared with some extras. 
27763 4 Happy to have the extra protection. 
27764 4 Works great! 
27765 1 Bad ball head for heavier cameras. 
27766 2 high priced for a dolly that barely holds up my dslr. Next time I will shop around. 
27767 4 nice 
27768 3 This is a nice case. Its vintage and can be used for more than just your camera. 
27769 4 Works as stated. 
27770 4 Excelent. 
27771 4 Captures stunning video. This is my first GoPro so I m still figuring stuff out, but man is this thing fun to play with. Easy to take ANYWHERE and capture most anything you do. Touch screen is a nice, new feature. 
27772 4 Really great picture and package, especially for the price. Took it under water just fine, love it. 
27773 0 Not very liked. It doesn t allow for quick access to the camera and you can t take a quick photo. Protects very well though. 
27774 4 Product quickly re-charged my camera & the extra cleaning kit had everything I needed to take care of my equipment. Thanks you. 
27775 4 I am so happy I bought this, I used it for the first time and it was wonderful. So easy to change the screens. the size is also nice and can be used as a backdrop. 
27776 4 Excellent product. A+++++ 
27777 4 It s a more comfortable alternative to cheap cord straps. It rides about mid-chest on me, which is what I like because whatever is on it doesn t swish around as much when it s mounted higher. 
27778 4 Good Deal! 
27779 4 Awesome original part, in oem package and from slicktron rc, got it first class mail in 2 days, wish I had know would have ordered all parts from them! 
27780 4 works great! 
27781 4 MagicFiber works great for me so far. No lint or fiber material left on the surface of my sunglasses or laptop screen during or after cleaning. I use one of the oversize MagicFiber sheets to polish and wax my guns. 
27782 4 Great product and Service. Walter in support was very helpful in setting up my remote access 
27783 0 Poor quality, and not costly for what is delivered. Poor quality eyepiece optic focal adjustment. 
27784 4 fits fine 
27785 4 Excelent and original piece for my old Minolta 100-300 mm Xi lens!!! 
27786 4 Love it! 
27787 4 simple and easy to use 
27788 4 Absolutely perfect for my needs. 
27789 1 Connections drop when used for a while, battery seems to go dead but actually experincing loose connections 
27790 1 There was no way to choose the color I wanted. I ended up getting gray and white even though the orange was displayed. 
27791 0 I bought this one little a year ago and now it is dead. 
27792 2 It s ok!!!! 
27793 3 Works great. Easy to use and easy to transfer photos to computer. 
27794 4 Works great and easy to set up is you re familiar with CCTV DVR S. 
27795 2 not as cool as i spect 
27796 4 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
27797 4 Smooth transaction. Fast shipping. A+++. Thanks!!! 
27798 4 I ordered this item and I must I say I love the design of it as well as the construction. Definitely well built and durable all the way around. I will be combining with other accessories such as the vest and belt but so far its working great!! 
27799 4 Came with a few extra little things that I can hang my pictures with, and a nice little note. Very lovely people! 
27800 3 The pics are clear and it has plenty of options. I was a little disappointed but 360 view in a half sphere is pretty neat. It s a fun little toy. 
27801 2 pretty cheap and ugly but works ok 
27802 3 works 
27803 4 I like having extra batteries on hand for my camera and the fact that this was a 2-pack was better yet! 
27804 4 I love this bag! Perfect size for the camera and everything that goes with it! Received on time and in great condition! 
27805 4 Works better then the original battery. I purchased six of them. So Happy. 
27806 2 I needed it for a micro sized projector.. It works but not without some effort 
27807 1 Works ok for family stuff, but not reliable enough for professional work. It s freezes my camera now and then and the only way to fix it is to take the camera battery out. 
27808 3 Looks good. Have not used it yet. I does not have any decals. 
27809 4 Light and very adjustable. Nice to have the level bubble. 
27810 4 Converting to a monopod the 1st time was a little tricky but I got it to work. Product is exactly what I wanted and is a nice size so I can travel with it and set it up quickly. 
27811 0 Item arrived broken. I was required to pay for the shipping back. 
27812 4 Love these flashes. I use them with the Yungnuo 560 triggers and I couldn t be happier. 
27813 2 Takes a nice picture, but has awful focusing issues. 
27814 4 Very nice product lasts longer than the one provided by Nikon 
27815 4 Good product has a rubber liner on he inside that works great 
27816 3 Works for my wife, price is good, thanks! 
27817 4 Very Good 
27818 0 Received the case and it fits the Samsung camera quite well. This case is going back as it s not made of leather at all. If you want a plastic case buy this one. 
27819 4 High quality images using my Canon 70D. Incredible sharpness. High quality construction, feels very solid, great feel to the focus and aperture rings (fully manual) beautiful appearance as well (love the giant front element). 
27820 0 My experience with this item was not good, as the performance was way below expectation. 
27821 4 Cute and quaint. A role of film is about 20$. 
27822 0 Neither device would trigger the flash no matter what setting the camera was set on. 
27823 4 Excellent looks very real 
27824 4 Geat replacement screen. Will look great once i put it on my old gameboy color. Great product. A++ seller 
27825 4 Works great, and at a great price! 
27826 4 Such a great camera for beginners especially! Easy to use while still producing quality photos and videos. 
27827 4 Looks real enoughat a distance. 
27828 4 Simply awesome. Charges my 18650 batteries very quickly. 
27829 3 This did exactly what it said it would do, and seems to be pretty solid construction. It doesn t feel like a lightweight piece of junk. Some things like this feel like really cheap plastic, but this one does not. 
27830 4 Works perfect it was a gift for my girlfriends mom and she loves it takes it fishing camping to the beach always gets it wet and it does perfectly fine 
27831 4 Great battery. I bought two extra ones when I purchased the Q500+ which gave me four batteries and ensures me at least 1-3/4 hours of flight time on breezy days and up to 2-1/4 hours on calm days. 
27832 4 Nice items. Just as spected 
27833 3 just what i expected. and it is simple to use 
27834 3 Works great! But I would recommend getting a better GoPro pole. But 1 problem I always open the case upside down:) so you need to mark the top. 
27835 4 These work pretty good. I use the smaller ones for my old binoculars and one of the bigger ones for my range scope and they fit and fold down just fine. Easy to stretch and fit! 
27836 4 The battery works great,also I m using it in my battery grip for my d60 Nikon and it works flawless 
27837 2 The rings seems to be dropping colors on the box itself. Not sure will it drop further? 
27838 3 Great mount and allows me to position the camera in a multitude of ways with ease. Deducting one star because the one I received was only able to go side to side, not the side to side and front to back as pictured. 
27839 4 Very nice bag, it works perfectly with my Zipshot MINI. Please note it will not fit the larger Zipshot tripods. 
27840 2 The moving(swivel parts) make the camera rattle around to much. 
27841 4 Excelente 
27842 3 Great 
27843 3 all good ingredients. very help first. 
27844 4 I got my moneys worth,keepup the good work. 
27845 3 Had to return the first one due to communication problems between the remote and the drone. They promptly sent me a new one. I was pleased with that. Other than a few technical glitches, I am enjoying the DJI Phantom 3. 
27846 2 camera is great, accessories not that good 
27847 4 Perfect for a new YouTuber like myself! 
27848 2 it is okay and good 
27849 4 Great quality. 
27850 4 !!!!**** Fits the Fujinon XT17 x 4.5BRMK14 lens for a Panasonic HPX 370 
27851 4 Good 
27852 0 Where are all these 5 stars coming from? These cloths leave more lint behind that what they remove! Or I must be extremly picky but Im not happy. Others work better do more research. 
27853 4 Performs as presented ,great camera for long trips. 
27854 4 Inexpensive and lets me keep my go pro going all day at the track. 
27855 1 Everything was shipped and came on time, but the quality of the items were horrible. Everything that had to do with the lens (hood and attachments) did not fit the camera at all. The tripod is cheap quality as well. I am pretty disappointed by the turnout. 
27856 3 Easy and fun camera to use for the price. 
27857 3 great for the price. 
27858 4 Cheap, works as expected 
27859 3 works better than I thought it would. Beats paying hundreds for a Coolscan. 
27860 4 Great product and the quality of the pi8ctures are great 
27861 3 Good 
27862 4 Nice camera! 
27863 4 No instructions but easy to figure out. Great product, great shipping. 
27864 3 It is OK, but I am not blown away with the quality. I guess you get what you pay for. The shoulder holder is definitely not the best part on this rig. 31/2 star. 
27865 4 Great, works as anticipated.. Only wish it were a tad cheaper. 
27866 4 Good product, works great. Like the separate packaging, Threw a couple in each glove box for my glasses. 
27867 4 Used this on an adventure course near Lake George. Worked great. Was worried it would stay on throughout the rough course. The little grippies worked fine. Glad I purchased this 
27868 4 COOL!! 
27869 3 nice light...at a very inexpensive price...you get what you pay for though...the stands are cheap...and the light hoods don t collapse for easy travel. But still a lot for a little. 
27870 3 Well made and strong, sturdy but unfortunately the shape of the handle bars prevent it from fitting good so cant see the phone but still a good product. 
27871 4 Great Cameras... Best for reliability if you need to do remote monitoring of your house. 
27872 4 Great case! 
27873 3 Great way to organize the stuff I have for the pelican case. 
27874 4 Arrived on time as described. I installed it and had my alarm system back up and running. 
27875 4 This item was a gift for my daughter. She said to give this a 5 star rating ! Very pleased ! 
27876 2 It s a little heavier than the one I have at home. You can only use this MANUALLY. Other than that, I thought it was okay. Add in a diffuser, and you re good to go. 
27877 4 This worked our perfect for my T3i!! 
27878 3 I am very pleased with the product and the service. 
27879 4 It is a lot of fun for the money. 
27880 4 Love this lens, clear pics and f/2.8 makes it great in low light! 
27881 4 Yes! I used this to go on ZIPLINE with a video camera. I used both straps connected to one camera for certainty of control. Worked Great! I removed one of the Metal screw on camera bases, and just used the lockable hook of one of the straps. 
27882 2 It was great until the waterproof aspect failed and we had no luck getting a warranty replacement, as &#34;Kodak&#34; does not really make this product. 
27883 4 I love it!!!! 
27884 4 Will keep your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake or ocean. Worth the price for peace of mind. 
27885 4 I ve had this camera for a long time and have never had a problem with it. Great purchase 
27886 4 Pretty nice lens for the money......you have to run it in manual mode but once you play around with f stops and shutter it s pretty nice. It even took nice pictures of the moon. Very satisfied 
27887 4 Very Good Tripod for price! 
27888 0 You would think this would be a no-brainer, but despite following the poorly-translated directions, I haven t been able to make it work yet. I think its simply defective. 
27889 4 Great training drone, easy to fly. Small enough for indoor use. It can really take a beating. You will need additional batteries for a good flying experience, the batteries last 7-10 minutes per charge. 
27890 4 Puts light right where you need it... 
27891 1 No comment. 
27892 4 amazing customer support, excellent product at a great price! Support from AR004216 was incredible! 
27893 3 Accessories are great. I had hoped the case had a permanent insert designed for the Go-Pro but it was just a foam insert that falls out and slides around too easily. Still a great deal. 
27894 3 Fits phone. Arrived promptly. Only difference is my original one had foam and was slightly more comfortable. 
27895 0 I ve owned this product for a little more than 6 months and used it for roughly 10 shoots: It has been finicky for the last two shoots, causing one to be cut short, and has now stopped working all together. Don t waste your money on this garbage. 
27896 1 Question: I have taken pictures inside and outside, close and far away, most come out blurry. It has the smart auto and smart flash settings on. I am not knowledgeable about cameras which is why i bought one with the auto features. Am i doing something obviously wrong? 
27897 2 could do without the rubber in the middle of the view finder 
27898 3 Nice, rugged little bag. Tight fit for my Canon PowerShot D30, but OK. Would hesitate to put more stuff in the bag, such as SD cards or cables. Several options to carry: neck/shoulder/wrist strap or belt clip. 
27899 4 This tripod mount works really well. Would have benefited from instructions on how to put it together but I eventually figured it out. 
27900 4 Really don t think you can find a better tripod for cheaper! Bought it (and a binocular adapter) for use with my astronomy binoculars and I couldn t be more pleased. 
27901 4 Great professional stuff. 25+ years in the alarm business, but don t do it for a living anymore. I swear by it, 
27902 4 Wow! This is one of the cutest and best deals. You get everything in the picture and they re all super cute. Can t wait to use it. Packaging was nice and arrived sooner than I thought. I highly recommend this deal. :D 
27903 4 I bought this product for some tabletop product photography. I needed a white, seamless background and diffuse light. This product worked great, especially for the price! I paid $20 and would happily do so again. 
27904 4 The camera was exactly as promised and i have loved it immensely. It was a good price for the camera, and it has been rewarding to me. 
27905 3 Great deal. Far exceeded my expectations. Great starter if you re really interested in photography. 
27906 4 Excellent product , really improves vision in bright sunlight. 
27907 4 Does the job. Great price. No issues here! 
27908 0 No life at all. Went dead with in an hour of use... 
27909 4 Awesome 
27910 4 Works as advertised 
27911 2 Just stopped working 
27912 3 This is not the described pink I was expecting. Although the color is more a salmon/coral shade, it is OK. 
27913 4 The camera is excellent, and the package included tons of things that made a great choice. 
27914 4 The camera is long gone, but the case is indispensable. 
27915 2 Like the camera, once I got it set up. It however took me 10 hours to set up a website and set up router. I am not tech say, had to watch YouTube to get it done. 
27916 4 It is affordable and works as intended. Might need a bath when you first get it, but not a big deal. I would order it again. 
27917 4 It works as it should. 
27918 2 It takes wonderful photos. Frustrated that I can t get the movie button to work (that means no shooting video). 
27919 4 One of the best camera bags I have ever owned :) 
27920 4 Well made, easy to use 
27921 3 works very well 
27922 2 Works well if you know what to do with it....LOL so really cant say. But looks nice and installs easly. 
27923 4 lots of storage 
27924 4 Great thanks🌸🌸🌸 
27925 4 RECEIVED IN SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WOULD RECOMMENED 
27926 4 I filled mine with heavy cat litter inserted into ziplock bags first. 3-6 pounds on each side does the job. 
27927 4 ♡ 
27928 4 Love it. Very easy. 
27929 3 All parts were in orders. Nice small camera for travel. Easy installation and download. 
27930 4 A versatile lens with great glass. I use this lens for everything from portraits to landscapes and have no complaints about its performance. Only praise. On the pricey side, but you get results. 
27931 3 A little too small 
27932 4 great 
27933 4 Only thing wrong is it is a little wiggly but it stays close to zero all the time 
27934 4 Great quality, fast shipping. Performs as needed and appears to be of solid construction. The first float I had, the stitching came apart where the camera hooks to the float. A lot of good that does to save your camera from sinking.Float held my Nikon perfectly. 
27935 4 Thank you the batteries and charge, perfect for my camerar. It will give me additional time to take pictures. Now, I will need an SD card with extra storage. 
27936 4 I lost the original hot shoe cover on my Olympus OM-D E-M1 and purchased this as a replacement which fits perfectly. Since is made of rubber, it has not accidentally fallen off. 
27937 0 It was really great at first but one trip to the beach got it rusting pretty bad. 
27938 4 I was very surprised at how easy and simple it was to use. It keeps the great quality of pictures. 
27939 4 A nice kit for your DSLR. Filters really make a difference in the quality of your work, and also protect your lens at the same time. This is a very reasonably priced kit. 
27940 2 Firmware is not updating over internet.. Certain albums are not displaying. Is there an option to update software by USB or SD card?? 
27941 4 Works perfectly! Don t waste hundreds in an electronic viewer. This is actually better! 
27942 0 Would not work!! Would not connect!! We put it to the side and forgot to send it back!! Never used!! 
27943 4 Exactly fit! And very good quality and fast shipping! 
27944 2 I really don t know what to say, it came in and the part that you screw on to the mono-pod was broken, never did get any answer back from vendor, but it gets you out there to the subject your trying to get a pic of.... 
27945 4 Works great. Cheap enough I bought several. 
27946 0 I was hoping to soften my image a bit, but this just blurs beyond recognition like an 1980s mall photographer. Also its coming from Hong Kong so too forever to get here. 
27947 4 Love this Magnifying Loupe. Had been thinking of buying it for a long time and finally saw a price I could afford. The transaction was easy peasy and the seller was great...no issues....def recommend both this seller and the item. 
27948 3 good 
27949 4 Excelent cam !! 
27950 4 Spot on! 
27951 3 does what is expected, good product. 
27952 2 Neat little softbox for the price. Nothing incredibly but definitely better than using the naked flash. 
27953 3 Works great for everyday photos 
27954 4 Small, adjustable, great picture and sound. Built in microphone has good range and helps eliminate cable clutter. Easy to disconnect to avoid hackers who would use your camera to spy on you. 
27955 3 Have only used one of the batteries, but for one cycle it seemed to match the performance level of the Canon battery. 
27956 4 Is exactly as stated and works great. 
27957 3 Outstanding little camera system with many features. A great value for all you get. Mobile viewing was very easy to set up and the picture quality is good. Too many walls will shorten the distance of reception however the system is outstanding in all. 
27958 4 Does what it says and now I don t have to buy separate filters and hoods for different size lenses! 
27959 4 very good I love it. 
27960 1 Not what I tought it would be 
27961 4 great price 
27962 4 I bought these small binoculars for my Sister who likes to watch birds from her kitchen table! She said they work perfect! She uses them every day! 
27963 3 A+ 
27964 4 yes just what i needed 
27965 3 Great little camera and DVR system, very easy to set up. 
27966 4 Fits the GoPro well! 
27967 4 Makes a big difference in the overall appearance of the camera. It works very well and cost a fraction of the Canon battery grip. 
27968 4 As described and good quality case. 
27969 4 Everything it was said to be! 
27970 4 I combined this with http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00VV7JMSC/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pC_nS_ttl?_encoding=UTF8&colid=1OABL0D3PBHIE&coliid=IGQJXE3GB584V for a wonderfully complete kit for under $100. The only thing I need now is a quadcopter... ;) 
27971 4 Perfect fit for my Pentax K50 And all the little things to hit the trails 
27972 2 The material is quite good but the smell of the leather is so strong ... this makes me feel uncomfortable. 
27973 4 Good tool 
27974 4 Best BIG umbrella i ve ever used, and the quality of the rods and fabric are well above average. The parabolic dome shape makes a big difference in light control. I threw a 7 Impact diffuser on it to soften the flash even more. Looking forward to shooting this weekend. 
27975 4 sturdy and easy to adjust 
27976 4 A must have for humid climates. 
27977 4 works great 
27978 4 im happy i will put sam pic or video later 
27979 4 Great case, perfectly fit my needs and priced right too. Arrived on time. 
27980 4 Solid construction. Packaged well. Performs as advertised. 
27981 4 Same charger that Canon ships with the camera. Lost mine. Canon wanted 50 bucks for the replacement charger. nuff said. 
27982 4 good 
27983 2 Beautiful strap BUT you better have a small hand. Difficult to get my hand through the loop and I don t have especially large hands. It s a 5 inch loop, needs to be 6 inches. 
27984 0 Just received my gopro today and no sd card but i choose the package with sd card :(((((( 
27985 4 good product 
27986 4 I love this. I was expecting something smaller and it s huge! You definitely need to have a place for this telescope. It is a very sturdy telescope. I haven t gotten to use it yet but can t wait 
27987 4 Excellent!! 
27988 2 The lens is amazing! BUT, I just bought this specific package because the lens hood like in the photo. When I opened I was very annoyed as they are not as described. HOW CAN WE SOLVE THIS PROBLEM??? 
27989 0 camera record in AVI only which is not compatible with 90% of the devices out there. I recommend buying the Wi-Fi version if you would like to actually see your videos. 
27990 3 Works well as a basic, every day lens and fits my close up lens set for use in flower photography. Nice addition to my camera bag. 
27991 2 works as described 
27992 0 My first review was rejected because it was very emotional, well, I will say easier, the device does not work as claimed, I did everything according to the instructions spent more than 3 hours making the one and same action and the result is zero does not work! 
27993 4 just what I wanted, real nice screen to see 
27994 4 My camera and all my lenses fit beautifully in this case. I love the fact that I can just grab it and go. 
27995 2 for the money ok but lots of plastic will fatigue ecome britle and break over time Im sure. More cheap junk from China. 
27996 4 Great for low light and quick photos. We use it take photos inside mostly and it works wonderfully. With just the little bit of light that makes it into the room from outside, we are able to take fantastic photos that look like they were taken with great lighting. 
27997 4 Def awesome does it all 
27998 4 They work great with both my 60d and the 70d. 
27999 0 Broke after one month. Need to return for one that works but is past return period. Motor just clicks but does not move. 
28000 4 Works great! 
28001 4 Exactly what I was looking for 
28002 4 Cannot beat the price on this and goes with my little vintage style polaroid perfectly! 
28003 4 ok 
28004 1 One battery was ok, but the other looked 20 years old. So swollen, it wouldn t fit in the compartment. 
28005 3 Love it! The retractable design makes it easy to carry. The brush is soft and it does the job very well. You must have one if you love your camera lens. 
28006 4 The lens hood work effectively and fits the lens correctly. 
28007 0 Product was useless, and the installation took almost an hour with cable Internet, as fast as it could be, I am still not able to set this camera, the My D-link was pain to find the product. 
28008 4 Please read comment By jnunniv on April 23, 2015. He is 100% correct. I followed his advice and, just as he said it would, it &#34;works like a charm.&#34; 
28009 4 ok 
28010 4 Soft, Gel-feel that you can keep on for hours. Camo is a plus too 
28011 4 So far so good 
28012 3 Worth the money. Don t see much difference I m GoPro brand with length of battery life 
28013 4 great 
28014 4 Fast shipping, great price! 
28015 4 Good Stuff 
28016 3 It does the job it s supposed to do. 
28017 4 [[VIDEOID:6cdee2e305bf59b79ec48101e10270a9]] I have reviewed the Ambient Weather BC-3000 intelligent battery charger and highly recommend the product if you are looking for an all in one battery charger for your home or business. 
28018 4 This is the greatest drone ever. It takes great pictures and videos. I am very happy with its easiness to fly. Definitely an A+ rating. 
28019 0 My cell phone takes better pictures, and my cell phone takes awful pictures. 
28020 1 With 1) a sensor battery life of only 6 months, compared to a Honeywell system of 3 years, 2) No-one that wants to monitor the system. makes this system not very realistic for an alarm system. Spend a little more money and buy a real system. 
28021 4 remarkable range and reach that most users will come to love. The main reason why I fell in love with it. 
28022 4 Like the way it brings out the blue of the sky. Awesome Poduct. 
28023 1 Only half of the picture was color. The other half was black. So much for &#34;rainbow&#34;. This was a birthday gift for my girlfriend... never been so disappointed. 
28024 4 Cute film, awesome colors. 
28025 4 perfect 
28026 3 little small but really protects lens 
28027 4 Very impressed with the clarity and quality of this film. Looks as good as digital but with the character of film... Nuff said ;-) 
28028 0 WASTE OF MONEY! 
28029 3 The quality of the video is fantastic. The microphone for sound is very sensitive to wind noise making the audio during the ride completely useless. 
28030 4 all ok 
28031 3 Works great, decent video quality and easy to set up 
28032 2 Too heavy. 
28033 0 One of three arrived torn. Extra material on the back is great if you need a sun screen, but a pain in the tail to deal with. Likely will cut excess material off. Just not worth it. 
28034 4 worth the money for clarity 
28035 4 Exactly what I expected 
28036 4 Love it, just love it. Simple to install, connect & configure. 
28037 2 Worked as expected 
28038 4 I got the 720p , picture very clear, infare red cool, its like having alight on, visiability only around 30 ft at night. Set up was easy, the only real work is running cable, which has label s, so you can t mess up. we love it! 
28039 4 My Camera is amazing...Maybe a bit overpriced but nevertheless it was worth it. 
28040 1 It s made out of plastic,the unlock bottom is flimsy I m afraid it might get stuck in the long run. 
28041 4 Nice easy to fly toy quadcopter. Great for first timers - like the blue color, I have 3 white ones that I have flown to death. 
28042 4 Just what I was looking for 
28043 2 just so so,it is tiring to change the camera lens 
28044 4 Excelent 
28045 4 The camera was more than I expected. Pretty much brand new with instructions. Completely satisfied with my purchase and this seller. 
28046 4 The battery was the correct battery for my camera and is working fine. Walt 
28047 1 Takes forever to focus whenever you zoom in and the picture will often come out blurry even when it indicates it s focused. Constantly made loud static sounds in the background of videos. Returned it the same week. 
28048 3 Did what it supposed to do 
28049 4 These batteries work beautifully in my Canon EOS Rebel XS. They hold a charge as well as name brand. I got them so I would have plenty of backup batteries on hand and I am so very glad I did. I will definitely buy them again! 
28050 4 I am very happy with the product... Customer service at amazon is the best... Thank you. 
28051 4 usefull to put all the elements of your camera. easy to open and get everything you need 
28052 4 We love our new camera. It took amazing photos of our Smoky Mountain vacation! 
28053 3 We like this camera but it is not doing everything it is supposed to do. It looks like there is some software glitch along the way. 
28054 4 How could you not like these. Five reasons to say thank you. 
28055 1 I bought this based on some of the reviews, one of the review s was a video review and what I got was not the same thing in the review s. I returned it. Later I read some of the other folks had the same problem. 
28056 4 Great for extending cables without have to splice new ones in. 
28057 4 I miss read their ad, but they stepped up and helped me out. 
28058 4 Great product thank you. 
28059 4 Great service Calvin! Camera works well after help from support. They were very responsive. 
28060 3 great little webcam. 
28061 4 Love this backpack. It even has a nice compartment for my netbook. Thank you! 
28062 0 fake gopro product with bad quality cheaply made chinese goods 
28063 0 The video not clear. The sound is bad and nosy. The detect move notification is late. It is realy useless 
28064 4 seems to work well 
28065 4 The lens has it s limitations, but if you know what you are buying it for, it s a great lens for the price. I absolutely love it. 
28066 4 good strap arrived on time 
28067 0 never worked as described 
28068 1 did not work with my altura flash. no problem with refund. 
28069 3 Works as advertised, no issues! 
28070 4 Excelent Product, Use to carrier a Video Camera (Handycam). 
28071 4 fast shipping, as described. 
28072 2 it is a good product, it is too small, though. 
28073 3 fits well 
28074 4 I love this tripod. Its is very strong and has a lot of features. I strongly recommend it, you wont regret it. 
28075 4 Love them and they came on time!! 
28076 4 It is perfect. My identical camera had broken and this is completely like my old one. I love it and it was packaged beautifully 
28077 2 The orange tabs did break, I bought a bag of 24 clamps from Home Depot (various sizes) for a better value. 
28078 4 Holds my DSLR well and protects it 
28079 3 Great product--leads to fun memories. 
28080 4 Great set of filter. They truly add contrast and detail to photos. The case is really good quality as well. 
28081 4 Product as described!! 
28082 4 Excellent product. Multi-element achromatic design provides very high IQ compared to single element close up lenses. Adds flexibility to large aperture zoom or single focal length lenses. 
28083 4 This is a great value !! We love it Very sturdy and great quality 
28084 4 excellent 
28085 4 Amazing product definitely not a fake I highly recommend it. No problems with delivery or the product itself. Comes with a lot of accessories ! Love it ! 
28086 4 Better than original go pro batteries. 
28087 3 The first one I had was great, but i lost it. The second one for some reason the top keeps falling off. 
28088 4 delivered as advertised very reputible. 
28089 4 Better than Expected! 
28090 4 Ok 
28091 4 Amazing quality for such a small lens. I love it. 
28092 3 Auto focus does not work with my Sony, but it is not a big problem. This lens lets you get some really interesting shots and people are amazed. 
28093 4 Wow! I truly love this camera body protector. It was just what I needed for my new canon 6D camera. It fits like a glove and it s also very light weight. I truly recommend this product to anyone. Protect your high end purchased. 
28094 4 excellent! 
28095 4 excelent , no problem 
28096 4 Very good product though a little costly. 
28097 3 This was a gift.. Never asked how it went.. 
28098 4 It does what I needed it to do. 
28099 4 Great binoculars for the price. I would recommend using a tripod for astronomical viewing. 
28100 4 I have owned several of these for various camera models. I have even bought them as gifts. I have never been disappointed. 
28101 3 Great product, great details. Not very clear description. The product is not a touch screen. 
28102 4 I LOVE THIS CAMERA. Stepped up from a Rebel T3i (which I love and still use as a backup body). Love the speed and the low light ability. Great pro-sumer camera. Wifi addition is tremendous and allows me to use my iPhone as a remote. Love it. 
28103 3 so far it work good. the only issue is that it won t start recording automatically when power is inserted which is important as I keep forgetting to turn on. 
28104 1 It s too hard to get an item under it to see anything. Can t really use it for the reason I purchased it. 
28105 4 This perfectly fit my needs. Love it! 
28106 4 love it 
28107 4 My product arrived just in time for my trip. I was able to use the covers to protect my lens. I am very happy with them. 
28108 2 The quality isn t GREAT, but it does OK. 
28109 4 I m using these as weather cams on wunderground.com. They handle FTP posting well. Directions are clear and easy to understand. 
28110 4 Great lens, probably not quite as sharp as the Nikon 14-24 but getting really close. 
28111 4 love it. works great and the accesories have exceeded expectations. 
28112 2 Does NOT fit the updated versions! 
28113 0 not working. I followed the instructions and it wont work. 
28114 4 Perfect fit. Love it. 
28115 4 Loved it...wish Flip was still in business. 
28116 4 Ordered for cousin 
28117 4 Very good value for money. All the components were good quality and worked perfectly. Will be buying a second kit for another camera. 
28118 3 Works great. I m only giving it 4 stars because it s aftermarket, and not canon brand. But hey- it s works great, so far!! 
28119 4 Good👍 
28120 4 No problems. Works as advertised. 
28121 3 This was a gift so I haven t used it, my granddaughter loves it. 
28122 4 Good 
28123 3 Works fine 
28124 4 NONE 
28125 3 It works, does the job, not big improvement on using time 
28126 4 LOVE it!!! Exactly what I need and use all the time...outstanding quality! 
28127 2 Not really that helpful but does have many functions spelled out. 
28128 4 Purchase was easy and product arrived on time and worked fine 
28129 4 Works as expected 
28130 4 Works perfectly and seamlessly with my 5D MkIII and my flashes. Exactly what I expected being another great Phottix product. They really are excellent! I would definitely buy again but doubt I ll ever need too! 
28131 4 Easy setup and good replacement for my Izon 1.0 - now i have a night vision - great. 
28132 4 Awesome loved go pro type this video to see it in action 
28133 4 Henry Campbell did a nice job helping me get my camera up and running again after moving. He remoted in and fixed it within 5 minute. Thanks, Henry. 
28134 4 Had to return however, did not fit my camera. 
28135 1 There is no info about camera on internet. Camera works well, but there are no infareds so no night vision and i can not figure how the usd cards works Only way to connect is third party app that does not explain anything. 
28136 4 resistente 
28137 4 Works great. The people that posted negative reviews just don t know how to use this. Don t set on max setting and manually prefocus if you have to, or set at lowest setting, auto focus and only then adjust ND ring. 
28138 3 Works great for cell phones, quickly charges and can recharge a cell phone many times between charges. 
28139 3 The tripod works great. It came very fast. This tripod does what it is supposed to. Great for its price. The travel case, however, came defective and the material is not good quality. 
28140 4 Worked great. Batteries corroded when left inside though. 
28141 4 Good 
28142 0 Crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap crap 
28143 2 Generally good, but focus is erratic and sometimes you get poor pics. 
28144 4 Easy to use, glad to have it while being on our tropical trip (boating, fishing, snorkeling)! 
28145 4 Great kit, the pad is nice and the belt is easier than putting on your own belt. 
28146 2 was used and missing the brkts for attachement. besides that it won t just fine 
28147 4 works great easy to set up 
28148 4 Easy to install and it works very well. Best price you can find online. 
28149 4 This plate is an exact match for my Ravelli APGL3 tripod. 
28150 4 Once I started using these for location shoots, I ll never stop. I absolutely love the results with my speedlite. 
28151 4 Shipped a large fragile and valuable sculpture in this. Pelican products are simply the best - built like a tank and flawless quality and design of every detail - clasps, wheels and handle are all outstanding. Not cheap but you will never regret having any of these cases. 
28152 4 tHE CAMERA LOOKS GREAT BUT MY GRANDAUGHTER HAS NOT USED IT YET. I THOUGHT FILM FOR THE CAMERA WAS IN THE &#34;BUNDLE&#34; & SHE NEVER SAW IT. AM I MISTAKEN/? BARBARA K MC CORMICK 
28153 4 Love it 
28154 0 I receieved the first one it did not work at all. Then the second one I rec d only one side of the charger works. It appears that the terminals inside are very poorly attached and just fall loose from shipping. Quality is very poor. 
28155 4 good product, price and company. 
28156 1 As other reviewers have stated the cloth does leave excess lint behind. 
28157 4 My Phantom2 is awesome!! Easy to fly without any experience! 
28158 4 Good quality 
28159 4 keeps the neighbor from parking in my driveway when i m gone. 
28160 4 Very good and useful to use the telescope out of city. 
28161 4 Works great. 
28162 4 So much stuff for a really great price! It came just in time, tomorrow I have a ghost investigation so gonna try it out !! 
28163 4 Works great,no probs yet,I m happy. 
28164 4 These Sony tapes work very well in my Sony Handicam Digital 8 camcorder. Output is in nice, clear video. I have used this camcorder and these tapes to record my grandaughter s birthday party and make an excellent DVD from them. 
28165 0 Non-standard thread size and ilconcieved proprietary clamp mechanism make this flag too flakey to trust on any shoot. If you have spare room on a cage or rig, lots of time and odd parts maybe. 
28166 3 Best digital camera on the market, hands down. I ve played with and used almost every brand and functionality out there and this one won my heart. Too expensive. 
28167 3 Be real careful mounting ,adjusting , the arms-mounts are very delicate , flimsy, once up near my real ones ,they look good, and may not be detected as fake, 
28168 4 Had sum questions of if it s 1080p but it is a good pictures 
28169 3 good quality but it s abit big for women wrists 
28170 4 works flawlessly 
28171 4 Easy to use durable and reusable. 
28172 0 Worked well for short period of time and then died. 
28173 4 Good flash.. delivered as promised.. thanks... 
28174 4 it is awesome 
28175 4 Works perfectly great. Seems really solid for anything we d ever need it for. Holds steady and turns smoothly. 
28176 3 as described good product 
28177 4 Nice product, all is well 
28178 4 Nice, but not quite long enough! 
28179 4 Handy gadget, works great, love the little storage compartment. 
28180 4 Comfy!! 
28181 4 dope lens you can t beat an F2.8 plus its made of strong material kinda heavy too which is good 
28182 2 It s okay. But I find the phone apps to do more! 
28183 4 Keeps your GoPro from sinking to the bottom of the lake. Covers back door completely. Includes the two tether mounts/anchors, not the surf mount, as depicted in the first photo. 
28184 4 A lot of fun. Easy to use. However I now want an upgrade. 
28185 3 Fine product, not sure how good this glass is but it works and my pics look a lot crispier and warm and I get to show the awesome blue Florida and Puerto Rican skies and puffy clouds. 
28186 0 Arrived with tear at the seam. 
28187 4 Works just as described! Incredibly simple to set up, and I love the function and aesthetics of it. Will probably add more! 
28188 3 The camera 📷 works great. 
28189 0 Got the cord and it doesn t work. I had to buy another one from best buy. 
28190 4 GReat price great service 
28191 4 Just as expected...added to my home surveillance, works great. 
28192 4 Great Product 
28193 4 Product just as expected, would use seller again. 
28194 0 I received the items before the target but 3 out of 9 were no working. 
28195 4 Excellent binos. 
28196 4 Worked perfect. Used over-sized bulk black paperclips to hold to Cowboy speed light stands and did my first green screen video. Worked perfect. Easy to store between video shoots. 
28197 4 Gud 
28198 2 It s okay, some vignetting and the outside is a little soft. I can t really complain because it was $250. I love h the wide angle though. 
28199 3 I like the 8-in-1 gopro kit, it arived pretty quick. The only thing is that the straps for the chest mount can be a little small if your a big person. All in all cool to have. 
28200 3 worked well for paint ball mask 
28201 0 not the right one 
28202 3 what i needed 
28203 3 for tus price its a good buy. 
28204 4 Love this alternative to pocket wizard. been using mine for a year. I have 6 and, they are reliable cheap and easy to use. I found a few youtube videos and had it all figured out from there. 
28205 3 It is very functional and very well protected. 
28206 4 This item was a gift for my 15 yr old granddaughter in Texas. She loves it!!! 
28207 4 excellent! 
28208 4 This has to be the best camera in the market. Pics are sharp, performs great in low light and with 32MP you can crop like you had a 500mm lens. Lots of options, intuitive to use (for an FX DSLR). 
28209 3 Nice quality. Good price 
28210 4 Delivered on time with great packaging. Items were as described and definitely a great asset for my photography! 
28211 3 Works well 
28212 4 Good Seller and Product 
28213 3 Had a few cosmetic issues, but lens seems to be in great working condition. 
28214 4 This unit works as expected. Great quality, built well with perfect connection to batteries. No longer have to worry about having access to AC power! 
28215 4 Very fast shipping and very happy with it. 
28216 4 Great product. 
28217 0 Garbage, don t waste your money. 
28218 4 A dream lens on my D700. Big and heavy and built like a tank which may be an issue for some weight wussies out there, but hardly a concern of mine; I appreciate build quality. Very sharp, great contrast and color saturation. 5 stars all the way. 
28219 4 Legit. Convenient. Easy to use. Smart design. Practical. Follow me on Instagram @heyitstony 
28220 3 Received this in really fast time, and as pictured. Had to mess with it a bit to get it on, but the extra filters I purchased fit fine. No real complaints. Would purchase again. Thanks. 
28221 4 Love these Wasabi cells! My GoPro 4 Silver does through a battery pretty quickly. A whole day of photos and videos is about 3 batteries worth. 
28222 4 This is a great case and perfectly designed for the dji Phantom 2. The drone and all of batteries, chargers, and miscellaneous pieces fits perfectly. It s very well built, lightweight and is what I had hoped for. 
28223 4 everything was ok. Thank you! 
28224 4 Good quality 
28225 4 I pulled it out of the package and plugged it into my wall. I then put a battery in the charger. It charged the battery like it was supposed to, even on off-brand products. Works great! 
28226 4 Husband likes this case because you can t see in it plus no one knows what it is. He also like it because it s very small. 
28227 0 RETURNED THAK YOU 
28228 4 Works so well I had to buy another! lol The picture is very clear and very wide. 
28229 4 This is definetly a must have product! 
28230 0 Product arrived deffective, with one loose leg, like there is a missing screw or something. I needed it for my vacations, what a waste of time and money. 
28231 4 Perfect solution to watch your pets and your loved ones at home. I found out that my dog just sits and waits near the entrance of the apartment from the moment I leave until the moment I come home. Amazing. Almost cried. 
28232 4 Worked splendidly. 
28233 4 very good.... 
28234 4 Awesome camera We took it on an 11 day safari with a six year old and 64 year old Grandmary. Easy to use n awesome shots were taken with the zoom. We took 1084 shots n kept 200. 
28235 2 Does NOT fit Canon M series. There were two questions on here answered saying that it does. I bought it and can confirm it doesn t fit. 
28236 4 Great all work fine 
28237 4 nice quality 
28238 4 Easy to fit on the handle bar. the actual GoPro holder can be removed from the handlebar holder what leaves a small peg on the handlebar 
28239 4 It meets my expectations does everything I thought it. Very pleased with the product. 
28240 4 I loved 
28241 4 very nice great value , perfect for those quick shots w/o using a slr. 
28242 4 This adapter is life. Works perfect! 
28243 4 It was lovely. 
28244 4 excellent 
28245 2 The quality is low but you get a lot with the deal. 
28246 2 good outside bad inside 
28247 3 Good price compared to battery stores 
28248 4 thank you 
28249 4 Works as advertised. I like the charger being independent from the camera. Have not fully cycled the batteries yet but don t expect issues. Also provides 12V. charging. Much cheaper than others. 
28250 4 takes fantastic pictures, model is a little older now, but cant beat this camera at this price point. Do not hesitate 
28251 4 Very nice filter set. 
28252 4 I love this Air Blaster..easy to use...no problems at all... 
28253 4 Richard. did a great job helping me set up port forwarding as well as email triggering.......10 Stars !! 
28254 4 My 18 year old and my 13 year old traveled to Toyko Japan and Manila, P.I. for the summer vacation. My teenager daughter got awesome videos using the GoPro while riding the wooden sailboats in the Phillipines. 
28255 4 great for the price 
28256 4 Seriousity and fast shipping!! 
28257 4 Just what I needed! 
28258 4 This is exactly as described. I bought this as a second battery for my camera and it is better than the original in that it lasts longer. The charger charges both batteries fine. 
28259 3 Does what its supposed to. 
28260 4 nicccccce! 
28261 4 Love it, but two weeks later and I still cannot figure out the instructions for downloading. 
28262 0 Not what I was expected. Came without any parts or helping page how to use it and how to see your pictures. This is our way to our future. Will be a disaster as planned by the experts in Washington, D.C. 
28263 4 Used on my panasonic dmc-fz70 camera. Fits perfect and pictures/video are great. Like that it protects the main lens. 
28264 4 Absolutely perfect, great price! Thanks! 
28265 4 Does what it is supposed to 
28266 3 its very good for taking photos but not good for videos. very smooth 
28267 3 A bit bigger than I expected, but works perfectly. I really like the fact that it can be plugged in directly in case the batteries in the receiver do die. 
28268 4 nice 
28269 2 It served the purpose. 
28270 4 Here s the bottom line: people wave at it as they walk by. :-D 
28271 4 Batteries are just as good as the original Nikon battery. I really love the travel charger. I keep a spare one in my suit case so I never leave home without one. I highly recommend. Shipped as promise I would purchase from this seller again. 
28272 4 Excellent Camera, Thanks. 
28273 0 It s very difficult to get off. It does wok but I wish it was machined better. 
28274 3 Omly wish it had beewn waterproof. Excellant telephoto and video. 
28275 4 Fit is very very good. Would buy again. 
28276 3 Very nice camara 
28277 4 cool looking 
28278 4 Awesome purchase!!!! Came in fast and everything is wonderful quality! Def would buy again 
28279 2 video/audio quality were good. i liked the product until the only button on it broke from pressing lightly. it was useless after that 
28280 3 works great 
28281 4 Fits like a glove, keeps out dust and protects the connectors on my a6000 flash shoe. 
28282 4 does what it is suppose to, and its made of metal. 
28283 3 Got this for my husband discounted to review. My husband has a canon camera but it didn t fit so he gave it to a friend who has a Sony. The friend says it works well. But the adapter does not work with all canon cameras. 
28284 4 versatile unit and easily achieved the position i wanted. 
28285 4 Great camera and the quality of the lenses are out of this world 
28286 4 Great--fits snugly and makes the camera look better, too 
28287 3 Works well. Cracked easily when dropped and now doesn t float well. 
28288 4 Everything perfect! Thanks! 
28289 4 You ll look a little silly with it since it s so huge but your camera will stay dry. 
28290 4 Takes clear pics. Great video! Small, portable, and powerful. 
28291 4 Amazingly sharp cutting wheel that will trim such a small sliver of paper from a photo if I didn t position it correctly the first time I cut it. Love that! 
28292 4 Nice polarizer, nice price! 
28293 0 They didn t work on my Kindle 7. 
28294 4 Excellent product.. it helps me a lot since I m new with my camera so I use it a lot... for me it s perfect to have more than one battery to use. Thank you! 
28295 4 Works great for a fraction of the price of the orion brand. 
28296 4 Great Camera Bag. Bought one as a gift in 2012 and the bag is still protecting the camera and lenses. 
28297 4 Exactly what I needed so I m not constantly changing lenses. The &#34;leash&#34; for the lens cap is a sweet bonus. I have &#34;lost&#34; the cap so many times in my travels. Also, the bag is well-padded and perfect for my Nikon and the new lens. 
28298 3 It s made out of plastic not carbon fiber. While not perfect, it will give some protection. 
28299 3 The backdrop is exactly how it looks in the seller pictures. Pictures can out looking great. Recommend this item. 
28300 4 I realy like my new Phantom!!! Thanks 
28301 2 WORKS GREAT BUT A BIT SLOW TO CHARGE 
28302 4 Awesome! use as a security alert. 
28303 4 FANTASTIC UNIT 
28304 4 This filter is working very well. I ve read where some photographers have had a problem unscrewing a filter (not necessarily this one), so I don t tighten it down all the way as with all of my filters. I m very happy with it. 
28305 0 bad. very bad. didnt charge my battery. went to a wedding to shoot, popped out the battery, and it hadnt been charged. the design is bad too. the battery easily falls out of the charger. 
28306 4 Works great but make sure you either carry a tool that will loosen these. They work so well with the gasket that sometimes your hand strength isn t enough. 
28307 3 it works great.pain in the butt to get set up right but with a home security system you will have that 
28308 4 Came quickly and as described. Worked perfectly for my Canon Powershot 
28309 4 Bought for my mother as a birthday gift. She loved it an it s many capabilities.The touch screen makes it very user friendly. Great resolution and IR mode. Very pleased with this product. 
28310 4 this part finished off my telescope. perfect 
28311 4 Works great with my 18-135 canon stm 
28312 4 Purchase inspired by Ken Rockwell review; it s totally awesome for power, compactness, and utility with a consumer-grade D3300. The price was painful, but the product was worth some of that premium. 
28313 4 Excellent 
28314 4 Fits my Canon SL1 with standard 18-55mm lens, battery charger, and USB chord. Tight fit. Good compact case. 
28315 4 Did what it was designed to do. But the product that I used it for (not a Sony product) did not work out. So I sent it back, along with the defective camera. 
28316 4 It worked great 
28317 0 Uncomfortable and pointless. You cannot comfortably take image with your hand in this thing with a D3300 
28318 4 Needed a back up battery, fit the bill nicely. 
28319 3 as advertised 
28320 4 I liked the product, and had no trouble with the purchase. thank YoU! 
28321 4 Thanks 
28322 4 good complement with the purchase of the quadcopter I recommend this a lot 
28323 1 Waterproof case doesn t work, water got in and now it doesn t work, never opened. Screen turned greened after 1 use 
28324 3 Thanks to Joseph badge #AR004204 for the set up help, product works great! 
28325 4 The case is attractive and compact! Like the feel of it and the utility! 
28326 0 Couldn t get a picture to show on the screen. Directions very poor. Tried some you- tube video instruction to no avail. Toshiba laptop should work with it but doesn t. Emailed Protensic but never got an answer. Don t know what else to do. 
28327 4 It s really great, but after some work in events I m not using because it s heavy without the chest acessory. 
28328 4 5 generic-brand lens covers for for my camera for less than 1/4 the price of one of the name brand. Fantastic! 
28329 3 Great product just wish the case was a little bigger 
28330 0 it started to shake. I barely used for 5 times. 
28331 4 Love it great light great customer service from seller great experience all the way around 
28332 1 When I was trying to download the firmware files. The wifi from bebop drone keep saying. Impossible to connect. It toke me about 30 mins to download the firmware. :/ 
28333 0 If I could rate it lower I would. It was a complete waste of money. Worst video quality you could imagine. I should have known better trying to save a buck. 
28334 4 Works great! Quick delivery. 
28335 4 They work really good 
28336 4 I like so much. Yellow bobber is easy to find in the water. 
28337 3 GREAT DEVICE at an Outstanding Price!!! 
28338 1 Works well as a monocular... however unfortunately it calls itself night vision. It is not even kinda night vision. 
28339 4 These have everyone fooled. combined with some legitimate Brinks security yard and window signs, I think this is a decent deterrent. 
28340 4 Works well... 
28341 4 I am very satisfied with this purchase. The camera is like new and charges itself, I never need to replace batteries as I had to with the old Coolpix. 
28342 3 Strong case but makes some of buttons hard to press 
28343 4 As advertised. 
28344 4 Great! 
28345 1 Worked ok but speakers were not very loud for video. 
28346 1 the fan has a problem, at first everything was fine, now is making a lot of noise 
28347 3 No problem with them.. 
28348 4 Excelente 
28349 4 This filter is remarkably constructed. The build, quality and and overall construction is excellent. It screws on nicely onto the lens and fits snugly. The coating is even and of high quality. Breakthrough Photography really makes great filters for a great value. 
28350 4 Great product and fast delivery. Look forward to next time 
28351 3 I ordered this battery for my Nikon D7000 and put it into a grip. Used it for a night time star shoot and had no problems. I ll know how good it is after a few months of use but so far so good! 
28352 4 I still have this canon camera and still use it for everything! it is so simple if you just like doing simple video and photography. And you can change the way it looks depending on what size lens you buy. 
28353 4 So far this floating bundle has been great! Easy to use and good qualtiy 
28354 0 Installer said it was a malfunctioning camera. I had throw packaging away so I did not return and counted as my loss. Discourage as a client for future purchases. 
28355 1 Bag was too small for my new 3/4 Lumix 
28356 0 camera did not function 
28357 4 Working good 
28358 4 So glad I bought the extra batteries for my Canon Camera. They keep a goo charge and comes in super handy for those long days of shooting pictures. Great Price as well for the pack. 
28359 4 I am amazed with the quality of service and as well as how I received my order 
28360 4 fitted perfectly on an om-d em5 even if its not listed as compatible, and its really good. perfect as replacement for the original one it may already broken 
28361 2 Really hard to rotate at times. does not bend forward and back well. It is fine for the price it is at. Will get the job done for low cost 
28362 0 Part of the head fell apart when I went to mount the camera! I returned it and got my refund back 
28363 4 Got it delivered very quicjly and it is perfect for me. As a photographer, it s so nice to have something so comfortable on your back! 
28364 3 Received the case which I like a lot it makes the camera look very retro ad offers good protection. 
28365 4 works great. I use it as an access point. Setup is very easy 
28366 0 DO NOT BUY THIS TRASH!!! IT TOOK FOREVER FOR ME TO GET AND ITS NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE IT WAS FIRST OF ALL IT IS USED AND NOT NEW THE PASSWORDS AND USERID DID NOT WORK SO I COULD NOT RESET IT AND ADJUST THE SETTINGS! 
28367 3 cable s a little too short, so buy an extension cord. other than that, It works well. 
28368 4 Buen producto 
28369 4 Thank you 
28370 2 It is a good back up battery. It has a lot lesser charged life... about less than 2 hours maybe. Where the original Lumix can go 4+ hours of photo shooting. But for the price is worth it... 
28371 3 Most of the time works fine, but sometimes you have to re-connect it to the shoes to make better contact. 
28372 4 Good range does come in clear 
28373 2 Good product but it does not screw on my t3i. I heard you need the filter for it to fit I ordered one we will see if it works now. 
28374 4 Much cheaper than Fuji original, fits to camera, looks good, made from solid material. 
28375 3 I m still testing it out. I wish there was a way to turn them off to conserve the battery. 
28376 0 total crap. 
28377 4 This has worked flawlessly, nice looking and sharp images. I use on my desk at work and love the reliability and quality. 
28378 4 Awesome Quality! 
28379 4 Much better than having a camera! All pictures look good! Do not expect real colors, it s like old instant photos. Be careful not to open accidentally the film storage cover. 
28380 4 The seller was quick to respond to my question regarding the type of camera that the case would fit. It does fit the Cannon Rebel 1000D with the 250mm lens. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28381 1 wasn t all that is cracked up to be 
28382 1 The unit has the front red windows was broken, the horizontal movement is not smooth but jerky.The movement is continuous and can not be used for multiple shots into a panorama. 
28383 3 Good for a low budget tripod. 
28384 4 The customer service is awesome and the camera works great. Great picture and set up is easy with videos. Hard to find great customer service today and this company and product is exceeding expectations! 
28385 4 No prob. Good quality. Recommend 
28386 0 Does not operate all that well. 
28387 4 The best camera for adults having to much fun and great for kids too! ;) indestructible!! 
28388 4 Great system 
28389 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
28390 2 Can t beat for the money but don t keep a large as long as original brand batteries. 
28391 3 Great Product 
28392 4 Fits nicely, to replace my lost Nikon D5100 battery lid. Don t have to live in constant fear that the battery will fall off. 
28393 4 Seller was great. Very good quality camera although it is just a basic one. 
28394 4 Timely arrival for a great price. 
28395 4 Good 
28396 3 Work good 
28397 0 Lasted about a week. Camera lasted three days. Buy a &#34;real one&#34; if you want a drone. 
28398 4 Quality 
28399 4 Its a camera battery and works just fine as expected for a Canon battery. I have never had it run low, even after 400+ photos in one session, using an external flash, but the builtin. 
28400 1 Not calibrated very well. 
28401 4 kenneth helped me out setting up the camera and camera works great just not as smooth as i thought it would be but everything else is perfectly fine. 
28402 4 Haven t used it in the water yet, but this is a nice, comfortable hand grip. With the wrist strap, this is a no Brainer for water enthusiasts! 
28403 4 Great!.. Thanks 
28404 4 works OK hard to use 
28405 4 Keeps my GoPro 4 going, charges fast with my Anker chargers. 
28406 4 very good 
28407 4 A good product. 
28408 4 Just exactly what I was looking for. Thank you. 
28409 4 Love the ball design ...can angle my camera in abstract way to capture a pic and it captures right every time...also like the ability to switch from tripod to monopod without falling...not a professional photographer but highly recommend this tripod 
28410 4 BESTTTTTT Love it!!! 
28411 4 Its great just what i was looking for. 
28412 3 great product for price , needs better instructions , not Bluetooth cabable 
28413 0 Add stated for phantom 2. However screews included were for phantom 3 only. 
28414 0 Don t use wrist mount the part that spins Broke off when I was on my jet ski and I lost my hero 4 
28415 4 I purchased this item for the Nikon D7200. It s a perfect fit for both the top and rear monitors. Very easy to install, no bubbles, no troubles. Does not degrade the display quality at all. 
28416 4 Bien 
28417 4 several year later and still going strong. love this accessory so much for longer battery life and for better grip. 
28418 0 I was looking for a tripod for my camera and not for a phone. 
28419 4 We took about a days worth of pictures and another half-hour of video (flyboarding) and the battery was just about done. These work great and the charger handles the original battery from my Olympus TG-4. 
28420 0 This is a fun scope to take along any where. I was surprize at how clear and good viewing through it was. I like and recommend all the Orion products. 
28421 1 Worked ok when I was able to use it. Every one of the loops that the strap goes through came off on one end. Super glue doesn t even want to hold them in place on that cheap plastic. You get what you pay for I guess. 
28422 4 love it, small enough to fit in my pocket, takes great pictures. wpi;d recommend to buy it. 
28423 4 Works as described. expensive for what it is, but I really didn t feel like trying to build my own and the cost for dies to cut right and left hand threads, so I paid the price. 
28424 4 O.K. Please send me a Guide to understand better to use it. I need also drawings and guidelines because I have problems to know better to use it. Thank You 
28425 4 The Best...... 
28426 3 works as expected 
28427 4 So glad I found a replacement for my camera, works great! 
28428 4 Love this camera! Not as intimidating as I first thought it would be...takes great pictures, no buyers remorse or disappointment. Very happy with my purchase. 
28429 4 Getting a real canon IS lens at this price is great. It s not as hefty as the more expensive lens, but for the price, it s hard to beat. I find this a must for those interior shots where 24mm and up just don t capture what I need. 
28430 4 Works great! My images look fantastic. 
28431 0 Don t work. Don t charge 
28432 4 Great lengths for the money 
28433 0 Doesn t work for me - cannot see to focus - view is distorted. Trying to return 
28434 4 Excellent remote. 
28435 4 Exactly what I expected. 
28436 4 Worked great for taking pics for eBay 
28437 4 Works great! I ve should ve gotten one of these ages ago! Helps my night photography a great deal. 
28438 3 the L830 is a wonderful prosumer camera sadly the shutter speed is not controllable 
28439 3 Decent camera for price. Quick delivery 
28440 4 The product is exactly what I needed. The speed at which I received the item was very good. Used the item day after I got it and it works great. 
28441 4 Our lights arrived quickly and in one piece. They are bright. 
28442 0 I bought this and 5 weeks after I bought it the base rusted. They expect me to pay shipping cost to get replacement. Bad product, Bad company, bad support. Bad use of money 
28443 4 Perfect.......better than expected! 
28444 4 The battery is just what I wanted. Thanks. 
28445 3 Works over wifi or cell service from any where in the country. It does freeze if signal is weak but you can speak through it and listen to conversations. It is an excellent low budget home surveillance alternative. 
28446 4 So great filters with good price, high quality build. 
28447 4 I am very pleased with the quality of the product, and the price and prompt delivery. A+ 
28448 2 Ok so the selfie stick itself is pretty good and sturdy but.... The go pro attachment snapped off in my hand which was lucky because with what I do it could have been the end of my gopro... An extra $10 later I buy a real adapter which was annoying... 
28449 3 These actually work very well - I now have 4 of them. The product would be better served by the inclusion of instructions that are better written in english; however, that notwithstanding, they perform as would be expected by a more expensive product, and are recommended. 
28450 4 Lost my original charger, this one works wonderful 
28451 4 Fast and efficient. Your batteries exceeded my expectation. Thank you for your great customer service. 
28452 4 It is exactly what I ordered and what I expected 
28453 4 great 
28454 4 great flash 
28455 4 received as expected 
28456 4 High quality and durable, honestly I am very impressed with this kit for the price! 
28457 4 My hope was to trigger my Canon 580EX-II off camera and this bracket is perfect! Most of it is metal with the exception of the knobs and feels very sturdy. Great product! 
28458 4 This tutu is absolutely ADORABLE!!! The quality is great and the color was exactly as pictured. Any little girl will look like the cutest little girl in the world with this tutu abd headband. Highly recommended this product!! 
28459 4 I really don t use it very often, but when I need it, it does perform as expected. It might not feel super sturdy and tough, but taking the price I paid for it into account I give it 5 stars. 
28460 4 Fits my new Nikon P600 camera perfectly. 
28461 4 Awesome, as usual for Canon products!!!! 
28462 4 Well and aesthetically built. Works fine, uses widely available AA batteries. Now all my studio devices run on the same type batteries. Great tool for a studio or outdoors shoots where extra lights are needed. Not that easy to use as it has so many functions. I am still learning. 
28463 0 I bought this a couple of months ago. I am disappointed. When the wifi does work, it will only let you upload 1 photo at a time. It is slow and frustrating. I wouldn t buy this product again. Don t waste your money. 
28464 4 Very nice for the money. Everything fits and works wekk with my Panasonic AG-HMC80. 
28465 0 So happy with it, it is so compact. Also happy that it has a re-chargeable battery. Also easy to use. 
28466 4 Excelente. 
28467 1 Kind of a joke not being able to see any history without having to pay for subscription. It s not a bad camera but not the best 
28468 4 Great price, and works as needed. No complaints. 
28469 4 This was a surprise to me how much I like these. Good enough for my elaborate home studio. 
28470 4 Great price for remanufactured, works great with Amazon oem battery and chargers available. 
28471 4 I got this for my brother and it was really cool! 
28472 2 It works some times and doesn t work other times. I was hoping it was more reliable to use my iPad or iPhone as a monitor when shooting video but it seems to be more of a deterrent than helpful. 
28473 4 AMAZING! 
28474 4 As described. Perfect high quality Galaxy S6 dummy phone. Fast shipping! Thank you. 
28475 4 Great value for the price 
28476 0 Does NOT fit the 55-250 Canon lens. 
28477 4 Item delivered on time and as described. 
28478 4 I m very satisfied with this purchase, because it s exactly what I was looking for. It work perfectly and is the battery that I need for my video camera. I want to Thanks the seller because they still have this kind of products in existence. Thanks. 
28479 4 Very high quality CCD. For the price you can t go wrong. Very good fish eye lens for outdoor. 
28480 4 Very good camera!!! 
28481 4 I don t like typing 
28482 4 Excelent product 
28483 4 Great and fast shipping. Lights are near daylight and perfect for my application. 
28484 4 Does what it is supposed to do, hold the camera nice and tight. 
28485 3 Only issue is they are a bit hard to separate. 
28486 4 Very good film camera. What else could I say? 
28487 3 The color is darker than shown in the picture, but all in all a neat little case. 
28488 1 Its bulky, just not the fit for me. I ended up stashing it behind a tree on a hike, and leaving my camera around me neck, with my extra lense in a smaller bag. 
28489 4 It worked even better than what I had anticipated. I strongly recommended this little but powerful gadget. 
28490 2 on my phone when you plug it in the phone it act like it want to zoom so it doesn t work but I set the time on my phone and use it that way not that big of a deal 
28491 3 Now both my wife and my self have spare battery for our photo trips. 
28492 4 I like how I can start a video shoot right away and not miss the event! Haven t had it underwater yet, is nice size to keep in my purse. TY :) 
28493 4 good seller, I recomend 
28494 4 Definitely a &#34;5&#34; on a scale of 1-5 in the COOL FACTOR Ratings...Adds a little style to my new X100T...Love it! 
28495 4 We are using it for 5 years, and still works as day 1. 
28496 3 good 
28497 4 This works great as other reviewers noted. Still trying to figure out how to set up motion sensor to start recording. Otherwise recordings and snap shots are clear and I love the two way talk. Love to have an outside version of this video cam. 
28498 4 Most happy with this kit. Came with everything I needed The A77II is a great camera.The battery grip helps for extended shoots. Picture examples from the A77II. 
28499 4 Great picture 
28500 4 It work Great 
28501 0 Fail. Bought two. One dead upon arrival. Would not hold a charge. 
28502 4 The person for whom I purchased it as a gift was delighted to have it. 
28503 4 Fits great and gives extra much needed grip to the smooth as silk Rx100 exterior. 
28504 1 Hmm quality of the construction is solid and looks good, but I found that using camera under water and then on sun the lens sweats from inside. Also lcd screen had same issue. All covers was closed and using in normal conditions. 
28505 4 great suport great item, 
28506 4 Works as expected. 
28507 4 great strap 
28508 4 ggreat product 
28509 4 Use these all the time. 
28510 3 can not delete misinstalled Canary 
28511 4 I love this camera. It works great. The staff is very helpful with any questions. 
28512 4 Great it works 
28513 4 Its a smaller size but its really fun and durable! 
28514 3 Really good 
28515 4 We love these little things - they are so economical, we wound up with a half-dozen - even one keeping an eye on the water heater closet. 
28516 4 sturdy, good product 
28517 4 Exactly what I was looking for. 
28518 3 Got it , have not had a chance to use it fully, when looking through it you can see circle s. Don t know if that is normal. 
28519 4 Great camera works well 
28520 3 still working after all this time; and doing it well 
28521 4 Much better than just looking at the screen from a distance. It helps me ensure I get the right adjustment for the light and it can detach since it has a magnet. 
28522 4 my wife loves it 
28523 0 Had it for a few years now. I have literally used it for about the first 3 months then bought me a real camera. This thing is the slowst camera in the world. Horrible battery life. Waist of $300.00. 
28524 3 Very nice! The entire package was much more than I really expected. I am very happy with my purchase. 
28525 4 Did exactly what I needed it to do, help my webcam fit my eyepiece. Couldn t ask any more from it. 
28526 4 So far so good. The product was delivered on the first day of the estimated delivery date for free shipping and packing was good too. Started using it and looks to be a good product for the price. 
28527 4 Works extremely well. Used for bear-detection in the mountains. 
28528 4 perfect 
28529 3 i have some problem on the button using the cover and i expected more from the battery BUT the quality video is good , 
28530 2 Alright part of it didn t work thougj 
28531 0 I m returning/exchanging this one. Doesn t charge from an outlet, only from cigarette lighter in the car. 
28532 4 This lens turned me into a pro. Love it. Easy to use. 
28533 2 The shipping time was ok. The only bad thing was that the instructions booklet and the camera strap didn´t came but I was rewarded for that. Regards. 
28534 1 poor resolution 
28535 4 Good Quality 
28536 4 Easy to setup and use! Very affordable as well. Worked with no issues Nikon D5200 
28537 4 It was what I needed and fits nicely in my camera case. 
28538 0 Fit on my Nikon body but did NOT fit my Minolta lens. 
28539 4 This is a must have if you have a NEX 7. Its great for protection, connecting over the shoulder harness and also easily clipping into my tripod (both landscape and portrait). No regrets. 
28540 3 Great battery for LED lamps... !! 
28541 4 Just what I needed! 
28542 4 Working fine, quick set up and fast service 
28543 3 Strap no good. Glasses were fine. 
28544 4 Perfect Fit for my new Pahntom 3, and plenty of room for the iPad Mini and extra battery. 
28545 4 Works perfect for my needs 
28546 4 An amazing camera. I just shot this music video in 4k and it came out great! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkheLRGWCZU 
28547 2 If the springs pop on you all you need to do is unscrew the 2 screws in the back and align the springs back and its good to go. 
28548 4 Item delivered on time, and works perfectly. Glad to have the keeper leash so I don t lose anymore........ 
28549 4 Best tripod I could buy, works well in all weather conditions. Doesn t float however :) 
28550 0 Couldn t even test out the set because I could only read about 1/4 of the digits/characters on the transmitter screen. NOT recommended. 
28551 2 Bought it for someone else 
28552 4 Great for travelling, the smallest of my 3 tripods. 
28553 2 It was great for about a month, comfortable, lightweight, but the clip broke and luckily I was holding my camera at the time or it would have been a disaster. 
28554 0 I ued this only 3 times, It can t be close-- only last 1 month.lose anymore, so I do not know how I can ship back. This cheap stuff is too expensive for 1 month lifespan. 
28555 0 It does not read, I thought maybe I was using it wrong so I asked the man that put my solar fencing in & he could not get it to read either. He used his own tester and got a reading. 
28556 4 Great case, protects without being bulky and at a great price. 
28557 1 M haaa a 
28558 4 Fine 
28559 4 Good 
28560 3 I love the way it looks like a WWII Leica case! 
28561 1 They ll work, mostly, but do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more. I had one that didn t want to let go of my lens (release button was only semi-coupled to the pin), and promptly chucked the set. 
28562 4 Works as described, have not had any issues yet. 
28563 4 great price 
28564 4 Great deal and batteries worked well. 
28565 4 Great bargain. 
28566 4 Great product. Not too heavy. Perfect for bringing on hikes. 
28567 4 Easy to install, great for security. The camera setting for recording is not totally intuitive. 
28568 4 Bought three of them already!!!! 
28569 4 Works great! 
28570 2 My unit was stolen, but it worked OK when I had it. 
28571 4 LOVE IT, works like the original. 
28572 4 I use these for all my delicate screens, cell phone, TV, and most of all for my navigation and compass clean up. 
28573 4 Easy to install. Works great. 
28574 3 I like it, but be careful when you receive it. The light went out on one side very easily. 
28575 3 This is perfect for what I intended... 
28576 4 these batteries were a good price and works perfect. and came with a car charger and a wall charger. i really needed the car charger. it really comes in handy. 
28577 4 Grate 
28578 4 Very Well Satisfied. 
28579 4 Great camera for the money. The website is convenient too. 
28580 2 Looks too fake-ish 
28581 3 Five star 
28582 3 Awesome... 
28583 4 Product was like brand new, everything worked and even came with a Sony carrying case I wasn t expecting. Very nice 
28584 4 I bought this camera 6 months ago. It was perfect for my needs. I looked at a bug collection that my grandkids found and also used it to watch while my students tied surgical knots. It works great and never had a problem. 
28585 4 Works well 
28586 4 Just as described. Received my camera quickly with no issues. 
28587 2 Works well 
28588 4 Nice design! Very good construction. Camera and accessories fit nicely. 
28589 4 Fits its purpose. No issues. 
28590 4 A good charger at a great price. Small, compact and does what it is supposed to do. Arrived quickly and as advertised. 
28591 4 Good battery,good price,and fast shipping. 
28592 4 Works the same as the original canon battery Good value 
28593 4 This is a really good ket for the price! 
28594 4 Great little case for your GoPro and some accessories! 
28595 4 Great case!! Took it overseas and it held up through a lot of abuse!! 
28596 4 Work great picture come out really nice ... Love it 
28597 4 Exelent product. 
28598 0 Got FV and not the FW 
28599 2 The greatest problem I have with this camera is the battery life. does not last but a few hours 
28600 4 Love. I am still learning some of the features for this is my first nice camera outside of pocket digital cameras. 
28601 3 works as advertised, nice price, seems to be reliable. 
28602 0 I could see the ends of the filter in the frame, its too long. Used with Canon EF 17-40 on full frame body. Didn t like the threaded mounting system either. 
28603 4 Awesome macro lens! I too, am newer to photography and recently discovered macro lenses. The shots I was &#34;attempting&#34; to capture with a standard lens seem a million times easier with this lens, and are much clearer. The price is also very good compared to others. I highly recommend. 
28604 4 The battery arrived fully charged and worked as well as the original equipment one had. Truly a remarkable value when compared with the price of an OE battery. 
28605 1 Video is washed out. Night time ir is grainy. Focus piunt seems fixed even though camer has adjustable focus. Pay the extra 10 dollars and get something better 
28606 4 Very good lens. Close range pictures have really nice colour and depth of field. I 
28607 4 Amazing and better!! Highly recommend this product. It performs better than expected. I did order another battery and a case to transport it in. 
28608 3 My light didn t work but from far away LOOKS REAL enough to fool average thief, the average thief isn t to bright anyway ! 
28609 3 Videos on my GoPro 4 hero turned out just fine! Colors looked good sharpness of video seems fine. The only thing I could see as an issue is the longevity of the product itself but for the money it was great. I would by again if needed. 
28610 4 Work well, thanks. 
28611 4 Great product and nice looking. Great for aero bars as well. 
28612 0 The screw that you tighten to secure the flash is very hard to grip with your finger tips. The first time I used this mount, my flash was on the floor within minutes. 
28613 4 It works great, especially for my camera lens. The grey cloth is the perfect size to keep in my camera bag, and I think I ll be keeping the larger one with my laptop! I would reccomend this product 
28614 4 Awesome value! Pictures turned out great! 
28615 4 The most versatile ruggedly made fun camcorder that you can do just about anything with from outside sport activities there s a very special moments in the home I would recommend this to everyone 
28616 4 Really bright. ...!!! 
28617 4 Replaced a previous model that had worn out over time. 
28618 4 Exactly what I expected 
28619 4 NICE ASSORTMENT OF ITEMS TO COMPLIMENT THE MINI 8 CAMERA. 
28620 4 Nice price and good condition. Highly recommend. 
28621 0 Very cheap quality. Does not fit the tripod. 
28622 4 STK always a winner. 
28623 4 Great product. Highly recommended. 
28624 4 Great simple camera 
28625 4 Good 
28626 4 Works perfectly! 
28627 4 So powerful. So useful. Get this in your camera bag right now. I know people that have 2 or 3 of these. You will not be disappointed. 
28628 4 Excellent product. 
28629 4 serves its purpose really well. 
28630 3 the camera, the lenses, the spare battery, the spare charger, the memory card and the lens converters are alright. I didn t like the flash, the bag and the tripod. The long distance shutter didn t work. 
28631 4 very good 
28632 4 Great! Received as described. 
28633 4 great value 
28634 3 You have moved an old timer into the digital age with this purchase. I m learning how to use yet, but I m satisfied with my purchase. 
28635 4 Great batteries. As far as I am concerned they are very close if not on par with the standard &#34;Canon batteries&#34;. Great Deal. Very Pleased. 
28636 4 So coll 
28637 4 Robust air blower. Never run out of air. No disposable cans. 
28638 4 Well-built, seems sturdy. The GoPro adapter can be unscrewed, leaving a traditional screw camera mount, so it works for other cameras as well. Very pleased. 
28639 4 The HD picture quality is outstanding. I am thoroughly pleased!! 
28640 3 It s a battery 
28641 3 Works well as a greenhouse/fish tank monitor. More resolution would be nice but this is adequate. It connected up at a distance of 40 feet or so from the router. 
28642 4 Very happy with purchase. 
28643 0 the image is not clear an not wide enough, do not waste your money in this purchase 
28644 4 Great price. Fine product. Works as expected. 
28645 0 Bad product but good customer service. I have bought two of these and both died after just a few months. I got a third one for free after I complained but this one also died after a few weeks! 
28646 3 The product works as advertised. You have to make sure the flash clicks into place though or it will not work properly. 
28647 3 Only problem encountered was a defective USB cable. I had to scrounge one from my drawer. The setup and subsequent use is very good. The software is an improvement over Drop Cam and I currently am using two of those. 
28648 0 This camera does not work 
28649 4 Great lense, good for shallow DOF 
28650 4 Clips and holds pretty nicely. Def a great replacement for a stock clip on cap. It was shipped from China, but came in roughly 2 weeks. So all in all... good buy. 
28651 4 This fits perfectly in my backpack to turn the front pouch into a camera bag! This way I can bring other things like clothes, water bottles, snacks, maps, etc. dedicated bags aren t quite as versatile, so this gives you the best of both worlds :) 
28652 4 The studio lighting is great for video and pictures. 
28653 4 Very good and easy to use. 
28654 4 Not bad for the price, it is not as good as original Nikon battery, but as a backup it is not going to disappoint you. 
28655 4 works as advertised! 
28656 4 good product 
28657 4 Very cute background! Looks exactly like pictured. 
28658 4 Excellent product, was everything it calmed to be. Fast shipping, friendly CS 
28659 4 bought to go with camera for 11 year old selfie generation- she loves it 
28660 3 It took me a little while to get everything working according to the instructions, including using sim card from at@t, but I m happy with the system. I did have a bad window/door switch but received a new one after notifying support@pisector. Their support people worked with me very well. 
28661 4 Works great 
28662 3 It works great for the camera and the other pockets will come in handy for something. 
28663 3 It works. 
28664 4 This a quality bag for a bargain price. I use this for a Sony Nex-7, multiple lenses, tripod, and all my accessories. 
28665 3 It works for my camera 
28666 0 Almost impossible to place on dog. 
28667 1 it is hard and inconvenient to connect, let alone keep the connection going. 
28668 4 Great lens, super lightweight, perfect for travel, great image quality. 
28669 3 Works great on my 150-600 mm 
28670 4 Just bought an Olympus underwater camera, used just one of the two floaty included and it works like a charm. 
28671 3 Motion detection doesn t work. 
28672 4 It s a rechargeable battery. It s still taking a charge after 4 years. What else can I say? 
28673 4 Perfect for my 75-300mm lens! Well made case. I love this case and having my 2nd lens right on my hip. I hate having to get into my bag every time I what to switch lenses, this case saves me so much time! 
28674 4 Fast service and good for beginner this is my first drome and is easy to fly...... 
28675 4 good item 
28676 2 Good 
28677 3 Pretty good but i have Android 5.02 which should work with WiFi feature but it does not No way of telling if it really does have WiFi or not. 
28678 4 Used it for the first time on my family vacation. Though I was a little nervous at first but it was an actually good buy. 
28679 4 LOVE THIS!!!!! 
28680 2 This latch doesn t hold as tight as the original GoPro latch and will let water in. GoPro replaced the original broken latch for free even after 2 years. I know keep this latch as a non-waterproof backup. 
28681 0 I ve ordered two of these lights and both begin to flicker after being powered on for about 30 min as they start to warm up. 
28682 4 Good 
28683 4 worked good 
28684 4 Bought 2 of these batteries! Work great in my Canon rebel xti! 
28685 4 Product as described, love it and would buy it again, thanks! 
28686 4 Awesome!!! 
28687 4 Love these reflectors! They pack up nice and compact and fit right in my camera bag. 
28688 4 Happy experience! 
28689 0 This was to be a NEW item. It WASNT. 
28690 4 The Camera is so great, like others in the segment, the accesories kit is fine and usefull but not so well made. Hope all of the parts works properly (425USD) for all was 
28691 4 At first I thought that the camera was going to not be of high quality, but I was wrong. The Fujikam camera has exceeded my expectations and I am very happy with this product. 
28692 4 perfect 
28693 2 It s not easy to use as there is no view finder so you re not really sure what you re shooting and it s very far away and you have to do manipulation on the photo to get a good print before you can post or use the picture. 
28694 4 One of the best values I have ever found. I don t care what others say, Cowboy Studios sells good products at better than affordable prices. If you are just starting out in photography, or a seasoned pro, you can t beat CS prices and quality. 
28695 3 Very sturdy, note that it will fit an unusual size pole. 
28696 4 Camera is still great. 
28697 0 didnt fit for my camera 
28698 4 Thanks Works Well! 
28699 4 It is a great buy !!! I had to return because it was not I wanted not because any problems 
28700 3 very Good 
28701 1 Did not fit my iPhone with the case. 
28702 3 This is a very fun camera, I appreciate Fuji for picking up the mantle after Polaroid, but it is seems a little oversized. In fact it is HUGE. 
28703 4 Love this tripod, very study 
28704 4 Quick and easy claim process! 
28705 4 great case. camera fits in it well. 
28706 4 This fish eye lens is comparable to the actual cannon version but at less of the cost. I have used these lens millions of times and I get great photos. I get great angle shots and lots of different views. 
28707 2 it s small and adorable, but the pictures come out too dark and the resolution is not great, just average. the pictures are misleading. 
28708 4 Looks to be what I needed. Thank you 
28709 4 Good price and very short time for delivery. 
28710 1 Outdated 
28711 4 Worked great, charged my orginal battery,and the battery that came with it. I recommend 
28712 4 Exactly what I was looking for...a camera case that did not disconnect from the camera when the camera is in use. It easily fit my smaller zoom and was a perfect fit for my Canon 35-300 Zoom. 
28713 2 AC Adapter die just after 1 yr 
28714 4 Good 
28715 4 Sturdy and well made 
28716 2 okay 
28717 4 Absolutely the best purchase 
28718 4 This case is bad ass. Sort of a tight fit around the motors (with the new Vortex limiting straps installed). I took pictures and sent the feedback to GPC.. all in all, terrific case 
28719 4 Only played with them slightly, but, enjoying them 
28720 4 Links easily with Honeywell L7000. 
28721 2 This lens is pretty cool. Can t beat the price, and it does just what its supposed to. Its also very lightweight, yet durable. A nice addition to my camera bag. 
28722 4 Got this case for my wife s large Panasonic point and shoot camera. It fit perfectly and had room for cables. Excellent quality bag and my wife loves the color to boot! 
28723 3 Currently using it on a bracket connected to my OMD E-M5 Mark ii and it works perfectly. 
28724 4 does what it says its gonna do 
28725 4 it works really good 
28726 1 I ordered for a Canon D10 and I received a Vivitar Kit. 
28727 4 A+++++, Will buy again! Excellent in all aspects & highly recommend!! Thank you! 
28728 4 love this 
28729 3 Nice addition to my gopro stuff 
28730 4 Works as advertised 
28731 4 Product worked well...it charged the batteries, and a green light indicated when to unplug the charger. excellent 
28732 4 Got everything in this plus a couple extra things. The suction cup is a little small. But zero complaints 
28733 4 I needed these to hold a few old 8x10 school photos and other nostalgic pics of yesteryear! Great protection for important mementos that are strictly 8x10 or smaller (unlike the 8.5x11 page protectors, which are slightly larger). Highly recommended. 
28734 3 True to description! Slim and user-friendly. My only complaint is that the photos are in the same order every time and that the memory card doesn t get inserted completely. There s a margin at the edge, so be careful if packing it with the card stored in it. 
28735 4 This was the perfect solution to my addiction to larger lens for my wildlife requirements. It has plenty enough room and i find comfortable for my use. AAA+ 
28736 4 works great and so much cheaper then the gopro one 
28737 4 Great mount! It can be put on a bar or handle as well as your wrist! Solid quality and trust my contour s life with it. 
28738 2 I thought it was for panoramic photos-it is better suited for close ups where you want a wider shot. 
28739 4 Fits perfectly 
28740 3 This would be an excellent bag/organizer for a GoPro if it was a little bigger. It just doesn t hold enough accessories! 
28741 0 This device a while go open it up yesterday today is the 21st August it don t work I want my money back piece of junk I charged it all night then turned it on and nothinghappen didn t clock did not even come on send me a return slip 
28742 4 good fit 
28743 2 it doesn t fit the whole screen so dirt and stuff collects at the edges. 
28744 4 Great item!. Used it to monitor my feline while away. 
28745 4 Perfect to stabilize my camera and perfect for iPhone when doing Flipagram for stop motion animation. You just need a part to hold the iphone, which you can find on Amazon, too. 
28746 3 Tiffin always axe a decent product. They sent me wrong size for my camera lens. Instead of 40.5 I got a 43.5. Trying to see if I can use it on another lens 
28747 4 Q-See has good equipment. These cables work just fine with Q-See camera. 
28748 4 pretty steady for indoor use 
28749 3 Definitely like this unit, its extremely solid as far as the frame and rods, The motors work ok with my cameras and are a bit noisy but that was expected if they hold up over time I will definitely give this rig 5 stars. 
28750 3 Nice set for the money. Had a hell of a time setting it up but it all works. It s not 5 stars because I m having trouble logging in because the name and password given to me for first log in don t work. 
28751 4 Same performance as the OEM battery at a much better price. 
28752 4 Nice and fresh. 
28753 4 😀 
28754 4 Charger for my Canon camera batteries. You can never have enough. Charged like the original, no overheating and my batteries did not lose the charge as some claimed. Its perfect for what I needed. 
28755 3 Only 9 out of 10 worked, which was disappointing when I had planned to take four pictures knowing I had four films left. The last one printed blank. 
28756 0 Missing some stuff 
28757 1 It did not fit my Sony a330 like I was told so I went to Florida for a week vacation with no camera cause of this. 
28758 4 Great service! Great product! 
28759 4 Very Happy with my Drone 
28760 4 Bought it again after losing it in the woods. I used it exclusively outdoors during hiking/climbing/camping. It stood up to the abuse very well for almost 8 months. 
28761 4 These cameras are great! We ordered two, and one of the selfie mirrors... used them at my daughter s wedding reception. Very fun idea, and not that expensive. 
28762 4 great picture quality, love the custom menu options. The only bad thing about this minister is that the battery mount falls off REALLY easily. Like I m about to gaff it on its so bad. But other than that the actual monitor is wonderf. 
28763 2 The batteries are perfectly fine, but the charger takes several hours to recharge just one battery. 
28764 4 Great battery last for long time for mic in sunday service for the church. 
28765 4 Love this strap! I wish I had another camera so I could buy another one! Very innovative 
28766 0 I was shipped a broken product. Gooseneck seems fine but without the clip it is unusable. 
28767 4 It s a great addition to my 5d mark III! Also amazing on the RED and great having the downstream LUTs for video village viewing! 
28768 4 Using camera for business -real estate photos - used just the auto setting but photos were amazing! 
28769 4 So fun to put on my dogs. They are a little confused with it on them, and try and take it off but once they get used to it they forget its on the,. 
28770 4 Love it, solid protection and easy installation! My screen is now protected and my investment is safe! To top it off its made in the USA!! 
28771 4 I got this as a replacement for another company s camera that lost the ability to get on a wireless network. I really like this camera. Easy setup, lots of instructions and support software. The images are incredible and the night vision is perfect. 
28772 4 Loving this system we have had in for a couple weeks or so now and it is pretty simple to set up. Also had to email support from Zmodo with a question and I got an answer back the next day in full details.. Awesome customer service!! 
28773 4 Very nice digital frame... Worth the money! 
28774 3 I wish the strap was a little longer but that s my only issue with it. 
28775 4 This was my 2nd roll of film, (right after the Tri-X 400). I also had this developed right away, and I love the results. I will be using much more of this film as well. 
28776 4 good 
28777 4 Shot one roll and immediately had it developed. This film is wonderful! Can t wait to use the rest. 
28778 4 San disk Mico SD a great media or I can say its a great performance card,greatly recommend to anyone. And the Nikon battery EN-EL 15 a long lasting life I love it 
28779 4 Love using these. Gives a great warmth and life to photos 
28780 4 Awesome 
28781 1 ok 
28782 3 Works really well, I have them in several rooms so I will always have one handy. 
28783 4 Works like a dream! 
28784 4 Awesome bag, great quality and smart design. I have space for everything. Carries tripod under as in photo. Completely waterproof, and it makes everything feel lightweight while carrying. I want to get one in all colors! 
28785 1 Flimsy!!! Poles seemed bent! Parts missing! 
28786 4 Lightweight, nice balance and cool looking. These fit on my Phantom 2, just for all those wondering. 
28787 4 good product 
28788 4 easy to apply, as expected 
28789 1 The LCD Viewfinder keeps fall of the camera. 
28790 4 A must for diy home security rigs and led uv boosters. 
28791 4 These lenses are very fun! I love how it s three different lenses in one! Product came as and when expected! Fit my iPhone 5 just well. Takes really cool pictures, you can get SO much more in the frame! 
28792 4 This is My Second Fuji Camera , I love them for the Dollar ! Great Zoom for a cheaper camera 
28793 4 It was easy as 123 I love 
28794 4 Held charge forever! Lastest all day; photos and videos. 
28795 4 evth ok! 
28796 4 Great product, works well. Good value for the price. This was replacement to my old tripod and I am happy with it. 
28797 4 good 
28798 4 Very versatile. I can charge at home or in my car. 
28799 4 Perfect. 
28800 4 Item was received just as described. 
28801 3 Works but took along time to set up. not the easist set up but once installed has been good. 
28802 1 Will not last very long a year or so at most 
28803 4 Durable and well made, lightweight and lots of room. Easily fits under airplane seats. A must for traveling with your photography equipment. 
28804 4 AWESOME CAMERA!!!!!!!!!!!! GLAD I PURCHASED IT. PICTURES ARE GREAT. 
28805 4 Shipping was good. Battery works fine. 
28806 3 It s just what I needed. 
28807 4 I think this is my second 10 pack of these types of clothes. As a family of forgetful glasses wearers, we go through and lose quite a lot of these. They work wonderfully though! 
28808 3 I know this bag is for NEX, I have a A6000, I thought they were almost the same, well, I was wrong, the inner bag is too small for it...... the bag itself is of good quality. 
28809 2 My biggest complaint with this is the battery compartment; it is awkward to open and close and its hard to keep your batteries and photo chip in plae 
28810 3 Worth the money. 
28811 3 I like the ability of screen flipping between the cameras. The on thing I would suggest is to increase the storage amount. 32 my would be preferred. 
28812 4 Basic as it gets but it gets the job done without hurting the wallet. 
28813 4 works like original battery. 
28814 4 Excelent 
28815 3 Product works as advertised 
28816 4 good product, so far working very well 8/9/2015. 
28817 4 perfect 
28818 0 No instructions, thanks! 
28819 1 Compared this to a brand new battery for the same camera and this lasted about 1/4 of the time of the new battery. You are getting what you pay for here. Only lasted about 2.5 hours with continuous use. Not really worth it. 
28820 4 Great camera for a great price. Super fast shipping. I recommend it! 
28821 0 Bad camera not good at all 
28822 4 Excellent product, and buying experience. I will buy in future 
28823 3 cool looking bag!! Good enough to carry a medium sized DSLR with 18-140mm attached onto it. And a 50mm lens. + the charger and cables. Anything more you will need a larger sized bag. 
28824 4 Pay the extra money for the best. Do Not Waste money on the cheaper products. 
28825 1 It would be nice if they had indications of what they were. Specifically the color and strength. 
28826 0 Bought for my boyfriend for his birthday in April, last month (July) the camera stopped working and won t turn on. Need to contact the company and hope they will work with me and replace it! 
28827 4 Highly recommended for a Canon 7D Mark II with a Canon EF 24-105 mm f/4L IS USM lens! 
28828 3 good product 100% 
28829 4 i love this camera! must buy product if you like traveling 
28830 3 It´s a very good product. I found it confortable to handle it. 
28831 4 ok 
28832 4 Vincent very knowledgeable and very helpful. 
28833 4 This filter works great for enhancing twilight and sundown colors. I saw a video from Bryan Peterson showing how well worked, and I ve tried it a few times with great results. 
28834 4 Reliable and much cheaper than the original. It s a little tight in the battery compartment of the camera, so sometimes we need to give it an extra push with a blade/key to pop it out. Camera operation is definitely as good with this battery as the original. 
28835 4 good deal! 
28836 4 Love my frame! 
28837 4 Great set for a good price. Quick shipping too. 
28838 4 Great camera! Love the quality of the photo. Very crisp and clear for a small camera 
28839 4 Good price. 
28840 4 Great item to allow me to see the camera LCD on a sunny day. 
28841 4 Great device and I bought for very good price 
28842 4 I haven t tried the Panasonic version of this cap, but I will say this one works perfectly. Probably not quite as tight against fine dust as the stock, hand-removable, cap, but very convenient, protective, and considerably cheaper than the Panny. 
28843 3 Great product... 
28844 0 may be Anti-glare. But because the surface is &#34;frosted&#34; it s difficult to see though. 
28845 0 Returned the item.send wrong item 
28846 4 Have only needed one battery replacement, in 2009, for camera purchased in 2005. These batteries work great. 
28847 4 good for price, working great 
28848 3 Very good product, I would recommend it. 
28849 4 Bought these as backups for my Pentax WG-10. They last as long, if not longer, than the OEM battery (which is not that long to begin with). Great price. Worth buying for extra shooting time, since these cameras suck up the juice pretty quickly. 
28850 4 Great bag for the price! 
28851 4 GOOD 
28852 4 I brought this awesome tripod for my sister and she absolutely loves it :-). Thanks! Dear eCost, I have rated the tripod. Here is my name and order number: Name: Dwayne Martin ORDER # 112-3476448-4701025 
28853 4 Go big or go home. If you hike, have some camera gear and other stuff, this pack is for you. It is big, well built, functional and roomy for everything you could imagine including a camera or two. 
28854 3 Just the right fit 
28855 4 ok...ok 
28856 4 A highly capable lens for a bargain price. I ve since switched all my gear over to Fuji, but would recommend this to anyone with a Canon looking for a budget lens. 
28857 4 Great service from the supplier, Amazon Prime gives you peace of mind, the drone is working well. 
28858 4 Works great for my Canon Rebel EOS T3i when the battery needs to charge but I still want to snap pictures. Decent length cord so you are not super tethered to a wall. 
28859 4 ...I used to store a Fuji X-E2 camera, fits correctly. 
28860 4 Absolutely great camera and huge bonus with all the accessories! Definitely recommend anyone looking for a great camera to purchase this bundle set!! 
28861 4 great strap 
28862 4 I am quite pleased with these little clothes. I leave one at each spot I leave one of my pairs of reading glasses (all over the house and my office). great clothes and a good value 
28863 4 Works very well. 
28864 4 Great price, work perfectly 
28865 4 Received product and tried installing it myself, that didn t work. Called D-Link customer service and received excellent assistance from Employee id# AR004671 
28866 3 Take with me all the time 
28867 2 The idia it s good and pricticle, but i being try to charge the remote control and i can t get a 100% charge. 
28868 4 Exactly what was needed. Worked as anticipated immediately and was pleasantly surprised with the additional charging devices. Appreciated the quick delivery. 
28869 4 Excellent. 
28870 3 Nice package but I did not realize the filters were only for the wide lens. No problem. 
28871 4 Fun 
28872 2 I had a couple of parts broken. A Lense was chipped and broken apart and the mini tripod broke but otherwise everything else works just fine. The tripod might be my fault though I don t know. 
28873 4 This is a great bag! It has great features to hold all my camera needs!!!!! 
28874 2 Decent camera, GORGEOUS screen and excellent functionality as far as sharing your photos on social media instantly, but if you re a serious amateur shutterbug, give this camera a pass. NOT good for theater/concert pictures. :/ 
28875 4 Easy to use 
28876 4 As advertised. Great replacement as it is longer than the factory cord. 
28877 4 This works just fine for my 18-5m lens for my Sony nex 3n! I m quite happy with it and see no problems! 
28878 4 fit my go pro hero 2 so I m good 
28879 4 Love love this bag much better then my previous one lots of space. Great ease of handling wish I would have had this one first. 
28880 4 Performed as expected. Reasonable quality for the price. Would recommend to a friend 
28881 4 awesome in every way. don t get a gopro, get the read deal. this blows gopro away. great seller 
28882 4 Makes it easy to align and do long exposures. 
28883 3 As someone over 6 feet tall, the strap is shorter than I like it. Other than that its great. Fit my Canon G16 perfect 
28884 4 perfect 
28885 4 It works properly and charges the battery quickly! 
28886 2 It has a nice level and quick release but the lock doesn t always hold well. 
28887 4 Makes a big difference in comfort from the original one that came with the camera. I can barely feel that it is there. 
28888 4 I can t live without it. Very nice product and good quality. 
28889 4 Changed up fine. Work well. 
28890 2 Most of the package is good. But the tripod is cheaply made. 
28891 4 Great 
28892 4 It s perfect for a nikon j4 or any of the series. 
28893 4 Works great. I have had no issues 
28894 4 Quick delivery, great camera features. Sharp colors, 42x zoom easy to use. 
28895 4 So great, purchased this for a 10th birthday. It was a huge hit ! 
28896 4 Perfect fit to the &#34;T&#34; 
28897 3 I feel like this case protects my camera very well. It stands up and has great padding inside. I like the &#34;hammock&#34; it keeps the camera from sitting on its lens. Only issue I have is that the zipper gets stuck on the corners or the bag with unzipping. 
28898 4 It has been so hard to take decent pictures with my camera phone!!! Finally someone came up with a way to IMPROVE the pics with THIS PRODUCT!! LOVE THIS!! 
28899 4 Great quality for the price! Still trying to get used to the whole connect wireless with WI-FI but overall it s worth it! 
28900 3 works great cheap price 
28901 3 Nice but for my TG-3 with the silicon skin it is a very tight fit. 
28902 3 Very good credit card machine works well! 
28903 4 Works as expected 
28904 4 looks absolutely real!! good quality for price!! 
28905 1 Don t waste your money. It doesn t hardly enlarge the slides at all, and is very cheaply made. 
28906 4 every thing ok 
28907 2 Too visible. I wanted a light that was less conspicuous. 
28908 3 Just what I needed. 
28909 4 Did its job 
28910 4 as expected 
28911 3 Good 
28912 3 Arrived at specified date. I have mo problems at all with it. It does seem a really good beginner drone. Crashed it a lot but with no breakage at all. Just picked up and took off again. 
28913 1 Nice but the bluetooth will not work the video on S6 Edge. 
28914 4 Perfect for aluminum housing for GoPro 4. Nice add-on. 
28915 4 Works well with Night Owl and Swann systems 
28916 4 Great quality Tripod! 
28917 4 No complaints here. Easy to use and makes the most of my poor photography skills. 
28918 1 This lens is not tack sharp. I had this exact lens before and it broke and that lens was much sharper than this one.... not sure what the deal is. 
28919 4 muy bueno 
28920 4 Easy to assemble and great quality. Would recommend for anyone! 
28921 4 I needed a spare battery and this charger was bundled with two, so that s it! 
28922 4 This camera is working perfectly in my home. I LOVE the wide angle lens, the motion detector and the Mic. 
28923 4 Thanks ...!! 
28924 4 I love it, hook it to a tree, railing, small, fits in your pocket. 
28925 3 Good solid case, protects memory cards very well. 
28926 4 I absolutely love this case; it fits my camera perfectly and has room for all of it s cords and accessories! 
28927 4 Best one I ve found so far, doesn t completely block the flash on the camera like the others do. 
28928 4 Takes awesome.pictures! Was really impressed! 
28929 4 Fits well 
28930 4 As advertised. 
28931 4 http://youtu.be/aQB3NtnNnlk 
28932 4 Bon produit et livraison rapide 
28933 1 Ok product. No a bad product but I should have got a more heavy duty product for surfing. 
28934 4 Works great. Perfect for multiple shots over long time periods. Or many quick shots in short time periods. Great for long exposure too. 
28935 4 Easy to install works nicely !! 
28936 4 perfect replacement for the remote. 
28937 4 Perfect charge 
28938 3 I got this mainly because I needed a clear filter to protect lens, and this was red on the outside, thought the matching red caps would be cool as well. Cap is cheap, falls off pretty easily with a little bump, but the filter is still nice. 
28939 2 its a pass trought device only, so make sure you have powered mics other than that is very well built and makes it convenient if you have multiple recording devices and or external mics. 
28940 2 Super heavy 
28941 3 nice product for the price 
28942 4 I installed two of these with Foscam 12 volt cameras. They work! 
28943 2 Arrived on time, but with open box. Filter a little dusty, plastic case obviously opened. No sign of wear on filter, though. 
28944 4 Good one 
28945 3 Very bright and useful only negative is the light has more of a blue tint rather than a natural light color which in turn leaves pictures with a. Blue hue. 
28946 4 Amazing binoculars for a great price! 
28947 0 cheaply made with bad quality.not real gopro stuff 
28948 3 I m a little disappointed that I had to pay to replace the top plate for one that actually works. Especially after I exchanged emails with them about the original being wonky. 
28949 3 Delivery was on time and case holds everything I use. 
28950 4 Small enough to fit in my messenger bag and super light weight. 
28951 4 Great quality picture and range of motion... 
28952 4 This product is far better than i thought it would be, very sturdy. 
28953 0 This does not fit Panasonic DMC-GF2. 
28954 2 I like the concept of this, and it works alright, but it makes it so you have to unscrew it to change the battery on the Nikon D5200. Not sure about other models of camera. 
28955 2 It s ok. Seems solidly built. Started immediately getting some sticky liquid coming out of the joints (viscous coupling?). It s not what I expected though... 
28956 4 this is a great little camera very happy with it 
28957 4 Very Good 
28958 4 An excellent and affordable way to protect your home. We have been using for about a year now. Still love it!!! 
28959 3 Works great. 
28960 4 nice easy use 
28961 4 good little camera. I use it on my boat 
28962 3 it s interesting toy,cheap than gopro,worth the price. 
28963 4 I saw some posts that suggested the battery was generic. Mine definitely said it was a Sony. What more can you say about a battery until it s been used for a while? Guessing it will be like other Sony products - very good. 
28964 4 Excellent 
28965 4 Selfie #YOLO 
28966 4 Love, Love, Love! 
28967 0 I ve been using Canon L lenses and this ND Filter is the worst I ever seen. Not even on manual focus can not get a decent picture. Sometimes cheaper is expensive is you are gonna lose clients taking photos. 
28968 4 working like a champ. way better than original batterys 
28969 4 Work awesome and it s extra long!!! 
28970 4 Works--keep checking for tightness 
28971 4 Product is very good and satisfactory. This seller s items are always welcome. 
28972 4 great battery and one I highly recommend to have on hand if you have an nx camera 
28973 4 Absolutely love my new Canon Soeedlite! It makes such a huge difference in my picture taking. My pictures now look like professional pictures. And it s not as hard to use as I d thought ! 
28974 4 Great case for a mirrorless slr (Sony a5100) Small enough to carry around easily but big enough to carry the camera and some accessories. The built in rain cover is really great. 
28975 4 This is a really nice tripod, the price was lower than I would expect for something this nice. 
28976 1 The degree of play due to the overall design/manufacturing and plastic internals make it hard to adjust and use this for reliably accurate focusing. 
28977 4 its solid...like a good battery 
28978 4 Comes with all the pieces and features you would need in a simple tripod. I love the quick release base. 
28979 4 Very good product so far I din t have any problem 
28980 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
28981 0 After light use, the ball head no longer holds. It shifts from one side to another, in a straight line, under light pressure. The no-name one I bought before this one works great. Go figure. 
28982 4 Great battery charger. I am very happy with the item and great sellers to do business with. Will most certainly buy from them again when I need something for my camera. Thank you! 
28983 4 Easily floats the Olympus TG-4 
28984 0 instructions are minimal. I can t seem to use this product because it doesn t seem compatible with my camera. I reached out to cowboy studio to see if they sold a remote connection and they never responded to my inquiry. 
28985 4 I really like this camera the quality of photos and videos are amazing. Very easy to use... 
28986 3 Lots of space. So far so good. Wish there was a water holding spot 
28987 3 works well with my all Canon lens, slow with autofocus, don t work with my Tamron 28-75 2.8 in Autofocus, but all of them work fine in Manual focus. 
28988 3 nice lens. 
28989 4 Exactly what I was expecting. Nice quality, great price. Even nicer that the owner hand signed a thank you in pen. 
28990 4 Good high resolution BNC camera for the money... Great daytime images OK for night does need better infrared for night use to get better images. 
28991 0 I’m truly disappointed with this product. At f5 150mm your picture is ok but as soon as you ZOOM further to 600mm the picture is get Hazy. I am waiting on a replacement...wouldn t recommend this product unless this issue is resolved. 
28992 4 This was perfect for my husband s home base business. It works great for his green screen. He has now picked up more business and making quality videos. I would recommend this to anyone. Great product and price. 
28993 4 Excelent 
28994 4 This is one of the best built monopods I have ever owned. High quality all the way through it and never an issue to work with. Recommend very highly. You cannot beat having this one. It works with you, no matter how you have to use it. I love mine. 
28995 4 Fast delivery, quality product. Thanks ! 
28996 4 Such a good price for a gopro product 
28997 1 This camera did not last very long. I ve got some that where bought direct from Lowes and they are still going strong. This camera only lasted 7 months before it died! Not sure why this one died so quick. 
28998 1 The lock broken in one month. It is very danger for an expensive DSLR. 
28999 3 https://youtu.be/XRIlIN1fJPg 
29000 4 Worked perfect. 
29001 0 China made crap. 
29002 4 Great Price. Great Service. 
29003 4 It was a gift for Grandson 
29004 4 Best color checker out there. 
29005 4 Excellent product and good price with good delivery time. This camera make me happy because i can take good quality pictures 
29006 4 This is a great little camera takes good photos this is the 4th one i bought. if it did not drop them they would last a lot longer for me. use it a lot and have taken thousand of photos with them for work 
29007 2 How is nobody talking about the fact that this camera doesn t have an external mic port!!! 
29008 4 This is a fantastic camera ! I m still learning all the things it can do, but I m well pleased with both the quality of photos and ease of operation. 
29009 4 Just what I expected. Very nice and in perfect condition. 
29010 4 Luv it....so much like my old Canon didn t take me long to learn. 
29011 1 Batteries stopped holding charge a year later. My SONY batteries that I bought with the camera long before that are still holding. Will not buy again. 
29012 4 love it works great 
29013 4 good 
29014 4 Perfect Product. I think it is great. 
29015 4 Amazing lens! My favorite lens! 
29016 4 Super light case that has just enough room for your base camera equipment along with a hydration pack. 
29017 4 thank you 
29018 4 Item received as described, thanks. 
29019 1 It could be better! 
29020 2 Connectors weren t fit right. 
29021 4 Good camera. Night vision is good 
29022 4 Gemtune 577C is a well build quick release plate. When I bought it I was hoping it was going to fit on my Benro S4 tripod head and it did! It fits perfect!!! And it also feets on my Benron K5 tripod head not perfect but it works. 
29023 4 Worked as stated 
29024 4 Convenient.Works as advertised 
29025 4 exact replacement for the charger I misplaced works great, shipped quickly 
29026 4 Perfect for my coolpix 530. Well padded with plenty of room for charger and extra batteries 
29027 4 Using it for DSC-RX100M3. Works fine. 
29028 4 Great transaction and looking forward to my next purchase. Can t believe the price versus high quality! These are my standard lens filters now and go on every lens I get from now on! 
29029 4 Best tripod for a heavy camera and lens! Agility and construction designed well. Based on the fact that the unit is designed to hold heavy components, it s a bit heavy, but I woul buy it again for a second camera. 
29030 4 This is a handy addition to your lens collection. It is a two part lens. The wide angle distance shots do have a curve to them. So be aware that it is not going to be a straight on shot. The macro portion is great! 
29031 4 Practical. Now, have battery to long time =) 
29032 3 Worked well. 
29033 4 NONE 
29034 4 these work great. i continue to buy more 
29035 4 Works, Can t really think of anything I would change. 
29036 4 Really good... More than expected... 
29037 4 I needed a tabletop tripod to use with my spotting scope on my terrace overlooking the East River in Manhattan. This small, sturdy item holds my heavy Kowa with ease. 
29038 4 No complaints, fit my product without any problems 
29039 4 Very nice product--cloths clean my glasses without scratching the lenses. I appreciate the individual plastic sleeves as well. 
29040 4 Very good 
29041 0 I could not activate the camera on my mac. Going to the default IP address by directly connecting to the mac or through the switch did not work. (It just hangs.) The included SADP software only works on Windows. It is going back. 
29042 4 Awesome works great! I love it! 
29043 4 worked great. Exactly what I needed. Expect to use them for a long time. 
29044 4 After figuring out how to sync my YN-560III flashes, the unit works great. The only thing I wish to be included in this unit is that Yongnuo put an option to turn off and on the flashes. 
29045 3 does take a day or 2 in the sun to charge batteries, but if you have enough you can always have some that are fully charged. 
29046 4 Henry very fast service. lots ok knowledge. pleasant to work with.I will recommend this product to all my friends. great camera. 
29047 4 good product. easy to configure 
29048 4 Great camera! 
29049 3 obodys perfect. Came as advertised. on time, just what I expected. 
29050 4 great product worked better than I expected delivery was on time 5 star all the way 
29051 4 great affordable lens. adds a nice touch to composition and does what it needs to do. works great on my sony a7 
29052 4 The security guys asked for $600, Well I bought these and installed them on existing wires as I had replaced my windows. Work like a charm , tested with security company all reeds work 100% 
29053 0 Inner lining separated. Poor stitching. I only used it a few times. But, unfortunate for me the return period has passed. I have only had it since June. 
29054 0 all wrong need np-fp50 
29055 4 Best buy! 
29056 0 The plastic ring around the lenses cracked just from having it in a bag. For a waterproof/ shockproof case this is absolutely unacceptable. Also the seal tends to not seat correctly so you have to really press to get it to seal. 
29057 2 No bag to carry the equipment and the umbrellas seem to be on the very low end of quality. 
29058 4 Meant for the 5D3 feels like a perfect extension of the camera. 
29059 4 excellent! 
29060 0 Same dust/oil spots issue as with D600 -- it s back to Nikon for maintenance again. Auto-focus gives up in low-light. 
29061 4 all ok 
29062 0 Not a real kit; multiple individual items shipped as a &#34;kit&#34;. The only authentic Canon item was the cleaning cloth. 
29063 4 Crystal clear view and a great addition to my cctv pack 
29064 0 Simply a joke and a ripoff. I had to place the leg of my dehumidifier on the battery to keep it in place long enough to charge it. Does not work. 
29065 4 Good value and perfect way to protect your lens investment. 
29066 2 Batteries are good for backup but are by far not as good as originals 
29067 4 thank you i feel more comfortable in my home now as it as done a wonderful job thank you again 
29068 4 Happy with the quality 
29069 4 Batteries charge quickly, and they use the same charging cable as the GoPro which is nice. Battery life is comparable to that of the battery that came with the GoPro; No complaints here!! 
29070 4 Love the ease of use and speed of attaching. I had to buy a second one for a second camera. Would highly recommend 
29071 4 I love it! 
29072 0 the product does not fit my Nikon D3300 camera even though it claim it does. But the return is pretty easy 
29073 4 Very light and comfortable. Seems like good quality for the price. The clasp mechanism is quite secure, though I use the backup strap as well just in case. Best solution I have used, way better than a regular neck strap, or just holding the camera in your hand. Very satisfied. 
29074 4 Excellent 
29075 4 Perfect item. Fits as snug as the one that came when I purchased the unit. Highly recommend this product and seller! 
29076 4 the filter is well made. and works well. 
29077 2 for the price i paid its good 
29078 4 Very good 
29079 3 Fun and cute designs! Order cam fast and in great condition. Would recommend! 
29080 3 I love the shots it captures and the price was right. 
29081 3 Steady, lightweight, and resistant. The ball head is ok for the price. But I would recommend to buy another if your doing panoramic or night photography. 
29082 3 The strap is comfortable. Would appreciate some instruction or suggested attachment ideas. None was included.. Tried to email provider but the suggested address didn t work 
29083 4 Camera fit perfectly in it! 
29084 4 great 
29085 4 A bit of wind can knock it over but it s ideal for the price. My first tripod and I m super happy with what I got. Stands up well and tall, also the grip latches work strong and in all it was a perfect buy. I highly recommend! :) 
29086 3 good camera, good quality videos even is 25 fps max on 1080p, the materials quality is ok 
29087 4 Good size, well padded, extra storage space, good price, and well built. 
29088 2 The band is high quality, but not quite wide enough. It tends to contract into the small space between the front of the lens and the manual focusing ring. 
29089 0 Although the unit seems to work fine (after modification). It did not include the us adaptor as advertised. 
29090 4 Works great!!! 
29091 2 Flimsy when up. Hard to handle without flipping over 
29092 4 Battery and charger are good 
29093 4 Everything in this kit has been very useful and one heck of a price. THe lens is sharp, light weight and everything you need for a walking. 
29094 4 performs well 
29095 4 Just got my X1 CPL and the thinness of the unit is absolutely incredible. I will be testing it out soon and leaving another review. But so far the packaging and the ultra slim construction have impressed me. 
29096 3 The first one I got wasn t a perfect fit for the lens, so they sent me a new one. Works great for my Sigma 18 - 35mm. With my Canon 70 - 210mm, it causes vignetting. 
29097 4 excellent product. 
29098 1 This is way hard to manipulate. 
29099 3 If you don t worry about pets, open the cover and pull the jumper off the board. MUCH better as it picks up movement almost instantly. Other than that, does what it needs to do. 
29100 4 Easy to adjust, easy to wear. 
29101 4 Great. Does exactly what it s supposed to and seems to be of excellent quality! 
29102 4 Used it for my wedding and I was thrilled with the results. 
29103 4 great lens, works as described. 
29104 4 Works as advertised. Have one in the house and one in the backyard. If anyone enters the garage we are immediately notified. 
29105 3 Just what I expected! 
29106 3 Does what is advertised. Very comfortable handle and easy to use mounting equipment 
29107 4 Recently received, It appears a sturdy, well made monopod. Just purchased a ball head for it, 
29108 3 Works great for all 4 of my bodies with a 70-200 (hood reversed), but grip will not fit. 
29109 4 excellent! 
29110 2 You will not be able to fit it in any case. more importantly, the flash will leave a dark mark where this large protrusion interferes with the flash. 
29111 3 works ok for my simple needs. 
29112 0 Non standard PoE and not advertised in the description of the product: it does not come with its own power supply and PoE injector and Samsung tries to sell its own solution with a recorder that costs a lot and has oownly 4 Ethernet imput adding 4 analog inputs 
29113 4 Wow amazing camera, great quality. 
29114 4 Perfect bag for the camera and accessory, great value and quality. 
29115 4 Damn this camera is the s***. Buy one. 
29116 4 The include foam breaks on in 1/2 inch squares allowing a perfect fit. I fit my Nikon D70, 2 standard lens and a 600 zoom along with my GoPro. 
29117 4 Works flawlessly. 
29118 3 Perfect for the small underwater camera, quick delivery, thanks! 
29119 4 excellent batteries 
29120 4 All good made it a great trip 
29121 0 DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT if you plan on using this in the ocean. I got this for bodysurfing and the camera snapped off the base almost immediately. My GoPro belongs to Mother Ocean now. And no....the waves were small - about 1.5 feet. 
29122 4 Good. 
29123 4 Not too much to say. It works perfectly, no sizing issues or difficulty putting on / taking off my camera. 
29124 4 arrived promptly and as promised, thank you 
29125 0 TERRIBLE SERVICE from the Seller. product broke in 2 months and no one will help replace. Not the seller and NOT HP. TERRIBLE al around. 
29126 3 The mount works nicely on most flashlights but ocassionally, the flashlight tends to drop on the floor during the middle of the ride due to the clamp doesn t have a top locking mechanism. It just had a half grip to hold your flashlights. 
29127 4 Great product. Works as described. Great service after the sale. 
29128 4 works well with a speedlite flash 
29129 3 Really good but I don t think it s $1000 good Returned and bought em5 mkii instead. Much happier 
29130 4 Good product. Work as expected. 
29131 4 Works. 
29132 4 Use it all the time and takes great shots 
29133 4 This is the best case for my phantom 
29134 2 Way too bulky. Impossible to go on trip without tripod and without tripod rings. 
29135 2 After very little use, one of the props continues to spins but without the force behind it to lift properly. 
29136 4 Gave it as gift for my Brother in law - He LOVES IT!!!! 
29137 4 Lost the charger for my camera and so happy to find it available on line. It works great and now I can use my camera again. 
29138 4 Works perfect on my d5300. Wanted a flash to get started with and its perfect for learning. Get the remotes too! 
29139 4 My wife LOVES them! They work great - better than we even expected! 
29140 3 for an LED light it takes a lot of batteries but it produces plenty of light. 
29141 0 Arrived after I left for vacation. didn t do any good setting on back porch. 
29142 3 arrived and in all working order good to go the batteries are heavy and you ll need to make a bace for them when charging but thats it 
29143 3 Simple to set up .Works great ! Thank you Price was also great 
29144 4 Very satisfied 
29145 4 Amazing product 
29146 4 It worked out fine. 
29147 0 everything was great but the camera settings won t change kinda of a bummer.. 
29148 4 Fits my Nikon Coolpix P530 perfectly and should fit all similar cameras. It s attractive looking and feels very well made. Very happy with my purchase, especially for the price. 
29149 4 Lightweight and compact. An excellent tripod for hikes and for backup. 
29150 4 Sold material works very well. I am using this to mount my H4N on my DSLR 
29151 4 this was exactly what I needed! 
29152 4 Worked just fine 
29153 4 Perfect match for my Sony camera. 
29154 4 Great little camera. Comes in handy when hooking up my boat trailer too. 
29155 2 Works well with the mobile app and easy to set up using the mobile app. However, I have yet to actually set up the camera because the detailed setup is way too confusing and difficult. The mobile app is good for basic features. 
29156 3 It was a little smaller than we anticipated but otherwise we are very happy with it. 
29157 4 Great Charger! I like the way it lets you know on the screen what is happening during the charge process. 
29158 3 Ordered this a week before a trip to Chicago. Not only did I receive it in time, but it fit and worked perfectly. 
29159 1 No comments 
29160 4 great. 
29161 4 Very happy 
29162 4 I really like this lens. It comes in a soft Pentax pouch. 
29163 4 It is exactly what I ordered and exactly what I needed. No problems! Works perfectly! 
29164 3 Works OK 
29165 0 Horrible!!! Do not buy!!! I used it twice and on the second use it blew a fuse, caused sparks to fly, and fried the cord... & a clients floor... Also the product is made cheaply 
29166 1 It s all all right!! 
29167 4 I am completely satisfied with this camera. I haven t had any problems. 
29168 3 A bit too small, even for my small camcorder ... but well made and designed. 
29169 4 Perfect! 
29170 4 Excellent Product! 
29171 4 They are best battery I ve ever used very good product don t mess with the rest 
29172 0 It never worked. 
29173 4 Arrived before I expected it and was fully charged out of the box, unlike the fuji battery that came with the camera. 
29174 1 The poor quality of this tripod was immediately apparent. Plastic, lightweight, I m not sure how it stands to support anyone s camera, but it was definitely not suitable for mine. 
29175 4 A++++ 
29176 4 It was easy to replace the old DVR with this one. Very straightforward to setup and access via the mobile apps. 
29177 4 Great 
29178 4 Took it with me to Yellowstone. Comfortable enough, and I liked all the different ways to get into the bag. I m a little concerned about the durability of the zippers. Had just the right amount of space for my regular lense, my telephoto and some extra things. 
29179 4 Just what it said it was. 
29180 3 I use it for outdoor work, good 
29181 3 Works like a charm! 
29182 4 Works great. 
29183 4 better than i expected. 
29184 4 This works great. I had to purchase this because I lost the cord for my camera. Now I can upload everything I want. 
29185 4 So easy to use and install. I love that I can check on the house while I am away. The picture is great too! 
29186 4 Great product, easy to use with my iPhone and my iPad. Quick shipping is a bonus!! 
29187 1 Works with my Sony camcorder however DOES NOT work with my Canon Rebel T1i. The Canon does not have the second hole on the bottom to attach it to the tripod base :( 
29188 4 Good package deal! The camera is very good and have been getting great results so far. 
29189 4 Arrived very quick. I love how pictures are capture. 
29190 4 Just the right size for &#34;Grab n Go&#34;. 
29191 2 This tripod is great for run and gun , the only issues are the legs , after the 4th time i used it the lega became loose , maybe the item that i got is bad , other than that run and gun shoulder stablizer was amazing 
29192 4 Excelente. 
29193 4 These are the best deals on security cameras I have came across. They work just as well as the high price cameras. They are weather proof. The IR s work great in total darkness and they have a wide angle lens that covers a larger area. A GREAT DEAL.... 
29194 4 Use this while on vacation. Could have one battery in the camera and the other one in the charger 
29195 4 Excellent product 
29196 4 Love this bad so far. Wish there was a few extra small zippered pockets to keep some smaller accessories separate, but all in all its been a great bag so far. 
29197 4 Perfect, no need to purchase a light stand when I have extra tripods! 
29198 4 Love it. easy to setup. Takes a bit to get used to the navigation. Wife loves it. She can fast forward thru the commercials. Worth every penny. 
29199 4 very lightweight and easy to carry. well done. 
29200 4 okay 
29201 4 Wonderful 
29202 4 A really fine focuser. Built well, heavy duty, very smooth and powerful. A worthy upgrade for a fine telescope. 
29203 3 pretty good camera, had it for 6-7 months and a camera has already gone bad. but pretty good picture. You want know who robbed you, but that you got robbed! 
29204 4 Fantastic little monitor!!! You simply can t beat the quality and features at this price range. Wish it had SDI IN/OUT and HDMI out, but come on... for $139... this IPS monitor is AMAZING!!! I promise you wont regret it! 
29205 4 This Kit is awesome, Worth every penny, It has all that you need to clean the sensitive parts of your camera. I love it. 
29206 2 The video is blurry and unable to capture license plate numbers. I guess you get what you pay for. I will be buying a better one. Sounds are good. The video gets distorted when it gets too hot. 
29207 3 A high quality product. 
29208 3 was a gift. Very well received. 
29209 4 Great Product! 
29210 4 Friend went through. 3 batteries before I went through one with this 
29211 4 A quality piece of equipment. It fits well and is well made. The extra quarter inch added to the bottom of my Sony a7mk2 makes it easier to hold. Combine that with the ease of using the arca swiss style plate and it is a win, win. 
29212 4 Great product, great price 
29213 3 The remote works well but their is no bag that comes with it for protection. 
29214 0 Not an infrared filter - it is a neutral density filter - you can see light through the filter 
29215 3 Great Product 
29216 2 The camera is too &#34;smart&#34; constantly adjusting...I need to read and look up youtube demos. Some of the flash photos have a bit of red in the color. It is heaver than expected and cannot be concealed at concerts...OK (sue me) anyway the dog doesn t mind the flash. 
29217 4 Works great! 
29218 4 Works great! And very economical. 
29219 4 They fit like a charm! 
29220 4 The camera was all that I expected and more. I m very pleased with this product. 
29221 0 junk 
29222 3 I liked the product 
29223 4 I got this for my 9 and 13 year old boys. They love it! Took a few tries to figure out how to fly it, but once they got the hang of it, it is great. Just make sure you go to an open field. 
29224 2 Does not fit the GPH4B perfectly, it s a bit loose. 
29225 4 Loved it, great condition, excellent pics, better than Nikon 200 
29226 4 Very helpful!!! 
29227 2 Great for everyday use, pictures are not as crisp as what I am used to. Good value, if you want great photos, spend more. 
29228 4 Exactly what I wanted perfect and for the price 
29229 4 This charger never gave me any issues, and did just what it was supposed to do: Charge batteries. Even though it s not an &#34;official&#34; Song charger, it still works perfectly. 
29230 0 It was good... until I dove just below the surface of the water... then it leaked 
29231 0 useless 
29232 4 Works great for our Nikon camera! 
29233 4 This lens fits perfectly with my Sony A5100 camera. The pictures are crystal clear. Totally worth it for the price! 
29234 1 not good spend more and get something stronger 
29235 4 Great quality adapter ring screws smoothly no binding onto camera lens and filters.Fast shipping too thanks Goja. 
29236 4 It worked fine 
29237 4 perfect camera if your into the outdoors and are hard on cameras. has never let me down ... even with underwater pictures 
29238 4 Extremely surprised - super great sound quality. Appears is little cheap (pastic wise), but does the job. Used them on my Canon 70D. Picks up great sounds from the back of an auditorium (80-100ft). 
29239 4 Works as advertised. Charged up my batteries for my range finder. 
29240 4 Great replacement. 
29241 4 Its a bit darker, but not enough to offset how helpful this focusing screen really is. Recommended for anyone with fast glass. 
29242 4 Works as advertised 
29243 0 Could not get to work with Mac edited images. Returned 
29244 4 Works on iPhones, cameras & small animals!!! I have even used it to read books. ymmv 
29245 0 just too light to be useful - going to return mine 
29246 1 meh. My older coolpix took nicer pictures. was really hard to figure out how to connect to my phone. returned it. 
29247 1 I m sure this is a fine product, but could never get it to transfer images from my camera. Remote control worked okay, but never transfer. 
29248 4 Well made perfect fit, looks like it belongs with the camera. Saved me from hitting buttons while holding the camera. And made my grip better. Love the material, aircraft quality machining. 
29249 3 Worked as expected. Charged batteries without issue. Only thing I did not l like is that the plug is attached to the unit. Not on a cable. This made it problematic with multiple charging units on wall outlets and strips. Other than that, it is a good purchase. 
29250 4 I go through lots of these it seems 
29251 4 excellent 
29252 3 Everything is good and just wish the recording resolution is bit higher than 480. 
29253 4 Top choice 
29254 1 At random, the system would restart or get stuck for no reason. Other than that, the unit is OK for the price. 
29255 1 Don t be fooled. The color is florescent pink, but its not florescent at all. Impossible to see with full blackout on stage. Unfortunately, this is of no use to me. 
29256 4 Works as advertised, looks good, feels good. glad I could use this on my A580 instead of the big expensive unit Sony says is needed. 
29257 2 I m in the installation task and adjusting the wi fi configuration. 
29258 4 Everything I needed and more for all my small cameras! 
29259 3 Great little case well made overall! I will be buying a larger version very soon 
29260 4 This is the tripod I ve been looking at. 
29261 3 Good hood for the money. The clasping system is very cheesy in my opinion however that is not their fault that canon made that bad call. If it had the flocking is give it 5stars but overall nice for the money! 
29262 4 Really good pictures for a small inexpensive camera. Nice size when traveling and want to take a lot of pictures and not use I-Phone 
29263 3 Good. Just what expected. 
29264 3 easy to set up like all Nest items but I wish you could move the camera remotely. 
29265 4 Amazing and funny toy. Excelent for beginners. 
29266 4 An excellent buy! 
29267 4 I have taken this camera just about everywhere so far. The ocean, mountain biking, on roller coasters, and hiking. I even mounted it on the side of my speed skates for a pretty cool angle. I m very pleased with the outcome, and the cost was great. well worth it. 
29268 4 Thanks. This will be my extra battery. 
29269 2 Good bag, but after owning for awhile the velcro attached to the straps ruined any shirt I had on. Was not noticeable at the time, until it ruined a sweater to the point that I no longer wore it. 
29270 1 Don t work well 
29271 4 Worked just as well as the original, and having the travel charger was great. 
29272 4 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
29273 3 Was exactly the camera I was looking for as a gift for my granddaughter for her birthday. Great size and weight for a 10 year old. Easy for her to use. 
29274 4 Ordered this to fit my binoculars. Great product, very thick foamy material on the strap. Easily hooks to camera. Feels very secure. You shouldn t be anything but satisfied with this, if it s what you are looking for. 
29275 0 NEEED MY MONEY BACK!!!! thanks 
29276 3 great seller - delivered as promised! 
29277 4 Very impressed with the system. Picture quality was more than expected, set up was fairly easier. Love the fact that can link multiple devices and have 24 hours live access at no charge. Very happy. 
29278 1 Stopped working less than 3 months after purchase. 
29279 3 Yes this is a very good case but my Nikon D750 did not fit in it. But for my D90 it was perfect. If you want it for D750 or D810 please look for something else. 
29280 3 No complaints on the quality. I do wish it had more capacity. There s really not enough room for anything more than the basics. Room for extra batteries, a small charger, and touch screen back pack accessory (for hero 4 black) would be nice. 
29281 3 Great image quality. But i m still using my pen lens for everyday ... size does matter especially in the small mirrorless category. But still it s a great lens. 
29282 4 Works perfectly! 
29283 0 The model I received (which might be a fluke) would not even hold my GoPro after I locked into place. I was really disappointed. 
29284 4 Works great. I used it to look at dates and markings on coins. 
29285 4 Great motor. It s a bit bigger than regular Nema 23 motor, but hole spacing and sizing and everything, fits everything made for Nema 23. It is also much stronger than any Nema 23 motor that you can get and can be wired to be parallel or serial. 
29286 4 kenneth was helpful with setting up an external ip address for us to view our camera from a different network. At times it was hard to understand him. But overall it was a positive experience and we were able to set it up successfully. 
29287 4 Package hot here on time. Love the camera! Great purchase! Thank you. 
29288 4 Took this little Action Camera with us to Puerto Rico and it worked perfect. I bought the extra battery pack and boy was that handy! I recommend this product for the price and its quality. 
29289 4 I bought it for my niece she really loved it. Everything work and fit perfect 
29290 0 not was I was hoping for… 
29291 4 Does a great job. Easy to set up on my phone too! 
29292 4 The adhesive is great. They are still on my lens months later. 
29293 3 Good 
29294 4 Great product 
29295 3 Fools everyone. 
29296 4 Absolutely amazing!! Huge upgrade over my Phantom 2. 
29297 4 Great filter. Now I can shoot video in sunny condition with low aperture and fixed shutter speed. Good deal! 
29298 3 Great bargain easy to use, fairly intuitive, but recommend reading the manual first. 
29299 4 i have an extra battery for gopro now. it works~ 
29300 4 this was just what my little camera needed to help stabilize it to eliminate blurred photos! 
29301 4 We attach this to a model rocket, and the audio and video are awesome. 
29302 4 their perfect 
29303 0 Thought it was a good value, but to good to be true... pictures not consistently clear and didn t double focal sight. 
29304 2 it s ok 
29305 4 Fast delivery. Batteries fit & worked fine in my Nikon S9900 camera. 
29306 3 and it will hold more that just filters; things like lens caps and body caps; I wish it closed more tightly (the Velcro is not wide enough if the case is not really stuffed full). 
29307 4 Wasn t sure what to expect because of price, but it really holds a charge. 
29308 4 Al Was perfect 
29309 4 Met my expectations and was priced right. 
29310 1 to small, good golly how did they make it. 
29311 4 Great selfie stick. very portable and surprisingly sturdy. inexpensive and fashionable. even works on snapchat. 
29312 3 works woderfuly keeps my Nikon D3200 lens clean 
29313 3 good product 
29314 2 Its okay, video looks good in the cam-recorder s screen, But, while seeing in the computer, it is okay, not very good. Picture quality is also pretty ordinary. 
29315 4 Just what we were looking for. Well satisfied! 
29316 4 Great Product! Why pay $60 for the Black Rappid when this is the same thing for a fraction of the cost 
29317 4 The quality of the head strap was great! 
29318 4 works great and feels sturdy while use in my go pro4 camera 
29319 4 Great little camera very sharp pictures easy to use 
29320 4 Great when shooting low to the ground. I use with a baby backdrop stand and an umbrella. Also good for back lighting a backdrop. 
29321 4 Excelent 
29322 3 The price is fair and the item is built in pretty strong material. I use it to mount my digital recorder on top of the DSLR. It works fine. 
29323 4 Camera works. Put it under my garage door opener and now if door is open get constant video. You can turn off too. 
29324 4 Good dependable power I think a bit over priced. 
29325 4 dank 
29326 4 This Brinno camera is outstanding. Many operational choices. Very fast shipping service. Construction is perfect. Well thought out design. 
29327 4 Does what I expect for a camera at this price point. One heel of a zoom range! Sometimes a little slow focusing in busy areas. Pretty crisp and clear too. 
29328 4 might need it 
29329 4 The internal screw terminals allowing an external sensor was a welcome surprise. This should be part of the documentation. I discovered that it worked by testing it. Sensors out in the garage are working well, but needed a repeater. 
29330 4 These are great batteries. Just what I wanted. 
29331 4 Not only protects the hot shoe when not in use, but also provdes a convenient spirit level! 
29332 4 Fast best-of-the-breed telephoto lens. Fantastic pairing with a tc-14e III teleconverter and/or aps-c camera for extra reach. It s big and heavy though but personally I find it manageable. You will get a workout but I m still spry and haven t been hospitalized because of that. 
29333 4 nice 
29334 4 great for my river raft trip 
29335 2 Doesn t do much 
29336 4 We love our GoPro! This thing is amazing! The editing program is very user friendly as well. I recommend buying some kind of steadying mechanism though... the video will look so much more professional if it s not as shaky. 
29337 4 Good quality and really amazing 
29338 3 doesn t go to terribly far but it s lighter then a d celled one 
29339 4 Looks nice and cool. Seems to be sturdy. Would recommend. 
29340 1 Had to discover after delivery that this item will not function without buying the additional Capture Camera Clip for 59.95$. Either sell the entire kit in working condition or don t sell at all 
29341 2 Served the purpose to communicate from the 1st floor to the 2nd floor. No power plug was included so they run on batteries which only last one week. 
29342 4 Awesome. I live one block from Lake Erie in Ohio. I love all the ways to use my go-pro gear-pro camera. I would highly recommend to take on vacations and adventures. 
29343 4 Arrived on time and better than expected. Great product when you don’t have three arms. 
29344 4 Amazing bag- really cant say enough about it. Even let friends borrow it for their Hawaiian honeymoon when they went hiking and they loved it. We used it all of Europe and it was invaluable! My husband felt comfortable wearing it and didnt feel out of place. 
29345 0 I don t know who comes up with these things. They should go work for Mattel. This thing is a joke! 
29346 4 Connects with Microsoft LifeCam Studio 1080p HD Webcam (Q2F-00013) 
29347 2 The telephoto lens works fine but the adapter included in this kit did not fit my G16. The telephoto lens does however fit a real Canon LA-DC58L lens adapter. Since I really bought this for the lens I m satisfied with this purchase. 
29348 4 It was a steal. I shoot music videos with it. I shoot events. Its great i just need extra batteries. 
29349 3 These batteries are added to my growing collection of LP-E6 s for my 5D and SmallHD monitors. They seem to work as good as my OEM batts as well as my Chili and Wasabi Power batteries. Thanks STK 
29350 3 Everything worked as described. The charger was slower than I expected, but it did charge the batteries completely. 
29351 4 The batteries are great and the delivery was earlier than promised or expected. All together a great experience for me with Amazon! 
29352 4 Great product and a good quality for how cheap it is! 
29353 4 Received as expected and works great on my Nikon D5000. Slipped on easily and is very comfortable to use. Great product so and I would definitely order this again! 
29354 4 Great 
29355 4 Worked well give it 5 stars 
29356 0 just because I ordered to a European address didn t mean I wanted the Eruo plug... super inconvenient since I m not even in Europe any more. 
29357 4 good little lamps 
29358 4 Henry was absolutely wonderful! He totally got both of my cameras set up. I didn t have to really do anything, whioch was great being I do not understand a lot about computers. Thank you again Henry! 
29359 4 I have old Nikon and new Panasonic. Went on trip to Alaska. Held batter charger and batteries and san discs. 
29360 4 Perfect 
29361 2 This external viewfinder actually works quite well, but it s prone to breakage since it s dangling off of the camera. Also, for $250, I would recommend just getting the newer Sony A6000 or NEX 6 that both have viewfinders. 
29362 4 favorite black and white film 
29363 0 No quality control at all! :( - Monopod sections don t lock, so camera flops down, rotates with gravity. - One of the lens adapters doesn t thread properly - Remote doesn t work (Even tried a fresh battery) 
29364 4 User friendly, crisp imagery, good battery life. 
29365 4 Great product and fast shipping. Just as described. Thank you! 
29366 1 Works fine for just a hint of extra lighting or if used as backlighting, but makes VERY LITTLE difference. Get something a little stronger. 
29367 0 The batteries do not hold a charge. We charged them for 24 hours before using them and they lasted less than 20 minutes. 
29368 4 I had some difficulty setting up external access from the web, BUT I called the Foscam tech support people and spoke to a gentleman named Edward, and he fixed me up in under 5 minutes. so far so good. great resolution on this camera 
29369 4 Love this case, came as shown in picture. The foam was easy to remove and everything fits snug. 
29370 2 I didn t make note of the three inch size when I purchased them. They are really little! 
29371 4 I love this bag!! perfect size and looks more expensive than what I paid :) 
29372 4 Love it. 
29373 3 good price and product. 
29374 4 My 15 year old loves this camera. The film is very expensive, but it is a very fun camera she uses with her friends. 
29375 4 Great film. Enlarged one of my Ektar negatives to 20x20. Looks fantastic on my wall, professionally framed. Amazing skin tone quality. 
29376 3 Good price. 
29377 4 Don t be fooled because this is a third-party brand; this is an outstanding lens! I used it on my Canon 7D. It s manual, but don t be scared of that. It produces some great images and the 8mm is perfect for crop sensor bodies. 
29378 4 as expected 
29379 4 Great features, Love the ease of use, Got this for a parent that s not super tech savvy and the fact that there s a button for taking pictures and another for recording video is awesome! 
29380 0 Do not buy. Accessories are not as per the details provided. And after sales experience is also bad. 
29381 4 nice adapter now I can use all my Nikon lenses on my Sony vg10 
29382 0 Did NOT fit my camera 
29383 4 very pleased with it all! 
29384 4 Love it! So much for a great price!!! :D So happy!!! 
29385 2 Not built very well and the tolerances are not great, but you get what you paid for. The item works well enough for me and I am satisfied with it. If you are doing hobby level macro photography, this works just fine. 
29386 4 If you don t have one of these you need to. i had some stains on my UV filter that lens cloth wont touch. But after useing this pen they where gone. i gave thisitem fivestars. 
29387 4 Great protection 
29388 4 Excellent lighting solution for my video game streaming set up! 
29389 4 I use this w/ a Tascam to record my mando. Rock solid. Finding well-made stuff in the sea of never-ending (cr*p) makes me Happy. 
29390 4 works great 
29391 4 Works like original battery in my Minolta digital camera 
29392 4 I tested this in a pool and no leaks! I was going to use it on a snorkel tour, but it was canceled. Not sure how well it works in deep water 
29393 4 I really love this lens! 
29394 1 worked great but now after charging the camera says the batteries are dead. Cannot seem to charge them at all 
29395 4 Works as described. Easy and the case is very nice 
29396 4 Just used it on our river trip in Europe and found the settings to be spot on. Threads easily and adjusts smoothly. A good universal fader. 
29397 0 Broken and not working when it arrived. 
29398 4 I like it it is working fine 
29399 4 everything fine. works great. 
29400 4 Works great, and I especially like the car adapter. 
29401 4 The order came in record time and was exactly as advertised. The pole looks very well made, with robust aluminum parts and no cheap plastic. Company seemed to take suggestions about its last iteration of this pole to heart and made the lock screw captive. Very pleased so far! 
29402 4 A cozy but good fit for the Canon SX 50. Room for extra battery and memory cards. 
29403 4 A relief to find avreplacement that works. Go-Pro was no help and don t support older products! 
29404 4 same as OEM if u wanna save a few bucks buy em 
29405 4 Excellent!!! 
29406 3 Nice kit, I ordered it for the hood. It is good enough and stylish, I like it. Filters are fine and I like the case they came in, very handy and useful. Came fast and well packaged. I recommend this item and the seller. 
29407 3 This product is good and reliable! Packaging was good! 
29408 4 Very good enclosure and mount for the Dropcam Pro or NEST camera outside. Just add a Fosmon 10ft Micro USB to USB Flat cable to get under a closed window and you have a perfect installation 
29409 4 We used these for our wedding guests to take selfies at the wedding reception. You have to find a place who will develop these and they have to be sent away for processing. We loved the idea and it was fun! 
29410 4 Outstanding Item and fast shipping. 
29411 2 Worked fine, though I never did figure out how to use the dividers. In the end it met my needs to have a sturdy, safe way to store and transport my family s collection of slides from the 1950 s-1970 s. 
29412 4 was a gift. no complaints so far. 
29413 4 Battery hold a great charge! Good value and well built. 
29414 4 So far so good! Still can t believe the price for this bundle. Looking forward to diving more into this product. 
29415 3 Met every expectation 
29416 4 Seems just fine. No problem, no regrets. Good value. 
29417 0 Package arrived on time as promised. Batteries did not last as long as original GoPro battery. One battery worked once and then would not charge again. Package returned. 
29418 4 great price and works great 
29419 0 The battery gets discharged completely if left in the camera overnight. It recharges fine and it says it s 100%, but doesn t hold the charge at all. I have Canon and STP brands also and they work fine. Total waste of money. 
29420 4 Great size & colors that won t get lost in the bottom of your bag! 
29421 4 very compact and easy to use. 
29422 2 I haven t cracked the code of shooting with a white background yet. Everything turns out gray unless it s essentially over exposed. That said, this is a decent little setup for occasional use. 
29423 1 Easy to setup. Mydlink works great on Android. BUT The picture quality is way below expected. I increased the resolution which helped, but nothing was ever in perfect focus at any distance or lighting. Disappointed 
29424 4 buy it, strap and brackets work well 
29425 0 Its ok but hard to set up 
29426 3 Very well made. I used a youtube video to get it on my camera, which I recommend because if you put the strap on wrong it can come off and your camera can break. This strap is very solid and the pattern is beautiful. 
29427 4 Make sure to pick up the right SD card for best performance 
29428 4 great product thank you 
29429 2 Worked well but after a couple weeks the app is not working so I can view on my phone! I am pretty angry cause I can t get it to work. The cameras work fine and do their job. App sucks. 
29430 4 AMAZING!! There isn t one thing in here that I have a complaint about!!! All of it worked awesomely, is durable, and I have yet to have a problem with any of it. Plan to buy two more for Christmas gifts! 
29431 4 Richard Helped me the reest of the way the cameras aree great and the wireless distance in my case is excelllent aso have utdoors wide excuse me i have treemors 
29432 4 Worked like new. 
29433 4 Works nicely love it! Picked it over the Dropcam. Very happy used it for a few months now. 
29434 4 Everything came as described. The cleaning pen works very well. Plus you can never have too many microfiber cloths 
29435 4 Shipping is fast and quality is good 
29436 4 Very nice filter. Slim profile and machined very well. 
29437 4 Haven t tested it out yet but it is obviously made of high quality materials! 
29438 3 I like it! 
29439 4 used this in the ocean with my go pro and it worked great 
29440 4 Great mount, aggressive price. 
29441 2 Too big for bikes or motorcycles 
29442 4 great! 
29443 4 This was a real surprise. It was a cheap gag stocking stuffer gift for my wife. The gag was on me. We have used our GoPro soo much more with this than ever before. Definitely worth the price and convenience. 
29444 4 as described 
29445 2 Seemed like a good product. I just wanted more of a walkie talkie so I could use inside unite anywhere in my house. Seller was very good about saying they would give me a refund. 
29446 4 Awesome. If I ever need a part I will definitely use them again 
29447 4 Was a gift for my daughter and she really likes it...she used to have the same one that her son drop by mistake inside the water.... it became a perfect gift for her :) 
29448 4 Minimal design, Solid construction. Needed to mount my monitor on to my gimbal. Works great 
29449 2 Our dial was broken but we did not get a chance to return it before the 30-day window. Luckily, the manufacturer fixed it under warranty it just took a while. 
29450 4 These are visitor brand batteries at a Bargain price as far as I can see. Basically getting three for the cost of one fuji battery. Came well Packaged and Fully charged. Superfast service. Highly reccomended 
29451 4 heck ya 
29452 4 This filter is superb, use it all the time when traveling especially 
29453 4 As described, great Product. 
29454 4 It s great to have an external charger and extra batteries. They save a lot of fusle. 
29455 2 Is ok 
29456 4 good quality. 
29457 4 Great case 
29458 4 Just like the original! 
29459 4 This was perfect for a trip I just did to Nicaragua. It helped me to have great pictures and not having to worry about my camera. 
29460 4 This case is the perfect fit for my DJI Phantom3! Plenty of room for all accessories including my ipad! It keeps everything firmly in place and can be adapted to almost any accessory that you might have. The wheels and handle are rugged and store away nicely for travel. 
29461 3 Works well 
29462 4 Henry 
29463 4 Very good quality and fun to use As described, easy to use, bluetooth paired without problems with my samsung. Good quality design, the phone holder grips the phone securely, when unextended its like the size of a normal umbrella, fits into the handbag. Worth every penny, no regrets. 
29464 3 shorter than expected, but I ve heard it s all about how you use it and size isn t necessarily everything... 
29465 1 Cheap plastic lenses, scratch easily... Shade limits photo area & casts shadows at certain angles 
29466 4 Have been using this for a long time now. Works great. Always keep extra batteries available when on vacation. 
29467 0 fake 
29468 4 Good value and easy to set up 
29469 4 I haven t actually testing this under water, but I m happy with it. It s just what the description says it is. 
29470 4 excellent 
29471 3 I finally received my order I believe it was lost in transit. I have used a product and it is like magic 
29472 4 Great product, well built, easy to use, delivered on time. 
29473 4 Nice case 
29474 4 Yep! It works! 
29475 0 The cold shoes are milled wrong and will not accept a flash shoe. 
29476 0 Flimsy and poorly crafted. Strap broke in 3 days. Stitching started to come apart after 6 days. Stay away! 
29477 1 field of view small. recordings will not play back on mac or pc. 
29478 4 VERY cute film!! I m definitely looking forward to using it as it is definitely one of those &#34;here&#34; moments for your fujifilm. I will treasure it and it came very fast and securely packaged! Would order again! 
29479 4 As described. 
29480 3 Nice case - covers lower body and easy to take on and off - looks good. Has little door on side to open for access to USB. One drawback which others have mentioned is to change battery or get access to SD card you must remove the case. 
29481 3 It would have been better if it could charge from USB port. But overall it is pretty good price and quality for two battaries. 
29482 2 This camera is everything I wanted, except the battery doesn t last as long as I would like. This is great for sports pictures, they came out crystal clear, love it. 
29483 4 Very nice strap, I have a full frame DSLR and been wanting a different strap but didn t like the ones that connect to the tripod mount. I saw another photographer with one of these and he liked it and I really like it also. 
29484 4 Fantastic strap that really fits. Shot all day, all week and hand rested well when camera hanging down. Room to use index finger on shutter for once. Great device. 
29485 4 Excelente 
29486 0 Horrible...replaced the bulb and blew within a week I would not buy this!!! 
29487 4 Great for that extra camera body so it is ready to go onto your harness. Nice and snug and good firm click when engaged. I do not worry about them coming undone. 
29488 3 fits loose but it seems ok i ll try it later this week. 
29489 4 Great Product 
29490 4 good value and works like original 
29491 0 Terrible &#34;x&#34; banding at darker settings 
29492 3 works good 
29493 4 Works great Great back up. Holds charge. Similar to original Canon battery. 
29494 4 Excellent product and great customer service!! The seller worked with me to fix some issues which were caused by me. Highly recommended. 
29495 0 I didn t even receive the rilakuma film. It was little twin stars. What the heckie! 
29496 4 I really like these. I ve bought four of them. Their mount is a little bit hokey, but it works, just gotta be careful. can be used on the camera, or hand held. Really very flexible and at a good price. 
29497 4 Awesome! 
29498 2 One stopped holding a charge and inflated in size indicating short circuit, the other worked fine 
29499 0 cheap made 
29500 0 wrong size for my camera 
29501 4 Great size pictures for scrap booking 
29502 4 It is what it is and what it is is fun. 
29503 4 This product arrived as promised. Everything that was described on the site was delivered. Very satisfied overall 
29504 4 it worked perfectly for my camera and got here just in time! 
29505 3 As advertised. 
29506 2 It holds the microphone. Can still hear shocks though. 
29507 3 Good product and received it quickly 
29508 4 Worked perfectly with my camera. 
29509 4 Obviously not top of the line. But it does the job wonderfully! I used this because I will be upgrading my camera soon and the underwater housing for the camera I will be upgrading to would not fit my camera now. So until then I will use this! 
29510 0 I can t say if the video quality is good or not because I can t figure out how to work it. The instructions are terrible and don t make any sense. I would love to be able to find a video showing you how to use this. 
29511 4 Love this camera. Got it for under $100. The red is nice color. Needed wifi camera with 1080p hd video and at least 16mp and this does the job. Bought accessory pack for $20 for case and extra battery. 
29512 4 Great for pics with baby. Cute 
29513 3 Nice camera for a decent price. However, I was eager about the wifi automatic uploading function. It is WAYYYY too complicated - I have never gotten it to work, and I am not tech illiterate. 
29514 1 Not work after two weeks 
29515 4 It is really good 
29516 4 as promoised 
29517 4 wonderful and easy camera to understand and use. 
29518 3 its a case ? 
29519 2 A little bulky 
29520 3 Super handy. I have to always use them with stage weights or sand bags. The base legs do not spread wide enough considering the giant sail that is attached to them. Very light weight, so treat them gingerly. 
29521 0 not much room at all 
29522 4 Works great from the moment it arrived which was on time. 
29523 4 Works Great. Very small and compact, can trigger the camera from the front, or from the back of the IR detector on the camera. Includes 2 buttons - one for focus and shutter release and the other is for a 2 sec delay. Tested range - 3m. 
29524 4 Wonderful camera and you get sooooo much with it for the price! Love it! Perfect for beginner or intermediate photographers! 
29525 4 Not gopro brand but high quality none the the less, great product for the price 
29526 3 Great quality. Not a huge fan of the fish eye but was expected with wide angle lens. 
29527 2 Novelty camera, photos are small and washed out. Don,t waste your money 
29528 3 As an amateur, i found this camera excellent, easy to operate, realistic colors and the build quality is very sturdy as you expect in a product like this. Lens upgrade is a must, the default lens is a bit poor in zoom in my opinion. 
29529 4 Worked great for my application. I m very pleased. Plugs into mic input for DSLR camera. Works for computer and iPad also. 
29530 4 Dove with these about 8 times up to 65 feet and had no fogging problems. I also used a stock gopro 1 and had no leaks, did not use any special dive case. 
29531 4 To expensive 
29532 4 Easy to use, lightweight and compact and came with all the accessories I needed. Shipping was quick! 
29533 1 The eye cup is too big for the Nikon D7100. It s loose and the right side partially blocks the diopter. 
29534 4 Batteries work great in my night vision scope... 
29535 1 Two stars 
29536 4 In the day its a wide clear color view... at night its clear black and white in the pitch dark :) 
29537 4 really surprising 
29538 3 I haven t used it yet, saving it for my cruise in October, but my camera fits nicely into this pouch, and it s triple sealed so you camera won t get wet. 
29539 0 Description is deceiving it states, &#34;higher quality video than what is provided through cable and satellite operators,&#34; which leads you to believe it can work with Cable or satellite TV and it does not. 
29540 4 As described 
29541 4 Works fine 
29542 4 Work like a charm, dusts on sensor of my Nikon D7000 were cleaned, thanks 
29543 4 This should hold my 15 x 56 binoculars steady. 
29544 0 A security camera has no Audio!! Whats the $190 for ?! that was the worse purchase I made within years. On top of that there at least couple of seconds delay. Non of these is acceptable for security camera, garbage! 
29545 4 THIS WORKS LIKE A FRONT LENS CAP SHOULD!!! WHOa !!!1! 
29546 3 Good product for the price; but doesnt feel it s going to be durable... screws seem they will break with use after a few months...let s see... 
29547 4 Excellent 
29548 4 Work just fine. No surprises 
29549 4 nice item, works well on my bag 
29550 3 Good protection at a decent price. 
29551 4 Arrived as described and on time. Thanks 
29552 3 Not the highest quality build that you have ever seen but it does what it needs to do and does it pretty well actually. It has very bright lights and takes double A batteries and it does last a pretty long time. So pretty good purchase made here! 
29553 0 not very sturdy. recommended to spend extra money on the actual stick from GoPro 
29554 4 We love this. It makes the target you are shooting about 100 yards closer. 
29555 3 Excellent 
29556 4 Essential equipment for all photographers can t wait to give it a try. Especially for night and tripod shooting. 
29557 4 I bought this lens for astrophotography. I tried on a clear night in a place away from city lights. The results met my expectations. I recommend this lens to anyone starting in astrophotography with a DSRL. 
29558 4 Just what I needed. Thanks 
29559 4 Great tripod. Grips to anything. Small and compact. Very easy to use. 
29560 4 Awesome camera, setup was a snap! 
29561 4 Awesome video quality, light weight and small in size. Perfect for my 250 quad build. Will do business with again Thanks! 
29562 4 Received these and have charged them up, work fine, thanks much. 
29563 4 Excellent product. Works great. I couldn t get all the features to work at the beginning. Called customers support and spoke with Calvin, everything working perfectly now. He helped me set up the Wireless and the Laptop support. One of the best technical support calls I ever had. 
29564 4 this is a very good flash, it won t disappoint you 
29565 4 Genuine Pentax batteries are the *best!* The shooting time I get with a genuine battery is 10 times longer than a non-Pentax brand, and the battery retains most of its charge after long periods of storage. Highly recommended! 
29566 3 Bought one for me and as a gift for a friend. Trust putting my d-800 on it with a small lens. Great for the price. 
29567 4 Everything works perfectly and for much less cost. The Sony has smaller batteries so you must have one or two on hand when you go out. This really fills the bill. 
29568 2 No what I expected:( 
29569 4 I love them! They were cheap and good products. At first it only shipped one so I contacted the seller and he automatically sent the other one. I got the other one about a week later. :) 
29570 4 Great product and allowed an easy installation of my Security Camera System. 
29571 4 Great value 
29572 4 really nice and conpact 
29573 4 It works great just as stated. Veto is very clear and night pictures are great. 
29574 4 I use this to mate a Nikon D3100 to the Meade ETX 125EC, still requires T-mount that &#34;clicks&#34; into the camera 
29575 4 Excellent 
29576 3 Haven t seen the Canon version, but it can t be much higher quality than this one. 
29577 0 Did not fit our Canon camera as described. Returned for refund. 
29578 4 Works perfectly with no issues. 
29579 4 This case is a snug fit for the Sony Nex-6 with a compact kit lens installed. 
29580 2 has rust which tells me it obviously got wet at some point, though it does work (but for how long) 
29581 4 These cloths have been invaluable for getting my glasses clean. No cleaner necessary, just a few rubs and I can see again clearly. 
29582 2 Best new toy! 
29583 3 Received as expected 
29584 4 Good price, and good quality. 
29585 3 Works as advertised. 
29586 4 Great little flash for the price. 
29587 4 Super cute. Goes well with my camera and I just love it! 
29588 4 works fine. 
29589 4 Everything you need to start capturing the best moments. Love the fact that everything was in perfect condition. I m really enjoying my camera. Even though it s a refurbished, you won t notice it. Because it performance is the same as the new one. 
29590 4 great circular polarizer, fits my 52 mm lens, does a good job in various light settings, makes the colors look so vibrant and nice, particularly the sky when i take landscape shots! 
29591 3 When used with various Lowepro bags this is a great way to distribute weight and reduce the strain on my shoulders (already an issue with two Nikon DSLRs). 
29592 1 price is good but its very cheap made and cant adjust levels on the leg 
29593 4 The quality of this I thought was going to be cheep. I was surprised very sturdy well worth the money! 
29594 4 very light but stable 
29595 4 Definitely love my Polaroid! Film is a little expensive but it is so much fun and in good shape. 
29596 4 Wow. these actually work. I thought for the price they would be half azzed. Can play music, record video, charge thru your PC. If you ride a motorcycle they can be indispensable. 
29597 4 Very very sturdy tripod, I can feel it immediately when I hold it in my hand. All the locks lock in very steady. And the monopod function is very nice too. Generally a very good buy! 
29598 4 Great Camera. Crystal clear and very vivid picture. Love it. 
29599 1 Don t come close to fitting around my 62mm filter. Waste of money. 
29600 2 good to observe Moon only.. not good for even... Mars and Venus. 
29601 4 Works and fast shipping! 
29602 4 The filters work well well for the price. 
29603 4 gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it! 
29604 1 Does fit over case of my I phone but not stable easily dislocated Has typical fish eye distortion as expected 
29605 4 GoPro products are such good quality. This clamp is very strong and I would trust my GoPro clamped to anything with this mount. 
29606 0 One camera came broken and the other two they drain brand new batteries in less than 24 hours 
29607 4 Large enough to fit all my components and to travel with , made very well, I would definitely recommend this for the GoPro 
29608 1 Although it is said to be the h4 3d gimbal, the computer software recognized it as an h3 3d....? Flew great but due to software issues I returned for a full refund. 
29609 4 Works very well on my camera. 
29610 1 This is pretty poorly constructed and doesn t really match the camera at all. I ended up returning it and buying the genuine Panasonic part (which is much better). 
29611 0 I can t get it to work and I threw away the paperwork - so I cannot return it. 
29612 4 Perfect camera for my quad. Simple and easy to install. 
29613 4 works great 
29614 4 Exactly what I needed to complete installation 
29615 4 It works very well. Ken Wolf 
29616 3 This lens came well packaged. So far it has performed well 
29617 4 The bundle work awesome, the stick are very steady and not slippery at all especially I use it to do Tough Mudder..and the boater work wonder since I dropped my go pro couple times in the water during the obstacles. 
29618 4 Great lighting kit. Everything described perfectly. I actually received an extra Sandbag that was not listed but love it since it helps to hold down the hair light. 
29619 4 Just what I needed the battery that comes with the camera does not have near enough power the handle an hour of recording time. I recorded about an hour and a half and the battery was still at about 75 percent charge 
29620 3 Doesn t last as long as a GoPro brand battery but pretty close. But they are totally worth it for the price. Fit perfectly in the gopro 
29621 4 We bought this for our Nikon Waterproof Coolpix camera. It s a perfect fit with enough room for the charger and wire! Great quality and light weight. Definitely worth the price! 
29622 4 Very cool 
29623 4 Love this looks real. keeps people on their toes. 
29624 4 Great cameras, fantastic value 
29625 4 Got the battery, charged it, and it is working perfectly. Fact that I have two batteries makes it better!! 
29626 2 I haven t been able to try it yet but I think it will be awesome. 
29627 4 Awesome camera. Loved it 
29628 4 Inexpensive, a terrific buy! 
29629 2 Camera freezes, we tried it for backing up our 5th wheel but the camera would either be black or freeze up. It was working for just connecting the hitch but now it is freezing up on that too. Very disappointed after reading all the good reviews. 
29630 2 Dark filter works as it should, but polarizing filter is not impressive at all. My honest opinion - isn t worth the money. 
29631 4 Does the job thank you !!!!!!!! 
29632 3 Nice little camera for the money- I may buy more 
29633 4 I like it, it s well made all metal. 
29634 4 Really love using these polaroids in lieu of traditional photos as they add more of an artistic touch to the photos! I would definitely recommend this! 
29635 4 Lobe this camera! If you wanna have fun with photos this is the product for you. 
29636 0 this does not charge from the sun, but will charge from electrical. it will not charge my phone at all. 
29637 4 VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !! 
29638 0 Almost worthless. Customer support is useless. I cannot get my computer to recognize the sd card to view the files. CS was unable to help me and offered no solutions. Save your money on this product. It does not work as advertised. 
29639 4 Works well; strong glue. 
29640 3 Extra batteries are great, charger is super fast! Although that mini tripod can barely hold up any weight.. doesn t stand a chance to hold up my Nikon D5300 (36.5oz ~2.3lbs!) 
29641 4 Good 
29642 4 excellent 
29643 0 It s a piece of junk. Haven t been able to contact the seller to retire this junk so I m stuck with it. 
29644 4 I love that I can bend the tripod to fit where ever I need it to be, used it on a TV, on a shelf. and on my arm! 
29645 4 Love it! perfect for monitoring my house!! 
29646 3 so far good kit, just learning it. will follow up soon. 
29647 4 I bought this originally to hold me over until I could afford the Money Maker from Holdfast. But after 12 weddings in the 2-3 months.....I m not sure I need the Holdfast. Granted it looks awesome....but is it worth $200 more than this??? I m just not sure. 
29648 4 Excellent. Wors as advertised, and the price can not be beat. 
29649 4 Looks real and the motion sensor works up to long distances triggering blinking red light. Great deterrent-very happy! 
29650 4 Works fine as a back-up battery for the camera. 
29651 4 Hold up as well as the name brand cannon ones I have. Great battery! 
29652 4 great battery, I have many older cameras and this works great 
29653 4 I bought this for my Nikon D7100. I love it, light weight and durable. 
29654 0 Hi,the quality is not good. After 3 times the screw was broken, my new flash has been dropped and he has had damage! Don t buy this product! 
29655 4 very nice 
29656 4 So cute!!! Love it! And the delivery speed is very impressive! I ordered at noon and received it the same night! 
29657 0 Did not charge my Sony battery or battery it came with!!!! 
29658 4 Nice Props....no problem at all after 16 flights. Recommend to get prop guards also. 
29659 4 Purchased two of these monitors and was very pleased in the ease of setting up. Now all my family members want one. 
29660 0 Item was broken on arrival. 
29661 4 I really did not know what to expect. But this little light weight tripod is great! I like that the legs extend if needed. 
29662 4 Product arrived on time and was as described. Perfect condition. Thank you ;-) 
29663 2 They re ok.They get the job done but just get a real sensor. 
29664 1 This product looked lioke and advertised to be a two lens case. It is not! only one lens fits into the case when it is closed. 
29665 4 Exceptionally clear and crisp for a cheap lens. Great depth of field with plenty of bokeh. Nice for DSLR video or pictures. 
29666 3 very nice quad, realy easy to fly and take videos, even for beginners after 3-4 flight the battery connector was melted. (both sides) 
29667 4 I love my len 
29668 4 Needed a replacement charger for my video camera and this one really came through for me. 
29669 4 Perfect! 
29670 4 Ie worked perfectly with my old camcorder. 
29671 4 Works just like the GoPro brand name one. Perfectly fine for me. 
29672 3 awesome selfie stick! 
29673 4 This product is more than I could have imagined. 
29674 4 Works as advertized, extreme high qualith cloths 
29675 1 I could only use autofocus on intelligent automatic. 
29676 2 I wanted an IR camcorder to do some amature paranormal investigation. For the price you get what you get but that isn t all bad either. I added the Poloroid 36 led IR light and get up to 30ft of lighted distance. 
29677 0 First time I used it the screen froze. I waited to use it for a vacation and by the time I got back the 30 day return policy had passed. Stuck with a paper weight. 
29678 4 Great product and arrived on time. The charger works well and the batteries hold a charge at least as well as the much more expensive Canon one, possibly better. I am very happy with this product and look forward to buying from this seller again. 
29679 4 This fits my Canon Powershot SX10is perfectly. Price is great. Arrived promptly. 
29680 0 In bought 3 of them and none worked!!!!! 
29681 4 Fantastic item and very economic. I cannot recommend this enought! I am using it with my Sony A7ii and YN-560 III and RF-603. 
29682 4 Kenneth helped me to set up all 3 of our Foscam s so we can have security throughout our home. He was very patient and very helpful. Thank you! 
29683 2 Other reviewers were correct. OK for finding lost change in your sofa. A bit weak for finding anomalies in rifle tubes 
29684 4 Philips wireless Home Monitor is perfect...It is small in fact tiny and can be put in a inconspicuous area. I love it and it does the trick... I can see who is in my home and see if someone is up to &#34;no-good&#34; Money spent well! 
29685 4 Just as described 
29686 4 Works perfectly, just what I needed 
29687 3 It s good, isn t big enough to get the ring in subjects eyes. But it functions very well. 
29688 4 I have been a pro photographer for over a decade, why did it take me so long to buy this lens? It s amazingly sharp and contrasty and great for portraits and candids. 
29689 4 It s Great! Great price and just what I wanted. 
29690 4 Great working camera. Day/Night mode switch over creates a loud click but works like a charm in night mode. 
29691 3 Great addition to your camera set. Definitely a great buy. 
29692 4 Good product 
29693 4 Great case that protects your camera, is compact enough to fit in a purse and easy access. Love it 
29694 4 Works well so far. Good price. 
29695 4 Very cute and worth the price :) 
29696 4 This is an absolutely necessary accessory to the LX100. The clip-on cap is cumbersome and you will end up losing it. This one is always where you need it. Who needs filters anyway? 
29697 3 I love this camera! It s so small I can put it anywhere. I love the color of it. The only thing I didn t like was you can t see what you are recording. Other than that it takes great videos and photos. 
29698 4 Works perfectly on my Sony a5000 camera 
29699 4 Excellent in every sense 
29700 4 Out standing clamp, I hem-hawed over the price for a bit, looked at other options. I already owned a Arcatech ball head, the quality is top of the line, made in the U.S. You get what you pay for in life. 
29701 3 nice item 
29702 4 Definitely a smart purchase 
29703 4 it did meet my expectation. very good picture quality, nice camera color and easy to use. 
29704 4 Yea...this flash is AWESOME! I ve been using a canon 430EX in manual for a while now and I still use this Nissin in manual also (mostly). But the lower profile by itself and easier to use controls just really adds icing on the cake. 
29705 4 This is one outstanding piece of equipment for the price. 
29706 4 great camera 
29707 2 Remote does not have much range to it 
29708 3 Setup is a little confusing, but once you get past that it works great. Access from my smart phone, tablet and PC. 
29709 3 Bought for 17 year old daughter birthday. She loves it. Picture quality is great. 
29710 4 The battery that came with it didn t work. Foto& Tech were quick to reply to my first review. I went to Walmart to get a new battery and it works fine now. 
29711 4 They work great, shipped fast. Would buy again. 
29712 4 poor quelity... fair for the price. 
29713 4 Works great to attach a handle to and is very high quality for the price! 
29714 4 Great quality sound, can hear voices very well even with a great deal of background noise. Highly reccommend these as a very economical yet very effective means of audio monitoring. 
29715 4 Great real like it. 
29716 4 Worked great for me. Did a DSLR video for a big well-known organization using those filters. It worked like a charm. Everybody loved it! 
29717 2 To lobotomize a drone tie a heavy cord or even a light chain to it. The higher it goes the more weight it is dragging. While debugging your new drone, start in the middle of a field, not in a room. 
29718 4 Works great. 
29719 3 cant fault the camera for anything so far. So I should really give 5 stars. However, lack of local storage is a significant drawback. The fifth star lost for lack of local storage possibility. 
29720 0 Total crap. Bolts didn t reach nuts, cheap cheap construction with no QC. Didn t come close to being worth what I paid. Save your money. and get this instead. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WFN4UIS?redirect=true&ref_=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_2 
29721 4 Works great on my Watson Duo Charger. Now I can charge batteries for my X-T1 and 7D at the same time. 
29722 4 Received as new 
29723 4 Great! Works perfect for my sony camera 
29724 1 Was damage when I buy 
29725 4 Great camera, so great we just ordered another one. Wonderful day image and super clear night image. Our DYI security system works great, especially with our cell phones at work. Great for watching the dogs while we are at work. 
29726 4 Thank you you were very helpful! Couldn t find the batteries anywhere else! 
29727 4 Got it and tried right away. Picture was very good using an older SD card. Just ordered the new model of SD and hoping it will be even better. Glad I bought this instead of paying $300-$400 for something else. 
29728 4 Great. I will buy more 
29729 4 Thank you, A+ 
29730 4 Was impressed with the packaging of this product, as well as my camera! 
29731 4 Gives good battery life and fits perfectly in the Canon SL-1 camera. 
29732 4 works for me 
29733 0 B 
29734 4 Works great and is a must for non-floating cameras. 
29735 2 Looks decent arrived with one broken bulb and another one flickering like crazy. Reaching out to Seller to see what steps they are taking to rectify. I will write more reviews about that and also the product when I use it. 
29736 4 Just what I needed for my wide-angle zoom lens. My only concern might be that the fitment to the 35-70 mm lens could have been a little tighter. Otherwise, it works great. 
29737 4 Love this case. Already have it too full. Looking for next size up. 
29738 4 Slipped these feet into my Watershot case. iPhone 5c now fits. 
29739 4 Great product and received as described A+ 
29740 4 The battery was delivered timely. It charged as advertised and seems to be holding it s charge as expected. I ve only had the battery for a month, so it s still working from it s initial charge. I bought it as a backup for a Canon 70D. 
29741 4 Excelent 
29742 4 great 
29743 4 sooo clear in picture and sound... BUMMED it took me this long to buy it! 
29744 3 it was OK 
29745 3 These cords work well at a fraction of the Canon price points. 
29746 4 For an inexpensive lens this is easy to add on and does enhance the distance. 
29747 4 Easy to use, easy to carry - can hold very large lens and camera and still be very stable - would definitely recommend. 
29748 4 This was a slight upgrade from my old Canon digital which was misplaced. Really great high res photos in any light. I use it for merchandising online. 
29749 4 Absolutely love this camera, the white really sets it apart from the typical DSLRs out there. I highly recommend this for any amateur photographer like myself. 
29750 4 Meet my expectation 
29751 4 Quick, fast, simple, easy 
29752 4 The same as the two cameras I had previously. I lost both to water accidents. I bouth another because I like this model. It is small, inexpensive, has a view finder and takes decent photos and videos. 
29753 0 Junk! Kodak will not support this and the sellers charge a fortune to return plus a restocking fee. My first one completely died after only a year and that was only turning it on during holidays and special occasions. 
29754 4 must have! 
29755 2 I ve been using this with both a FL-600r and an FL-50r. It does it s job but overall I much prefer to just use a small softbox for on-camera. I couldn t recommend this for off-camera use either. 
29756 4 awesome 
29757 4 Great 
29758 4 These cloths work amazingly well and the price is right. 
29759 3 Works good for the price 
29760 4 Fast shipping, smooth transaction, perfect product Thanks! 
29761 4 Product is exactly as expected. They are sitting there as spares - hopefully will never need to use them. 
29762 4 DID WANT WE WANTED IT TO DO 
29763 0 doesn t havew the strength it needs 
29764 4 CAMERA IS GREAT FOR THE PRICE , NO PROBLEMS 
29765 4 This is a great camera. Its worth the cost 
29766 1 The motor is loud and you can hear some of it on videos. I also do not like how short the battery life is. It does make nice videos otherwise but I would recommend getting a spare battery and external mic. 
29767 4 Worked has advertised. Was able to take shots of the starts and lightening. That was the whole reason for the purchase. Excellent price, well worth the money. 
29768 4 Both hoods work very well for my application. I use the retractable hood since I can extent it as needed. I have purchased several products from Gina and have always been happy with my purchses 
29769 4 Worth every penny, AAA+++ 
29770 4 very nice! 
29771 3 Good product, fits perfect on 55/250mm IS STM lens and cheaper than original Canon lens hood. 
29772 3 I like this a lot but I m not a huge fan of how you strap the tripod on. 
29773 3 Finally found a good product for safely cleaning my monitors and flatscreen TVs. The spray and magic fiber cloth work well together and get a good streak free clean. I ve got the small magic fiber cloths for my sunglasses etc. Quality product would definitely recommend to everyone. 
29774 4 Love this bag, great seller 
29775 2 no good. 
29776 4 Bought this device to enable me to download images from my camera to my iPhone for sharing. Absolutely easy to install and intuitive to use. Works as advertised for me. 
29777 0 Supposed to be HD, but it s only low quality SD. Very narrow view lens, can t get much of what you are looking at on the video... maybe somebody s ear, or a blank wall, etc.. 
29778 4 Batteries worked great with my S32. Two batteries got me through a 14-day backpacking trip, hot and cold temperatures. 
29779 4 It works 
29780 1 They do not fit in the camera. I have a canon t5i which it clearly says that they fit, but they do not. They do however fit into my battery grip, but that is not why I bought them! 
29781 4 Super product 
29782 4 as advertised 
29783 2 Hard to remove ! Excellent fit and quality 
29784 4 Love it. It costs less than my previous camera, which I unfortunately dropped and broke, but this seem to have better features. I just hope I don t drop it again. 
29785 4 Excellent! 
29786 4 Purchased 2...easy setup...works great...runs smooth...fast delivery...tech support is there when you need your questions answered...PS LIVE SUPPORT. 
29787 2 I love this polaroid film. However, the light sensitive layer in one pack arrived damaged and each polaroid in that pack was ruined, which is a bummer since each polaroid costs about $3.00 
29788 3 fits on my shotgun and my bow. but feels a little flimsy and may easily break 
29789 3 Fun gimmick, although package arrived damaged on the corner, the lens itself was fine. 
29790 4 Great! Wouldn t use the selfie stick in water... It rusts in a few hours😂 
29791 4 I have been wanting a macro ring light for many years. The Canon light was always too expensive for just casual, non-professional use. This one works great, has adapter rings for almost any lens and is so inexpensive, you deserve to try this. I m very happy. 
29792 0 It doesn t work how can I return 
29793 2 ok for the money, obviously not even close to the manfrotto version, but it will work.. 
29794 4 Awesome little kit. I can t think of a single complaint for these. 
29795 4 Awesome! Vendor great too!!! 
29796 4 Excellent purchase 
29797 3 Nice setup, just the car mount alone normally runs about the cost of the full package. 
29798 4 Use all the time. Do exactly what they are advertised to do. 
29799 3 Very solid but seems to be easily scratched. Perfect use to build a customizable shoulder rig. 
29800 0 Already broken but I didn t keep the information to return it. What a disapointment! 
29801 4 good stuff! 
29802 0 AVOID this case. It leaked while submerged in 30&#34; of water and ruined my SJCAM. No clue what to do from here. There s something to be said for shopping at actual stores. 
29803 3 Very good system 
29804 3 Great little camera for the price!!!!!! I bought this just to keep in my pool bag and it works fine! 
29805 3 Good tough straps that allow very good length adjustment. They were very close to being exactly what I was looking for. The strap adjustments could be tighter to prevent movement. 
29806 4 Work perfect and really come in handy when you have the bluetooth running. For sure need to get if you have a gopro 
29807 4 Excellent package deal. Love this thing. 
29808 1 focus doesn t work and the flash doesn t woik 
29809 1 Lets be honest, you re getting what you paid for. Cheap plastic, cheap quality, looks good for decoration at least. 
29810 4 Fit the case exactly as stated. I didn t have too hard of a time getting the screws in as others have mentioned. Really helped me fit all the smaller camera gear in my case to utilize the most space possible. 
29811 3 Works well really pleased with the GoPro product line. 
29812 4 These are amazing!!! I have one on every lens. I will never lose another lens cap again! The adhesive works perfectly. Best deal ever! 
29813 3 nice item..... 
29814 4 vintage 
29815 4 My son loves this camera! 
29816 4 best strap i ever had. this is way better than those that comes with the camera. this is very comfortable and my camera feels secure. for the price, its no brainer not to get this strap. 
29817 0 Product didn t work. It kept crashing and was very unstable. When I called for support I spoke to someone in India who eventually ask for access to my computer. Although this may not be unusual I declined. Returned the product. Great disappointment. 
29818 1 Okay head, had to grind down the screw heads on the base so that the clamp would fit flush. Also, the clamp is okay, but I have to adjust the tension as the size of the Desmond brackets are different than all my other ones. Wouldn t buy again. 
29819 4 Worked as expected. Car socket adapter made it a plus. 
29820 4 This product really works. Bought a bunch for me, family and friends. 
29821 4 Amazon Basics does it again with amazing quality products at an affordable price. I feel like I stole this thing, it is so much better than it s price tag suggests. I can t imagine what more I would want in a tripod. 
29822 4 As described. Works well. 
29823 0 The majority of the accessories did not fit my GoPro Hero 4 and I inquired about the issue twice will no answers 
29824 3 Works as well as the technology permits. 
29825 4 Works just like the more expensive canon flash. Does what it s made for as long as you know what youre doing. 
29826 0 dont buy from this buyer even by mistake! product looks worse than a chewed up cellphone! 
29827 4 gives you all of the cool items for any adventure 
29828 4 I rarely use it right now, because my mic. Once that is resolved I can use the whole thing. 
29829 4 Great &#34;old school&#34; type cameras and were fun to bring to an event. 
29830 4 This was a gift, but my friend seems pretty happy with it. 
29831 4 It s a great value for a Canon camera, we couldn t be happier. 
29832 4 I love this little thing. It gets great angles from my gopro and very durable. The only thing I don t understand is the Rope thing that came with it. 
29833 0 Great product 
29834 4 Exactly what I wanted! 
29835 0 Does not sync up to our openers. 
29836 0 Horrible product and service. 
29837 0 Had the same problem as others. I plugged in the charger and 30 seconds later I heard a pop. My battery was damaged and the charger no longer worked. 
29838 2 it work !! 
29839 4 This does exactly what it s supposed to. I am able to fit my Sony Nex-3n as well as a Kodak Zi8 and extra batteries, cables, and sd cards. For small cameras and accessories this is a great bag. 
29840 4 Right fit. Lost my original while on vacation. Works great and reasonable priced. 
29841 4 Good 
29842 4 I ll try to remember to add to this next year because these are to replace two competitor s batteries that didn t last but about a year. So far these charged up well and seem to hold their charge well. 
29843 2 Descent. Set up i got what i could afford to learn with. I know its going to be fun either way. 
29844 4 This viewer worked great for slides that are 60 years plus. 
29845 4 Very good 
29846 4 Great housing for the Xiaomi Yi camera. Adds a bit of protection to the unit. Recommend, especially at this price. 
29847 4 Works great, exactly what I needed at the star party. Best to wait until it is on sale. 
29848 4 No problems, charges and lasts just like described. 
29849 2 very grainy picture quality but what do you expect for this price. 
29850 2 Order more, limited life. 
29851 3 Works 
29852 4 It s perfect and wonderful for cutting out glare while looking into the viewfinder. 
29853 4 Works great for spare batteries for the GoPro. And great price compared to GoPro branded batteries. 
29854 0 It did what I wanted with the slides, I have yet to try it on my super 8 film and negatives. 
29855 3 I bought this for my NEX 5 camera to use when we went to Yellowstone this summer. It is a fine lens but it is rather heavy for the camera. However, I am pleased that I had it with me because I got some excellent photos! 
29856 4 Excellent lens hood at a great price fit perfectly! 
29857 4 Exceptional product - in fact, I liked it so much I bought another one! Lightning fast shipping. Great experience and would definitely buy from again!!! 
29858 4 work great best camera at this price. 
29859 1 too small for my use 
29860 4 Arrived quickly and was exactly what I needed. 
29861 0 Horrible back drops. 
29862 3 Super! 
29863 2 The clapper had separated from the board during shipping and i had to glue them back together. Other than that the quality seems good and the price is right. 
29864 4 Received in an appropriate amount of time. Very pleased. 
29865 1 spend the money and buy the real deal 
29866 4 as advertised 
29867 3 Still learning how to use it all. 
29868 3 It fits ok in general but clutching the stop buttons requieres more handling 
29869 4 Best birthday present I ever bought myself. I m still learning this camera and have yet to fiddle with each setting; but the photos I have taken with this camera are polished and look fantastic. I love submitting them to photo societies. 
29870 4 excellent product. it was what I was expecting. 
29871 4 I bought this camera as a birthday gift for my sister. She absolutely loved it! In the digital age where everything is online she was so excited to have instant &#34;old school&#34; pictures. 
29872 4 Awesome product and customer service! 
29873 4 I had one before. I bought one to replace the old one and they work fine. 
29874 4 Got to love Gopro. I recently lost my old Hero 3 Black, and found this one as cheap as it could get. All items arrived as described, it was just as new. Great Photo and Video quality. 
29875 4 Works well! 
29876 3 For the price, this is a decent saddle-bag weight. The material is nylon but appears and feels durable. I placed zip-loc plastic bags inside the compartments of the sand bag then filled those plastic bags with sand. 
29877 4 Great item. Love using it when we are surfing and also when kayaking and hiking 
29878 4 Nice blacked out housing 
29879 0 lenses won t focus - don t waste your money 
29880 4 Fabulous package with so many accessories in it! Couldn t have asked for more! 
29881 4 Very, Very Good Camera. Metal casing is heavy, but I shaved most of weight by making a 1/16 inch thick plywood box for it. Now weighs 0.6 oz. 
29882 4 great 
29883 4 Great 
29884 4 Nice. Easy to set up, sturdy, and is a very gracious size. Also, the carrying case is very helpful. 
29885 3 Like everyone else says, the plastic parts seem weak. But higher priced versions have similar or worse complaints about the same problem. I came back to this one and am pleased that with some care it will stand up to my infrequent needs for a reflector stand. 
29886 4 Case was well made and fit perfectly. Appreciated the extra thought involved in developing the battery change panel. Surprised with the gift wrist added to the package. 
29887 4 I purchased this while I was expecting my first baby so I could capture all her firsts So simple to use, which was great while I had pregnancy brain! Videos are amazingly crisp and clear and look great on our HDTV! 
29888 4 More than I expected. Came with car charger and even plug that we used un Iceland. Great value 
29889 0 Very bad quality products. One mount cracked at 1st time I tried to use. Monopod seems like its gonna break when u extend it. All these cheap chinese stuff. 
29890 1 The strap started ripping I only had it for a month if that. 
29891 4 Cute 
29892 4 Good stuff 
29893 0 This product needed to be set up with their web site and their link didn t work! Still can t use this product! (Not happy!) :-/ 
29894 4 I love these accessories for my go pro hero 4 silver, works perfectly and looks so cool :) 
29895 4 What a tool. this camera rocks. 
29896 3 Very nice lens and affordable to. helps get that clsoer shot 
29897 2 ok for the price. It fulfill my basic needs for a monocular 
29898 4 Lightweight, well built, great optics. Perfect for our Kodiak Brown Bear viewing operation. 
29899 4 helpful 
29900 4 Glad to find original Nikkon products 
29901 4 Excellent!!!! 
29902 4 Arrived as promised and fits the battery. Haven y used it since the battery arrived already charged. 
29903 4 TERRIFIC! 
29904 3 Easy set up, works well, phone app lags a little unless you have 4G but still very useful. would be good if you could adjust the audio notification, motion notification works great. overall a great camera, I will probably get another to monitor another part of the house 
29905 4 Does exactly what it is supposed to! Very well made metal lens hood. I needed a 62mm wide angle for my 28-80mm vintage zoom lens that works great but is prone to flare. This hood solved the flare problem nicely! 
29906 4 Surprised the wife and it works great on vacations. 
29907 2 Love my new Fugi! 
29908 4 Works with d5300 
29909 3 Great polarizer, does not attract dust and I have not had problems with it getting stuck. Inexpensive for the quality, although if you have a budget for a more expensive filter like B+W that would be a better route to go. 
29910 4 I like it. Nice, smooth and eazy to use 
29911 4 Good price, excellent product!!!!! 
29912 0 Would not stay registered on my Veralite, even though I had a repeater less than 20 away. I was unable to get Vera it to recognize it again, even when I brought it inside. Maybe defective - I sent it back. 
29913 4 Works great for mating the pistol grip from the Amazon Basics 70-inch Pistol Grip Tripod to a monopod that s fitted for 1/4-20 thread. 
29914 4 Five star récord. 
29915 0 Never got it to work, and I tried on multiple OS s. Very disappointed 
29916 3 Works as well as OEM at a fraction of the price. 
29917 4 I can t fault the product, it is as described--- but I seldom us it. Too lazy I guess. 
29918 4 it works ! 
29919 4 Fixed the blinking red light of death issue with my FI8920W. I replaced the failed power supply with this one and I was back up and running. 
29920 2 Fits the camera fine, just don t like how it fits in the camera case. Sticks out so far that you have to leave room for it or take it on and off. 
29921 4 Absolutely great value! Super snug & comfy with just the right amount of compartments and dividers. Would purchase and would recommend. 
29922 4 Love using this for my DSLR in the kayak! I holds my camera nicely with extra lenses and some supplies. The shoulder strap is a little awkward, but at least it has it. 
29923 4 I have had no problem with this battery. Works great in my Canon camera. 
29924 3 Excellent ball head, especially at that price! 
29925 4 As expected 
29926 3 Very nice camera for the price. Good clear image, great features, easy to setup. Very easy to use, both from my smartphone and laptop. My wife loves it for watching our pets when not at home. 
29927 4 Perfect and much less expensive than the go pro ones. 
29928 1 Too flexible 
29929 4 Great camera for the price. I m not a great photographer who can use the SLR s. This camera is about as close as you can get to the quality of a SLR, without buying a SLR. Very pleased with the purchase! 
29930 0 The right arm broke at the 4th use... and the camera died within a week... Don t buy this :P 
29931 4 I put 6 rechargeable AAs in it to see how long it would stay on at full power. After 10 hours I finally had to go to bed. I am very impressed with this unit. 
29932 3 This is my third Sony Cyber shot, I feel like it s NOT made well, but it does take AWESOME pictures. 
29933 4 Excellent for low light. Great build quality. 
29934 4 Great camera, great transaction! 
29935 2 Its pretty good but its not very strong, thats why Im gving it 3 stars 
29936 4 Works great 
29937 4 nice 
29938 4 I slip this into large purses, totes and backpacks so that I can take my digital camera with me without having to bring a separate camera bag. It seems to cushion the camera well. 
29939 4 Light weight material makes this tripod easy to carry - it comes with its own carrying bag, too. Surprisingly tall (when the legs are fully extended) and sturdy. I mounted my heavy binoculars on this tripod, and the whole thing was very stable. I would definitely recommend this tripod. 
29940 4 Looks so real 
29941 1 cheaply made 
29942 4 Perfect to use with my older GoPro Hero 2 and the inline microphone. 
29943 4 Excellent product, it works perfectly. 
29944 3 Good product 
29945 4 Great 
29946 4 I love it. it is light and have a lot of adjustment. it perfect for me. thanks 
29947 3 It works ok. Not spectacular, but ok. 
29948 4 I LOVE LOVE LOVE this item!! PLEASE restock so I can buy more!! :) 
29949 4 Beautifully sharp portraits from this lens with gorgeous bokeh. So glad I saved over $1000 by getting this one instead of the 1.4G! 
29950 4 good results 
29951 1 This was a sweet camera until the view screen stopped working after a year of light use. I wouldn t buy another one although the color resolution was excellent for art work. Now a monument to wasted money. 
29952 4 Works as intended..... not easy to operate, but that s how it can be made 
29953 4 Great backup! 
29954 4 Excellent product and oportunity, great price... 
29955 4 great value and excellent product 
29956 4 This was a purchase for myself and I have found it as advertised and a good purchase. The seller was very efficient and a pleasure to deal with. 
29957 4 Perfect!!! 
29958 4 I upgraded from the FC40. This unit is amazing! 
29959 4 Fantastic camera for the price. I have gotten several hours of HD video out of it. Love the fact that it automatically corrects for orientation of the camera. 
29960 4 Great package. Fits my Panasonic LF1 perfectly. 
29961 0 horrible pictures. piece of junk. 
29962 4 Perfect for sage keeping and easy transport 
29963 3 Nice well made hood. I purchased this hood for my GM5 and it fit the kit lens perfectly. 
29964 2 The sensors are lacking on this product. I am not impressed with the quality and I would have went with a different one if I had it to do again. 
29965 0 The film I received was either expired or defective. Once I went to use it all of the pictures came out like they were not properly developed. 
29966 4 lots of product for the price 
29967 3 great light for video filming the only thing it does not come with the stand 
29968 0 Fell apart. Crap 
29969 4 LOVE IT!!!! 
29970 3 It does a good job with AHD cameras. So far so good. 
29971 4 Works great. 
29972 0 it works only a couple of times than just die 
29973 3 Hope I never have to use it.... but I will.... and I will demand to be served. Thanks. 
29974 4 Great, and very useful. 
29975 4 FRIGING best thing I ever got for my GoPro !!!!!! I use it on 75% of protects it allow me to get so many different angles that mounts sometimes restrict you to have. 
29976 4 Very nice 
29977 3 I haven t used this enough to know if it will hold up, but so far it s a good tripod for the price. 
29978 4 Works great. You can mount the brackets on the wall or use c stands for more portability. Great product and the quality seems good. The rollers and chains are plastic, so naturally I was worried but they are sturdy enoug. No complaints. 
29979 3 Barely got it last night, BUT. First thing I notice is how noisy the shutter is. This surprised me since no one else mentioned this and I thought an electronic, mirror less camera would be silent. Not so! 
29980 2 Ok 
29981 4 This little camera works great! VERY cool, and affordable. Here is a little time lapse I did https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRXNr8AMMrI VERY FUN! 
29982 4 Good product for the price 
29983 4 Nice and clean shots. I use it with all my lenses now and it is producing get shots for it s cost. 
29984 1 The Hood did not fit my Canon t5i, as described. I was able to wedge it on most of the way, but even after that, it did not work as well as the other lens hoods I ve used. 
29985 4 Great product! 
29986 4 Works a treat 
29987 4 Needed this for an older JVC. The cleaner did the job. The heads were so bad that I had to run the cleaner through two times, but I can now view and transfer my old Hi-8 tapes to disc. 
29988 3 It was as described. Have not used it yet. I got it for using under water when in Hawaii. Might go for one that is a bit longer. 
29989 3 solid 
29990 4 These cloths are perfect for display screens, glasses, tablets, kindles etc. I use one mostly on my Kindle, it s great for wiping the finger smudges off the screen. 
29991 4 It is kind of bulky but it provides much more battery time than stock battery that came with videocamera. 
29992 1 Battery drops dead withins three hours. 
29993 4 These are excellent cameras, at a great price. Very well made and a definite improvement in resolution and night vision over the cameras that came with my Swann system. I will continue buying them as replacements and add-ons. 
29994 4 Works great. Good battery life. 
29995 4 Excellent product. 
29996 4 Got camera. Working. Fast shipping 
29997 4 All I Expected! 
29998 4 Great harness. I took this on a 60-mile hike and wore my camera 6 days straight.. couldn t be happier. 
29999 4 Was as advertised 
30000 4 very pleased with the batteries and receiving them so fast 
30001 4 Excellent camera at an excellent price. I graduated from the SX 40 so had a good idea on how to use it. 
30002 4 Great product 
30003 1 Cheap material. Light won t lock in place very flimsy. But the pro is the lights are very bright. 
30004 4 Excellent product. I have several monocular but Polaris Explorer is another level. Very high build quality, very good optics. Highly recommended. 
30005 4 This works very well, does all the single shot and burst and timer and bulb shots, exactly as expected. I have not tested the transmitting range distance but am never very far from the camera in my photography. The instruction manual was surprisingly helpful and well done. 
30006 3 Love this camera, but the history feature take a long time to load. Maybe I need to set it to 780 instead of 1080. 
30007 4 Worked perfectly as expected. 
30008 4 It works as advertised, but I do wish the brick was a little smaller. 
30009 4 Works very well with the Samsung Camcorder. The professional wedding photograph even used it. 
30010 3 I use this quite a bit with Macro photography, works really well.... 
30011 4 excellent product 
30012 0 doesn t work ;( 
30013 4 It was everything I excepted. 
30014 4 Very well made. It can even be used as a regular purse if needed. There s plenty of room to fit other stuff besides the instax mini. Beige looks very classy as well. Overall very pleased with my purchase! 
30015 4 This was purchased for my grandson and he loves it. 
30016 4 Nice prime Canon EF lens for portrait and low light shooting. It is soft when wide open, but sharpens significantly at about f2.8. I don t use it often, but when I do the results are very satisfactory. 
30017 2 Average. Works, but not especially well-made. 
30018 4 Excellent 
30019 4 No issues 
30020 4 These worked well with my D3100. 
30021 4 I love this strap. It feels so good when wearing it because of the velvet that touches the neck. Very good quality and beautiful! Worth the extra money then some others I ve looked at. 
30022 3 Used it the same day I received it. Have no complaints, as described. 
30023 3 i love it so much; but the one thing i can t find is the &#34;flash button&#34; to turn it off. 
30024 2 It served it s purpose for street shots in Europe, but I always wanted to be able to change lenses 
30025 1 Poor quality. Plastic, not durable 
30026 4 Great 
30027 3 Works fine for thé moment. Will really use it only in tow monts. 
30028 4 It is perfect. This I exactly what I wanted. The camera is a gem. 
30029 4 Excellent product, fast shipping. Buy without hesitation. 
30030 3 Awesome camera has alot of extras but moves around when accelerating like on a dirtbike. Just need to figure out how to keep it facing the right way but great picture underwater and regular 
30031 2 Shipping was fast but missing tripod mount. 
30032 4 Great product at a great price. Had all the features of the expensive flashes at a fraction of the price. I love this flash! 
30033 4 good 
30034 4 Amazing sandals very comfortable 
30035 4 Was tight at first and nothing said it won t fit with the lens cap on but now its fine. 
30036 4 Better than previous model with the IR separate, also has audio feed. A challenge of sorts to mount, but doable. Great picture for the price, make sure you get English firmware. check the suppliers.. Some say it is others say from China. Not support available to upgrade if from china 
30037 4 I love it. 
30038 4 Just note that the USB cord is for the battery charger not to transfer data from your camera to your laptop (my mistake). However, the battery works great on my Nikon CoolPix AW110. 
30039 4 Great picture quality day or night. You wont be sorry if you buy this camera. My ZModo system came with 4 and I added 2 more they were that good. 
30040 4 very good 
30041 3 This camera is great. I bought mine for a nursery camera. It does get hot when I to turned on so I try to turn it off when I am not using it. But it is super handy and the remote option is awesome. 
30042 0 cheap! broke on it s first use 
30043 0 I am returning Kodak Easy Share Printer Dock. We were delighted to find one, but it only prints half a picture. I am enclosing sample. Would like to request refund procedures and information to print return label. Thank you 
30044 4 Really nice lens bags. Good protection and smooth sides so they slip into my overloaded bag really easily. Will buy more when ii need them. Better than the Nikon bags that come with their lenses. 
30045 2 No instruction manual, doesn t have very good video at night 
30046 2 I need more direction 
30047 2 makes the motor and iris very noisy and slow. but it works i guess 
30048 4 Love this, if you do not get anything else get this. This really makes you life easier. 
30049 4 Really like, fits alittle small. 
30050 4 My son loves this!!! 
30051 0 Horrible definition 
30052 4 My son is in love!!! He s a sports fanatic and into all things outdoors. These let him and his friends use their GoPros hands free!! And I don t have to worry about it getting smashed up or left behind!!! 
30053 4 The carmers is a replacement they work fine and they were what I want. 
30054 4 Works for Sony action can 
30055 4 excellent! 
30056 4 Loved it, I just needed 2 but is good to have them in a drawer next time you need it. 
30057 4 Yes this is fantastic for our baby monitor. Can put the monitor everywhere now. Very happy. Although it does look very suspect in its packaging which the postman gave me a funny look!!! Lol 
30058 4 Great for smaller items 
30059 4 good for the price! here s my sample clip @1080P https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfuSAyqW8_Y music outdoor sample acoustics https://youtu.be/SdLSbkG1EKE https://youtu.be/lSs5epPOFHQ orchestra/band https://youtu.be/Q37u77MbnaA https://youtu.be/1Q-L_ffqd1c very nice zoom downside battery life 
30060 2 Limited value with sigma 150-500 mm lens since you can t use auto focus and it is hard to manually focus, like shooting craps. Not worth the money. 
30061 4 I ve had this remote a few years. Recently, the cable stopped transmitting, but Promaster s warranty is wonderful. In a very short time, they shipped a brand new cable to me, and the whole remote works just like new again. 
30062 3 The plastic finish could be better but the results match the expectation, great flash for any camera. Good battery consumption. 
30063 4 great what i wanted block out light 
30064 4 Excellent 
30065 4 Great little camera. Nice size for a pocket or a purse. Takes great pictures. Nice zoom range. Also, didn’t buy it with the idea of taking any video but the video capability is a good addition and the video quality is better than I would have thought. 
30066 4 Perfect light with the size , solid build 
30067 4 Great camera!!! Excellent quality, both pictures and video, a lot of cool lenses in this set. Tripod is very light so you can take it anywhere with you. 
30068 1 The case was covered by full of mold... But lens covers were ok. Works good too. 
30069 4 Long and black -- connectors are good 
30070 4 bad I never worked and the seller did not want to be responable, Amazon had to help me and I returned the money 
30071 4 Holds a charge well, does its job. Would buy. Again. 
30072 4 everything came and look like it was in the picture 
30073 4 LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this camera! GREAT picture, LOVE that you aren t replacing batteries all the time, just needs a charge once in awhile, easy to get pics off, and AGAIN GREAT PICTURE! WORTH EVERY PENNY! 
30074 4 Quite a few tapes for the money. 
30075 4 Love just as much the second time purchasing as the first. Awesome product at a crazy awesome price. THANK YOU! 
30076 4 Exactly as described. Great quality paper! 
30077 2 bueno 
30078 4 This is an excellent buy for the money. Very satisfied. 
30079 4 Everything looks just as promised. Used the products last night and they did a swell job! 
30080 3 Unit received fits well on my camera and allows a secure hold and feel. 
30081 4 You really can t beat a good Pelican Case. I mounted these to my 2000 Triumph Tiger 885i and the size is perfect for long rides. For daily riding I m just using my Seahorse tail case. 
30082 4 Best bang for your buck out there. I use these for star gazing at the milky way when in the bahamas and for other scouting uses during the day. they work very well. 
30083 4 Thank you. I got it! My friend said he loves it too! 
30084 4 I love these batteries Work great and they fit my camera Now I can carry all with me incase I need a fresh charged one. Great deal 
30085 4 As expecteted 
30086 3 Pros: Shipment was timely and met specs as advertised. Cons: Not recommended for a heavy DSLR with large lenses. 
30087 4 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv0BUK0YocQ Check out the video I did on the unboxing of this item! 
30088 4 Perfect fit, no loose connections to mess with! 
30089 4 Awesome 
30090 4 works as advertised 
30091 4 Works fantastic even in sunlight at F/1.4. I highly suggest it. I am using it on a 1.5x crop-frame DSLR, so I am not sure if any issues full frame cameras would encounter. However, it s a perfect ND filter to start with. 
30092 0 Defective product, poor customer service, one of my biggest mistakes 
30093 4 Fantastic optical quality. 
30094 4 I could write a technical review here. Many have touted the 7DII and its amazing performance. I will say simply......untouchable for a crop frame camera. If you are thinking of adding this to your collection, DO IT! 
30095 1 The ball joint works fine, but for the price this company charges for the weather proof housing and this stupid ball joint, it s ridiculous. For $30 you should get the housing and the ball joint. Instead it s $70 for both. 
30096 4 So far I like them. The rest we will know when he gets back from the deer camp. Anxious to see how videos turn out 
30097 4 Nice lens for the price. 
30098 4 charges my camera up right 
30099 4 Batteries charge up and hold charge well. Great value at a fraction of the cost of Canon batteries. 
30100 3 I have not as yet had the opportunity to use it, hence the 4 stars. Based on design, appearance, and the ratings of others, I am very confident that it will perform as expected. 
30101 4 Great quality great quality and intensity 
30102 4 Nice case, not too small and not too big. Several pockets outside and inside. I have a camera backpack, but I use this case much more often. 
30103 4 Worked perfectly on our older security monitor set up. Much cheaper then trying to buy a bunch of cat monitors. 
30104 4 Works like a charm. Lock the mirror up on your camera for steady shots. Great for selfies of my wife and I as we send pictures to our friends. 
30105 1 I bought this as a replacement for the original canon one that broke. It looks as good as the original however it constantly slides off my T3i. It doesn t lock in place securely and the slightest touch makes it fall right off. 
30106 4 Love the camera, new to DSLR. Easy to use, on auto settings, yet definitely want to explore more manual settings. Highly recommend. Came as advertised. Delivered on on time with prime. 
30107 4 Great looking camera but did not check out the functions since I had returned the camera. 
30108 0 You get what you pay for. The lens is exposed to dust even when not taking pictures. You have to hold this camera very steady or the pictures will be blurred. If this is a 10.1 MP camera, I am disappointed. Bottom line, it is a cheap camera. 
30109 0 Couldn t get the wrinkles out 
30110 4 Excellent products and good pricing. Thanks much. 
30111 2 It s a nice beginner scope but it is very hard to sight in and shakes a lot when trying to adjust. 
30112 4 Super happy with my drone looks great everything is there how it was advertised thanks guys 👍👍 
30113 4 very good 
30114 4 GREAT FOR HIKING,EXTREMELY LIGHTWEIGHT. GREAT VALUE. 
30115 3 Good Product Works as expected 
30116 4 OMG! I don t know how Ive done without this! 
30117 4 So far so good, a lot to learn with this camera to use it to its full potential. 
30118 4 Sharp views. Takes care of lot aberrations. Excellent high end eye piece for an affordable price. 
30119 4 These floats work as advertised. Used them in pool and ocean. Used on my Galaxy S4 phone and Kodak waterproof camera. All went well, items floated and the colors were visible. 
30120 4 Excellent! 
30121 4 Arrived quickly, and just as expected from the order. Thanx! 
30122 0 Unfortunately the tapes do not work. Not sure why but ever time I put the tapes in my equipment it would say the tape was dirty. I had to clean my equipment. Unfortunately I missed the window to send tapes back. 
30123 0 it sucks 
30124 4 exactly as described, I love this lens 
30125 3 Great bundle. Only thing is that the tripod seems a little low quality but that s something that we all have preferences for. Other than that amazing. Very pleased :) 
30126 3 Good camera bag, has a lot of compartments, well padded for protection and durable to use. 
30127 4 Tripod is a little off center like the guy posted in the video but is easily corrected. I use it with a Logitech C615 Webcam works amazing for this. 
30128 4 This is the best. I love how compact it is, it fits in my purse, and holds an extra battery. Definitely worth having. 
30129 4 My experience echoes the experience of others—they re super functional and a good buy. 
30130 3 Only used to scan 35mm. Magnifies small dust. 
30131 4 Lens works great 
30132 4 The order arrived quickly. The batteries and charger have been as good as the battery that came with the camera. Performance as I would expect. 
30133 4 I m a film student in NYC and i want to take my filming to the next level. The stabilizer was a gift from a dear friend of mine. After expressing my need for a stabilizer, my friend did his research and found the perfect combination of affordable and excellency. 
30134 3 good pictures, cycle time a bit long. 
30135 4 For a DSLR such as a Canon Rebel or Panasonic GH4, you need this! Make sure you don t leave it in direct sunlight or you will burn up your LCD like ants in a magnifying glass. 
30136 0 This is horrible only because mine turned out to be a fake. It wouldn t work and looking at pictures of the same camera, they looked nothing alike. :( 
30137 4 OUTSTANDING 
30138 3 Great glasses. Everything we wanted. Thanks 
30139 1 Great product 
30140 4 Fantastic backpack for camera and accessories. I don t go anywhere without it. 
30141 0 first they sent wrong sin card , went and got the new one and it doesn t record!!!!!!!!! The pictures freeze all the time, what a waster of money!!!!! 
30142 4 Great product 
30143 4 Nice to have some extra for all my USB sticks and then some 
30144 4 A complete kit,very usefully Nice and thought camera 
30145 2 I was sceptic all at first but after playing with the cenera and learning to programimg I am very pleased 
30146 4 Excellent quality and very fast shipping thank you. 
30147 4 Great camera for a great price. Still highly recommended 
30148 4 nice product and an excellent seller 
30149 0 Zipper broke just after 30 days warranty period expired. Do not recommend this product. 
30150 4 Film didn t work Did receive refund 
30151 4 I LOVE, VERY GOOD AND EXCELLENT 
30152 0 The notes showed this was good for beginner star gazing. It s really hard to set up and not user friendly at all. 
30153 4 Fits my Tamron 150-600 mm to a T! Quality of materials and fabrication are outstanding. Should last many years of heavy use. This item was supposed to come in September, but it arrived even before the other items I purchased from Amazon on the same order! 
30154 2 Some work, some don t. When they work they are great for a dark cabinet or a gun safe. Unfortunately some arrive DOA. 
30155 4 awesome case. helps you keeping it organized and protected 
30156 4 People had mentioned previously that it doesn t seem to have the same battery life as original camera battiers, but I have not found this to be true. I am very happy with this purchase 
30157 4 Work great , not problems 
30158 3 Hard to find Polaroid type film. 
30159 4 Wonderful camera, color is sharp and clear, the night vision IR is also great. No complaints here great camera at a great price. 
30160 1 I thought it will be good from the reviews, but no. Its not a quality product, maybe some users liked it but your experience may differ. The part that connect the legs is s***ty and sort of broken? One leg gets off really easily. Sorry, not worth the money. 
30161 4 This is truly a great value and is very functional. I received this product as promised, in great condition, and it nicely fits my iPhone. I was a bit skeptical about this product because of its low price, but it is truly a great deal and it works nicely. 
30162 4 This arrived so quickly and is working like a charm. 
30163 0 Unfortunately this is not adjustable and didn t realize it is big, would not work with someone with smaller wrist. Seller is very professional. 
30164 3 Good for what it is. Head mount. I don t really use this but its not bad when wearing a hat so you don t feel the elastic sucking the hard plastic pieces onto your forehead! 
30165 0 Does not improve lens of Fuji HS50EXR, save your money. 
30166 4 I had no problem installing and they work great. 
30167 4 No complaints so far! Affordable and far more compact than the manufacturer s charger. 
30168 4 Just what we wanted. Price was good and arrived as expected. We are very satisfied. 
30169 2 Would have been far better had it come with some directions. Bought it for my wife. Neither of us are tech gurus. Will figure it out but it would have been far easier with direction. 
30170 0 The product description mentioned a non-corrosive set of accesories such as the floating handle grip and the hand-held monopod extendable telescope pole, and both have signs of corrosion starting to show in addition to the floating handle grip getting full of water. 
30171 4 After finally figuring out how the charger works, this is a wonderful thing to have. I think the instructions of use need to be a little more clear to purchasers though. Always glad to have extra batteries for my camera though. 
30172 3 This is a pretty good little remote. Was able to use it from 16 There are no bells and whistles - just shutter button and a 2 second delay option. Your camera must be set on self timer - the 10 second mode. Easy, 
30173 2 Decent product BUT they put the name of the company very large on the side. Masione. Written large on the side. Simple google search tells you they make FAKE cameras. Why not put ANYTHING else? Gonna try and sharpie black it out. 
30174 1 Great product 
30175 3 Great for the price! 
30176 3 Fast shipping. Good performance from products 
30177 1 Great for underwater photos but extremely mediocre for normal use. Flimsy strap provided broke in a week. Takes blurry photos. Disappointed. 
30178 4 Great product! Good price and fast delivery!!! 
30179 0 This stand is HORRIBLE!! Took it out box to set it up and literally pieces began to fly everywhere.The center rod disconnected from the base causing it to be un-level. I could go on for days but overall very inexpensive,bad craftsmanship, It s TRUE You Get What You Pay For 
30180 0 impossible to make it work. 
30181 2 OKay, range is a little to be desired. Batteries that came with it were dead, thought it was DOA until i switched it out. 
30182 4 Very well-built 
30183 4 Good fit for our Sony A6000 with 30mm prime lens :) 
30184 4 Works great and easy to use/install! Great online help guide too. 
30185 4 We are enjoying watching our backyard birds with this great pair of binoculars. Finally had to buy new ones after the one pair we had is over 25 years old. Thank you! 
30186 1 I am very disappointed to say the following; Item came or received not as advertised in the amazon site. Model came was &#34;Incorrect&#34; and different from the picture shown. No item description or Label see on the device itself and looks like fake and not at all a &#34;genuine&#34; product. 
30187 4 The pictures are great, I kove this camera. 
30188 4 Unbelievable. I really appreciate this product. High quality! Amazing photo, video and time-lapse! 
30189 4 perfect, just what I wanted to protect my camera when out and about. 
30190 4 Great for my purposes 
30191 0 Equipment looks great, to bad it s worthless. 
30192 4 It seems to be doing what I bought it for, protecting the lens from dust and fingerprints and etc. 
30193 2 runs out quick.... 
30194 4 For my first backdrop stand it was a great buy. Sturdy and come with a carrying case. Great value! 
30195 4 These batteries are great for on the go and work very well to keep a long charge! 
30196 2 Given as a gift. 
30197 4 Great product 
30198 4 The camera is great and the service is quick. Walter helped me get I back on the app. 
30199 2 small bag which does the job for a starter 
30200 4 This light modifier produces lovely directed light. I wish it came with a carrying case. 
30201 3 The life of these batteries is about 40% of the battery that came with my GoPro. That s an estimate. My GoPro battery lasts about 3 - 4 hours at 1080p / 60 fps. These batteries last about 1.5 - 2 hours each at the same settings. 
30202 4 The charger worked and the delivery was very good. Happy with purchase. 
30203 4 Roy 2nd call did the job .as far as camera ,for the money ,excellent and great picture and wireless ,perfect 
30204 3 Works great 
30205 4 Package came waaayyyyyy before expectancy date (like 2 weeks early )it was amazing product is gorgeous and fitsss nicceeee 
30206 4 Great !! 
30207 4 I purchased this while on vacation so I could get all of my cameras and lenses back home safe. this is an amazing case. I love it 
30208 4 Perfect day bag for quick trips. I don t like to carry all of my accessories so this works perfectly. Can fit my DSLR body, two lenses inside easily. Outside pocket is great for extra batteries and memory cards. I use the side pockets for my cell phone and money. 
30209 2 Works ok. The only thing I would recommend to the designers is away to know that a camera is truly straight. Maybe put some markers to know a camera is leveled. 
30210 4 Great batteries. They save you money as the C123 s are very expensive. I ended up buying an 18650 for 1 of the lights and it worked amazing but it was to big to fit into the other. These will do. 
30211 3 Everything was as advertised. You could spend more and only get the charger. Here you extra batteries as well. 
30212 3 ok 
30213 4 As advertised. Quicker than expected. 
30214 0 The opteka micro lens does not even fit. They really try to trick into saying this is made for the AX100 this company needs to get its act together. 
30215 4 Worked for my 77mm Variable ND Filter which had 77mm threads and 82mm opening on front. Good quality. 
30216 4 Very good for an everyday use of online selling. Be aware that this is only for small items and if you have bigger items to photo-shoot you need to get something bigger. price is excellent. 
30217 4 love the borders! perfect for a day at disneyland. 
30218 4 Awesome 
30219 4 Thank u 
30220 3 Great Cam for the price! 
30221 4 I love these camera s, and with the Hero 3+, every change has been a solid improvement. 
30222 4 got these for hero 4 silver. no problems at all, and the dual charger is super handy! also charges the GoPro battery with no problem 
30223 4 I have already used this product numerous times. Including on my boat when my camera battery died! I LOVE IT! 
30224 4 works great...and still working great 
30225 2 Everything works pretty well. It get what you paid for. But I did not recieve the spare battery in the package. It is included with the picture but I didnt get on in my order. Other than that its not half bad. 
30226 4 The sound from this little guy is great. Love the bass that comes from it. 
30227 2 The fix for the battery is a bit loose but, it does the trick for the price. 
30228 0 Without screw lock on bottom of case, camera will fall out of case.....when opening to shoot? WHY??. 
30229 3 functions well and looks good. L E D has discontinued to function after a month or so. Will not operate without a battery. 
30230 4 The best deal in a TTL flash. Complete kit with off camera remote. Everything except batteries included. TTL Zoom flash pairs perfectly with Nikon 5200. If you need a flash but unwilling to spend $300-400 for Nikon branded one, this is what you want. 
30231 0 Can t fit extended battery. 
30232 4 I ordered these especially to make colored sleeves to put over my Windows Phone in my purse (so I could find it!). I ordered Aug. 15 and received the cloths on Aug.17. 
30233 4 Good Batteries for the prices. 
30234 4 Fit easily and looks good. 
30235 4 I just received these items yesterday 8/10/2015 and everything seems to be just fine. 
30236 4 good 
30237 4 Great underwater shots! 
30238 0 Ordered in March, stopped working on June...ineligible for return. 
30239 4 Cheap and effective. Arrived very promptly 
30240 3 It s strong and smooth. The only minor drawback is it could use a locking mechanism on the horizontal axis. But the friction knob is very adequate when transporting in the wild. 
30241 3 Excellent product 
30242 4 Very Good for Great Price 
30243 4 These work just as good, if not better than the GoPro version. No complaints and you get more for your money. 
30244 4 I was nervous it wouldn t fit/work. It worked great for my Fuji Fine Pix F850EXR. Very happy. 
30245 4 Works like a charm. 
30246 4 love, have a lot to learn best next to top of line cameras lens is built in and a viewfinder. 
30247 1 I believe it was a combo of 45 plus developing time and problems with it not feeding the 1st or last pic right which left me 6 pics.....bummed was stoked on the idea. 
30248 4 Great price with great image 
30249 4 Very comfortable, and very secure. 
30250 4 perfect for a beginner 
30251 4 Work great! 
30252 4 Just what I wanted. 
30253 2 Resolution, not that good 
30254 2 works but very flimsy, do not expect to much out of this thing. 
30255 4 Clear videos....takes a learning curve to have it up and running, but I got through it. Love the &#34;quick&#34; settings so the camera can move faster. Linked it up to my cell so I can see whats going on from my workplace. Either in the home or away...very nice camera... 
30256 4 Simple case that offers protection but not a lot of bulk. I like the zipper pocket -- I can keep extra memory cards there or just a little cash. 
30257 3 Good product. 
30258 4 Just what I needed. Couldn t find the right battery for my camera. Now I m taking pics without having to purchase a new camera. Thanks. 
30259 1 Not for outdoors. I hate it 
30260 0 This was the same number battery, but did not fit my Kodak camera. 
30261 3 Great fun recording waves and surf. Can not wait for the surf to quiet down a little to get some snorkeling done. 
30262 4 Works to get better looking video using my DSLR Nikon camera 
30263 4 Quick shipping, just what I needed and works well. 
30264 4 asdf 
30265 3 The particulars of this plan seem to suit my needs if I should need to utilize this protection plan. 
30266 0 water leak about 25ft 
30267 4 Very good. 
30268 4 Great quality from DJI as expected. I have purchased knockoffs at a cheaper price and they have all failed. This is by far the better value. 
30269 4 works for me great product and real peace of mind keeping my go pro safe. Thanks!! 
30270 3 Very soft and nice just like the vonoto. This one came in the write color. 
30271 4 Very good and cheap batteries, I am satisfied ! 
30272 4 Works great and has a good picture. Pretty easy to set up. 
30273 4 I love this bag, it is now my primary 
30274 4 Exact fit for my Canon 70D. Easy to apply. Touch screen function still works perfectly. Highly recommended. 
30275 4 A gift for my father. He loves them. 
30276 0 The device didn t work 
30277 4 Perfect for my needs. Very versatile, quite bright. I have three now. I have some vision issues and this is a lifesaver when I m doing fine work 
30278 4 Fine purchase 
30279 0 The GoPro stays on perfectly. No issues with that. But if the pole is extended it rotates. To keep it in place I have to have it retracted and hold the silver part of the pole so that the GoPro stays upright. Not satisfied with this product. 
30280 4 Excelente. 
30281 4 excellent 
30282 4 Excellent and they actually float too 
30283 3 My daughter loves it. 
30284 4 So glad I bought this replacement. Works great and charges well. 
30285 4 Great kit, and great value. 
30286 4 i really like it,,its a little motion senitive but all in all a good little camera 
30287 4 Did great. Went on vacation Rained a couple of days and did not worry it got wet. 
30288 4 Working great and the longer length is nice too. 
30289 4 Can t beat it for the price! :) Fully Manual, but works! 
30290 1 the quality is noticeably worse with these papers zzz quite disappointed. the ones that come with the printer are way better. now i m going to have 100 crappy pictures ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ never again 
30291 4 Well done, I Like 
30292 4 very simple plug and play gimbal. very good value. great if you are to scared to but those metal 3D gimbals for twice the money 
30293 3 Good product, but buy the 6-pack and get the free case from the PolarPro site - better deal and more complete. 
30294 4 works well. the alarm will continue to sound until you turn it of. The GE model will stop alarming when the trigger is released. 
30295 4 Excellent case is much bigger than expected. Holds my extra batteries, suction mount, chest and head mounts, and tons of fixture adjustments. Very well padded, perfectly fits standard locks, and the pressure release valve is very useful when travelling across country with altitude changes frequently. Worth every penny. 
30296 3 Very good camera , the only flaw is the instruction book only in Japanese. 
30297 4 I recommend, fast delivery. very good 
30298 0 Reverted back to my old Pogoplug because this wasn t working right. 
30299 2 works ok, sometimes it goes off when no one comes in 
30300 4 Really good cleaning cloths!! Highly recommend for anything with a screen 
30301 4 Great! 
30302 4 Super easy to use ! 
30303 4 awesome flash for videos 
30304 4 got this as a gift... but hope to get one for myself soon. 
30305 3 Works well, I took it snorkeling with my underwater camcorder. The extending and retracting method is a bit difficult and needs getting used to. 
30306 4 Perfect for rooms. 
30307 0 Does not work. Trim falling off. 
30308 4 Shipped quickly and is as advertised. 
30309 3 Works well with my lamp stand. cord would be a little longer. 
30310 0 Cheaply made in China. Instructions would have been a big help also! Don t buy it! 
30311 0 Junk. Did not work - at all. 
30312 0 Item does not work according to the manual. very poorly made. 
30313 4 The cables were perfect. Just what we needed. They are a nice quality. 
30314 2 Very good! 
30315 4 Work just like the battery that came with the camera. So convenient and charge quickly! 
30316 4 Original cap for my Lumix camera. Fits perfectly. 
30317 4 very good 
30318 4 Very well made Product. 
30319 4 This set is awesome.It is very durable and easy to use, It keeps your go pro in place so you dont have to worry about it getting damaged or falling while in use.I recommend this to everyone to use! 
30320 4 pretty impressive little gizmo. Everyone in my office wants one. The phone app is also great. All I do is touch the app on my phone and I can see my living room. 
30321 4 Mobile phone tripod attachment. Works perfectly well. 
30322 3 It s not professional quality, but for $24.99 you can t really complain. 
30323 4 Works great! 
30324 3 It was what I wanted at an affordable price 
30325 4 perfect 
30326 4 Fast ship! Very well-designed bag at a reasonable price. 
30327 4 Nice cameras easy to install excellent picture quality 
30328 4 Just what we needed 
30329 2 It worked for me for a year and then my cmaera would not recognize it any more. Next time I will purchase a Canon grip. 
30330 2 Definition of image is not very good even with adjustments allowed by the program. But what could you expect for the price. Would be nice to add a mirror to be able to see at angle i tight space. Probably could pay twice as much and get a better image. 
30331 0 One of the Camera s don t work and the hard drive doesn t record. One of the holder for the camera is strip. They haven t responded back to my request for a new camera and hard drive.. 
30332 4 I couldn t find a better price, and their quick shipping to Hawaii is second to none. Product is as described. The precut slots are perfect for my GoPro and accessories. My only regret is not getting the large sized since I ended up buying more accessories. 
30333 4 excellent product and fast delivery 
30334 4 surprised with how solidly its built. provides extra utility as a baton, if needed. 
30335 4 Works well 
30336 4 Works great with my Honeywell vista 20p panel. I picked it specifically because CDMA coverage in my area outperforms GSM by far. Telguard interactive is also a great feature. Very happy with the product. Long time Telular customer back to SXT1 
30337 2 It s ok 
30338 4 Works great! 
30339 3 WORKS WELL. 
30340 3 Good 
30341 3 nice product i ever used. just go for it 
30342 4 Love it 
30343 0 This did not work as expected. 
30344 4 Works wonderful for all of my lens. I like the hook on them for security and also so I can hook them onto whatever bag or case I am using for easy access! 
30345 4 Great lens, check out some photos I took with it on my instagram @jonathinadams 
30346 4 Does the job it was made for. Thank You 
30347 4 Worked perfectly! 
30348 0 POJ! Make pics blurry. They make magnifiy 2x but its not worth it when every pics comes out blurry. Returning. 
30349 2 Camera is good but battery life is low. It drain out fast. Need more power full battery. 
30350 4 good 
30351 2 The mechanism seems to be doing fine, but the programming of the system is terrible. Need to make some major improvements. 
30352 4 This kit comes with everything you would need. The quality is excellent 
30353 4 Great flash best ever 
30354 4 Thank you ! 
30355 3 Great camera, underwater pics turned out awesome! 
30356 4 Great 
30357 4 Excellent product! 
30358 3 Not much to say here, good quality cloths for a pretty good price. Gave me enough to keep one near each of my primary devices, the little phone wipe is neat but overall just kind of gimmicky. I feel like it will lose it s sticky properties in short order. 
30359 0 This product worked for 1 week, then it wouldn t recharge. My opinion spend a little more money and buy a more expensive one. 
30360 4 Everything went smooth. 
30361 0 It s not what I expected you need to remove the whole front cover in order to take pictures 
30362 2 Poor / little instructions on use i cant figure out how to cycle through all cameras on full screen not switch from 1 to a 3 view. 
30363 3 Still learning to use, good starter kit in my opinion. 
30364 3 I like it a lot... My first ring light and so far is good... 
30365 4 Good product, bit of a fiddle to apply, but then they all are. Customer support from them is excellent. 
30366 4 Cheap, easy to use, small enough to fit in just about any pocket of my pack. Lasts as long as the GoPro branded stuff. 
30367 3 I bought it as a portable container for my GoPro and various accessories. It works, but despite the flexible sections inside it really isn t ideal for it. I do like it, and it seems to be holding up well. 
30368 4 Better than I had hoped for an aftermarket product. Fits perfectly and snugly to boot. Well worth it. 
30369 4 Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint. 
30370 2 The acessories not very goos, the camera is amazing, but the quality of the acessories not the same. 
30371 2 Loved the look and feel. Sadly it fell off after some time never to be seen again. 
30372 4 Works like a charm! ✔️ stabilization is quick and easy! :) 
30373 3 Works well as advertised in my Sony A6000. 
30374 4 Good 
30375 0 DVR is junk and not usable from web even internally. Received and returned to replace 3 broken cams. Should have sent the whole system back but I had already ran the cables throughout walls. I m now replacing it with blue iris and WiFi cameras 
30376 4 Awesome juice when you need it. 
30377 2 It works great thanks 
30378 4 wish it came with an owners manual like my other one. 
30379 4 First lens I got for a beginner camera. Works great. 
30380 4 this thing is better than a gopro picture good but the video is awsome 
30381 4 Great thanks!! 
30382 4 Came very quickly and works great! They don t make this camera anymore, and mine got a crack on the battery casing, so I was happy to find a good used one on amazon. VERY SATISFIED! 
30383 4 Very Good 
30384 3 Great pictures 
30385 3 Exactly as advertised. Good camera, accessories were not premium quality, but I knew that going in. This was a great value for me. I m using it to take vacation and family pictures and hobby photos. 
30386 4 It is good battery 
30387 4 Came in as expected! 
30388 0 i need help with this how do i use this i cant find out[[ASIN:B00M7RROU8 8GB Mini HD Glasses Spy Hidden Camera Sunglasses Eyewear DVR Video Recorder Cam]] 
30389 4 It arrived on time. Everything was as advertized. 
30390 4 Perfect for my Sony RX1003. Snug fit, looks good. Priced right. 
30391 4 Fits perfectly and gives piece of mind. Like some other reviewers I had the issue fitting the installed guard in my hardshell backpack, but after a little careful cutting of the pack s foam w/ a sharp knife, the guard slides right in, secured w/ the zip ties. 
30392 4 My Swann video security system came with four cameras with the DVR able to support eight. I purchased two more cameras and needed the additional power supply. This unit powered up the new cameras just fine and has been working fine for several months so far... 
30393 4 Excellent for holding multiple flash units 
30394 4 This lens hood fits perfectly on my 75mm f1.8 lens. I have not seen the Olympus equivalent, but this lens hood is well built and works as expected. 
30395 0 Dead right out of the box. My dogs were roaming the neighborhood until I could find a decent replacement. 
30396 3 as described 
30397 4 Nice backdrop. 
30398 4 Great 
30399 4 This strap makes carrying a camera very simple without pulling on the neck or being uncomfortable. I would recommend to anyone. 
30400 1 Good build quality, but did not fit my Canon EF 24-70mm 4.0 lens, despite the listed technical specifications indicating it would. 
30401 3 guuud 
30402 4 Good quality 
30403 4 I wish that I had this from the start. Now I have my 18-55 and 55-300 that are useless to me. This does it all and yes it is very well constructed. Nice Job. 
30404 4 Great Product, it is a better back pack than the actual DJI back pack. 
30405 0 Did not work! 
30406 0 Does not connect to wifi no matter how hard you try, had to return product 
30407 0 This item arrived promptly. Unfortunately the white reflector was marked with purple throughout. Whereas, I have done a lot of positive business with Fotodiox in the past, I am willing to upgrade my opinion of this product once it has been replaced. 
30408 4 Every bit as cute as shown. 
30409 4 Extremely helpful!
