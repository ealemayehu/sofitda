[BEGIN] While this will do the job, the plastic construction is very flimsy and more expensive that others that appear to be made out of better materials. Look for something else.  [END]
[BEGIN] With no OSD there is no way to change the camera settings and the picture is so bright it is almost washed out. I m replacing this one with something that will work for FPV.  [END]
[BEGIN] These batteries are not good at all. They hold a charge a fraction of the time of the regular battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] All the velcro comes off and my camera and gear gets jumbled. Great durability though! But terrible &#34;compartments.&#34;  [END]
[BEGIN] Much larger than I thought it would be, can be awkward to have hanging on your neck strap, but it does hold the lens cap so I won t lose it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I guess it is true that you get what you pay for. the frame is flimsy and I was not able to figure out how to use it. Am returning it.  [END]
[BEGIN] The first time I used, one of the lights stop working  [END]
[BEGIN] The first set did not thread properly, i was sent another set with an adapter, once using that I can no longer use my lens cap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fair  [END]
[BEGIN] box was partially crushed. cheap remote with NVR was cracked.no manual came with NVR and it appeared like it had been used before.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is not good quality,now it is not working!flash light on and any keys no function !i put it into my trash can ,it is unbelievable such kind of thing happened on Amazon!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pan head release lever broke within 6 months with minimal use. Unfortunately, past the refund date and I can t find a replacement part.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s slow  [END]
[BEGIN] The screen viewing angle was very poor. Also, the motion censor switched off the photo frame even when we were seated near by and we had no way of setting the time delay for the frame to switch off. Overall a poor design.  [END]
[BEGIN] According to bhphotovideo.com, these cameras are only 0.3 MP CMOS. To me that means LOW resolution. No wonder the listed specs are so vague. It s a good buy if you are willing to settle for such low res imaging.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything was great for a month then 3 cameras went gray. I was also unable to view on my phone or computer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hi, I bought this product and I did not get all parties. in the picture I show the items they got me and the product comes with more items. would like to know what happened to the other items that bring the product? Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Buy good one once rather than buying cheap again and again  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well for what I bought it other that the cord it s really short!  [END]
[BEGIN] Seemed like a great deal for the money, but they didn t even last a full year. Both batteries have swollen slightly (as many cheap batteries seem to do) and don t fit inside my Fuji X-T1 any more. Pretty bummed.  [END]
[BEGIN] thing broke  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor build quality and optics are poor but better than the 20-80 version. You get what you pay for. I gave them away along with the 20-80 version and bought Zeiss which are vastly superior in optical and build quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looked off, and it is a weaker model than the standard nitecore battery. This one is a 650 and normally they are 750.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing that the battery area isn t big enough for the batter and you can t close the cover to the battery area. This is a poor design for this.  [END]
[BEGIN] design is sleek However, the overall illumination is much lower than earlier generation products  [END]
[BEGIN] No instructions. can t be too sure how it works. Useless to me. Without instructions, money wasted.  [END]
[BEGIN] Smaller than expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Should have a quick release rod system, very annoying to take off or move. Also does not have much height so if you have a battery grip, it will reach none of your lenses to support, even big telephotos like me 70-200 f/2.8L. Solid metal construction.  [END]
[BEGIN] doesn t work very good  [END]
[BEGIN] It didn t work for me. Tried it with a Sony NEX7 and Canon lens and had mixed results. I could never get the autofocus to work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Glass screen came off after first use. Can t turn it off and it seems the connection might be intermittent since it seems to mess the shutter presses every 4-5 clicks.  [END]
[BEGIN] the advertise 53X was wrong, it is only 40X optical zoom !  [END]
[BEGIN] The head swivels very loosely.  [END]
[BEGIN] SImply put, ...cheap ...cheap ...cheap. Don t waste your funds on this.  [END]
[BEGIN] you will get good wide angle view but in spite of adjusting all the exposure parameters, you will not see details in image. Details and sharpness is very poor. You will see lot of reviews which will say great value for price but image quality is very poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very very little.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bot cords, the power cord and the backup camera cord are too short. Cannot hide the cords. Don t let them say otherwise. I have a Honda Accord, and both cords are too short. Mirror also vibrates a little when driving. So I will lengthen the cords by soldering them.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera works well when tied directly to the router, but will not sync wireless.  [END]
[BEGIN] it feels cheap the tripod stand is so tiny you cant set it on rocks to get a higher view  [END]
[BEGIN] One blade stopped working after three days. Have not been able to use it since.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works ok color is really poor but for the money its ok  [END]
[BEGIN] A cheap filter isn t worth the loss in image quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] The plastic thread is horrible, I tried it on my different lenses and I can t get it to work properly. You can t really tighten it up as the plastic won t allow it. Just a waste of money!  [END]
[BEGIN] im not happy, the cable gets out. need a stronger closer  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted to like this camera, but sand got under the shutter button the very first time I used it at the beach. Back it went. If you need something for the pool and not the beach, this would work great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use, video and audio quality is very poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] The velcro came ripped and I ll need to do something about that so I can put it on my belt or something  [END]
[BEGIN] Received and the snaps began to pull apart one by one. The canvas is nice and the bag is roomy enough but the quality of the securing snaps is very poor.  [END]
[BEGIN] the buttons are small and I cant tell if I am recording or not.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quality weak  [END]
[BEGIN] I wish I hadn t bought it because every time I have to change the battery it turns into a whole process to remove the cover.  [END]
[BEGIN] I would recommend an actual finder scope, but if you need a reflex finder the reviews clearly indicate that the Telrad is the way to go. I have this one, and it works OK, but that s about it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Difficult for an amateur  [END]
[BEGIN] worked well for about 6 months, and then something inside popped, and now it doesnt work. the warranty is a lie, as yognuo customer service doesnt exist. just invest in a higher quality flash and save yourself the time! this is my 2nd one ive burned thru this year!  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh.  [END]
[BEGIN] returned it due to bad photo quality ..  [END]
[BEGIN] Strap broken. Good while lasted.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok. Not worth the time. Just get a macro lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very grainy video. Not an original sj4000 as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Be sure to test. Lost my waterproof camera the first time it was used on the river kayaking. One would not even slow it down as it sank out of sight.  [END]
[BEGIN] fall apart too easily  [END]
[BEGIN] Honestly I m really disappointed in this boom, or maybe my expectations where to high, don t extent it compleatly out, it will not support well. It s not terrible, but for neewer... It s not great either.  [END]
[BEGIN] they dont work at all,cam wont focus no matter what lens i use,i wish i cold return it but i cant because ill have to pay for shipping.  [END]
[BEGIN] Only runs two hours. What s that going to get you?! Understanding enclosed set of directions was a waste of our time. Googled further instructions, got the things working but found it insufficient for our needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this but the camera itself doesn t work. Even though I have a new sdcard  [END]
[BEGIN] Loss of resolution  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased it for my Canon Cool Pix S6900, but it wouldn t even zip shut.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t fit snug enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] really too small, I will have to get a larger one to fit the camera better  [END]
[BEGIN] the battery is worthless!! charge it at the house by the time you get somewhere the battery is dead! all the stuff is cool but can t use it????????  [END]
[BEGIN] Way too heavy for the Phantom 1. Sucks power from the battery twice as fast, and rarely keeps the camera fully leveled.  [END]
[BEGIN] didn t fit  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger has green light on as soon as you plug it in and stays that way even after you insert a battery into the charging port forever. There is no way to tell is the battery has been charged or not. It seems like a defect. Not recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor image quality and very poor instructions - none. Returned item....  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to set up. Many times refused to accept password. Finally worked on WiFi to phone until I unplugged to move to permanent location. One plugged back in and reboot, can no longer connect. Will give support chance on Monday. If no luck it goes back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Description needs to be clear that a lens adapter is necessary.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came is a package that was crumpled up and the stickers are all wrinkled really bad. I m afraid to try and put them on my drone with all the folds in the stickers. The need to ship this on a hard cardboard sheet.  [END]
[BEGIN] broke down fast...not good  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality is not so good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty flimsy. Does not offer much protection for camera and equipment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the best quality. They go bad pretty quick.  [END]
[BEGIN] My son has been having problems with camera not ejecting the photos. We have to take out a battery for a complete reset in order for the camera to spit out the photo.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great idea but takes forever to charge a couple of AA batteries. Would not recommend it, and the sun is strong where I live so I should get better results  [END]
[BEGIN] Need to return it. After charging it and downloading the FreeFlight app 3. I hit the take off button and it goes up about 3 feet and drops to the ground. I will be returning it and now test out customer service. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] breackdown in 2 days!  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t fit Leica typ 109 despite listing it in the name / description. Left gaps around all sides - small gaps, but it looked awfully hodge-podgy. Imagine getting a phone film protector which didn t go edge to edge. Undermines the point, in a way.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hi, I bought this flash is not working me properly, I do not return because it is more expensive to send to me it replaced, I hope the next to buy me out as good as another that I have almost a year. Thank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh!! If there is a little wind, it will shake the stand and probably knock your camera down.  [END]
[BEGIN] The top peice broke the day after.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its not what i was specting. And dont know how to instal it dint come with instuction. So a had to pay some one to doit but keep going offline  [END]
[BEGIN] Expected better quality photos. Not clear as I had hoped. Still fun to play around with.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t know it I got a bad batch, but I would say that at least half the prints came out blank.  [END]
[BEGIN] I thought I was getting a macro lens, but I recieved a wide angle lens  [END]
[BEGIN] Very small and not very sturdy material but can t beat price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked greatfor about 3 days and then broke  [END]
[BEGIN] Look and Fill wise Product is good and it shipped before delivery date. The battery life for continuous video recording is just 30 min, which is very less and the main reason of dislike of the product. Quality of video/image is not outstanding and just ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] Waste of Money  [END]
[BEGIN] the quality of this camera is very good. It is one of the best quality HD ip cameras out there. Config is easy to do, if it weren t buggy. Does not send email notifications, Google uploads, etc. Without software, the camera is worthless.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this as a gift and it quit working after about a year as well. I have a 10&#34; and it is still working great so not sure why this one seems to die after a year. Sad because my sister enjoyed it before it gave out.  [END]
[BEGIN] My eyes could not focus with them, I sent them back.  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t change stop-wise when you spin it. I d return it if it wasn t a hassle.  [END]
[BEGIN] they broke off  [END]
[BEGIN] tough and well made, but terrible image quality. had to return it  [END]
[BEGIN] It s hard to take a picture when case is attached, because it gets in the way. The quality of the product is as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] In the description it said it was compatable with my camera, after opening the package the batteries didn t even come close to fitting. The company was very easy to work with and issuing a refund  [END]
[BEGIN] It s very thin and cheaply made (I guess you get what you pay for). I am not happy with this product at the moment. I will attempt to hang it and take a few photos too see how it shows up on camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Piece of garbage! It broke within three minutes of me taking it out of the box! definitely want money back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Zero firmware updates. Need ActiveX to configure Motion Detection. Why is this old junk still for sale?  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t stay connected as well as I d like, but with some ingenuity I made it work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looses electric connection after a few weeks. Wouldn t recommend getting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really weak and flimsy, overall wished I spent more money on a strap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to return as it never worked. Return was easy enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product worked about 3hours then 2 of the motors burned out. One wont even turn junk!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok for a monopod, feels cheap and unsteady with a Nikon d610 attached. Good enough for a point and shoot though. Upgraded to a a Manfrotto monopod shortly after purchasing this. Should have just skipped this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found what I wanted and I was really excited. But when it came in the mail it was the wrong product.  [END]
[BEGIN] screw not Tight enough for nexus 7, can not support  [END]
[BEGIN] D-rate too low, zeiss lens does not show good Saturation, Effective focus range too little, dont expect it can make any bokeh or blurry background at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] The items in this shipment We re good quality but this does NOT come with a bag. My order did not include all items advertised. There was no carrying bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] doesnt fit right to original hero 4 unit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The worst part is that it is actually a really good monitor. with all the nobs and settings you can not turn off the volume. so basically you are stuck listening to what ever you are shooting.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not fit well  [END]
[BEGIN] Not a good camera but does barely adequate video.  [END]
[BEGIN] This lens hood was fine for a while, but started to tear and was not usable. Also, fully extended, the lens hood showed up in the pictures and had to be cropped out.  [END]
[BEGIN] only one of the two batteries actually works  [END]
[BEGIN] Image is ok Smartphone works ok Cannot upgrade firmware Image don t show at PC software No website information  [END]
[BEGIN] It works but is a little &#34;twitchy&#34; in that it doesn t always want to work properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] The pictures all look hazy blue. What I was seeing was more colorful than the pictures. Sending back  [END]
[BEGIN] Alright for walking, but not jarring action.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed no memory card included  [END]
[BEGIN] Wifi switch broke after a few days. Great camera and water proof case.  [END]
[BEGIN] Flimsy and detaches from frame easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works but just not great I the they hyped the product a little much  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to install. I had one camera stop working after 6 months.  [END]
[BEGIN] too small  [END]
[BEGIN] It s not so great for outdoors :( I hate it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hood needs to fix.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too tight  [END]
[BEGIN] Foggy picture.  [END]
[BEGIN] This broke within days of using it.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s a good system. However, I wish it wasn t complicated to connect to your wireless device such as download Skype set up two different Skype accounts in order to view live on your wireless devices  [END]
[BEGIN] the battery does not fit in exactly as this is for multiple types of batteries. Consequently, my grandchild who uses it becomes frustrated at times.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very disappointed that it did not have belt loop to allow it to be carried on my pants belt. It is simply a cover.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, eh. I d spend that much on a good coffee, but the quality just sucks. It &#34;works&#34; but the instructions are inaccurate, the thing has to be reset all the time and the image quality is terrible. If you want one of these, spend a little more.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was not happy with the camera. Quality is so so. I am returning it and purchased the printer to work with my smartphone.  [END]
[BEGIN] didn t last very long :(  [END]
[BEGIN] another one bites the dust after I took it in the water 100 buck down  [END]
[BEGIN] Meh optics, sent it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] No, used it on Sony Handycam HD, it did not improve telephoto capability the way I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] disappointed in the fact that the autofocus feature on the camera will not work with this lens  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheap and not easy to use I ended up going to Sams Club and having my slides professionally transferred the Quality was so much better at Sams Club then this device claimed there product would be, Stay away from it, waist of time and money  [END]
[BEGIN] The small diameter of the tripod are is prohibitive. I have a very small tripod (fits easily into a water bottle pouch on a bag), and I couldn t get it into this tiny thing. At best, the diameter is 1.5&#34;-2&#34;. Don t recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good Product, but it s not useful, due to the position of the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] i would not recommend purchasing this item.. for a few more dollars you can can abetter product  [END]
[BEGIN] no what I expected. Not expecting a fisheye look. I thought it was just a wide angle lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] not very functional.  [END]
[BEGIN] The first one broke as soon as I got it so I had another shipped...seller was great, item somewhat cheap  [END]
[BEGIN] No comments  [END]
[BEGIN] Constantly falls off camera lens, very limited use.  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for. I spent way too much time on each prop to get them as close to balanced as I could. The system didnt seem to be very accurate on any even and balanced surface I tried it on.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera did not meet my expectations because the motion detector mode and the sound detector mode activated the camera every 2 minutes for two hours. It works okay in manual mode and the image quality is mediocre. It does come with may attachments for mounting the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] You really get what you pay for here. The filters scratch VERY easily.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works if you only want to take less than 99 photos per sequence. Mine broke because of poor quality battery door, but mfg replaced it. Next time I ll spend more and get one that will take unlimited photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] The set I received have no lining. They are just neoprene bags. They are okay. Certainly nothing like advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Honestly, I feel like I get better white balance when using my white and grey cards. I followed the instructions in the video but this just doesn t work that well, in my opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not work they were not compatible with the batteries  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the items came incomplete. I would like to contact the seller accordingly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Macro is not great. Better buy separate macro lens. The sharpness and clarity is hugely compromised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Hard to focus.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t notice really any difference....  [END]
[BEGIN] Cons : 1 - Flamsy. 2 - No .. including. 3 - bad full rig. Pros : 1 - Great price. 2 - Get the job done.  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger stopped working after 6-months. How do I utilize the 1-year manufacture s warranty if I can t get any contact information for the company who makes the unit? It was purchased 10/21/2014.  [END]
[BEGIN] The joint isn t strong enough to use on my Harley. The vibrations are just too much. Probably great for a mountain bike or road bicycle, but not for a vibration machine like a Harley.  [END]
[BEGIN] The battery dies quickly and it constantly has to be re-programmed. It goes with the the old saying &#34;You get what you pay for.&#34;  [END]
[BEGIN] So heavy!  [END]
[BEGIN] The head is plastic and not capable of holding a DSLR. Legs are fine, but the head is overrated. Maybe for a dinky little point and shoot it would make a decent travel tripod., but that s about all.  [END]
[BEGIN] no work for me  [END]
[BEGIN] Took me a while to put together. No manual  [END]
[BEGIN] The view is decent at night but blurry during the day even when it is adjusted for focus  [END]
[BEGIN] I found this product to be very flimsy without much padding to protect my camera and lenses. It is also lacking in pocket space. I have a case that is half the size with many more pockets and thick padding and I fit more things in it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice unit, but range is 50-75 feet  [END]
[BEGIN] The strap broke immediately and the last 3 (of an expensive roll of film -only 12 photos) did not print out. Instructions on the &#34;lighting&#34; button on camera would have been preferred.  [END]
[BEGIN] The batteries have a high self-discharge rate. After a week of non use, they need to be recharged.  [END]
[BEGIN] POOR QUALITY, SOMETIMES IT WILL SYNCHRONIZE WITH THE CAMERA, OTHERS DONT !! DONT BUY THIS !!  [END]
[BEGIN] The screen was scratched.  [END]
[BEGIN] Image quality is poor on any setting. Action shots are impossible to achieve.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works so so... you need to be on ice if you ever want it that smooth if you get my drift! enjoy the bumpy footage!  [END]
[BEGIN] Pins all bent up. Two sockets missing two pins each!  [END]
[BEGIN] They are really cheap batteries. They do not last 10 to fifteen shots. waste of money  [END]
[BEGIN] Monopod is useful for a video camcorder. Tripod camera mount plate/plastic clamp is so weak YOUR EXPENSIVE DSLR WILL FALL RIGHT OFF! You ve been warned. This is an imported piece of trash that is an expensive mistake!  [END]
[BEGIN] Well the build quality was alright but the actual use of this item was horrible. It would slide on its own and hit the insects id try to photograph. do not buy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Inserted the sd card and it got lost in the camera. Had to take camera apart to get it out. Re-inserted, tested camera, and didn t work. Returned camera and sd card. Won t order anything that small again.  [END]
[BEGIN] I still have been able to get it to work  [END]
[BEGIN] This umbrella soft box does not have a white interior as the description claims. That was the only reason I bought this version over the others that are available and it was incorrect. The build quality was fine for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than the factory dji box, but you still have to remove the rotors and it bends the RC antennas a little. Also the pockets and zipper storage for the rotors would be too tight and potentially bend them.  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased these to use on a Galaxy S6 and was disappointed, the clip did not fit well and the Macro only seemed to come into focus if the object was about 0.50&#34; so I returned them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Better stay off it unless u have all day time and a dead specimen to click.  [END]
[BEGIN] Horrible quality. Get a better camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] not user friendly  [END]
[BEGIN] Too much distortion, even after you set the Lens Conversion setting. This is true for both the wide angle and the telephoto. The telephoto is worse, though. You re better off just spending more money on a better attachment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lena cap does not fit hood  [END]
[BEGIN] The product comes in Chinese letters and could not figure out how to put it into english.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great bag, too small for 9900. returned bag  [END]
[BEGIN] Low Quality Gives cameras a rainbow on the screen  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera is good but the rest of the assessories are garbage. The batteries on the battery charger wont charge. The cleaning solution was open and everything on the inside of the bag was wrecked so I had to be thrown away.  [END]
[BEGIN] the backpack does look like the one is the picture doesn t say DJI on it disappointed  [END]
[BEGIN] I m not a camera person...not what I expected...  [END]
[BEGIN] Not good for all cameras listed. The case included is tiny.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s nice enough but it keeps corrupting the USB stick that stores the photos. I ve had to reload the USB several times now.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera works well when the ethernet cable is plugged in but the wireless function is very hard to set up and goes offline several times a day. I don t recommend this unit so keep looking.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Vixen representative gave me incorrect information about its compatibility for use on my Pentax spotting scope. It cost me shipping and insurance to obtain a full refund.  [END]
[BEGIN] Impossible to set up. Our son could not figure it out and he is a network engineer!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clamp may work well enough. But I didn t get that far. The arms inside the Gopro mount adapter are too thick. When I mount the camera, the screw does not reach the nut on the opposite side. Useless to mount a Gopro. Back it goes.  [END]
[BEGIN] What do you expect for 25.00 dollars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t give me the results I was looking for. However, that may be my lack of understanding of infrared filters.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disconnects during transfers to my smart phone, got no response from Nikon as to the software they provide. Cannot maintain a connection to my Nikon D3200. Waste of money...  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, the build quality could be much better. Specially the pol filter is tricky to screw on and easily can fall off. Was expecting much better quality for such a price tag.  [END]
[BEGIN] The green part is dark. Not a true choroma green color.. Requires more light to render green screen properly... I regret buying it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too heavy for a phone, and the quality of the picture comes out too distorted on the edges. The quality of the alleged &#34;Professional HD&#34; camera lens needs serious improvement. I love wide lens, but this one is a big disappointment.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lens stopped working in a year.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product itself is good but I do not receive the rubber pad neither the top rubber cover  [END]
[BEGIN] Gives connection error after a few clicks..  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price but the rubber eyecup pulled loose from the plastic frame and had to be glued before I attached it to my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great purchase - but 8 months later, it s completely stopped working.  [END]
[BEGIN] The case is fine but it did not protect my camera lens when the bag got dropped. Now that I had to purchase a new lens, I am also purchasing a more protective case.  [END]
[BEGIN] after two months my video on my smart phone is connecting to someone else s camera I don t know where in the world! App crashes every single time  [END]
[BEGIN] The time stamp wouldn t deactivate when I chose &#34;no date.&#34; Everything else was great, but I don t want a time/date stamp on all my videos, so I sent it back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great shipping product wasn t that great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pretty much disappointed in bebop drone 1000 down the drain.  [END]
[BEGIN] The I have had this camera for exactly 47 days and the lens is already making a weird &#34;zipper noise&#34; whenever the lens extends. Not only is this affecting my audio, but I fear the problem is only going to get worse..  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small to be functional/useful. Camera fits, but nothing else.  [END]
[BEGIN] I am glad that it came with two. After a couple hours of use. The string that loops around your waterproof camera began to fry, deeming it useless if you lose your camera anyways. I would recommend purchasing a better quality floatation device for your camera/what have you.  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t prevent from shaking and swinging while walking and filming.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was sent quickly hover charger was not correct model. Both batteries were correct howe ve charger did not fit these batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wobbly. Great for stationary video. Terrible for anything in on the go. The clamp is fine, but the swivel mechanism wobbles.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t look like the photo at all, came in a reddish color and the flap was completely flat without a circular indent for the lens like the picture shows. It s an OK case, just not what I expected or wanted  [END]
[BEGIN] I have owned this for less than a month and have discovered that it it used and only charges on one terminal i bought a duel charger which is not duel  [END]
[BEGIN] Broke after one year.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice in theory. Not able to wrap hand around camera and still use shutter button with out loosening grip.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped working after a week. Should have installed it earlier to enable processing of refined... instead, sat on the dining room table for a month prior to installation...  [END]
[BEGIN] Not worth the money  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is only meant to fill in spots with real cameras around. If this is the only camera, everyone will know it is fake after about a week.  [END]
[BEGIN] You get what you pay for. The very first day two of the clips to hold the legs extended snapped. Easily glued back together. You get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its ok. the only bad thing is you have to make sure all the air is out of the space between the lens and the gopro. if not the footage would look like crap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Menu comes up in chinese and the majority of the interface requires ActiveX. Not compatible with Linux.  [END]
[BEGIN] It did what it was supposed to do. Sadly it came off very easily. Eventually it was lost and never seen again.  [END]
[BEGIN] return  [END]
[BEGIN] While this is a terrific idea, the adhesive gave way by the second time I took the lens cap off. I am keeping them to see if I can find another way to make it stick. Other than that they are easy to &#34;install&#34; and they arrived quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased it thinking to record while walking around but the videos are just too shacky to be watched. A stabilizer is the best options.  [END]
[BEGIN] I consider it false or disingenuous advertisement to advertise a wireless system, especially for DIYers, that doesn t include the essential wireless component, the Wifi Module communicator that enables the system to &#34;communicate wirelessly! &#34; It s another charge for the Wifi module communicator.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not very good. The metal port got stuck in my laptop port second time I used it. Video isn t bad. It s just made like crap.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this looking for a durable tripod for my ipod and this wasn t a very good product. The legs get very thin at the bottom and it is cheap and unstable. I would advise to spend a little more money to buy a better one.  [END]
[BEGIN] not as good as expected, case is large enough for intended use with GoPro and accessories; however, the zipper malfunctioned on initial use. no wont open without having to hold the zipper in place so not to further tear. very disappointing...  [END]
[BEGIN] defective on surface, make unusable for professional use, as metal scuff, or little dents or cracks make base bump. Try another model type that couldn t get easily damaged......well China low quality products and poor model design some times make things bad.  [END]
[BEGIN] this case is really too small for the Sony Cyber shot for which I bought it. :o(  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is built using low quality plastic. The maximum syn speed is only 1/160s. If you are looking for a higher syn speed like me, you will be very disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] It shows in my 18-55 at the lower range focal lengths and the threading is weak. Dont get it for short lenses.  [END]
[BEGIN] They didn t have the size I needed so It was a waste. But the product seems to be good.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its so dificult instol softweare. I m sorry but I returned back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had this battery for about 6 months now. Worked for 2 or 3 charges, now no longer accepts a charge, so its pretty much useless already.  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality of the product I received was sub par - the screws weren t properly fitted and the build quality is bad - The shoe mount on the bottom is loose. Unhappy with the product.  [END]
[BEGIN] It did not quite work for the eos as it completely covered the dial for focusing the viewfinder. Bummed.  [END]
[BEGIN] very difficult to make sense of the instructions for playback. I used this for the birth of my Great Granddaughter so I don t want to return it because I don t want to lose the footage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ordered two cords... one was fine. The other did not work. I checked the system w a different cable and it worked fine. Just a bad cable.  [END]
[BEGIN] cheap  [END]
[BEGIN] poor quality. very cheap made you get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good idea to create this, but build quality is really bad. It cannot securely lock with the small plastic attachment.  [END]
[BEGIN] works ok but not very loud i bought it to use inside as a &#34;help&#34; alarm but the chime is not loud enough to be heard will have to get something else  [END]
[BEGIN] waterproof case is good but the suction does not stick  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t expect that &#34;Anti-glare&#34; means frosted, I don t like that. And the little one for shoulder screen doesn t fit, it s a bit smaller than the screen.  [END]
[BEGIN] The charger seems to work but one of the batteries will not hold a charge any more. This happened after 2 months. I d spend your money on the samsung battery as a spare and not worry about a charger. You can charge the batteries using an external pack anyway.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s difficult to turn the camera off or on, or to change the camera card, without taking the camera down from its mounting position, unlike front-loading cameras. i would not buy another one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Tiny bag must be like 4x3x2  [END]
[BEGIN] Cool little device but not for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] If you can spend money and buy something better go for  [END]
[BEGIN] This case is too small for my camera, so I don t use it. The return shipping fee is almost the same as the price of the case, so I didn t bother to return it. It does look well-made, however.  [END]
[BEGIN] these are rough, they do the job protecting the stuff but dont think you can use them as lens cleaners too like a real goggle bag does. if they made a 5 pack of smith goggle bags or oakley goggle bags that is what most people are looking for !!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] My hope was to use this as a baby monitor however the picture and sound won t stay up on any of my apple devices so it is not a good solution for a baby monitor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not as pictured Missing bag Missing screw Missing filter  [END]
[BEGIN] You pay for what you get. It has decent quality and video. Mine had a black dot right in the middle of the sun when it was in veiw. Don t let it take shock at all it ll screw it up bad. Mine no longer works properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera does not focus good at all, the color seems to be off some, Not true color. and the night vision was super grainy even with some light.. I have several cheaper Zosi cameras and they are much better quality then this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t waste your money. Just buy more battery packs  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to return this item. The built is good, it s also bright but the green spike is a little too much.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looked like it was gonna work great. Then an oring broke before first use. Total garbage.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good but i think this have remot for com  [END]
[BEGIN] was not all there len cap missing got 3 lens and the case hat all no len cover cap bad......[[ASIN:B003QQYFLA Bower VFK46C 5-Piece 46mm Digital Filter Kit]]  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t hold a charge for longer than three weeks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought 2 and both are coming apart at the seam. Good when they work, though...  [END]
[BEGIN] Th sound don´t fuction.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product doesn t like brand new as the inner filter box was quite dirty and there is a dent on filter can t be cleaned off. I am in oversea so can t return it, not a good experience this time  [END]
[BEGIN] This Tripod is very wobbly. I put my camera on it and the legs bend extremely easy. I cannot recommend this product. it is cheaply made with cheap materials. I dont trust my camera with this Tripod  [END]
[BEGIN] Set up is pain I had D link cameras too and it didn t require port forwarding, and all other critical set up activities. It was just plug n play. Returning product and getting Dlink again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems to be poor quality - I don t really trust it.  [END]
[BEGIN] LED lighsts only works with with battery packs and not batteries. The lights were smaller than expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Probably works great for small action recorders, but will not work with a dslr as they are just too heavy for the timer to be able to keep its balance while spinning.  [END]
[BEGIN] built like crap  [END]
[BEGIN] Your device will slip out of the Phantom 3 tablet holder using this shield. Not a good fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The float stick works well but after using it on vacation it already has water in it that won t come out. The extension stick is crappy, it s hard to extend.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is too bulky- when it is closed it s also too large still.  [END]
[BEGIN] Overpriced for a piece of plastic, but it works as advertised. (It looks big, bulky, and silly when attached to the flash unit)  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] The last flash that I bought is not properly shut continue on after turning it off , and the other does not work correctly the locking when mounted on the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased this product. It came with NO instructions whatsoever. Can someone provide me with English instructions?  [END]
[BEGIN] Likely sufficient is shooting photos from the sidelines or traveling by car but for the hiker, too heavy, too bulky and too cumbersome.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera was in a very good condition. Just I didn t get then what &#34;body only&#34; mean, and buying a lense now is another $150 and also an SD card. So I might as well buy a new camera in that price. Thank you again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cheaply made.  [END]
[BEGIN] Had a difficult time uploading the video. Still have problems so I don t use much.  [END]
[BEGIN] leaves little spots all over the sensor.  [END]
[BEGIN] while this may be a good camera, we had to return it because it s rather bulky. Should ve looked closer at the pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] The price is good, but the batteries do not mark the used percentage correctly.. so they hapen to die at any time with no notice. they don t work for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Audio is worthless.  [END]
[BEGIN] Get what you pay for...zippers pull apart and seams have torn after a few months of occasional use. Not professional at all. If you use in home studio and don t move...work fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] TTL not reliable  [END]
[BEGIN] The unit itself is decent the cameras are great resolution, but amcrest DVR s offer more capabilities, and worse yet the Hard drive failed in less than a week, requiring a warranty repair.  [END]
[BEGIN] I wanted to like this... I really really did. But it cannot hold the weight of a flash, receiver and umbrella. No matter how tight I made it. An entire shoot it was sideways.  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved the length! but the sound quality is horrible, sometimes it sounded like i was under water!  [END]
[BEGIN] Would not buy this again. The camera quality is not there but the app is even worse i gave up on it and now the camera sits in a box.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t get the 1/4 inch loops for the camera bodies???? The strap feels good but I was a tad disappointed to discover the item was not complete... I m assuming the camera connection screws were supposed to be in the kit?  [END]
[BEGIN] Material that touches my neck irritates it. Wish i hadn t wasted my money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Unable to figure it out. Still trying.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great until they break at the foot of the 600ex-rt. 2 recent ones broke only after several months of use - the plastic used here apparently is not nearly as good as previous versions.  [END]
[BEGIN] At least half of these so far have had little to no charge but still way cheaper then the energizer or Duracell options.  [END]
[BEGIN] TriPod stand broke after a few uses  [END]
[BEGIN] The lense does a great job. I paid for the 2x converter as well but didn t get it. So you won t get everything you pay for, beware.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery doesn t last long. It died to quickly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Optic are kind of okay but your phone adopter is very poorly made it it is off the track very easy and flimsy!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Snapped in riptide current.  [END]
[BEGIN] Two day prime was five days! And the new camera I bought may have been factory reconditioned. Charger and Battery don t work. have to return. Either bad luck or bad business...  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought it for my daughter to play with. The pictures are blurry & grainy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Description said 30 LED would light up, as shown in the picture. The ones received only have one blinking red light. Disappointed in the description.  [END]
[BEGIN] Warning. My Wasabi charger died after approximately one year. The battery works ok.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera its self is great. Great picture and clarity. But the mounting bracket is cheap and doesn t hold the camera, it falls off all the time and even with the instructions it hard to navigate through the setting.  [END]
[BEGIN] hoping for aluminum !  [END]
[BEGIN] The battery and the travel charger are NOT FOR THIS CAMERA! The charger clearly says for a NIKON and the battery is the WRONG SIZE! Do not waste teh extra $20 thinking you are getting a good deal, You are better off buying the extra battery and travel charger elsewhere.  [END]
[BEGIN] Haven t been able to use it as it is missing the top bracket  [END]
[BEGIN] I am not real enthusiastic about the picture quality. The picture will jump for days on in and then finally stop. Get what you pay for I guess  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered 1 pair these I think came from California. ..and the were garbage. Very poorly made and didn t last long at all ....the part that came from China was very well made and had a locking ring and screw ....  [END]
[BEGIN] One camera was missing the antenna  [END]
[BEGIN] It s a Micro USB charger. Nothing more.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great concept, but it wouldn t velcro around my hands any way i tried. I may have had a defective one but i had to return it. Seemed like the velcro was in the wrong place.  [END]
[BEGIN] Klugy, but it works.  [END]
[BEGIN] Almost all the photos I took came out blurry, and I did follow the directions and made sure I was within 3 feet of the subject, etc. Disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good bundle.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not work on my Canon Flash.  [END]
[BEGIN] This product is not as it appears in the ad. It is an ordinary, round mirror; so don t imagine an oval that fits our small, rear view mirrors. Fooled me with the picture. If you want a little, round mirror, shop locally.  [END]
[BEGIN] wouldn t recommend due to vignetting showing up on videos.  [END]
[BEGIN] The ad claims that the fp100c works in the SX70 camera but the plastic case is too large to fit in the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] I returned this item as it does what it says but there is noticeable signal loss and distortion.  [END]
[BEGIN] This selfie stick is really nice but it broke on me the third time I used it. The middle piece broke off and I could not salvage it and had to throw it away. It also took the longest time to sync with my iPhone.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works ok. But will not connect to wifi  [END]
[BEGIN] Has a defect. A line straight across. I ll keep it only because I got it on a great deal.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s just a not good product. It s cheap to the touch.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t seem very secure even as tight as possible. Getting a bit of shake from the joint on the clam shell to the arm.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera worked ok but upon playback the colors were washed out, no matter what settings I had it on. Returned  [END]
[BEGIN] This lens had a bubble Cant make a difference in photography, but looks defective.  [END]
[BEGIN] very poor quality lens filter coloring on the glass was uneven when they arrived and the threads did not match up to the lens very well at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] I can t write about the function of the product except that I was not able to use it for my purpose.  [END]
[BEGIN] I could never get the cameras to work while i was away from home. Hired professionals to connect the cameras -no luck. Planning on returning all items.  [END]
[BEGIN] too bulky  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to return twice because two of the three lenses did not fit the camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Went out of control and crashed!  [END]
[BEGIN] The pole smells like metal and rusted after only one use.  [END]
[BEGIN] The string that attaches to the camera is so thin and weak that a strong gust of wind will threaten to snap it. I lost my camera on a particularly rough dive this past winter when the string let go.  [END]
[BEGIN] Completely made of plastic. Feels like a knockoff. Returned it immediately  [END]
[BEGIN] didn t work with my technology  [END]
[BEGIN] Lost my GoPro while whitewater rafting, as I relied on just this head strap to secure the camera to my helmet. Should have had an additional chin strap and &#34;floaty&#34; back door for some redundancy.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor quality all the way around vision is blurry and the audio pretty much don t work unless you re right on it!! But you get what you pay 4.:-! :-\  [END]
[BEGIN] Zippers no good both have broken off. now I need a new bag  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not appear to work unless plugged directly into router. I have asked how to get it to connect on its own without the ethernet cable but received no response.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stiff on the neck  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small for the camera models suggested.  [END]
[BEGIN] Way too big for this girl.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera worked well in &#34;live&#34; mode, but failed to respond in &#34;motion detection&#34; at any setting on both cameras I purchased. Easy to set up and a great clear picture, but I purchased them for the motion detection feature and cannot get it to work after a month of trying.  [END]
[BEGIN] first one was not connecting wireless to phone or ipad. was on phone with tech support for 90 minutes and they couldn t get it to work. Will try a replacement. Software would not recognize camera and connect.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery function does not work cannot seem to charge battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Can t get it to work. It works maybe once out of ever 20 clicks if I hold it right up against the camera. I m using it with a Nikon D3200  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent item, solved my problem  [END]
[BEGIN] It works fine not the best picture at nice. I found another camera that 800 tvl and $1.50 cheat. With way better picture and much better night view. I would not buy this one again  [END]
[BEGIN] This case was okay when new but, over time, the inside lining started to fray. Some of the lint got into the camera and damaged it. The camera lens can no longer zoom.  [END]
[BEGIN] Motion trigger is pretty good. Lightning trigger is rubbish!!  [END]
[BEGIN] To much to adjust. Head locking device does not hold the scope tight. The screw that tensions on the scope mount fell out on my first back packing trip. Also a little heavy.  [END]
[BEGIN] the battery arrived two days later than expected. for whatever reason, the batter charge only lasted 1 day before having to recharge it again. Now after one month, the batter is no longer chargeable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Rated these 2 stars because although these are really cool. They are not HD. They aren t worth this much money if they are claiming to be full 1080p HD because they aren t high quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] this camera software is not good , and setup is not very ease , after some figuring out got it to work but would not buy again , the camera specs are good but the app to operate on mobile app is not, remote view away from home gives trouble  [END]
[BEGIN] Case leaks you get what you pay for  [END]
[BEGIN] Some parts broke after use , some are working ok  [END]
[BEGIN] One of my six units quit working after only 3 weeks, I contacted the seller and they said to send back the intercom that doesn t work at MY EXPENSE.  [END]
[BEGIN] Leaking - will be returning for refund. Maybe I just got a dud?  [END]
[BEGIN] Should have known better, for the price, it is exactly what I should have expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] I got this but soon realized that, I don t typically want to share a photo with anyone/anything before editing it a bit in Photoshop. So...not really using it at the moment. I did a small amount if testing and I had no problems with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] I no longer own this camera. It has a propensity of shutting in mid use.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the filter, but find it difficult to get on and off the lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Glass was flawed with a discolored spot within the middle third of the filter. Rendered unusable. Should have been a rejected product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ok  [END]
[BEGIN] This specifies that it fits the Canon PowerShot SX60---it does not. I m hoping that I will be able to return it but have had no response to my inquiry from several weeks ago.  [END]
[BEGIN] only worked once or twice  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera works well enough for the price but the monitor want cut on ..so I just got it hooked to a TV ..  [END]
[BEGIN] The TTL function on one of mine doesn t work. Didn t realize till after return window was closed.  [END]
[BEGIN] had problems getting it to thread with my UV filter but after a few tries it fitted  [END]
[BEGIN] Well-ordered this battery as a backup for my Sony point and shoot camera. But this little guy just stopped working. Has just over one year. The original battery that I have still works. Will not buy again. Waste of money.  [END]
[BEGIN] Corners match size but sides are concaved and do not fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] To small in length in my opinion. Looks weird when you a wearing it. It s just really small and but pops out on your back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Don t buy this bag, the straps break easily and it s poorly-made.  [END]
[BEGIN] Selfie stick does not fit properly  [END]
[BEGIN] No útil  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera goes through batteries way too fast. It is difficult to change the settings and switch from photo to video, but very easy to accidentally delete your photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] I reserved the the battery pack and itself works fine but I reserved the baking for a go pro hero 3+ and it does not fit onto my gopro hero3 white housing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice looking however the batteries we are going through is ridiculous! We have bought rechargeable now yet we are recharging every two days?  [END]
[BEGIN] Too Loud. No Volume Control. Otherwise, works as expected. The lack of volume control makes these useless to me though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Stopped working after a couple of months  [END]
[BEGIN] It doesn t zoom in as much or clear enough.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did not work at all. Gave a two star because the return process was easy. The price seemed to good to be true and it was.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product IS GOOD, well made, but it does NOT FIT Manfrotto 501PL Quick Release Plates, unfortunately. I ll try the longer version with less threads on the tip,maybe they work.  [END]
[BEGIN] A little smaller than useful.  [END]
[BEGIN] the lenses doesn t fit, and im so disappointed because thats the only thing in the bandle that im so excited about, it say s for instax mini 8, but its small!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Looked good but I didn t like how the gopro mounted to the pole- I would prefer it to screw in  [END]
[BEGIN] This is one of the worst tripods ever it cant even hold my cameras weight and it contains really cheap materials do not recommend anyone to buy this unless you are in really desperate needs  [END]
[BEGIN] Almost everything about this is pretty great; the neck stays put, the clamp is super strong and adjustable... but none of that matters since the brittle plastic clip snapped into 3 pieces on the second use. avoid!  [END]
[BEGIN] The films were received some films packages were not working.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have mixed feelings about this product. Although easy to assemble, the bars are so lightweight that on my first use, it bended, almost loosing its shape. I don t recommended for outdoor use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good but too small for a regular size hand and is also not high enough from the camera when mounted on.  [END]
[BEGIN] Product works but batteries are have an awkward fit and seem like they have poor quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] the round silicon cover for the naked gopro lens leaves a smudge on the lens that must be wiped off before use after storage.  [END]
[BEGIN] batteries no good. cheap. won t charged.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s to confusing to use and it even says it s a video recording device. A waste of 100 dollars.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nah... Even as a toy this is too expensive for what it is. For one thing it only works at the highest zoom level because at the lower levels you would start seeing black corners creeping into the picture. At either zoom level the distortion is too noticeable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Picture quality is poor, no way to save or review video.. only a live feed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera was very grainy with my security system. Could have been my system but the 800 tvl from this company is clearer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometime it will not work  [END]
[BEGIN] Had some problems with it. I usually use my Nikon D-5100 but thought I wanted a smaller camera that I could carry easier. Guess I expected the photo quality to be the same as the digital SLR but was disappointed. However, Amazon let me return it without any hassle.  [END]
[BEGIN] So, ordered the standard housing 2.0, but unfortunately received the dive housing 2.0. Did not even realize this until I was already on the dive boat today. Will update product review once proper product is received.  [END]
[BEGIN] The remote doesn t work with my Canon Rebel t3i EOS 600D  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks good. That s where the goodness ends. Boom arm to pole connector does not really hold: loaded, the whole construct slips. Consider looking elsewhere. PS.: while not excluding a &#34;crooked hands&#34; factor, this particular design does not work for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this for my 12 year old niece as her first digital camera. This camera takes crappy pictures 😕. Not worth the purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Motor and gears break easily. Must order parts online. However, they are easy to replace. My son loves the copter.  [END]
[BEGIN] poor image quality  [END]
[BEGIN] It needs more compartments to put the accessories in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Panasonic FZ series is so much better. I had high hopes for Fujifilm but they do not compare to the clear and sharp images of Panasonic - even if you go back a few model years.  [END]
[BEGIN] Charger has bad ports, will kill batteries charged there. Was good for a little while (4-6 months?) but then it killed batteries. It took me a while to realize it was the charger, not the batteries failing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not happy at all! Drops control link sometimes less than 10 meters. I find it not reliable at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] To be completely honest, the item was flown one time and already needs replacement parts Not very happy with the robustness Of the product. Easily broken. Will be contacting the company for answers and replacement parts. It does fly ok. Very touchy controls.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item is broken. I guess I ll be using super glue since it s not worth the hassle of returning.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap, broken, this sums up what this tripod is all about. Doesn t matter where you get it you will find the same. Shame on you Targus.  [END]
[BEGIN] JUNK  [END]
[BEGIN] sound wasn t great item looked and felt very cheap and batteries cost.  [END]
[BEGIN] the charger is okay but the batteries don t work but a few months. would not buy again  [END]
[BEGIN] Too many issues with an off brand. Works great when it works but often finicky with the camera electronics. Sometimes just doesn t work  [END]
[BEGIN] Had purchased one a few months ago exact same one and the company would not take it back so we had to order this one ...It works great but we had to put the insides in it...it came with out the parts.  [END]
[BEGIN] THe zoom is not great, and I have had issues with pictures appearing pixculated. I am very aggravated with this camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery life doesn t seem to have alot of juice. The stock battery i received with my phantom 2 seems to last me longer! i dont think its what its advertised to be regarding longer battery life!  [END]
[BEGIN] Neither my wife or I found it comfortable and it made reaching the shutter release to cumbersome. We don t use it at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not made well, very cheap looking. Got what I paid for.  [END]
[BEGIN] The base is ok, but the little ball head is really flimsy/junky. I m using it to hold a small LED lite array, so I just superglued the ball in-place and am using the LED device s mount for movement.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think it s such a rip off that this item isn t included in the Vello light bouncer. It works well but, doesn t warrant the price. It should be included in the light bouncer.  [END]
[BEGIN] To easy to OPEN, slight knock and it flips up  [END]
[BEGIN] No battery cover useless as is  [END]
[BEGIN] I received a completely different camera than what is shown in the pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] I was hoping to be able to have some sort of focus option and be able to zoom. There aren t many times this camera will be very useful.  [END]
[BEGIN] Wasn t quite what I thought I ordered  [END]
[BEGIN] Thing works like it s designed but the lens cover (rounded piece) doesn t fit the lens hood so it s really stupid. I had another issue where the ring got stuck to my lens and had to get some tools to take it off.  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera looks *generally* as advertised. However, the &#34;30 LEDs&#34; is false advertisement. Inserting batteries causes a single red LED to light up, and even then it only blinks. In no way does it look like faux IR. I would not purchase this again.  [END]
[BEGIN] This does not fit the go pro 3 housing. The black frame alining is different from this LED housing. Simply put it doesn t fit  [END]
[BEGIN] Charged once I received them went to used them a month later they did not hold a charge  [END]
[BEGIN] There were no instructions included and we never could get it to focus correctly. Maybe it s just our incompetence, but it is sitting on a shelf. Thank you for your interest.  [END]
[BEGIN] Took about three weeks to get it... They re pretty thin packs.  [END]
[BEGIN] The one I purchased from an another store but it was a GoPro Suction Cup Mount non the less. The camera would shack and not allow for smooth filming.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was an excellent camera until it sat for a while. Now it will not charge from the battery. I called a shop and they said they can t get parts from Kodak and not to buy any more Kodaks. $500 camera down the drain!  [END]
[BEGIN] Small bag. Not enough to accessories.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very difficult to get to work right.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great at first and then it started making this weird beep sound now it doesnt work  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap plastic, never worked as intended. Can hold two batteries but only pulls from one at a time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I received the camera and the only way to charge it is thru the camera. Also 1 battery was bad out of the 3  [END]
[BEGIN] Was very easy to set up (especially for a new photographer) but the box was missing one of the backdrops and only had one umbrella and NO RETURNS by the time I got back in town to realize it was missing pieces from the package.  [END]
[BEGIN] A neat item but was defective screws were never installed properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was broken! so bad!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery life is terrible. Should have looked around for better camera. Price was ok, videos clear.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like many things somethings you can not buy cheap What I am looking for is about 300/500 dollar range.  [END]
[BEGIN] confusing instruction and battery not charging.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love the light from this. I can t use it because on the two location shoots I ve brought it out, half of the support ribs have broken.  [END]
[BEGIN] The lense bends the horizon on the peripherals, the software will not load on my iPad. The system seems to be incompatible with my 64bit windows app. There were no prohibitive warnings at the time of purchase. Kind of a rip off, Nothing works as expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Do not buy this camera as a deterrent, it is only meant to fill in spots that real cameras might miss. If this is the only camera, in about a week everyone will know it is fake.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pain to install and uninstall. Does not fit in case with guards on...  [END]
[BEGIN] Hi, it came in a bundle. Big, spacious, but the twinkle that makes when you walk is just too annoying.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too many parts not as easy to install as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] This was more of a pain to use than it was worth. The clips don t allow for for flexible positioning. We had to use our clamps instead. More for studio use than field use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not great but works  [END]
[BEGIN] I might have to return it Didn t come with manuel on how to use Fits my camera but when I take a picture it comes up errow try cleaning lenses  [END]
[BEGIN] Too complicated.  [END]
[BEGIN] Board snapped 1st day on set. Gaff tape kept it together mostly. Rain started to wash colors off the sticks  [END]
[BEGIN] To those who say it will not fit the SX520 - they are right. It does not even come close. It does appear to be a classy case, somewhat retro which I like. Too bad it does not fit the SX520.  [END]
[BEGIN] grainy video  [END]
[BEGIN] Very flimsy album and will not order it again  [END]
[BEGIN] The shipping was really fast but the product came damaged so I wasn t able to take it on my vacation as planned. Not sure if it happened during shipping or what  [END]
[BEGIN] The device refuses to recognize the internal hard drive. Cameras work, but the system will not record.  [END]
[BEGIN] One side where the flash is inserted just broke. Made of cheap material.  [END]
[BEGIN] The description item says &#34;Waterproof&#34; and I have used just one time in my pool and later, the screws show corrosion.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work for what I intended to use it for. Tried to mount my camera on my windshield but my camera would just be facing at awkward angles. Very strong suction though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sometimes when one gets stuck it ruins the whole case and you can no longer use the rest of the packaged polaroid  [END]
[BEGIN] Returned it after finding many of the screws on the clamps were stripped out. If you get a good one probably not bad for the price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked fine for 6 months, then started making corrupt files and ceasing recording at random intervals. Had to tell the cops that the hit and run I filmed was a corrupted file. No one was happy.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this to save a little money, and it broke the second day I had it.  [END]
[BEGIN] One of the connector that holds the strap to the bag broke within 6 months, the other one keep coming off from the bag. The bag is too deep to reach Not efficiently designed for its size Good thing that I got it free when I bought camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t work at night .... Not sure if I have something plugged in wrong.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very please with it  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small......got a bigger one  [END]
[BEGIN] Could see in lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] I found it in parrot story US by22.99$  [END]
[BEGIN] The on/off switch does not work with my Canon HF G-20 camera. Does the endless cycle (on/off) as has been reported on other cameras in review section. Zoom does work  [END]
[BEGIN] Very short range! Went back to my 5yr old bunker hill(works most of the time).  [END]
[BEGIN] This did not meet my expectation at all. I returned it to the vendor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bad battery. if leave charging all night will only fill half battery but if you leave charging for a couple hours will be 90% but don t last to long before die so I can t charge overnight and I can t trust when is full.  [END]
[BEGIN] Didn t work out for me  [END]
[BEGIN] The seams are very visible, and my white backdrop was torn.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t allow you to add battery grip, unable to close.  [END]
[BEGIN] small need extra to be studio  [END]
[BEGIN] The arm are not very flexible, hard to bend....  [END]
[BEGIN] the image quality of the camera was terrible so I returned it... not sure if my camera was defective or generally the 240p sucks! Setting up its wireless connection was so easy and using it whenever there is an outlet was practical.  [END]
[BEGIN] Came with chinese firmware and seller only directed me to Dahau. Dahau support is non existent. This camera is actually the lowest end Dahau..I would suggest the 2xxx or 4xxx models over this for a fe more $  [END]
[BEGIN] It s just a tripod inside a box. The tripod itself is fine, but don t market it as &#34;with a bag&#34; if you re not going to include it.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is mediocre at best. I recommend going to Walmart and buying a canon elph for less. I own a 7d and iPhone 5s. I prefer iPhone 5s over s110 pics.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked great until it died six months later.  [END]
[BEGIN] Constantly switches to channel 1 instead of staying on channel you set it on. Also, lots of interferences and loud ringing despite systems being place far apart (different floors).  [END]
[BEGIN] I may have bought the wrong case as this doesn t fit the stuff very well can t quite get a handle on where stuff is supposed to go. Next time will purchase larger case where I have options on cut outs. May work for you though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Much too small to comfortably hold my Canon 70D with a 50mm lens. It fits but you have to stretch like mad.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product is described as HD / 720p camera. The quality when viewing through the Web app or mobile app while the camera was connected via ethernet, is clearly not HD. We have 2 other cameras on the same network and also 720p which have a much higher quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] has issues ... tilt axis keeps drifting even with a perfectly balanced camera. I ve used the GH4 and Blackmagic cinema and same issue with both cameras. Calling DJI is a joke and gets you NOTHING done.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bulky, heavy, picture quality not impressive.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice camera. Software not user friendly. Spent hours trying to set camera up. Called tech support, they had problem had to download a fix. Reset camera, then could not log in ... return camera within a week.  [END]
[BEGIN] Doesn t hold a charge. Runs down quickly. I get 70 pictures on 50% of the charge. normally I can get 350 pictures on 60% usage  [END]
[BEGIN] its made ok. it absolutely does NOT work with my garmin virb elite even though they put it in the description! guess i got caught with the &#34;keyword&#34; type ad they use to get you on their page even though their product has nothing to do with your shopping needs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Macro lens is crap. I used wide angle lens only once and don t like to use anymore  [END]
[BEGIN] Cumbersome, not useful.  [END]
[BEGIN] The quality of picture is poor at best  [END]
[BEGIN] POOR DEPTH OF FIELD. PICTURES WERE NOT SHARP. OVERALL HAD BETTER PICS WITH LOWER PRICED CAMERS, ESPECIALLY NIKONS AND THE KINDLE FIRE HD.  [END]
[BEGIN] None of the pictures develop , I went to Michael s and bought more film to see if it was my camera ,but all the film from Micheal s worked. None of these developed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera but very slow in reporting, sometimes none at all  [END]
[BEGIN] Second-rate optics in a nice compact and light binocular. Lost it and bought a Pentax 9 X 28 for $180. Really nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought two. Neither worked with motion video. Single pictures worked fine. Continuous video worked fine.  [END]
[BEGIN] The batteries are great, but the grip doesn t seat correctly. I loose power to the camera and have to reconnect the grip to get it to work.  [END]
[BEGIN] I asked for the Kodak MD863 charging cord and adaptewr but was send one that did fit the charging plug on the camera. I hope we can resolved.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery Door does not fit properly. Adding tape to hold in place. Must snap door on and add tape each time battery is removed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Grainy video. Can t see the difference between this and my old standard definition camera. I regret buying it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked for the first day and then sensor wouldn t recognize motion. Not a good product.  [END]
[BEGIN] item simply did not work  [END]
[BEGIN] The charge doesn t last very long, almost the same as the original Sony battery that I ve had for a few years - which is why I purchased new batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Cheap quality. If you are looking to save money go ahead. This mount will fall over and it will not stay in place when you wrap the legs around things. The camera is too heavy for the top ball it will slowly move and fall back.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not fit well  [END]
[BEGIN] It wasn t what I needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] The clamp is great but the quick release tabs on the base of the neck both broke over the course of the first few uses. Now only the clamp is of any use. I wouldn t recommend this at current quality and durability levels.  [END]
[BEGIN] Units work, but video quality leaves a little to be desired.  [END]
[BEGIN] Couldn t get this to work with my Nikon D600.  [END]
[BEGIN] There batteries really aren t any good. Most times they only charge to 75-80% and they drain way to fast, even when they sit in the camera and it s turned off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great for 1 dslr camera but not if your needing to carry more then one dslr.  [END]
[BEGIN] It was a good flash, but it just stopped working about two months later and the company is completely unresponsive.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was really excited to get my Nikon bundle package today. But then when I took the bag off the carrying case for the camera it was dirty! Not sure if it was used? And if it was what other items in my bundle package were used then re-wrapped?  [END]
[BEGIN] Remote viewing is very slow compared to older models. It sucks but the set up is much easier.  [END]
[BEGIN] It takes forever to charge an NP970!  [END]
[BEGIN] Does not work for the whole range. after a certain point it starts showing an &#34;X&#34; in the picture because areas along the diagonals are darkened more than rest of the image.  [END]
[BEGIN] Returned this one as it is not what I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] The product was received in fine condition and was what I expected. The problem is that the movies and pictures on the TV are not in color. This was a surprise.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera did not meet my expectations. The quality of the photos in auto and friendly auto mode is not acceptable.  [END]
[BEGIN] I had to return for a poorly fitted/errant propeller on the drone. A new one should be sent  [END]
[BEGIN] does not fit well into the socket. Ruined the Connection of the original automatic lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the price, this is okay, but the tripod is pretty flimsy. I m no photography expert...and I won t be with equipment like this.  [END]
[BEGIN] While the tubes don t lock up on my lenses like others have noted, they are not rigid. Any change in pressure on the lens causes them to flex considerably.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too much vignetting from using it on the lens, useless. Works ok on the hotshoe, but kinda misses the point to use it like that.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not great, not bad. You get what you pay for.  [END]
[BEGIN] The Charger is different than the picture and have just one dock for battery, the car charger is different too and is just for this charger and is not possible charge a ipad and iPhone at the same time because doesn t exist usb port....  [END]
[BEGIN] Like everyone else, the base of the arm broke on me after only a couple of uses. NOT WORTH WHAT YOU PAY FOR IT!  [END]
[BEGIN] If you are a professional....stay away from this....I know...if professional should not be buying this in the first place...correct. If you were to purchase..install and never move or remove...could be alright...third time I removed...the whole entire right side tore from top to bottom...overpriced for what it is. bummer.  [END]
[BEGIN] Night time photographs do not show beyond 15  [END]
[BEGIN] Focus range is so small that it s impossible to use even on a tripod. Seems to be clear enough that it might be a good lens but the focus is just too shallow.  [END]
[BEGIN] I still haven t figured out how to set it up. No support.  [END]
[BEGIN] Basically an Eggtimer with cool graphics. No adjustable settings and the 1hr. limit and rotating speed made the timelapse seem rushed. the top also fell off. Not a great buy for $35  [END]
[BEGIN] It can only record for a maximum of 25 minutes. I bought it to record lectures but it s just sitting home now. The battery is not strong at all.  [END]
[BEGIN] Freezing to much on the app and i do have the faster business Internet at home. I restart the cameras 3 times already because it didn t work.  [END]
[BEGIN] Poor quality even at this price. The float mount broke right away. The selfie stick is ok, but can be purchased alone and not in this kit. For use with my action cam in the water, I opted for the neomark wrist mount and was very pleased with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Sucks.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was extremely disappointed with this product. This product isn t durable enough for children. This was purchased for my son. He dropped it and it broke.... He was heart broken. It was money basically thrown in the garbage Now I have a very disappointed child.  [END]
[BEGIN] low quality photos  [END]
[BEGIN] Can not adjust the sense with this bag. Pictures look a bit blury. not that happy, but it was cheap.  [END]
[BEGIN] Ended up keeping since the return shipping would make it a wash. NOTE: There are NOT 50 LEDs as claimed in the description- just one blinking red light. Meh  [END]
[BEGIN] Show a great pic..just had a line on one side, this was suppose to be a new item, but I think it was a use item, maybe or maybe not..but great pic on oneside.  [END]
[BEGIN] Pictures didn t turn out the way they were supposed to, and it only came with 8 pieces of film. Not worth almost $28 in my opinion.  [END]
[BEGIN] The quallity its very poor, i prefer at least 1080p of resolution. Another important thing is the angle camara, with gopro i had 170 degrees and with brinno only 14p0  [END]
[BEGIN] After one month of use it restart with no obvious reason at random time  [END]
[BEGIN] Much better options available. Not very solid  [END]
[BEGIN] Had to return it the first time because the battery was not charging (after waiting more than a month for the camera to be delivered). The second camera I received is ok, but my phone takes better pictures.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good action cam. But no sound on videos unless you play it back on a VLC player. They should really update the codec for this device. Very annoying to have to find all sorts of work around (ie downloading codec etc) do deal with the no sound issue.  [END]
[BEGIN] I do not recommend this brand. I bought it because they used it at work and while the quality looks okay it goes on and off all the time  [END]
[BEGIN] Very small and it broke within weeks.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seems too small.  [END]
[BEGIN] I don t understand Japanese/ no english directions to be read, nor pictorial instructions. I have returned the camera to Essex for credit card credit.  [END]
[BEGIN] It didn t fit my Samsung NX2000 like it said it should it was way too small. Also They didn t refund my whole amount of money they just refunded me $6 out of the $17 I paid. The case was very nice just wish it fit my camera. Bummed!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] I gave up as it was too hard to hook up with comcast  [END]
[BEGIN] battery contacts are intermittent -- I think I can fix it, but at first I thought it was DOA  [END]
[BEGIN] Was great..... And then it fell apart. I could tell it wasn t that sturdy and I m a little frustrated that it didn t last more than three gigs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Lens cover gets scratched very easily. Great price though.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not the greatest  [END]
[BEGIN] Cord is too short...  [END]
[BEGIN] Their firmware updating and process is crap. Software outdated.  [END]
[BEGIN] The products that I did receive work great, but the body mount and extension pole were not included.  [END]
[BEGIN] Its a nice case but is too small for the Sony RX100M4 even though it is advertised as being for that camera. The camera does not slip easily into the case. Two stars because of the poor fit.  [END]
[BEGIN] The screws on the light stands broke after the first use and the light bulbs were not as bright as I expected them to be. You get what you pay for I guess. I would ve returned it, but one of them fell over and the light bulb broke.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thinking about returning. Don`t like the way it looks when you look into them.  [END]
[BEGIN] This was just okay for a quick fix. But I think I should have bought something different.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too much for something that is an adventure to install ! If you simply MUST have this brand screen protector, then buy TWO. One for the first failure and the second for, hopefully, the successful install !  [END]
[BEGIN] flimsy design.  [END]
[BEGIN] Batteries don t last. 2 years later, they won t hold their charge at all. SONY batteries purchased before that have continued to hold 100%.  [END]
[BEGIN] it broke after I used it two times ):  [END]
[BEGIN] The threads were too long for my application (Garmin Virb mounts). Also, the diameter of the threaded portion is too large for Garmin Virb mounts.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very flimsy and poorly constructed. After using it just one time, pieces of it were already chipping off.  [END]
[BEGIN] it was ok but battery didnt last long and cant have it more then 40 feet away  [END]
[BEGIN] ND is divided right in the middle with no adjustment. Causes framing shots nearly in half.  [END]
[BEGIN] The stand start to get loose in the head after some use. It is not a durable or heavy duty stand.  [END]
[BEGIN] Battery doesn t stay charged  [END]
[BEGIN] The size of the shield is smaller than the size of the LCD screen  [END]
[BEGIN] Not for heavy cameras. Based on another review I thought it would be sturdy but it is not and you can tell as soon as you feel the box. The monopod part also did not extend as much as I thought it would. Probably okay for casual light use.  [END]
[BEGIN] No better than the 700TVL cameras that I had before and they were pretty bad especially for night vision  [END]
[BEGIN] Not great quality. When shifted, the filter darkness does not cover the entire lens so during long exposures, the lighting is exposed differently across the picture. I suggest buying something more expensive for better quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] The cameras are good and with the POE (power over ethernet) it makes running the wire much more simple. The downfall is the controller and HDD, it constantly needs reformat and will not overwrite the current recordings.  [END]
[BEGIN] Flimsy and overly complicated design (the amount of pieces that extend. There is really no suitable purpose for these. I wish i could return them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Kind of plastic-y. Not impressed.  [END]
[BEGIN] No matter the settings, I cannot seem to get a clear picture when inside. I bought this so I didn t need my large camera on me all the time. Disappointed.  [END]
[BEGIN] Too small to fit compact camera Cannon Power Shot SX710HS (it is a really small case)  [END]
[BEGIN] its ok  [END]
[BEGIN] It was free and I still wouldn t use it. I hope no one actually pays for this.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s bad quality and can t see for my cellphone or internet...  [END]
[BEGIN] I got electric shocks each time I touch  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits the copter, controller and charger great. No room for blades, tablet or other equipment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Low quality  [END]
[BEGIN] camera does not seem to be working as it should according to the instructions,kindly have someone from amazon give me a call and walk me through setting up camera and getting it to work properly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Disappointed in the quality. Thought it would be leather. No plastic protectors , had to purchase them my self. WAY overpriced!!!!!!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Useless. Unable to pan or tilt smoothly..  [END]
[BEGIN] Sounds quality was not as good as expected. Video quality wasnt very good either  [END]
[BEGIN] Tips over easy  [END]
[BEGIN] Color is very poor in Auto mode. I ll have to delve into the documentation to see if there is a fix.  [END]
[BEGIN] Both batteries no longer work and I have only had them almost 5 months. I had pictures scheduled and had to cancel because I charged both batteries and neither worked..  [END]
