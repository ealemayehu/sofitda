[BEGIN] This is my 4th Breakthrough filter. The quality of the build & the glass is Excellent, which was expected based the the UV & ND filter I purchased in the past. The threads & edge of the filter make it easy to attach/remove from my lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] My main purpose in buying the kit was to get the filters included so it s hard to complain. The lens is great but the lens pouch is entirely too narrow to put any lens for an DSLR into. I m using for the camera cleaning kit!  [END]

[BEGIN] Great addition to my home theater.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just a little tight getting in & out.  [END]

[BEGIN] Better than described! Awesome tripod for a great price!  [END]

[BEGIN] So far it works like a charm. It does what I need it to do and more. Its only been a few days and I would recommend this product.  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect for the Price. Protects Device Well.  [END]

[BEGIN] Such a great lens to use for sporting events and long distance shots.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nicely designed, simple to use. Definitely made with cheap materials but for the cost it does a great job. I m surprised my heavy phone did not tip it over, even with the legs extended all the way. Would recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a super camera. I love it. Easy to set up and easy to run. Had problems connecting to my Windows 10 computer. The technician Henry was a genius in helping me connect. Very good process.  [END]
[BEGIN] This assessor you was suggested to me by my photography teacher. I don t know how anyone can use a digital camera out in the sun without this device. It allows me to clearly see the pucture even on the brightest of days. A must have for any photographer!  [END]

[BEGIN] Works perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked great with more than enough lighting. I ordered 2 and received 4. I guess that was my mistake, so now if I return the extra order they will charge me shipping. I guess I will just keep in my storage. Or if one breaks..  [END]
[BEGIN] At first I thought it wouldn t work because there were two prongs on the charger and three contacts on the batteries. However, I put in a battery, the light turned red, and it turned blue when it was charged. Then the battery worked fine in my camera.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great  [END]

[BEGIN] The brush quality and the size of the blower was bigger than I expected it to be. I ordered the version with the Altura lens cleaner included. I used it on a really filthy telescope eyepiece (with multi-coatings) to no obvious ill effect, so that s good.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great value for a great product. I bought this as a gift for my wife and was pleasantly surprised by the performance, especially for the price.  [END]

[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little portable light source. It s very bright and compact so it takes little room in my camera bag. can be used as a fill-in source for close up photo s as well. Well morth the money, a good value.  [END]
[BEGIN] This tripod is fantastic! Heavy duty quality construction, versatile adjustments, works perfect with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Looked at many tripods and none come close to this for the price. Home run Amazon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Easy to use, instant gratification and lots of fun for teens who want more than posting pics.  [END]

[BEGIN] A+ thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] This really works well. My wife uses it with the GoPro when scuba diving and it s great. Has never flooded on dozens of dives so feel free to keep whatever you need in the handle and it will stay dry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice product, daughter loves it for her new GoPro.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great Camera.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great mounting kit, with this kit you can really mount the remote anywhere. I have it mounted on my goPole to use as a selfie stick for my girls.  [END]
[BEGIN] Does exactly what it s supposed to do - securely holds my flash onto my light stand. The clamp for holding an umbrella is a little tight at first, but that gives me piece of mind that it s secure.  [END]
[BEGIN] The perfect addition to the RX-100 series of cameras. It gives you a nice gripping point that allows for a much firmer grip on the camera...  [END]
[BEGIN] This was a great purchase with the GoPro camera!  [END]
[BEGIN] perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] This is renamed Looxcie LX2 which I have with 480p at 4:3 aspect ratio, good enough for the price I bought for $40.00. Red LED lit if recording, if you try filming ongoing police activity better cover that red LED with black cut out electrical tape before doing so, lol.  [END]

[BEGIN] great  [END]
[BEGIN] all ok  [END]

[BEGIN] great tripod. The legs each have 3 adjustable sections. Feels light but solid as well. I debated between this one and a few options in the $20-30 range. I am glad I decided to spend the extra money for a brand name and still reasonably priced.  [END]

[BEGIN] These work great- I have several lenses and these cleaned them all right up. I mostly use canon ef lenses but they work great for pentax as well as my Nikon lenses. Definitely a but I d recommend to photographers who like to keep their lenses clean on the go.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great deal. Good little kit for the price. Really happy with my purchase  [END]
[BEGIN] The floaty backdoor works great. I have a couple of them. The adhesive is very strong. This is cheap insurance. If your camera slips from your hand its great to see it floating up, rather than sinking to the bottom. Believe me I know.  [END]
[BEGIN] extra batteries are a must with go pros  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera is perfect for me and it has helped me with my golf swing. J-Made ensured that I got it quickly and I appreciated their excellent customer service in doing so.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just as good, if not better than the hood that came with the lens.  [END]

[BEGIN] Solid product. Great price and it works well. The floaty device was even able to keep my GoPro (Hero version 1) plus the pole afloat in salt water. Haven t tested in fresh water yet.  [END]

[BEGIN] product as advertised, very good  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great. Just what I was looking for. Great product  [END]

[BEGIN] Fast delivery. Product as stated in the description,good quality at very good price  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank you  [END]

[BEGIN] It was just as described and fit my camera battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good product. Works as advertised. Would be great to see support for home automation systems such as Amazon Echo, Hubs like Revolv and maybe Apple s HomeKit. The notification part is necessary, but can be annoying. All in all - fantastic product.  [END]
[BEGIN] These are well made accessories. If you have a polaroid cube you will need the tripod mount and a 1/4 20 camera mount adapter for some of the attachments.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s working excellently and I can recharge it at anytime rather than wait for it to get low..  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfectly, just what I needed  [END]

[BEGIN] LOVE IT  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly what I wanted. A similar cable would not let me download my photos directly from my camera. This one works.  [END]
[BEGIN] Walter with their tech support group helped me find an IP conflict on my router because I (evidently) didn t reserve the camera IPs in my router and my printer took over the IP address.  [END]
[BEGIN] Much better than the standard battery.  [END]
[BEGIN] 100% necessary if you have a GoPro. Nothing is worse than getting to your destination and finding that the battery you had in the camera has died. Great replacement for OEM GoPro batteries.  [END]

[BEGIN] Windows 7 professional 64 bit, right clicked the install file &#62;properties &#62;compatibility &#62;check run in windows 98 compatibility mode.

[BEGIN] Great for the price  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product. For once, I have more pockets than stuff!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a very nice lens cap for the price. The fit is better than with the oem in my personal opinion. Shipping time to the U.S. is not the best with any of the current sellers, however.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic. Did not expect this to be so good. But there is always a flaw to a product and it is the microphone when on a the bike mount.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good camera. Reacts quickly and smoothly through wifi. Clear image. 2 way audio if very good  [END]

[BEGIN] It was a quick, easy setup. It worked great the first time and seems fairly durable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic. I shot a movie and tossed this critter in my bag and used it as an eye light and as a computer light. Dang thing runs forever! (or so it seems)  [END]

[BEGIN] Use these all the time  [END]
[BEGIN] awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] great lens clothes, just the right size  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a genuine Canon battery and works perfectly in my Canon T6s camera. I think you should always have a charged spare battery on hand when on a photographic trip to avoid the sad event of a power failure.  [END]
[BEGIN] I really like the effects of this lens. At 10 stops, my dSLR can literally see nothing through the viewfinder. Please pardon the Spinal Tap reference. I could not help myself.  [END]
[BEGIN] you push it to turn it on and off! very convenient  [END]
[BEGIN] It is so hard to find a strap for my semi-compact Canon camera, and this is the best you can get imo. I really love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product.... Technology is super.... Ease of use is outstanding... It s a ready to go unit in a box... Compare it to a High End Security service... Security service would cost a minimum of 2k... Believe me, I priced them!!!!  [END]

[BEGIN] Love it..Great Product...Thanks  [END]

[BEGIN] A high quality product with a great warranty. You won t be disappointed!  [END]
[BEGIN] It was just what I wanted.  [END]
[BEGIN] great product  [END]
[BEGIN] I need batteries to last for over 8 hours, and these batteries go strong days after. They re perfect for a camera flash where I need a quick refresh rate to fire off a flash as needed. Paired with the Powerex charger, these are a must have.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great customer service and product is made out of superior materials.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works exactly like the original  [END]
[BEGIN] Just like the originals, now the kayak has what it needs.  [END]

[BEGIN] Nikon quality as expected.  [END]

[BEGIN] i love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little accessory for my iPad. Great close up photos.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works very well!!!! A++++++!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Kids can break just about anything. However this helicopter is easier to navigate than others. Its durable and can take some pretty bad falls or crashes. In the situation that my kid does break it. Its super cheap to be replaced.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is the perfect match to the LX 100 – it s fit and finish match and it even fits in the leather case.  [END]
[BEGIN] i love it...as expected  [END]

[BEGIN] GREAT CASE  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT PRODUCT. RECOMENDT IT.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is everything I have been looking for. Great for telescope. It makes my cell phone a mini TV  [END]
[BEGIN] It appears to be a well made filter, Works awesome with clarity..I recommend it...  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome! Just like OEM batteries, if not better. You just can t beat the price!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly as I expected.[[ASIN:B00NIYJKL0 GoPro HERO4 Dual Battery Charger + Battery for HERO4]]  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent alternative to cable tethering... Have to get used to the lag time when shooting Raw but a necessity for location shooting and really sets you free in the studio. Great advantage shooting to an iPad for client involvement and approval. If you shoot tethered... It s a must have.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great to have for surveying and inspections, bought several to have when needed.  [END]
[BEGIN] popped right on, works great!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works Great  [END]
[BEGIN] good clean product. I wasn t sure what to expect but after receiving the package and using the cloth on my glasses, I glad I purchased them. I gave one to my wife, I have one in my vehicle and in my backpack. I expect to purchase another order soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Used this accessories kit to go cliff jumping and atv riding. Never have problems  [END]
[BEGIN] really good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] the night view is very good, I can see my Sofa so clearly, also my door  [END]
[BEGIN] Fun, fun, fun! If you love bokeh and want to experiment, this lens is for you! Play and have fun and expand your creativity.  [END]
[BEGIN] Inexpensive, reasonably well constructed, works brilliantly (also very light weight). Given the battery life in an A6000, two are a requirement, and being able to charge both simultaneously saves getting up in the middle of the night to swap batteries into the charger.  [END]
[BEGIN] So awesome to have another battery ready to go. These are working great. Recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] Git it on time. Everything as written came.Learning to use, but like it so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was really happy with this purchase and made a review regarding the quality of all the accessories. The only accessory that I think is not so great is the monopod/selfie stick. Here is the link to my review on this purchase. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzvifJOyfac  [END]
[BEGIN] This is just the right combination of super optics, travel size and affordable price. There was no perceptible difference between these and Leica in terms of clarity and ease of use. It is super easy to adjust thr focus by turning just one knob.  [END]
[BEGIN] see pics. that s a dell e7440 and Sony a55 w/ 16-105 zoom lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] This harness was great. It was easily adjustable and fit both my 18 pound Beagle and my 23 pound mutt perfectly!  [END]
[BEGIN] It s the most useful thing I have purchased in a while.  [END]
[BEGIN] so great to use them  [END]
[BEGIN] I`m using all these pieces and there is a great difference no using them. Filters are very useful for specific pictures, anyway you have to be patience for selecting the right moment with the right place with the right filter. Good lenses for taking pictures of insects.  [END]
[BEGIN] Was better than expected, solid, and compact enough to transport.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fantastic and it s exactly what I expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely worth it... Grabbed one of these to keep an eye on our dogs! Took less than 2 min to set up! I will be adding a few more of these once our house gets built. Great for security as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Looks just like picture. It is perfect for any size cell phones.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this for my Husband for his birthday And he had yet to put it down..he takes it everywhere  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent design. Can carry a lot of gear for the size. A bit over priced.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Item! Would buy again. Did not disappoint.  [END]
[BEGIN] Surprisingly simple and reliable  [END]
[BEGIN] GREAT LENS.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. Great price  [END]
[BEGIN] Love the magnetic feet!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as it should (tested as soon as I got it) and the bonus adapter was great when we went to Paris. Unfortunately, I forgot the charger, and the extra battery (original), plus I left the adapter when we checked out of the hotel. :-/  [END]
[BEGIN] I love it  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfectly - much more convenient than the standard cover. And - the camera is not even longer (maybe by half of a milimeter)  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product. Larger than I expected but perfect for cleaning for cleaning the screen of my phone and tablet.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very bright and clear for day time, easy to use. Pretty powerful even for long distance but don t expect too much. Very good for general use, looking at bugs, butterflies, passing by ships etc. Would be great if the pouch has some extra room.  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick shipping. Product works fine. We are powering 3 cameras with it at this time and plan to add more soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m just a casual picture taker and 99% of the time use the automatic mode. The pics are fantastic. Great clarity, huge rage when zooming, and easy to carry.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good tripod but no for heavy cameras  [END]
[BEGIN] Needed another shoe on our Canon C100 cameras for second wireless mics. The 1/4-20 hole at the back of the handle is the perfect spot and this shoe fits the bill. I bought 4, one for each camera. Why did we suffer so long without these?  [END]
[BEGIN] Based on past experience, this sort of battery charger may be more apt to fail with heavy use; however this charger works well and, hopefully, will last a long time.  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought two extras of these to glue together for lens organization in my bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item came in on time, in tact. Very happy with the product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Better than expected. Easy to install and operate. Great system for price  [END]
[BEGIN] Sturdy and heavy duty. I can pretty much angle my camera in an direction. This product is very well made!  [END]
[BEGIN] Exactly as described. Quality is excellent.  [END]
[BEGIN] It s great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great solid antenna with very good signal expansion compared to stock  [END]
[BEGIN] The cap fit very well. I have an old 35mm camera and lost the body cap. I can now shoot film and take my camera out and about  [END]

[BEGIN] Ghhg  [END]

[BEGIN] Love it! It worked perfectly. One thing to be aware of, it completely overrides your camera s controls when plugged in to a remote trigger (i.e. pocket wizard), so you must unplug it to adjust exposure, focus, etc., then plug it back in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice point and shoot camera! Love how small it is so it can fit in my clutch!  [END]

[BEGIN] Absolutely exceeded my expectations with syncing to my phone and emailing pictures directly from camera and the front LCD for easy selfies, no selfie stick needed!  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything arrived on time, great experience.  [END]

[BEGIN] This is one easy camera to use. It takes the nicest photos. It is a great camera. The shipping was spot on as well. It is very thin and fits into most pockets with ease. The only thing I would suggest is to add a screen shade on the back.  [END]

[BEGIN] great bag for a great price.  [END]

[BEGIN] Looked great for my Holiday photos! Good quality too. Wish it was larger size.  [END]
[BEGIN] For the Price there is nothing better  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as expected. I have no trouble with the fit of the plug/socket on the D610 that some report. A must have for long exposure shots. Landscape type shots with these high res cameras also benefit using a cable/remote shutter release  [END]
[BEGIN] Affordable lens for great bokeh!  [END]
[BEGIN] It is exactly as described. I would deal with this supplier again  [END]
[BEGIN] i love it  [END]

[BEGIN] wonderful and strong and reliable  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice kit, great price!!  [END]

[BEGIN] This camera, thus far is superior to the DLink product which costs more. They could use a bit of work on the directions but once I got what they were asking it was a snap.  [END]
[BEGIN] simple, easy, fun, and great for scrapbooking, or as party favors!  [END]
[BEGIN] having the extra power on hand is crucial when you re out and about. Threw these into my backpack and went all over Mexico with plenty of space on my memory card and plenty of juice in the form of batteries.  [END]

[BEGIN] works great everything i expected  [END]

[BEGIN] Love how spacious is! Everything is well cushioned, which protects the equipment.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fine !  [END]
[BEGIN] Started with the Foscam... Returned that for this vastly superior product.  [END]

[BEGIN] Exactly what I needed. And got it quick  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing  [END]
[BEGIN] This is so adorable! I bought this to go with the Fugufilm Instax Mini 8 Instant Camera. I think this is a must have to go with the camera! Love everything in the box!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits perfectly, works, one third the price of the way-overpriced Canon version. What more is there to say? Those who say it doesn t fit must be putting it on the wrong lens, this is for the 18-55 STM version.  [END]
[BEGIN] worked well. Great deal. Timely shipping. Thanks.  [END]
[BEGIN] The video quality is great and it switches to night vision gracefully. Sound quality is not so great. Even with speakers hooked up to either laptop/computer, its very hard to hear noise. The reason this is so important to me is because I use it as a baby monitor.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] This is perfect for my Lumix GX7 camera and it fits it perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Get s the job done  [END]
[BEGIN] Fantastic lens! Clarity and quality of shots is amazing  [END]

[BEGIN] Works as well as any other filter set and price is reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect for me photo needs  [END]
[BEGIN] This slider is the perfect length! Not so long for transporting. Not that heavy either but the build quality is great! Very smooth operation. Bought the Manfrotto MVH500h Fluid head with it, works great!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product  [END]
[BEGIN] Best mount for the Mobius action cam.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a cheap version of a tulip lens hood, but it did the trick as well as the overpriced ones. I d purchase it again in a heartbeat.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great, as expected  [END]
[BEGIN] Used this with a gopro on a recent dive trip. Six dives in total and it worked well every time. It made for some great underwater shots and selfies with the rest of the dive crew. Solid construction, lightweight and easy to adjust.  [END]
[BEGIN] Practical bag for my Sony NX-5N and lenses  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent graduated ND filter  [END]
[BEGIN] must have great backdrop indeed  [END]
[BEGIN] Really enjoying the mount thus far. Very sturdy and secure.  [END]

[BEGIN] Love this camera. The instant gratification of your pictures being printed instantly is fantastic  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits my new Lumix perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] I think that s what the Doctor order.  [END]
[BEGIN] ok  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] A must have for photographers. You can fix horizon lines in photoshop, but why have to with this.  [END]
[BEGIN] William Tom was wonderful helping me in getting the camera up and running. Got on my computer and in 2 minutes I was up and running, great tech support! This Camera is fantastic so far..  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome device!  [END]
[BEGIN] As advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Item works well  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera works just fine. Gives acceptable video.  [END]
[BEGIN] It even fools me. I catch myself going into the room to turn off the TV before I leave, only to realize it s just the fake TV doing it s thing.  [END]
[BEGIN] A great camera kit for an even better price! Easy to use a pretty straight forward DSLR  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product at a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes great photos. However, the camera is either too small for my hands and fingers or my hands and fingers are too big for this camera. Since Amazon won t give me a bigger camera I asked God to give me smaller hands and fingers.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very nice item!!!!!! I got it earlier than I expected, great shipping !!!!!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product!  [END]
[BEGIN] love the new camera strap! I get lots of complements on the new look! Love the colors and the sizing.  [END]

[BEGIN] Excellent déclencheur mutifonction je le recommande  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome product. I like it much better than the screw on and safety clip version.  [END]
[BEGIN] I m not a professional photographer so I don t see the stuff they see in photos. All I know is this filter works for me & my nx2000 with no &#34;X&#34; in the picture like people claim to have.  [END]
[BEGIN] Incredibly well made, fits perfect. Firmly holds both the camera and lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Helps my device stay a float in water. Color is visible from far away.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it  [END]
[BEGIN] it does what it says it was going to do  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked great on my recent vacation. It is a bit heavy to carry on the camera around my neck but I just supported it in one hand while walking and it was fine. Wish I would have bought this one years ago!  [END]

[BEGIN] These work perfectly, small and cheap enough for one in every camera bag. Batteries are easy yo find and last a very long time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this little thing, but make sure the gopro is showing or else it might look like somthing a bit weird. Works Perfectly and is fun to use!  [END]
[BEGIN] I ve used this product over the last year while skiing in Colorado, underwater in Mexico and everywhere in between. Works like a charm, never had a problem with use or durability.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great strap!! Got this for my dad as a gift and it works amazingly!  [END]
[BEGIN] Quick delivery, item just as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] Not sure of the battery s charge life yet, but so far the battery works great in my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. The ball joint is my favorite feature. Love the construction, feels well built but super light-weight. Quickmount is a bit tough to get on and off.  [END]
[BEGIN] Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Working like a champ!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works Like the Nikon Battery. Camera Shows the Information about the state of the battery. So Far NO Problems.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great Product for the Price. I ordered a backup since the price was reasonable.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great little camera for snorkeling. Has a nice secure lock on the battery cover and takes great underwater photos at shallow depths.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works just as well or better than the original Canon battery. Using in Canon G3 X camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Brilliant. Just with turning on the two modules are connected within seconds. It works perfectly and the scope (complies with what the manufacturer says) is more than enough for the task for which I need it. Always carry spare batteries just in case.  [END]
[BEGIN] It arrive quickly and was exactly as described in listing.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s alright  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved it. Exactly what I needed. Thanks  [END]
[BEGIN] Brilliant quality, used underwater and it floated perfectly, even with the weight of the GoPro. Loved the design, would definitely recommend.  [END]
[BEGIN] as expected, but it has 9 leg clamps to go full extension.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product, easy to install  [END]
[BEGIN] These portfolios are ideal for things you care about. I ve been pleased with everyone that I have purchased. They will hold a lot of material in a minimum of space.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good quality photos!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal for this!, shipping fast and product works awesome now I have 3 batteries all the time ready to go in my Go Pro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it works really good  [END]
[BEGIN] Try this. Wrap the clip with masking tape or some soft tape. Mount the GoPro camera on and bite the mount. Film from mouth level and use the remote to take pics. Helpful?  [END]
[BEGIN] Great service, I got exactly what I asked for.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price for this timer. I used with my Canon 7D to create a time lapse video of a remodeling project in my home. It s easy to use, has an on-off switch, and uses standard batteries. I highly recommend it and would buy it again.  [END]
[BEGIN] The best!  [END]
[BEGIN] I have 2 of these units they are great for the money im also thinking of getting another one for my winter home in florida.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very pleased with product and service  [END]
[BEGIN] Works (and looks) just like the Nikon original HB-69 lens hood for a fraction of the price. People that have issues mounting the hood (too loose....?!?!?) need to turn it just a tad further until it clicks securely into place. No complaints at this price!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Arrived quickly works fine  [END]
[BEGIN] My purchase was for a replacement, lost the charger. This charger and the batteries are excellent. The service time was short, I am happy. Thank you  [END]

[BEGIN] Work great so far. I love not having to worry about the lens cap.  [END]

[BEGIN] great  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great with my Hero Three! Holds a charge longer than the original battery and charge time is pretty quick. Great deal for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] Good quality. Seems solid. I like the ability to unsnap and resnap it from the camera quickly rather than having to fully remove the tether. It floats a Olympus Tough TG-4.  [END]
[BEGIN] good quality  [END]
[BEGIN] as advertised... delivered on time... no disappointing surprises... will consider the company s products first if they offer what I need... THANKS, J  [END]
[BEGIN] This worked perfectly for my camera and I got it really fast!! I was hesitant to buy this one because it was so much cheaper than the others, but I got it anyway and it works perfectly!! Very happy with my purchase!  [END]

[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] Batteries hold charge and i can use the battery charger in my car..love it  [END]
[BEGIN] Love my camera back pack and how it can hold soo much. I now have a larger laptop but still pack this bag for long trips so I will still have it.  [END]

[BEGIN] just what i wanted; good visibility and not too heavy to use without stand;  [END]
[BEGIN] I took this camera to London, Paris, Istanbul, and Doha. It performed wonderfully. It does all of the basics well, and has some nice added features (like a pop up flash.) This is the best camera I ve ever owned in this price range.  [END]
[BEGIN] does the job!  [END]
[BEGIN] The camera lens case worked out and fit perfectly. Quality looked good and put together well. The purple band and purple fur interior helps to differentiate between cases. Very satisfied  [END]
[BEGIN] I have had this camera for a few years and used it extensively in cold weather shots in Alaska. I like the viewfinder for people pictures or taking shots in too much direct sunlight. The movies are pretty amazing for something you can tuck in the shirt pocket.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it! Got one for my husband and my mother. Like the calendar feature that still plays the slide show in the smaller frame. Would definitely recommend - and size is just right for desk - anything bigger would take up too much space.  [END]

This is the same controller as the factory controller that was shipped with my first DJI Phantom 2 Vision Plus, however this controller also has the rechargeable battery. For the price, it was well worth the added features.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great for macro. Used it to take closeup shots of eyes.  [END]

[BEGIN] A true 360ws strobe for this price is really a great deal. I tested it and got F22 at 10 , 100ISO...that s a GN of 220 measured in feet.... !!!! I have used it a few times and so far it s held up very well.  [END]
[BEGIN] This kit is really great!! It makes my pics much focused and wider. The fisheye lens is awesome for panoramic photos.  [END]

[BEGIN] Great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] I purchased these to use while snorkeling & kayaking. They fit perfectly on disposable waterproof cameras, were comfortable on my wrists and kept the camera afloat when it bounced out of the kayak.  [END]

[BEGIN] as advertised, no issues with quality or performance  [END]

[BEGIN] Great filter for the price!  [END]
[BEGIN] For the money it can t be beat, purchased as a spare to my Canon 430 speedlite, limited in someways but a great backup and came in quick, just before my vacation.  [END]

[BEGIN] Really love this bag. The sections in it are so helpful!  [END]
[BEGIN] Got this for a customer who misplaced their older-style / 1st generation USB cable to download photos from camera. Works as advertised.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great series of reflectors. I love the shear scrim. Caveat: Almost impossible to fold up. Really!  [END]
[BEGIN] Small form factor but great performance. Always missed out on a flash for fuji for covering small functions.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great lights for close up filming and they work really well in low light outdoor areas. However you must make sure your camcorder matches with this brand of lights because it comes with a shoe mount you need to screw into specific sony model cameras.  [END]
[BEGIN] I use my camera every weekend and did not notice that this shield was even on. Easy application and does not distort the screen.  [END]
[BEGIN] had to write a review.... camera is fantastic! really easy to set up... great job  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] This was everything I expected and more. Absolutely love it..  [END]
[BEGIN] Good camera and even though it was refurbished it is in great condition.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is better than my friend s GoPro! After I showed him my camera, he got one as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] lots of room fits canon t3 , 75-250, 35-55 lens, extra batteries, cone, point and shot, flash, lots more room  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well  [END]
[BEGIN] Speedy delivery is always a plus and can I use the same UV filter on the zoom (300mm), part of my camera also? I am very happy with this one, easy for this lady who loves taking her action pix. Thank you  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this!  [END]
[BEGIN] Unfortunately there was something wrong with the camcorder upon arrival. We got in touch with Vivitar and they replaced it with a newer model. Great customer support!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great stuff.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best $$ I ever spent. This is really a good product. I was in Bermuda recently and I was able to take a lot of beautiful pictures under the sea!! I love it. I used it for my Canon Powershot S95.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this lens and is on my camera most of the time. I particularly like the constant bigger f number in this lens.  [END]

[BEGIN] Thanks everything was good!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] We are very pleased and may buy another of the same.  [END]
[BEGIN] it s very nice  [END]
[BEGIN] An amazingly versatile lens. Easy to use in just about any situation. I ve only just scratched the surface of its capabilities and not come close to its limits. Except when I m going super-wide (and then I love my 10-24), this sits on the camera (70D)  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits perfect, light and strong material.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera fits great in it and with the padding it stays safe!  [END]

[BEGIN] Very sharp, very good quality. Great build quality. I would say much better than the Canon alternative.  [END]
[BEGIN] Make sure to get the extra batteries as just having one in there is a waste. It adds bulk but feels good in the hand when flipping for a portrait shot. Its worth paying a little bit more for the official Canon grip instead of the other branded ones.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great! no issues with battery life after 3 weeks  [END]
[BEGIN] Just love the product, worked out great. A+++  [END]

[BEGIN] I love bringing this camera when I go to Disney! The pictures come out so good! I recommend taking outdoor shots when the sky is clear for a more &#34;enhanced&#34; shot.  [END]
[BEGIN] The sling shoulder neck strap makes it much easier to pull the camera into position. It realigns the pressure points away from the neck spine and reduces pressure on the muscles of the neck. This is especially helpful for photographers with arthritic spinal changes associated with aging.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great device. Easy to install and even easier to use. Just set it and forget it. Very good quality pics.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this camera!!! Exactly what I wanted! The night vision is so clear and I love being able to move the camera by touching the screen of the device I m using.  [END]

[BEGIN] Very light and powerful. Worked well in Alaska  [END]
[BEGIN] Very good video!  [END]

[BEGIN] Great camera and user friendly....takes great pictures  [END]
[BEGIN] perfect gift for birthday give along with new insant camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal for me-use for astronomy and birding. Field of view is a little narrow but that s to be expected compared to the Fuji 10x50 s and Pentax 7x50 s I use also. Good colors and it s made in Japan too.  [END]
[BEGIN] Camera works great, arrived on time and as advertised, the lens on this camera is so much better than my last digital camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome product,quick delivery, and great support  [END]

[BEGIN] everything was ok. Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0ay8zAY_Jw This is how we used it and it worked great for us I love everything about it and it is so durable and easy to work with.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is exceptional. It is very similar to my GoPro, for a fraction of the price. I would highly recommend this cost effective alternative, especially if you are investing in a GoPro like device for the first time.  [END]
[BEGIN] Excelente cámara ..delivery rapido  [END]
[BEGIN] Very comfortable for extended use. Quality is very good.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like the handle best, because it does float. The handle allows you to properly aim and shoot shots in all conditions.  [END]

[BEGIN] I couldn t be happier with this telescope. it is my first ever telescope, and i have had many amazing nights on my back porch with this thing.  [END]
[BEGIN] 👍  [END]
[BEGIN] Lowepro makes the best lens cases around. I have this case in several different sizes. Not only do they protect the lens like no other, but they also look and feel great too.  [END]
[BEGIN] This little stand does the trick. I have used it several time to give presentations to the Rotary Club.  [END]
[BEGIN] Really bright light and goes right on my tripod with ease  [END]
[BEGIN] I ordered this lens hood for use with my macro lens. Works great. Be sure to check the thread size of the lens you would like to use it with before ordering. I ordered the 49 mm thread size and it fits my lens perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfectly, just what I needed  [END]
[BEGIN] Works fantastic. Couldn t find locally and wanted it for vacation! Solution? Order thru Amazon and it ll be there when you get there!! &#60;3. #dottiedixon  [END]

[BEGIN] Sturdy doors with secure latch. Just right for making access to space under RV dinette seats. The only improvement I suggest is to include a template with it for cutting the hole.  [END]
[BEGIN] I just got a Canon G3-X with external EVF, and I needed a case that would fit it. This one works perfectly, plus there is room in the front packet for the charger and other accessories. Great case!  [END]
[BEGIN] Magic fiber is amazing at cleaning glass. I keep some in my car, my husbands car, my camera bag, my desk office. It s so handy  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product. I lost my original Sony charger along with the original battery. This is quite an excellent replacement. Feels like it charges much quicker than the original charger. The cigarette lighter charger comes in really handy. Overall, very satisfied.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great value for a set of four. My SIL loves her little polaroid and this film is really cute. I would buy this for her again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing fit  [END]
[BEGIN] Hoy glass is top notch. If you re a pro, and you re using high quality lenses, don t put a plastic filter over them and soften up your image. Just bite the bullet, spend the extra money, and get a filter you can be proud of.  [END]

[BEGIN] Makes charging quick and easy.  [END]

[BEGIN] Arrived on time and everything was in great condition. The lens and flash just didn t work for me.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just an FYI: I checked each item in the package to see what each would cost separately. I only searched on Amazon. The total came to $1297 - without the bag; the description here is too vague to match it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice  [END]
[BEGIN] really GOOD DVR FOR THIS MONEY  [END]
[BEGIN] Love love love this!!! Nice price, great product, easy to use.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great deal..look very professional.  [END]

[BEGIN] Love love love!!!  [END]
[BEGIN] B  [END]

[BEGIN] Operates as described and expected. Excellent zoom.  [END]
[BEGIN] Seller was very good to work with. I was very pleased with my purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Did what I bought it for  [END]

[BEGIN] They worked great and even lasted longer then the go pro battery!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what I needed and a great price  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought this to use with my Nikon D5500 DSLR. Works perfect!  [END]
[BEGIN] Well made, comfortable on the wrist. Detachable clip makes this even handier. Love the design too. I ve also been using Optech s larger model wrist strap on my Mirrorless Fuji X-T1 on three trips, and their products are very well made and the most comfortable straps around.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well made and works perfectly.  [END]

[BEGIN] VERY GOOD  [END]
[BEGIN] Item delivered on time, was as described and a very nice product, packed good would rate A+ all the way !  [END]

[BEGIN] Reasonably priced, items as described, arrived when promised. Seller recommended.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is just awesome! I will definitely recommend it! Very satisfied :-)  [END]
[BEGIN] Used this mount to record a few videos while I was driving and it did a really good job. It s solid and worked great on the dashboard and the windshield. If you re looking to make mobile videos, don t look past this mount.  [END]
[BEGIN] My mother in law requested this for her birthday to store her new Nikon camera and all of its accouterments. It holds everything and is a reasonable size. Plus, the backpack style is much easier to tote around than the shoulder strap version of old.  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything works well. There are a few places some of the plastic fittings aren t perfectly smooth, but you re paying $25 for a ton of parts.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] I am loving this camera!! I got this to upgrade from my T2i and I am very impressed. Pictures are really clear and great. The camera is bigger but I m getting used to it. I am very happy I went with this one. :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Products are the same quality as the originals. However, these come at a very affordable price that everyone can afford. Wouldn t hesitate to buy again if i get another gopro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very cool for it to geotag the pictures taken. I love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] I really love my Rode VideoMic I shot a whole documentary using this microphone. I am thinking about upgrading to the pro anyone want to buy my gently used Mic?! Lol all jokes aside, this is a wonderful microphone and makes a big difference when you use it  [END]
[BEGIN] Even though the original battery seems to last forever (next to no moving parts on the camera), it is always good to have a backup battery. This one is indistinguishable from the original battery, and works great.  [END]
[BEGIN] Best cheap LEDs  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product - very pleased with it.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this camera backpack. Recommend it to everyone I meet. Perfect for traveling.  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect screen protection. Fits well and recommend you use it right out of the gate to protect the screen.  [END]
[BEGIN] Meets my needs at the lowest price available.  [END]

[BEGIN] These work perfect for my small LED lights and Strobes. I have 6 of them and use them all the time :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice. Handy size, neutral color, good texture for most any fine or delicate work. I m using it for guitar maintenance, but I may get another one for greasy/oily stuff, cars, bikes, guns; this is a handy product at a reasonable price. Beats using a yoga mat...  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely exceeds my expectations, this Nikon D5500 is a great camera, I am very happy, easy to handle specially for novice like me.  [END]

[BEGIN] Looks great on my mantle with 3 5x7 pictures from my granddaughter s wedding. I previously bought a similar frame that was too big for my space which was returned. This one shows off the pictures and is compact and beautifully made.  [END]
[BEGIN] I have several Fotodiox adapters and they all fit perfectly, and so far they all allow focus to infinity. This one actually will focus past infinity. That isn t a big problem but you do have to actually focus at infinity.  [END]

[BEGIN] good film  [END]
[BEGIN] Good for a back-up. Not as well made as am original. But does work.  [END]

[BEGIN] gave as part of gift bag for someone with new Go Pro and they loved it!  [END]

[BEGIN] Works as you would expect it to for a reasonable price  [END]
[BEGIN] It is a good camera, nice pictures  [END]

[BEGIN] Sick!! Works good  [END]
[BEGIN] Fit perfectly.  [END]
[BEGIN] We were able to see our home beautifully while on safari in South Africa - amazing!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very bright! Love that you can change the warmth and the dial down the brightness. Takes a ton of batteries (AA), but to be expected. At full brightness, mine lasted about 2 hours. Great for fill light in photography.  [END]

[BEGIN] Bought two for kayaking to keep cell phone in, they work great had for about a year now.  [END]

[BEGIN] Very good overall experience. Easy purchase, fast delivery. Would recommend.  [END]

[BEGIN] Not as strong as the GoPro branded mount. This is more like a mount for GPS or car-smartphone holder, but for mounting a action camera to a smooth surface that isn t subject to winds this works great. I would not use it outside, however.  [END]

[BEGIN] I love it ... It does what i need  [END]

[BEGIN] its cool  [END]
[BEGIN] Very impressed with this camera! Custom white balance is a welcome change, underwater macro is superb, and the new microscope mode is insane. Still need to try out the time lapse/stitching settings, but have seen some first had results and am excited.  [END]
[BEGIN] I like this lens for how cheap it is. You get a lot of bang for your buck. It s my go to lens for board sports.  [END]

[BEGIN] It works OK.  [END]

[BEGIN] Smart purchase. Biggest bang for the buck.  [END]
[BEGIN] works well can adjust apperture  [END]
[BEGIN] Is beautiful bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well and very durable. Must of crashed it at least 100 times and haven t broken anything yet. Longer battery life would be nice, but for the price you can t beat it.  [END]

[BEGIN] good  [END]
[BEGIN] More sensitive than expected. Cranky mssg. set up, once set it works. I use it in an area with less shadows from bright windows in the day - that said, because as I said, it is that sensitive. Beat it at the price, I do not think so!  [END]

[BEGIN] Nice product at a reasonable price.  [END]

[BEGIN] Works well, stays on glass and holds up my point and shoot, no complaints here!  [END]
[BEGIN] Clever system that works for us. Not intended as a full time security system but more peace of mind when away. Could do with some sort of IFTTT integration or one of the smart home systems - maybe on the way if so then systems get even better.  [END]

[BEGIN] very nice and slim  [END]
[BEGIN] New and delivered on time. Great deal.  [END]

[BEGIN] Camera works very well. It does generate quite a bit of heat, but the image is very nice.  [END]

[BEGIN] I have had no issues with this. Fits my Canon 70D with a longer lens on it. Great for everyday use.  [END]

[BEGIN] Bright back light, Clear view in bright and sunny conditions outdoors. Long action time on high capacity battery (2 days of use between charges.). Only came with short MiniHDMI to HDMI patch cable and no pigtail for the analog av input. Would have also liked a 12vDC pigtail as well.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just what I was looking for  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as intended.  [END]
[BEGIN] It is just the size (a medium, despite the description) for my needs, falling between a couple of smaller bags and a larger system bag. It certainly seems sturdy and well designed. I opted for the orange interior to make finding the small odds and ends easier.  [END]
[BEGIN] Takes great pictures!  [END]
[BEGIN] ok;-)))  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it!  [END]
[BEGIN] I love my Manfrotto!  [END]
[BEGIN] It came exactly as the description said it would. It s adorable and unique.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bought one of these for my 70D and it works great. But no surprise there - I have bought SterlingTek batteries for my other DSLRs (40D & G12) and they have always been excellent and cost-effective. Highly recommended!  [END]
[BEGIN] This little camera works awesome for a whole bunch of different applications from underwater to live shows and for the price you can t really find something this good I think.  [END]
[BEGIN] Fit my filters fine. A nice additional to my Cannon SX520 outfit. Well worth the price.  [END]

[BEGIN] Happy  [END]
[BEGIN] Received on time and in perfect condition. Works very well with no issues. Recommended product  [END]

[BEGIN] These work great!  [END]
[BEGIN] I bought this initially for my binoculars to use at concerts but took it to Boston last weekend and paired it up with my camera and it was great. It s light, compact, and steadies your shots beautifully.  [END]
[BEGIN] High quality and worked fantastic!  [END]
[BEGIN] All seems in order. I got this to view the Blood Moon in September 2015. And to view our wonderful night sky on other occasions. Packs easily in the backpack (included). Nice value.  [END]
[BEGIN] Extremely light and EXTREMELY loud. You pull the top loop off the Robocopp to turn it on, and it s very secure so you can be sure it won t go off automatically. It s sturdy, well-designed, and as I said, it s LOUD!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Awesome build quality and functionality! gonna buy more for my class.  [END]

[BEGIN] The batteries are working well so far. I don t live them overnight for charging. They will get hot if you do. The charger is fine too. But you should charge one battery at a time.  [END]
[BEGIN] So far so good. Arrived earlier than promised. Have used a few times with excellent results. This was purchased for a Canon 60D.  [END]
[BEGIN] There is a reason why products like this from Manfrotto are more expensive.... They are grade A quality and you can tell. The movement of this head and the incredibly sleek build are perfect for video and/or photo. You get what you pay for!  [END]
[BEGIN] The best lens I d owned so far.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product, as expected!!  [END]

[BEGIN] Thank you :)  [END]
[BEGIN] Superb product for a great price. Lightweight and compact.  [END]

[BEGIN] Photos came out fantastic!! I have an older Polaroid that I found at an estate sale and I was very hesitant about with to get for it. This site helped me a lot! Although it came out a little more yellow it had more to do with the Polaroid.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love this. It s wonderfully sturdy with a great grip, and yet compact enough to carry in the tripod straps of your camera bag. Easy release attachment at the top is an extra plus. Well worth the price.  [END]

[BEGIN] came quickly, works well.  [END]

[BEGIN] Wonderful quality. Not lightweight but carries well with its shoulder strap. I didn’t think I could afford binoculars this nice.  [END]
[BEGIN] These were a great cost effective replacement for our stock cannon batteries. worked great.  [END]
[BEGIN] This charger does the trick. I plug in 5 batteries and an hour or so later they are all charged and ready to go. That gives me a good 45 minutes of flying time to include changing them out. Much better than the one-battery charger that comes with the quadcopter.  [END]
[BEGIN] As good or better than the original batteries!  [END]
[BEGIN] This is beautiful, looks amazing, Exceeded expectation for appearance. Don t know yet about how it holds up.  [END]

[BEGIN] Good!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very Good  [END]
[BEGIN] I got this lens for wild life photography. It is heavy, but well worth the trouble. I ve gotten great shots across a lake, without any loss of image quality. This lens is Sigma s better quality, better sealing, better glass. I think it s great!!  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect fit. Sturdy.  [END]
[BEGIN] A++++++++  [END]
[BEGIN] works like a charm!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] Love it. Who would have thought that something so inexpensive could make my $250 Canon speedlite better. Fits perfectly and seems to provide  [END]

[BEGIN] very good for this price, i use rarely, so, cant say a lot about it  [END]
[BEGIN] Gr8 product for the price i pay  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits my Panasonic Lumix camera at a great price for 2 batteries and charger. Charger also recharges Panasonic battery that came with the camera.

[BEGIN] Very good quality, indistinguishable from a name brand item.  [END]

[BEGIN] works great the only downer is my lens cap does not fit it as it is bigger opening but it functions like a pro.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great color. I should have gone with a smaller width. I ended up cutting mine, which was a pain, so keep that in mind. Paper is very sturdy and suits my needs well. I love not having to deal with fabric wrinkles.  [END]

[BEGIN] the best thing ever ;)  [END]
[BEGIN] Illuminati  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect for what I needed. Great quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] Definitely good to have extra batteries when you re out and about. If you re filmong for the day, you don t always have a place to recharge. Fast shipping. Good price.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works like original.  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice, love.  [END]
[BEGIN] The screw in version installs differently than the bayonet mount (aside from the obvious difference). This video was extremely helpful in getting the latch closed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CsoNmlFZMU Be sure to run your finger over the latch from the attached side rather than trying to just push it in.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great case  [END]

[BEGIN] Best Price for a solid bundle! Hands down worth it! Thank you for this!  [END]

[BEGIN] Great!  [END]

[BEGIN] Bought for my 12 year old grandson. He loves using it when he is riding his bike.  [END]

[BEGIN] Awesome product…  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Product at a Great Price with fast shipping  [END]
[BEGIN] Works well with a Nikon D3200, but autofocus with the Tamron 150-600 lens is hit and miss dependent on the light. At longer zoom settings you will need a tripod, or a lot of light and high shutter speeds, as expected since any movement blurs.  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased this for snorkling in Key West for our Canon Elph. It works great. I m sure it s not nearly as good as an actual underwater camera but for the price this case it s a keeper!  [END]

[BEGIN] Purchased to mount on a roll bar on an open-cockpit racecar. I have used it for one full day (about 3 hours of track driving including some off-track excursions) and it performed flawlessly, no shaking and never loosened up. It was received quickly and exactly as described.  [END]
[BEGIN] Well built mount. It most important part of a mount is the it is solid with no vibration or slippage. This is a great mount. Likely I will order more. The ball joint allows infinite positioning possibilities. The best mount I have.  [END]

[BEGIN] Works great! Can a photographer ever have too many backup batteries and chargers?  [END]
[BEGIN] Work like it should.  [END]
[BEGIN] Daylight, nightlight, whatever you shoot in, this thing will pick it up. Even in the case, you can still make out low voices talking, and the clarity is astonishingly better than I expected. For the price, you can t beat it. I plan on ordering a few more very soon.  [END]
[BEGIN] Just might be the best lens on the market, at least for headshots anyway. Super sharp, super crisp and the autofocus is amazing. Many complain about its weight, but that makes about as much sense as saying a Ferrari s engine is too loud. Happy shooting, Vroom Vroom.  [END]
[BEGIN] good product  [END]
[BEGIN] A+++  [END]
[BEGIN] This recharged batteries quickly and I was happy that I received it just as fast before the kids went to camp.  [END]

[BEGIN] I have Wasabi batteries for my Canon cameras and GoPro Hero 2 and 3. Better than OEM, more power so they last longer. Love the batteries, the chargers are OK - they use the same base and just attach the appropriate battery specific connector. This keeps sliding off. Annoying.  [END]

[BEGIN] Takes great clear pictures and is light weight. Easy to place in a small purse...  [END]
[BEGIN] This is nice and works well for my once a month photo sessions. I can t say how it would hold up if you used it everyday and traveled with it. It replaces one almost the same, although this one does have a nicer carry bag.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very light weight, sturdy easily holding a video head, a DSLR , lens and a slider. gets low, goes high. Feet are soft rubber for inside, reveling metal spikes for outside. Great no nonsense tripod.  [END]

[BEGIN] This is an excellent lens for any photographer/digital artist. I bought the lens for my Nikon D3200. You must use this lens in manual mode settings on camera. After reviewing fisheye attachment lens and true fisheye lens, definitely spend the extra money for a true fisheye lens.  [END]
[BEGIN] Like it better than other tripods-more flexibility  [END]

[BEGIN] great  [END]
[BEGIN] Purchased two speedlights with a YN560-TX. The results are superb. It took me a while to get them set up correctly to start taking pictures off camera, since i m new to flash photography. This a must buy. Will update later after i ve done more testing  [END]
[BEGIN] Another product that is WAY overpriced, but exactly what us video guys need. It s aluminum foil people.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked as expected  [END]

[BEGIN] Definitely met my expectations!  [END]
[BEGIN] Excellent product.  [END]
[BEGIN] This camera is awesome - lots of features, is nice and compact making it easy to carry.  [END]
[BEGIN] great cams! WARNING.. If you use &#34;blue iris&#34; for your security system do not update the firmware on these. the last firmware (as of 8/20/2015) will not break the streaming to the software. However the cameras still work with other software. Also Infrared Leds could use better range......  [END]
[BEGIN] Love everything about this camcorder. The quality, the zoom, the auto focus, the stability feature.. its just amazing. only slight problem is that the battery pack sticks out.  [END]

[BEGIN] Perfect for glasses  [END]
[BEGIN] Loved this lens and the bundle was great! Shipping was crazy fast too. I would definitely order from them again.  [END]
[BEGIN] Worked very well and there are no problems with using them with the J5. Amazing price for three batteries.  [END]
[BEGIN] Get teased for using a selfie stick! But seriously, this thing is solidly constructed and is great to get overhead shots in a crowd, and also really low shots (think skateboard videos that track along a few inches from the ground).  [END]
[BEGIN] Works great  [END]
[BEGIN] Just got, Have used it a little already taken a lot more pictures than my old one would have and still has 2 dots left. Thanks and the price was good also.  [END]

[BEGIN] great for my needs when needed works well and very pleased. Thanks!!  [END]

[BEGIN] I love this sling, bought it prior to a trip to Disney World and this made it much easier to use my camera.  [END]
[BEGIN] It works! Cap is good to protect camera lens while transporting and storing. Lens hood didn’t eliminate propeller shadow but definitely reduced it. Lightweight so does not effect gimbal balance. Overall, I’m happy with my purchase.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great Quality - we recommend this item!  [END]
[BEGIN] three thumbs up.  [END]
[BEGIN] Works as intended!  [END]
[BEGIN] excellent product.  [END]

[BEGIN] Excellent  [END]
[BEGIN] Great price for a beginner photographer.  [END]
[BEGIN] great  [END]
[BEGIN] Inexpensive, works perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a really affordable package when you break a light and need some replacements. I bought these as soon as one broke. Much better to buy in a package than to buy them singular.  [END]
[BEGIN] Bueno  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice head strap, somehow stays cooler than its cheaper imitators. Get it so you can be a miner with a camera on your head. you know you always wanted to play miner..lol  [END]

[BEGIN] A great battery for my Tough 4 camera which I love!  [END]
[BEGIN] Very happy  [END]
[BEGIN] I was pleasantly surprised. The bag is bigger than I thought and therefore holds more equipment. It arrived rather quickly and more than met my expectations. It is a nice bag and well worth the money. T hank you.  [END]
[BEGIN] Love this little bag but it was too small for my sons camera and lenses, so I had to return it. It is very well made, has little compartments and I recommend it highly for smaller cameras.  [END]
[BEGIN] Couldn t be happier!!! This thing is solid, and awesome!  [END]
[BEGIN] Super fast shipping! I lost my original lens cap to a lake and this baby did the trick! The cleaning pen is awesome as is everything else in the package. For the price and quality, don t hesitate to click and buy NOW!  [END]
[BEGIN] Works perfect, And fast shipping!  [END]
[BEGIN] Case is as advertised. Wouldn t hesitate to buy from them again  [END]

[BEGIN] Incredible lens!  [END]
[BEGIN] Fits my T3i camera body, 2 lens, and my speedlite.  [END]
[BEGIN] I love working with ND filters and these give me a bit more to work with. They seem like good quality for the price, they may not be for professionals, but for me, I am very happy with them.  [END]
[BEGIN] Grest product  [END]
[BEGIN] Hot Shoe Cover hits perfectly for my Sony a6000.  [END]

[BEGIN] Just as I expected.  [END]
[BEGIN] Very convenient and having no extra cords is a plus!  [END]
[BEGIN] Absolutely am thrilled with such a good secondary battery for my T5. It holds a charge like a champ and hasn t caused me any issues on my all day shoots. Definitely recommend this battery if you want a good substitute or replacement battery for your Canon Rebel.  [END]

[BEGIN] keeps my need safe and secure, nice product for many needs. Thanks!!  [END]
[BEGIN] Just right for my camera and &#34;stuff&#34; and at a great price.  [END]
[BEGIN] works great.  [END]

[BEGIN] Like it it works great  [END]
[BEGIN] Everything arrived ok! Great product.  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product, as usual from SmallRig. Just what I wanted, and exactly as advertised. I have built many custom rigs, and SmallRig is rapidly becoming my favorite source. My clients are always impressed with the quality.  [END]
[BEGIN] These filters are fantastic! Makes my pictures look as if I knew what I was doing.  [END]
[BEGIN] I was looking for a battery for my Samsung film camera that I forgotten about since the dawn of the digital camera. The price of this rechargeable lithium battery is about the price of a single non rechargeable one. No brainer for this one.  [END]
[BEGIN] perfect for my coupons  [END]
[BEGIN] Amazing quality, shipped on time, I love them!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great camera  [END]
[BEGIN] Might be overkill to use this for a &#34;tough&#34; camera but it s rigid and can hold the battery charger and extra batteries, which is all you really need when vacationing.  [END]
[BEGIN] Thank You  [END]
[BEGIN] Works just as described! Exactly what we needed. Thank you!  [END]
[BEGIN] Great product  [END]
[BEGIN] Item as described.  [END]

[BEGIN] awesome bundle  [END]
[BEGIN] A great set. My daughter loves and and is having so much fun using it. Thank you!  [END]

[BEGIN] Audio quality is not good like camera but over all. Good  [END]
[BEGIN] Delivered on time and as described  [END]
[BEGIN] Nice fit with smooth finish. Doesn t seem like it ll fall off or peel away anytime soon. The low profile makes it hard to tell that it s even there. Clear glass doesn t negatively affect image quality at all. Good product!  [END]
[BEGIN] They ARE &#34;Wireless&#34;....But they don t run on Batteries! (WOW) - Of course they need a PLUG to have &#34;Power from Electricity&#34;! These ARE &#34;MONITORS&#34;...Not secret SPY CAMERAS!! (LOL)  [END]
[BEGIN] Olympus batteries are the best for the Olympus cameras  [END]
[BEGIN] Since I got my GoPro 4, I ve bought quite a few filters & junk. Out of everything this is one of my favorites!  [END]
[BEGIN] Perfect.  [END]
[BEGIN] This is a great device that allows you to view things going on in or around your home from a remote location. It has a lot of the features of a CCTV system, but for a fraction of the cost.  [END]
